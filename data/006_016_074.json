    "message_1": "A certain type of product defect occurs in a manufacturing process with a probability of 0.05. \nWhat is the probability that in a sample of 50 products, exactly 3 will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x! * (n - x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n - x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defects\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 50)\n- x is the number of defects we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3)\n- p is the probability of a product having a defect (in this case, 0.05)\n- q is the probability of a product not having a defect (in this case, 1 - p = 0.95)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(3) = (50! / (3! * (50 - 3)!)) * (0.05^3) * (0.95^(50 - 3))\n\nFirst, we calculate the factorials:\n\n50! = 3.04140932 × 10^64\n3! = 6\n(50 - 3)! = 47! = 2.58623242 × 10^59\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(3) = (3.04140932 × 10^64 / (6 * 2.58623242 × 10^59)) * (0.05^3) * (0.95^47)\n\nP(3) = (3.04140932 × 10^64 / 1.55093985 × 10^60) * (0.000125) * (0.21484375)\n\nP(3) ≈ 1.959 * 0.000125 * 0.21484375\n\nP(3) ≈ 0.000053\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 out of 50 products will have this type of defect is approximately 0.0053 or 0.53%."
