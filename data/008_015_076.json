    "message_2": "First, we need to rewrite the system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  2 |\n    | 2  5  5 |\n    | 2  5  9 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 17 |\n    | 42 |\n    | 61 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. In this case, A = LL^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose.\n\n1. Calculate L11:\nL11 = sqrt(A11) = sqrt(1) = 1\n\n2. Calculate L21 and L31:\nL21 = A21 / L11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nL31 = A31 / L11 = 2 / 1 = 2\n\n3. Calculate L22:\nL22 = sqrt(A22 - L21^2) = sqrt(5 - 2^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\n\n4. Calculate L32:\nL32 = (A32 - L31 * L21) / L22 = (5 - 2 * 2) / 1 = 1\n\n5. Calculate L33:\nL33 = sqrt(A33 - L31^2 - L32^2) = sqrt(9 - 2^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(4) = 2\n\nNow we have the lower triangular matrix L:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 2  1  2 |\n\nNext, we will solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n1. y1 = b1 / L11 = 17 / 1 = 17\n2. y2 = (b2 - L21 * y1) / L22 = (42 - 2 * 17) / 1 = 8\n3. y3 = (b3 - L31 * y1 - L32 * y2) / L33 = (61 - 2 * 17 - 1 * 8) / 2 = 9\n\nSo, y = | 17 |\n         |  8 |\n         |  9 |\n\nFinally, we will solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n1. x3 = y3 / L33 = 9 / 2 = 4.5\n2. x2 = (y2 - L32 * x3) / L22 = (8 - 1 * 4.5) / 1 = 3.5\n3. x1 = (y1 - L21 * x2 - L31 * x3) / L11 = (17 - 2 * 3.5 - 2 * 4.5) / 1 = 1\n\nSo, x = | 1   |\n         | 3.5 |\n         | 4.5 |\n\nThus, the solution of the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3.5, and z = 4.5."
