    "message_1": "In a dictator game, a dictatorial player has $100 to share between themselves and another player. The dictator must decide on a sharing rule before the other player accepts or declines the offer. If the other player accepts the offer, both players receive their designated shares. If the other player declines, both players receive nothing. If the dictator offers $x to the other player, what is the maximum value of x that would convince the other player to accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the dictator game, the other player's decision to accept or decline the offer is based on their perceived fairness and their personal preferences. There is no strict mathematical rule for determining the maximum value of x that would convince the other player to accept the offer, as it depends on the other player's individual preferences and their perception of fairness.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the other player would accept any offer that is greater than $0 (since receiving any amount is better than receiving nothing), then the maximum value of x that would convince the other player to accept the offer would be $100. This is because the dictator could offer the entire $100 to the other player, leaving nothing for themselves. But this scenario is unlikely, as the dictator would typically want to keep some amount for themselves. \n\nIn practice, the dictator may choose to offer an amount that they believe is fair or that maximizes their own share while still being acceptable to the other player. This could range anywhere from a 50-50 split ($50 for each player) to a more uneven distribution, depending on the dictator's preferences and their perception of the other player's willingness to accept the offer."
