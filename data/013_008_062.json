    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are four players who can either contribute $1 to a public fund or keep their money. If all four players contribute, the total fund will be $4 and it will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5. The resulting amount will then be divided equally among the four players. However, if one or more players don't contribute, the total fund will not be multiplied and those who contributed will lose their money.\n\nWhat is the maximum monetary payoff for a player who contributes to the public fund if the other players don't contribute?",
    "message_2": "If a player contributes to the public fund and the other three players don't contribute, the total fund will be $1 (since only one player contributed). As mentioned, if one or more players don't contribute, the total fund will not be multiplied. Therefore, the player who contributed will lose their $1, and the maximum monetary payoff for that player will be $0."
