The demand function for the product is given by Q(p) = 10 - 0.5p, where Q(p) is the quantity demanded at price p. The cost function for each company is C(q) = 2q, where C(q) is the cost of production for quantity q. Find the Nash Equilibrium prices for Company A and Company B in the Bertrand competition.",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms set the same price, they share the market demand equally. We will find the Nash Equilibrium prices for Company A and Company B by analyzing their best responses to each other's prices.\n\nLet p_A and p_B be the prices set by Company A and Company B, respectively. The profit functions for each company are given by:\n\nπ_A(p_A, p_B) = (p_A - C(q_A)) * q_A\nπ_B(p_A, p_B) = (p_B - C(q_B)) * q_B\n\nSince the cost function is C(q) = 2q, we can rewrite the profit functions as:\n\nπ_A(p_A, p_B) = (p_A - 2q_A) * q_A\nπ_B(p_A, p_B) = (p_B - 2q_B) * q_B\n\nNow, we need to determine the quantity demanded for each company based on their prices. We have three cases:\n\n1. If p_A < p_B, then Company A captures the entire market demand, and q_A = Q(p_A), q_B = 0.\n2. If p_A > p_B, then Company B captures the entire market demand, and q_A = 0, q_B = Q(p_B).\n3. If p_A = p_B, then both companies share the market demand equally, and q_A = q_B = Q(p_A)/2.\n\nNow, let's find the best response functions for each company:\n\n1. If p_A < p_B, Company A's profit function is π_A(p_A, p_B) = (p_A - 2Q(p_A)) * Q(p_A). To maximize this, we take the first-order derivative with respect to p_A and set it to zero:\n\ndπ_A/dp_A = Q(p_A) - 2Q(p_A) - 2p_A * (-0.5) = 0\nQ(p_A) = p_A\n10 - 0.5p_A = p_A\np_A = 6.67 (approximately)\n\n2. If p_A > p_B, Company B's profit function is π_B(p_A, p_B) = (p_B - 2Q(p_B)) * Q(p_B). To maximize this, we take the first-order derivative with respect to p_B and set it to zero:\n\ndπ_B/dp_B = Q(p_B) - 2Q(p_B) - 2p_B * (-0.5) = 0\nQ(p_B) = p_B\n10 - 0.5p_B = p_B\np_B = 6.67 (approximately)\n\n3. If p_A = p_B, both companies share the market demand equally, and q_A = q_B = Q(p_A)/2. In this case, both companies will set their prices equal to their marginal cost, which is 2q. Since q_A = q_B = Q(p_A)/2, we have:\n\np_A = p_B = 2 * Q(p_A)/2 = Q(p_A)\n10 - 0.5p_A = p_A\np_A = p_B = 6.67 (approximately)\n\nIn the Nash Equilibrium, both companies set their prices equal to 6.67 (approximately), and they share the market demand equally."
