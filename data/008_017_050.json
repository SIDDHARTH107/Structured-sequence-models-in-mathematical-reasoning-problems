    "message_2": "First, let's notice that the given system of linear equations is not independent, as the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo solve the system using sparse matrices, we can represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables [x, y, z], and b is the column vector of constants [12, 24, 36].\n\nA = | 3  2  4 |\n    | 6  4  8 |\n    | 9  6 12 |\n\nb = | 12 |\n    | 24 |\n    | 36 |\n\nSince the system has infinitely many solutions, we can express one of the variables in terms of the others. Let's express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 3 - (3/4)x - (1/2)y\n\nNow we can write the solution as a column vector [x, y, z] with z expressed in terms of x and y:\n\n[x, y, 3 - (3/4)x - (1/2)y]\n\nThere are infinitely many solutions to this system, and they can be represented by this column vector with different values of x and y."
