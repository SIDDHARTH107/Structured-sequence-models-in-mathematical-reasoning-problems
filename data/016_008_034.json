    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. Therefore, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the number of iterations or the initial length of the line segment. So, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after five iterations with an initial line segment of 1 unit is approximately 1.2619."
