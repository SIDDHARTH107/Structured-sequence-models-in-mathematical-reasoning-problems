    "message_2": "We will use the method of rational parametrization to find the rational points on the curve. The given equation is $y^2 + x^3 - x^2 = 0$. Let's rewrite this equation as:\n\n$y^2 = x^2(x-1)$.\n\nNow, let's make a substitution to find a rational parametrization. Let $x = \\frac{t^2}{1+t^2}$, where $t$ is a rational number. Then, we have:\n\n$1 - x = \\frac{2t^2}{1+t^2}$.\n\nNow, substituting this into the equation for $y^2$, we get:\n\n$y^2 = x^2(1-x) = \\frac{t^4}{(1+t^2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{2t^2}{1+t^2} = \\frac{2t^6}{(1+t^2)^3}$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have:\n\n$y = \\frac{t^3}{(1+t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nNow, we have a rational parametrization of the curve:\n\n$(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{t^2}{1+t^2}, \\frac{t^3}{(1+t^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\right)$.\n\nFor any rational number $t$, the coordinates $(x, y)$ will be rational. Conversely, for any rational point $(x, y)$ on the curve, there exists a rational number $t$ such that the parametrization holds.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many distinct points on this curve with rational coordinates, as there are infinitely many rational numbers $t$."
