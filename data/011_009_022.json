    "message_1": "Suppose you want to invite 10 of your friends to a party and you want to give them all different colored party hats. How many different ways can you distribute the hats if there are 5 different colors available? (Hint: use Bell numbers)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are used to count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. The Stirling number S(n, k) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this problem, we have 10 friends (n = 10) and 5 different colors of hats (k = 5). We want to find the number of ways to distribute the hats among the friends, allowing for some friends to have the same color hat.\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we can find the number of ways to distribute the hats as follows:\n\nS(10, 5) = 42525\n\nHowever, this only gives us the number of ways to partition the friends into 5 non-empty subsets. Since each subset corresponds to a color, we also need to account for the different ways to assign the colors to the subsets. There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to do this, as there are 5 choices for the first color, 4 for the second, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to distribute the hats is:\n\n5! * S(10, 5) = 120 * 42525 = 5,103,000\n\nTherefore, there are 5,103,000 different ways to distribute the hats among the 10 friends."
