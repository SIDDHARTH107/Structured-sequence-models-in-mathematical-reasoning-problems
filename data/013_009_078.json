    "message_1": "Suppose that two players, A and B, are playing Matching Pennies. A chooses heads or tails, and B chooses heads or tails. If the choices match, B gives A two dollars; otherwise, A gives B two dollars. If A always chooses heads and B always chooses tails, find the expected value of A's winnings after 100 plays.",
    "message_2": "Since A always chooses heads and B always chooses tails, their choices will never match. Therefore, A will always lose and give B two dollars in each play. After 100 plays, A will have lost 100 times, resulting in a total loss of 100 * (-2) = -200 dollars. The expected value of A's winnings after 100 plays is -200 dollars."
