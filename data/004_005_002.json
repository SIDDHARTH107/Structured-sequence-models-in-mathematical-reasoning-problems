    "message_2": "Yes, the math student can solve this problem. To find the particular solution to the given differential equation, we first need to find the general solution and then use the initial condition y(0) = 5 to find the particular solution.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x\n\nTo find the general solution, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(2x dx)\n\ny = x^2 + C\n\nNow, we use the initial condition y(0) = 5 to find the value of the constant C:\n\n5 = (0)^2 + C\n\nC = 5\n\nSo, the particular solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny = x^2 + 5"
