    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices, where the distance is the minimum number of edges that must be traversed to get from one vertex to the other.\n\nIn a graph with seven vertices and six edges, the worst-case scenario is that the graph is a tree (i.e., it has no cycles) with one vertex having a degree of 1 and the other six vertices connected in a line. In this case, the diameter would be the distance between the two vertices at the ends of the line, which is 6.\n\nHowever, if the graph has a cycle, then the diameter will be smaller. For example, if the graph is a cycle of 6 vertices with an additional vertex connected to one of the vertices in the cycle, the diameter would be 4 (the longest shortest path would be between the additional vertex and the vertex opposite to it in the cycle).\n\nThus, the diameter of a graph with seven vertices and six edges can be at most 6 and at least 4."
