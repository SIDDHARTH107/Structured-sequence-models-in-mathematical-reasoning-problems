    "message_1": "A ferris wheel has a diameter of 32 meters and rotates once every 120 seconds. If a person starts at the bottom of the ferris wheel and rides to the top, what is the average distance the person traveled? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the average distance the person traveled, we need to find the distance from the bottom to the top of the Ferris wheel, which is half of the circumference of the wheel.\n\nThe circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = πd, where d is the diameter.\n\nIn this case, the diameter of the Ferris wheel is 32 meters. So, the circumference is:\n\nC = π * 32 ≈ 100.53 meters\n\nSince the person travels from the bottom to the top, they cover half of the circumference:\n\nAverage distance = 1/2 * 100.53 ≈ 50.27 meters\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the average distance the person traveled is approximately 50 meters."
