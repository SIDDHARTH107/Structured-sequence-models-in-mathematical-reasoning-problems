    "message_1": "A company produces and sells 5000 laptops per month. The total cost of producing these laptops is given by the function C(x) = 200x + 500,000 where x is the number of laptops produced. The demand for these laptops is given by the function p(x) = 1500 â€“ 0.1x where p is the price of one laptop in dollars, and x is the number of laptops sold. Determine the optimal selling price that maximizes the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal selling price that maximizes the company's profit, we need to first find the profit function. The profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue function, R(x), and the cost function, C(x).\n\nRevenue function, R(x), is the product of the price per laptop, p(x), and the number of laptops sold, x:\n\nR(x) = p(x) * x\n\nSubstitute the given demand function, p(x) = 1500 - 0.1x, into the revenue function:\n\nR(x) = (1500 - 0.1x) * x\n\nNow, expand the revenue function:\n\nR(x) = 1500x - 0.1x^2\n\nThe profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue function, R(x), and the cost function, C(x):\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x)\n\nSubstitute the given cost function, C(x) = 200x + 500,000, and the expanded revenue function, R(x) = 1500x - 0.1x^2, into the profit function:\n\nP(x) = (1500x - 0.1x^2) - (200x + 500,000)\n\nNow, simplify the profit function:\n\nP(x) = -0.1x^2 + 1300x - 500,000\n\nTo find the optimal selling price that maximizes the company's profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. To do this, we'll take the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = -0.2x + 1300\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-0.2x + 1300 = 0\n-0.2x = -1300\nx = 6500\n\nNow that we have the critical point x = 6500, we can find the optimal selling price by plugging this value into the demand function, p(x):\n\np(6500) = 1500 - 0.1(6500)\np(6500) = 1500 - 650\np(6500) = 850\n\nTherefore, the optimal selling price that maximizes the company's profit is $850 per laptop."
