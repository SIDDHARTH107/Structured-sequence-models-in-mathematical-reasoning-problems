    "message_1": "What is the sum of the first 10 digits of the imaginary parts of the roots of the polynomial $f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + z + 1$ that belong to the the boundary of the Mandelbrot set?",
    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined for quadratic polynomials of the form $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$, where $c$ is a complex constant. The polynomial given, $f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + z + 1$, is a cubic polynomial, not a quadratic one. Therefore, it is not directly related to the Mandelbrot set, and the question is not applicable in this context.\n\nHowever, if you are interested in the roots of the given polynomial, we can find them using other methods."
