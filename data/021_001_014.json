    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix\n\n```\n|  2   3  -5 |  4  |\n|  4  -2   3 | -11 |\n| -2   5   2 |  13 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x term in the second and third rows. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 + Row1\n\n```\n|  2   3  -5 |  4  |\n|  0  -8  13 | -19 |\n|  0   8  -3 |  17 |\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y term in the third row. To do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\nRow3 = Row3 + Row2\n\n```\n|  2   3  -5 |  4  |\n|  0  -8  13 | -19 |\n|  0   0  10 | -2  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n10z = -2\nz = -2 / 10\nz = -1/5\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-8y + 13(-1/5) = -19\n-8y - 13/5 = -19\ny = (13/5 - 19) / -8\ny = (13 - 95) / 40\ny = 82 / 40\ny = 41 / 20\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n2x + 3(41/20) - 5(-1/5) = 4\n2x + 123/20 + 1 = 4\nx = (4 - 123/20 - 1) * 10 / 2\nx = (-19/20) * 10 / 2\nx = -19 / 4\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -19/4, y = 41/20, z = -1/5"
