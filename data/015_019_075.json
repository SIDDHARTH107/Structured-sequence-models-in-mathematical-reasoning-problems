    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent for a dynamical system like the Hénon-Heiles system is a measure of the system's sensitivity to initial conditions, and it is typically obtained through numerical simulations. The Hénon-Heiles system is described by the Hamiltonian:\n\n$H = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \\alpha x^2 y - \\frac{\\beta}{3} y^3$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are parameters, and $(x, y, p_x, p_y)$ are the coordinates and momenta of the system.\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon-Heiles system with $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=1.5$, one would need to perform a numerical simulation of the system's equations of motion, and then compute the Lyapunov exponent using an appropriate algorithm, such as the method of Benettin et al. (1980) or the algorithm of Wolf et al. (1985).\n\nAs a mathematician, I can provide the necessary steps and equations to perform such a simulation, but I cannot directly provide the numerical value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent without performing the simulation myself. If you are interested in the numerical value, I would recommend consulting a published study or performing the simulation using a suitable software package."
