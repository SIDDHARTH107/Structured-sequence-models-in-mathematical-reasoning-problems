    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase angle of each harmonic component present in x(t), we can rewrite the given Fourier transform X(f) in the form of a complex exponential function. The general form of a complex exponential function is:\n\nA(f) * exp(j * θ(f))\n\nwhere A(f) is the amplitude and θ(f) is the phase angle.\n\nWe can rewrite the given X(f) as:\n\nX(f) = 3 cos(2π57f) + 5 sin(2π104f) - 2 cos(2π125f)\n     = 3[cos(2π57f) + j * sin(2π57f)] + 5[-j * cos(2π104f) + sin(2π104f)] - 2[cos(2π125f) + j * sin(2π125f)]\n     = 3 * exp(j * 2π57f) - 5j * exp(j * 2π104f) - 2 * exp(j * 2π125f)\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude and phase angle for each harmonic component:\n\n1. For the 57 Hz component:\n   A(57) = 3\n   θ(57) = angle(exp(j * 2π57f)) = 0°\n\n2. For the 104 Hz component:\n   A(104) = 5\n   θ(104) = angle(-j * exp(j * 2π104f)) = -90°\n\n3. For the 125 Hz component:\n   A(125) = 2\n   θ(125) = angle(exp(j * 2π125f)) = 0°\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase angle of each harmonic component present in x(t) are:\n\n57 Hz component: Amplitude = 3, Phase angle = 0°\n104 Hz component: Amplitude = 5, Phase angle = -90°\n125 Hz component: Amplitude = 2, Phase angle = 0°"
