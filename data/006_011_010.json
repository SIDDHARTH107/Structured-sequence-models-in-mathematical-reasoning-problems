    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a machine not malfunctioning is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince there are 7 machines, the probability of no accidents occurring (all machines not malfunctioning) is 0.8^7 ≈ 0.2097.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we subtract the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\n1 - 0.2097 ≈ 0.7903.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one accident occurring during a day of production is approximately 0.7903 or 79.03%."
