    "message_1": "A certain electronic system has 4 components that are known to fail independently with probabilities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 respectively. What is the probability of the electronic system failing due to the failure of at least one component?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least one component failing, we can find the probability of none of the components failing and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of each component not failing is:\nComponent 1: 1 - 0.1 = 0.9\nComponent 2: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\nComponent 3: 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\nComponent 4: 1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n\nSince the components fail independently, the probability of none of them failing is the product of their individual probabilities of not failing:\nP(None fail) = 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.3024\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one component failing:\nP(At least one fails) = 1 - P(None fail) = 1 - 0.3024 = 0.6976\n\nSo, the probability of the electronic system failing due to the failure of at least one component is 0.6976 or 69.76%."
