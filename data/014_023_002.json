    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Rail Fence cipher with 3 rails, we write the message in a zigzag pattern along the rails and then read the message along each rail from left to right. Here's how it looks:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the message along each rail from left to right:\n\nHOR ELWLDO LLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HORELWLDOLO\".\n\nTo decrypt the message, we reverse the process. We write the zigzag pattern along the rails with the same number of characters as the encrypted message and fill in the characters from the encrypted message along each rail:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the message in a zigzag pattern:\n\nHELLO WORLD\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"HELLO WORLD\"."
