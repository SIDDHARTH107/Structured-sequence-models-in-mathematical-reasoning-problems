    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |      X = | x |      B = |  5  |\n    | 2  5  3 |          | y |          | 10  |\n    | 3  6  4 |          | z |          | 15  |\n\nNow, let's find the LU decomposition of matrix A:\n\nL = | 1   0   0 |      U = | 1  2  1 |\n    | l21 1   0 |          | 0  u22 u23|\n    | l31 l32 1 |          | 0  0   u33|\n\nStep 1: Find the first row of U and the first column of L:\n\nu11 = a11 = 1\nl21 = a21 / u11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl31 = a31 / u11 = 3 / 1 = 3\n\nStep 2: Find the second row of U and the second column of L:\n\nu12 = a12 = 2\nu22 = a22 - l21 * u12 = 5 - 2 * 2 = 1\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * u12) / u22 = (6 - 3 * 2) / 1 = 0\n\nStep 3: Find the third row of U:\n\nu13 = a13 = 1\nu23 = a23 - l21 * u13 = 3 - 2 * 1 = 1\nu33 = a33 - l31 * u13 - l32 * u23 = 4 - 3 * 1 - 0 * 1 = 1\n\nNow we have the L and U matrices:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |      U = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 2  1  0 |          | 0  1  1 |\n    | 3  0  1 |          | 0  0  1 |\n\nNext, we solve the system LY = B for Y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  5  |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 10  |\n| 3  0  1 | | y3 |   | 15  |\n\ny1 = 5\ny2 = 10 - 2 * y1 = 0\ny3 = 15 - 3 * y1 = 0\n\nY = | 5 |\n    | 0 |\n    | 0 |\n\nFinally, we solve the system UX = Y for X:\n\n| 1  2  1 | | x |   |  5  |\n| 0  1  1 | | y | = |  0  |\n| 0  0  1 | | z |   |  0  |\n\nz = 0\ny = 0 - z = 0\nx = 5 - 2 * y - z = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nX = | 5 |\n    | 0 |\n    | 0 |\n\nx = 5, y = 0, z = 0"
