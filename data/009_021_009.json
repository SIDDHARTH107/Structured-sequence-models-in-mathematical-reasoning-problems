    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation given by:\n\nu_t = 5u_xx, \n\nwhere u(x,t) is a function of two variables x and t. The initial condition for this equation is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = sin(3x),\n\nand the boundary conditions are given by:\n\nu(0,t) = u(π,t) = 0.\n\nFind the solution u(x,t) for t > 0 using separation of variables method. What is the value of u(π/3, 0.5)?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the separation of variables method, we assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the given PDE:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 5X''(x)T(t)\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 5X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / (5T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, they must both be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nX''(x) / X(x) = T'(t) / (5T(t)) = -λ^2\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + 5λ^2T(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0, t) = 0 and u(π, t) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0\nX(π) = B*sin(λπ) = 0\n\nSince B ≠ 0, we must have sin(λπ) = 0, which implies λ = n for some integer n. Thus, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX_n(x) = B_n*sin(nx)\n\nNow, we solve the second ODE:\n\nT'(t) + 5n^2T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*exp(-5n^2*t)\n\nNow, the solution u(x, t) can be written as a sum of the product of these functions:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ (B_n*C_n*sin(nx)*exp(-5n^2*t))\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(3x), we get:\n\nsin(3x) = Σ (B_n*C_n*sin(nx))\n\nComparing the coefficients, we find that B_3 = 1 and B_n = 0 for n ≠ 3. Thus, the solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = C_3*sin(3x)*exp(-45t)\n\nTo find the value of C_3, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(3x):\n\nsin(3x) = C_3*sin(3x)\n\nThus, C_3 = 1, and the solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(3x)*exp(-45t)\n\nNow, we can find the value of u(π/3, 0.5):\n\nu(π/3, 0.5) = sin(3*(π/3))*exp(-45*0.5) = sin(π)*exp(-22.5) = 0*exp(-22.5) = 0"
