    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input, we first need to find the frequency response of the system. The frequency response is the transfer function evaluated at s = jω, where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor the given transfer function G(s) = (10s + 5) / (s^3 + 9s^2 + 26s + 24), let's substitute s = jω:\n\nG(jω) = (10(jω) + 5) / ((jω)^3 + 9(jω)^2 + 26(jω) + 24)\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude and phase of G(jω) at ω = 2.5 rad/s:\n\nG(j2.5) = (10(j2.5) + 5) / ((j2.5)^3 + 9(j2.5)^2 + 26(j2.5) + 24)\n\nG(j2.5) ≈ -0.32 - 0.95j\n\nThe magnitude of G(j2.5) is:\n\n|G(j2.5)| = √((-0.32)^2 + (-0.95)^2) ≈ 1.00\n\nThe phase of G(j2.5) is:\n\n∠G(j2.5) = arctan(-0.95 / -0.32) ≈ -108.43°\n\nNow, we can find the steady-state response to the sinusoidal input with amplitude 3 and frequency 2.5 rad/s. The output amplitude will be the product of the input amplitude and the magnitude of the frequency response:\n\nOutput amplitude = 3 × |G(j2.5)| ≈ 3 × 1.00 = 3.00\n\nThe output phase will be the sum of the input phase (0° for a simple sinusoidal input) and the phase of the frequency response:\n\nOutput phase = 0° + (-108.43°) = -108.43°\n\nSo, the steady-state response is:\n\ny(t) = 3.00 * sin(2.5t - 108.43°)\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the steady-state response is:\n\ny(t) ≈ 3.00 * sin(2.5t - 108.43°)"
