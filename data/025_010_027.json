    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective plane curve of degree 4 in complex projective space defined by the homogeneous equation F(x,y,z) = 0. Suppose that the genus of X is 3 and that its canonical divisor is linearly equivalent to 3L - p1 - p2, where L is a hyperplane section and p1,p2 are two distinct points on X. \n\nDetermine the number of points on X in the finite field F5 that can be represented as (x,y) where x,y are integers modulo 5 such that F(x,y,1) = 0.",
    "message_2": "We will use the Weil conjectures to determine the number of points on X in the finite field F5.\n\nLet q = 5, which is the size of the finite field. The Weil conjectures state that the number of points on X over Fq is given by:\n\nN(X, Fq) = q^2 + 1 - a1 - a2 + a3\n\nwhere a1, a2, and a3 are the eigenvalues of the Frobenius endomorphism acting on the first cohomology group H^1(X, Q_l) (l is a prime different from q). Since the genus of X is 3, the dimension of H^1(X, Q_l) is 6.\n\nBy the Lefschetz fixed-point formula, we have:\n\na1 + a2 - a3 = Tr(Frob | H^1(X, Q_l)) = q - 1 = 4\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the number of points on X in F5. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D)\n\nwhere D is a divisor on X, g is the genus of X, and K is the canonical divisor. In our case, D = 3L - p1 - p2, so deg(D) = 3(4) - 1 - 1 = 10. Since the genus g = 3, we have:\n\nl(D) = 10 + 1 - 3 + l(K - D) = 8 + l(K - D)\n\nSince D is linearly equivalent to K, we have K - D = 0, and l(K - D) = 1. Thus, l(D) = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nNow, we can compute the number of points on X in F5:\n\nN(X, F5) = 5^2 + 1 - 4 = 25 + 1 - 4 = 22\n\nSo there are 22 points on X in the finite field F5 that can be represented as (x, y) where x, y are integers modulo 5 such that F(x, y, 1) = 0."
