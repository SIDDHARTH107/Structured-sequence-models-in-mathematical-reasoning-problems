Let e = 13.\n- Find d such that d is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)*(q-1).\n- The public key is (n, e) and the private key is (n, d).\n\nEncode the message \"HELLO\" using the public key, and then decode the resulting ciphertext using the private key.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find n, which is the product of the two prime numbers p and q:\n\nn = p * q = 7 * 11 = 77\n\nNext, we have e = 13, which is coprime to (p-1)*(q-1):\n\n(p-1)*(q-1) = (7-1)*(11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n\nNow, we need to find d, which is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)*(q-1):\n\nd * e ≡ 1 (mod (p-1)*(q-1))\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find d:\n\nd = e^(-1) mod 60\n\nd = 13^(-1) mod 60\n\nd = 37\n\nSo, the public key is (n, e) = (77, 13) and the private key is (n, d) = (77, 37).\n\nNow, let's encode the message \"HELLO\" using the public key. First, we need to convert each letter to its corresponding numerical value (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26):\n\nH = 8, E = 5, L = 12, L = 12, O = 15\n\nNow, we will encrypt each numerical value using the public key (n, e):\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nC_H ≡ 8^13 (mod 77) = 10\nC_E ≡ 5^13 (mod 77) = 71\nC_L ≡ 12^13 (mod 77) = 49\nC_O ≡ 15^13 (mod 77) = 52\n\nThe encrypted message is 10, 71, 49, 49, 52.\n\nNow, let's decode the encrypted message using the private key (n, d):\n\nM ≡ C^d (mod n)\n\nM_H ≡ 10^37 (mod 77) = 8\nM_E ≡ 71^37 (mod 77) = 5\nM_L ≡ 49^37 (mod 77) = 12\nM_O ≡ 52^37 (mod 77) = 15\n\nThe decrypted message is 8, 5, 12, 12, 15, which corresponds to the original message \"HELLO\"."
