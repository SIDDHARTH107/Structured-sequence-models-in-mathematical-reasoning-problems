Suppose you have a sample of 15 cars, and the data on horsepower (x) and weight (y) are given below:\n\nx: 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500\ny: 2000 2250 2540 2700 3040 3120 3300 3200 3680 3800 3900 4100 4350 4600 4880\n\nCalculate the regression equation and use it to predict the weight of a car with a horsepower of 275.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the means of x and y:\n\nmean_x = (150 + 175 + 200 + 225 + 250 + 275 + 300 + 325 + 350 + 375 + 400 + 425 + 450 + 475 + 500) / 15 = 325\nmean_y = (2000 + 2250 + 2540 + 2700 + 3040 + 3120 + 3300 + 3200 + 3680 + 3800 + 3900 + 4100 + 4350 + 4600 + 4880) / 15 = 3426.67\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the products of the differences between each x value and the mean of x, and each y value and the mean of y:\n\nΣ[(x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)] = (150 - 325) * (2000 - 3426.67) + ... + (500 - 325) * (4880 - 3426.67)\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the squares of the differences between each x value and the mean of x:\n\nΣ[(x - mean_x)^2] = (150 - 325)^2 + ... + (500 - 325)^2\n\nCalculate these sums:\n\nΣ[(x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)] = 1270833.33\nΣ[(x - mean_x)^2] = 433750\n\nNow we can find the slope (b) of the regression line:\n\nb = Σ[(x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)] / Σ[(x - mean_x)^2] = 1270833.33 / 433750 = 2.93\n\nNext, we find the y-intercept (a) of the regression line:\n\na = mean_y - b * mean_x = 3426.67 - 2.93 * 325 = 3426.67 - 951.25 = 2475.42\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line is:\n\ny = 2.93x + 2475.42\n\nNow, we can use this equation to predict the weight of a car with a horsepower of 275:\n\ny = 2.93 * 275 + 2475.42 = 805.75 + 2475.42 = 3281.17\n\nTherefore, the predicted weight of a car with a horsepower of 275 is approximately 3281.17 pounds."
