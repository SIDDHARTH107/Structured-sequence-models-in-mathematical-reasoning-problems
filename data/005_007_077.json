    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between the hours of study and the grades obtained by the students, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of the x values (hours of study), and ȳ is the mean of the y values (grades obtained).\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the hours of study (x̄) and the mean of the grades obtained (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 14 + 15) / 10 = 90 / 10 = 9\nȳ = (45 + 55 + 60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 10 = 720 / 10 = 72\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator: Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)]\nDenominator: √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nFor each data point, we will calculate (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ), (xi - x̄)², and (yi - ȳ)²:\n\n(3-9)(45-72) = -6 * -27 = 162\n(4-9)(55-72) = -5 * -17 = 85\n(6-9)(60-72) = -3 * -12 = 36\n(7-9)(65-72) = -2 * -7 = 14\n(8-9)(70-72) = -1 * -2 = 2\n(10-9)(75-72) = 1 * 3 = 3\n(11-9)(80-72) = 2 * 8 = 16\n(12-9)(85-72) = 3 * 13 = 39\n(14-9)(90-72) = 5 * 18 = 90\n(15-9)(95-72) = 6 * 23 = 138\n\nSum of (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ): 162 + 85 + 36 + 14 + 2 + 3 + 16 + 39 + 90 + 138 = 585\n\n(3-9)² = 36\n(4-9)² = 25\n(6-9)² = 9\n(7-9)² = 4\n(8-9)² = 1\n(10-9)² = 1\n(11-9)² = 4\n(12-9)² = 9\n(14-9)² = 25\n(15-9)² = 36\n\nSum of (xi - x̄)²: 36 + 25 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 = 150\n\n(45-72)² = 729\n(55-72)² = 289\n(60-72)² = 144\n(65-72)² = 49\n(70-72)² = 4\n(75-72)² = 9\n(80-72)² = 64\n(85-72)² = 169\n(90-72)² = 324\n(95-72)² = 529\n\nSum of (yi - ȳ)²: 729 + 289 + 144 + 49 + 4 + 9 + 64 + 169 + 324 + 529 = 2310\n\nNow we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = 585 / √(150 * 2310) = 585 / √346500 ≈ 0.976\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the hours of study and the grades obtained by the students is approximately 0.976, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables."
