    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, one of the congruent sides is 9 cm long and the angle between them is 72 degrees. Find the length of the third side.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side, we can use the Law of Cosines. In an isosceles triangle, the two congruent sides are called legs, and the third side is called the base. Let's denote the length of the base as b and the angle between the legs as A (72 degrees). The Law of Cosines states:\n\nb² = 9² + 9² - 2(9)(9)cos(72°)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cosine of 72 degrees:\n\ncos(72°) ≈ 0.309\n\nNow, plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nb² = 81 + 81 - 2(9)(9)(0.309)\nb² = 162 - 2(81)(0.309)\nb² = 162 - 50.178\nb² ≈ 111.822\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the base:\n\nb ≈ √111.822\nb ≈ 10.57 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side (base) of the isosceles triangle is approximately 10.57 cm."
