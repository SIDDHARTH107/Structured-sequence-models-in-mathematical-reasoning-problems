    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that fills a square by recursively subdividing it into smaller squares. Each time the curve is subdivided, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4, and the size of the square it fills is doubled.\n\nLet's denote the total length of the Hilbert curve at depth n as L(n). At depth 0, the curve is just a single segment with length 1, so L(0) = 1. At each subsequent depth, the length of the curve is multiplied by 4, so L(n) = 4 * L(n-1).\n\nNow, we can find the total length of the Hilbert curve when it is subdivided 3 times (n=3):\n\nL(3) = 4 * L(2)\nL(2) = 4 * L(1)\nL(1) = 4 * L(0)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nL(3) = 4 * (4 * (4 * 1))\nL(3) = 4 * (4 * 4)\nL(3) = 4 * 16\nL(3) = 64\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve when it is subdivided 3 times is 64."
