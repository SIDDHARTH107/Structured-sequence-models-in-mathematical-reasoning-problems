    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 3sin(2x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 3sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 3sin(2x) with respect to x:\n\n∫3sin(2x) dx = -(3/2)cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral on the interval [0, π]:\n\n[ -(3/2)cos(2π) - (-(3/2)cos(0)) ]\n\n= [ -(3/2)(1) - (-(3/2)(1)) ]\n\n= [ -3/2 + 3/2 ]\n\n= 0\n\nNow, we will plug this back into our average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 0\n\nAverage value = 0\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x) on the interval [0,π] is 0."
