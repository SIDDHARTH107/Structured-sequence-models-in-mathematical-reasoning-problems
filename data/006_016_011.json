    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs, with an average of 3 defective bulbs per batch of 50 bulbs. What is the probability that a batch of 50 bulbs will contain exactly 2 defective bulbs?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability formula, which is used to calculate the probability of a given number of events (in this case, defective bulbs) occurring in a fixed interval (in this case, a batch of 50 bulbs). The formula is:\n\nP(k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere P(k) is the probability of k events occurring, λ is the average number of events (in this case, 3 defective bulbs), e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of exactly 2 defective bulbs in a batch of 50, so k = 2. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(2) = (3^2 * e^(-3)) / 2!\nP(2) = (9 * e^(-3)) / 2\nP(2) = (9 * 0.049787) / 2\nP(2) ≈ 0.224041\n\nSo, the probability that a batch of 50 bulbs will contain exactly 2 defective bulbs is approximately 22.4%."
