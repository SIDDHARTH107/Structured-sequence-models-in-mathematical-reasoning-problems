    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that G has 10 vertices (v = 10) and 15 edges (e = 15). We can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for connected planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for v and e:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, we need to check if G satisfies the Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nIn this case, since the graph has only 10 vertices, it cannot contain a subdivision of K5 as a subgraph, because K5 has 5 vertices and 10 edges, and adding vertices to the edges would increase the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nSimilarly, G cannot contain a subdivision of K3,3 as a subgraph, because K3,3 has 6 vertices and 9 edges, and adding vertices to the edges would increase the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nTherefore, since G does not contain a subdivision of K5 or K3,3 as a subgraph, and it satisfies the inequality e ≤ 3v - 6, we can conclude that G is a planar graph."
