    "message_2": "To determine the complement of A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all elements under consideration. Since A is a set of integers, let's assume U is the set of all integers from 1 to 9, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nBy comparing the elements of U and A, we can determine the elements of A':\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement of A is unique. To do this, let's assume there is another complement of A, called B, such that B ≠ A'. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince B is a complement of A, it must contain all elements in U that are not in A. However, we have already determined that A' contains all such elements. Therefore, B must contain the same elements as A', which contradicts our assumption that B ≠ A'.\n\nThus, the complement of A is unique, and it is A' = {2, 4, 6, 8}."
