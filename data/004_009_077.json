    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x - 1)(x^2 + 3x + 5) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = 2x - 1\nv(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2\nv'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for u(x), v(x), u'(x), and v'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (2)(x^2 + 3x + 5) + (2x - 1)(2x + 3)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 2x^2 + 6x + 10 + 4x^2 - 2x + 6x - 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x - 1)(x^2 + 3x + 5) is f'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 7."
