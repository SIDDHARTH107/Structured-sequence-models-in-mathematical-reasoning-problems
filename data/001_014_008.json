    "message_2": "To simplify the square root of 32, we need to find the prime factors of 32 and then pair them up.\n\n32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 (5 factors of 2)\n\nNow, pair up the factors:\n\n(sqrt(2 × 2)) × (sqrt(2 × 2)) × sqrt(2)\n\nSince the square root of a number squared is the number itself:\n\n2 × 2 × sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n4√2"
