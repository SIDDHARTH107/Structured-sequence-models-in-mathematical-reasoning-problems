    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 12 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the cone in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral surface area (a curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = πr² + πrL\n\nwhere r is the radius, and L is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (L) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the height, radius, and slant height:\n\nL² = h² + r²\n\nwhere h is the height of the cone.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL² = (12 cm)² + (4 cm)²\nL² = 144 cm² + 16 cm²\nL² = 160 cm²\n\nNow, find the slant height (L) by taking the square root:\n\nL = √(160 cm²) ≈ 12.65 cm\n\nNow, we can find the surface area using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr² + πrL\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSurface Area = π(4 cm)² + π(4 cm)(12.65 cm)\nSurface Area = 16π cm² + 50.6π cm²\nSurface Area ≈ 66.6π cm²\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 66.6 * 3.14 cm²\nSurface Area ≈ 209.084 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 209.084 square centimeters."
