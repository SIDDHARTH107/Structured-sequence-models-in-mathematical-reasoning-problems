    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices. Since there are 8 vertices and 11 edges, we can start by analyzing the possible configurations of the graph to find the minimum and maximum possible diameters.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum possible diameter. If the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex), then the diameter would be 1, as every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. However, a complete graph with 8 vertices would have 8 choose 2 edges, which is 28 edges. Since our graph has only 11 edges, it cannot be a complete graph, and the diameter must be greater than 1.\n\nNow let's consider the maximum possible diameter. If the graph is a tree (i.e., a connected graph with no cycles), then the diameter is the length of the longest path between any two vertices. A tree with 8 vertices has 7 edges, so our graph must contain at least 4 cycles. To maximize the diameter, we can arrange the vertices in a linear fashion, with one vertex having a degree of 3 to account for the extra edges. The arrangement would look like this:\n\n```\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8\n    |\n    9\n```\n\nIn this configuration, the longest shortest path is between vertices 1 and 8, which has a length of 7. Therefore, the maximum possible diameter is 7.\n\nSince the diameter must be greater than 1 and cannot be greater than 7, the diameter of the graph lies between 2 and 7, inclusive. To determine the exact diameter, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges in the graph."
