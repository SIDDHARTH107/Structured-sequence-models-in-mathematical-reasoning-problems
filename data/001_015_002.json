    "message_2": "To solve the equation 4^(x-1) - 8^(x-2) = 0, we can first rewrite the equation using the property of exponents:\n\n4^(x-1) = (2^2)^(x-1) = 2^(2(x-1))\n\n8^(x-2) = (2^3)^(x-2) = 2^(3(x-2))\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\n2^(2(x-1)) - 2^(3(x-2)) = 0\n\nLet's factor out the common term 2^(2(x-1)):\n\n2^(2(x-1)) (1 - 2^(x-1)) = 0\n\nNow we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2^(2(x-1)) = 0\nThis case has no solution, as the exponential function with a positive base is always greater than 0.\n\nCase 2: 1 - 2^(x-1) = 0\n2^(x-1) = 1\n\nSince 2^0 = 1, we have x-1 = 0, which gives us x = 1.\n\nSo the solution for the equation 4^(x-1) - 8^(x-2) = 0 is x = 1."
