Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n   (A, D) = 1\n   (B, F) = 1\n   (A, B) = 2\n   (E, G) = 3\n   (A, C) = 3\n   (D, E) = 4\n   (E, F) = 5\n\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n\n3. Add edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\n   Add (A, D) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   Add (B, F) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   Add (A, B) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   Add (E, G) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   Add (A, C) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   Adding (D, E) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n   Adding (E, F) would form a cycle, so skip it.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete with the following edges:\n(A, D), (B, F), (A, B), (E, G), (A, C)\n\nThe minimum cost of laying cables to connect all neighborhoods is the sum of the weights of these edges:\n1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10"
