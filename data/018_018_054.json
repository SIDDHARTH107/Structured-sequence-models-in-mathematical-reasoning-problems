The symmetric difference is commutative if A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince union and intersection are commutative, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (same as A ∪ B)\nB ∩ A = {3, 5} (same as A ∩ B)\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 7, 8, 9}\n\nSince A Δ B = {2, 7, 8, 9} and B Δ A = {2, 7, 8, 9}, the symmetric difference is commutative."
