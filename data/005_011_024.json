    "message_1": "An experiment was conducted to test the effect of a new fertilizer on the growth of tomatoes. Two groups of tomatoes were grown: one group received the new fertilizer and the other group did not. After a month, the height of the tomato plants was measured and recorded. The heights of the tomato plants in the new fertilizer group were 18 cm, 25 cm, 20 cm, 22 cm, 26 cm, and 19 cm. The heights of the tomato plants in the control group were 14 cm, 16 cm, 17 cm, 15 cm, 13 cm, and 14 cm. Calculate the mean height for each group and determine whether the new fertilizer had a significant effect on the growth of the tomato plants.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mean height for each group, we need to add up the heights of the tomato plants in each group and then divide by the number of plants in each group.\n\nFor the new fertilizer group:\nMean height = (18 + 25 + 20 + 22 + 26 + 19) / 6\nMean height = 130 / 6\nMean height ≈ 21.67 cm\n\nFor the control group:\nMean height = (14 + 16 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 14) / 6\nMean height = 89 / 6\nMean height ≈ 14.83 cm\n\nNow, let's compare the mean heights of the two groups to determine if the new fertilizer had a significant effect on the growth of the tomato plants. \n\nDifference in mean heights = 21.67 cm (new fertilizer group) - 14.83 cm (control group)\nDifference in mean heights = 6.84 cm\n\nThe mean height of the tomato plants in the new fertilizer group is 6.84 cm taller than the mean height of the tomato plants in the control group. This suggests that the new fertilizer had a significant effect on the growth of the tomato plants. However, to be more certain about the significance of this effect, a statistical test (such as a t-test) would need to be conducted to account for the variability in the data and the sample size."
