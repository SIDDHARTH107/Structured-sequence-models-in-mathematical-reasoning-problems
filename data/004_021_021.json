    "message_2": "First, we need to find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 - 15x + 10)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x - 15\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x - 15)\n\nAgain, using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 12\n\nf''(2) = 12 - 12\n\nf''(2) = 0\n\nSo, the value of the second derivative of f(x) at x = 2 is 0."
