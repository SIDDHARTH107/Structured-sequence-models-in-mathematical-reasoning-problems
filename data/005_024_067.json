    "message_2": "To calculate the mean, median, and mode of the data, we first need to organize the data in ascending order:\n\n$32,000, $38,000, $42,000, $45,000, $47,000, $48,000, $54,000, $55,000, $62,000, $70,000\n\nMean:\nThe mean is the average of the data. To find the mean, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values.\n\nMean = (32,000 + 38,000 + 42,000 + 45,000 + 47,000 + 48,000 + 54,000 + 55,000 + 62,000 + 70,000) / 10\nMean = 493,000 / 10\nMean = $49,300\n\nMedian:\nThe median is the middle value of the data. Since there are 10 values, we take the average of the 5th and 6th values.\n\nMedian = (47,000 + 48,000) / 2\nMedian = 95,000 / 2\nMedian = $47,500\n\nMode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data. In this case, there is no value that appears more than once, so there is no mode.\n\nIn summary, the mean is $49,300, the median is $47,500, and there is no mode."
