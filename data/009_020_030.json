The control function u(t) is subject to the constraints |u(t)| ≤ 1. Find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function:\n\nJ = ∫(0 to 10) [(y(t) - 1)^2 + 0.01u^2(t)]dt\n\nsubject to the given dynamics and constraints, where t represents time.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP), which is an optimization method for control systems. The PMP states that the optimal control input u(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian function H, which is defined as:\n\nH = L + λ'(t) * f\n\nwhere L is the Lagrangian, λ(t) is the costate variable, and f is the system dynamics. In our case, the Lagrangian L and the system dynamics f are given by:\n\nL = (y(t) - 1)^2 + 0.01u^2(t)\nf = y'' + 4y' + 4y - u(t)\n\nNow, let's define the costate variables λ1(t) and λ2(t) as:\n\nλ1(t) = ∂H/∂y = 2(y(t) - 1)\nλ2(t) = ∂H/∂y' = 0\n\nThe costate equations are given by:\n\nλ1'(t) = -∂H/∂y' = -4λ2(t)\nλ2'(t) = -∂H/∂y = -4λ1(t) + 4\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by:\n\nH = L + λ1(t) * y'(t) + λ2(t) * (y'' + 4y' + 4y - u(t))\n\nTo find the optimal control input u(t), we need to minimize the Hamiltonian with respect to u(t):\n\n∂H/∂u = 0.02u(t) - λ2(t)\n\nSince |u(t)| ≤ 1, we have:\n\nu(t) = min(max(-1, λ2(t)/0.02), 1)\n\nNow, we have a Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) with the following system of equations:\n\n1. y'' + 4y' + 4y = u(t)\n2. λ1'(t) = -4λ2(t)\n3. λ2'(t) = -4λ1(t) + 4\n4. y(0) = 0\n5. y'(0) = 1\n\nTo solve this TPBVP, we can use numerical methods such as the shooting method or the finite difference method. Once we find the optimal costate variables λ1(t) and λ2(t), we can compute the optimal control input u(t) using the formula:\n\nu(t) = min(max(-1, λ2(t)/0.02), 1)\n\nThis will give us the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J subject to the given dynamics and constraints."
