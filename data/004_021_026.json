Find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 9)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x + 4\n\n2. Find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 12x + 4)\nf''(x) = 12x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 12(2) - 12\nf''(2) = 24 - 12\nf''(2) = 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 9 at x = 2 is 12."
