Based on a sample of 100 customers, the mean amount spent was $5.75 with a standard deviation of $1.20. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average amount spent by customers at the coffee shop.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average amount spent by customers at the coffee shop, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nGiven:\nMean = $5.75\nStandard Deviation = $1.20\nSample Size = 100\nZ-score for a 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = $5.75 ± (1.96 * ($1.20 / √100))\nConfidence Interval = $5.75 ± (1.96 * ($1.20 / 10))\nConfidence Interval = $5.75 ± (1.96 * $0.12)\nConfidence Interval = $5.75 ± $0.2352\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average amount spent by customers at the coffee shop is:\n\nLower Limit = $5.75 - $0.2352 = $5.5148\nUpper Limit = $5.75 + $0.2352 = $5.9852\n\nThe 95% confidence interval is approximately ($5.51, $5.99)."
