    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5, we first need to find its derivative f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the potential critical points.\n\n12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x = 0\n\nWe can factor out a 12x from the equation:\n\n12x(x^2 - x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we have two factors: 12x and (x^2 - x - 2). Setting each factor to zero, we get:\n\n12x = 0 => x = 0\n\nx^2 - x - 2 = 0\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation x^2 - x - 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 8)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √9) / 2\nx = (1 ± 3) / 2\n\nThis gives us two more solutions for x:\n\nx = (1 + 3) / 2 => x = 4 / 2 => x = 2\nx = (1 - 3) / 2 => x = -2 / 2 => x = -1\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5 are x = -1, x = 0, and x = 2."
