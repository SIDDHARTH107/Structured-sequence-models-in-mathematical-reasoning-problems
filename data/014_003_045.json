    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve regarding ElGamal encryption and decryption:\n\nSuppose a message is to be encrypted using ElGamal with prime number p=29, primitive root α=2, private key a=5, and public key A=α^a mod p. The message is represented by the integer m=15. The sender randomly selects k=6 as the ephemeral key, computes the ciphertext pair (c1, c2)=(α^k mod p, mA^k mod p), and sends it to the receiver. Compute the plaintext message using the private key a and the received ciphertext.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the public key A using the given values:\n\nA = α^a mod p\nA = 2^5 mod 29\nA = 32 mod 29\nA = 3\n\nNow, let's compute the ciphertext pair (c1, c2) using the given values:\n\nc1 = α^k mod p\nc1 = 2^6 mod 29\nc1 = 64 mod 29\nc1 = 6\n\nc2 = mA^k mod p\nc2 = 15 * 3^6 mod 29\nc2 = 15 * 729 mod 29\nc2 = 10935 mod 29\nc2 = 25\n\nSo, the ciphertext pair is (6, 25).\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message using the private key a and the received ciphertext:\n\nm = c2 * (c1^a)^(-1) mod p\nm = 25 * (6^5)^(-1) mod 29\n\nFirst, let's compute the modular inverse of (6^5) mod 29:\n\n(6^5) mod 29 = 7776 mod 29 = 16\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 16 mod 29. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for this:\n\ngcd(16, 29) = 1 = 16 * x + 29 * y\n\nAfter applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get:\n\nx = 2, y = -1\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 16 mod 29 is 2.\n\nNow, let's compute the plaintext message:\n\nm = 25 * 2 mod 29\nm = 50 mod 29\nm = 15\n\nThus, the decrypted plaintext message is 15."
