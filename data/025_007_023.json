    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space H^1(X, L), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nHere, h^0(X, L) and h^1(X, L) denote the dimensions of the spaces H^0(X, L) and H^1(X, L), respectively. In our case, X is a curve of genus 2, and L is a line bundle of degree 1. So we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = 1 + 1 - 2\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find h^0(X, L). Since L is a line bundle of degree 1, it is not very ample, and it cannot separate points or tangent vectors on X. Therefore, there are no non-constant global sections of L, and h^0(X, L) = 0.\n\nWith this information, we can now solve for h^1(X, L):\n\n0 - h^1(X, L) = 0\n\nh^1(X, L) = 0\n\nSo the dimension of the space H^1(X, L) is 0."
