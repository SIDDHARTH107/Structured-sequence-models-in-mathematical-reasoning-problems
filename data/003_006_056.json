    "message_1": "A triangular field has angles of 60°, 75°, and 45°. If the longest side of the field is 30 meters, what are the lengths of the other two sides?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and their opposite angles as A, B, and C, respectively. According to the given information, we have:\n\nA = 60°, B = 75°, and C = 45°.\n\nSince the longest side is 30 meters, let's assume c = 30 meters (opposite to the largest angle, which is 75°). Now, we can use the Law of Sines to find the other two sides:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe have the values for A, B, C, and c, so we can solve for a and b:\n\na / sin(60°) = 30 / sin(75°)\na = 30 * sin(60°) / sin(75°)\n\nb / sin(75°) = 30 / sin(45°)\nb = 30 * sin(75°) / sin(45°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the lengths of a and b:\n\na = 30 * sin(60°) / sin(75°) ≈ 30 * 0.866 / 0.966 ≈ 26.83 meters\n\nb = 30 * sin(75°) / sin(45°) ≈ 30 * 0.966 / 0.707 ≈ 40.92 meters\n\nSo, the other two sides of the triangular field are approximately 26.83 meters and 40.92 meters."
