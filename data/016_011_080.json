    "message_2": "To find the fractal dimension of a Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of a Vicsek fractal, the square is divided into smaller squares, with a total of 5 smaller squares being filled (forming a cross shape). So, N = 5.\n\nNow, let's find the scaling factor S. The problem states that the square is divided into 394,264 smaller squares. To find the scaling factor, we need to determine how many times smaller each side of the smaller squares is compared to the original square. Since there are 394,264 smaller squares in total, we can find the square root of this number to determine the number of smaller squares along one side:\n\n√394,264 ≈ 628\n\nSo, there are 628 smaller squares along one side of the original square. This means that each smaller square is 628 times smaller than the original square, so the scaling factor S = 628.\n\nNow we can calculate the fractal dimension D:\n\nD = log(5) / log(628)\n\nD ≈ 0.738\n\nThe fractal dimension of a Vicsek fractal constructed by dividing a square into 394,264 smaller squares and repeating this process 6 times is approximately 0.738."
