    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group of order 16, it means that G has an element (in this case, 5) whose order is 16. In other words, 5 has the property that 5^16 = 1 (identity element) and no smaller positive power of 5 equals 1.\n\nTo find all possible cyclic subgroups of G, we need to consider the divisors of 16, which are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. For each divisor d, we can form a cyclic subgroup by taking the powers of 5^(16/d).\n\n1. For d = 1, the cyclic subgroup is {1}, which is the trivial subgroup.\n2. For d = 2, the cyclic subgroup is generated by 5^(16/2) = 5^8. Let's call this subgroup H2. H2 = {1, 5^8, (5^8)^2 = 5^16 = 1, ...} = {1, 5^8}.\n3. For d = 4, the cyclic subgroup is generated by 5^(16/4) = 5^4. Let's call this subgroup H4. H4 = {1, 5^4, (5^4)^2 = 5^8, (5^4)^3 = 5^12, (5^4)^4 = 5^16 = 1, ...} = {1, 5^4, 5^8, 5^12}.\n4. For d = 8, the cyclic subgroup is generated by 5^(16/8) = 5^2. Let's call this subgroup H8. H8 = {1, 5^2, (5^2)^2 = 5^4, (5^2)^3 = 5^6, (5^2)^4 = 5^8, (5^2)^5 = 5^10, (5^2)^6 = 5^12, (5^2)^7 = 5^14, (5^2)^8 = 5^16 = 1, ...} = {1, 5^2, 5^4, 5^6, 5^8, 5^10, 5^12, 5^14}.\n5. For d = 16, the cyclic subgroup is generated by 5^(16/16) = 5^1. Let's call this subgroup H16. H16 = {1, 5, 5^2, 5^3, 5^4, 5^5, 5^6, 5^7, 5^8, 5^9, 5^10, 5^11, 5^12, 5^13, 5^14, 5^15, 5^16 = 1, ...} = {1, 5, 5^2, 5^3, 5^4, 5^5, 5^6, 5^7, 5^8, 5^9, 5^10, 5^11, 5^12, 5^13, 5^14, 5^15}.\n\nSo, the possible cyclic subgroups of G are {1}, H2, H4, H8, and H16."
