    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive prime numbers greater than or equal to 1,000, we need to find the first pair of prime numbers with the smallest difference.\n\nThe prime numbers greater than or equal to 1,000 are:\n\n1009, 1013, 1019, 1021, 1031, ...\n\nThe differences between these consecutive prime numbers are:\n\n1013 - 1009 = 4\n1019 - 1013 = 6\n1021 - 1019 = 2\n...\n\nThe smallest prime gap between two consecutive prime numbers greater than or equal to 1,000 is 2, which occurs between the prime numbers 1019 and 1021."
