    "message_1": "Suppose Amy and Ben are playing a centipede game. The game starts with Amy having $50 and Ben having $0. In each round, Amy can either keep the money or pass it to Ben. If Amy passes the money to Ben, the amount doubles and Ben passes half of it back to Amy. If Amy keeps the money, the game ends and both players receive their respective amounts. What would be the amount that Amy and Ben would respectively hold on the 6th round if Amy decides to pass the money to Ben in every round?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game round by round:\n\nRound 1: Amy passes $50 to Ben, it doubles to $100. Ben passes half ($50) back to Amy.\nAmy: $50, Ben: $50\n\nRound 2: Amy passes $50 to Ben, it doubles to $100. Ben passes half ($50) back to Amy.\nAmy: $50, Ben: $100\n\nRound 3: Amy passes $50 to Ben, it doubles to $100. Ben passes half ($50) back to Amy.\nAmy: $50, Ben: $150\n\nRound 4: Amy passes $50 to Ben, it doubles to $100. Ben passes half ($50) back to Amy.\nAmy: $50, Ben: $200\n\nRound 5: Amy passes $50 to Ben, it doubles to $100. Ben passes half ($50) back to Amy.\nAmy: $50, Ben: $250\n\nRound 6: Amy passes $50 to Ben, it doubles to $100. Ben passes half ($50) back to Amy.\nAmy: $50, Ben: $300\n\nAfter the 6th round, if Amy decides to pass the money to Ben in every round, Amy would have $50 and Ben would have $300."
