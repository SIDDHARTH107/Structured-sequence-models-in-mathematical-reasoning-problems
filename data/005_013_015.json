Sample standard deviation of X and Y:\n\nFor X:\nVariance of X = Σ(Xi - mean of X)^2 / (n-1)\n= ((50-65)^2 + (60-65)^2 + (75-65)^2 + (55-65)^2 + (85-65)^2) / 4\n= (225 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 400) / 4\n= 850 / 4\n= 212.5\nStandard deviation of X = √(Variance of X) = √212.5 ≈ 14.58\n\nFor Y:\nVariance of Y = Σ(Yi - mean of Y)^2 / (n-1)\n= ((7-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (9-8)^2 + (6-8)^2 + (10-8)^2) / 4\n= (1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4) / 4\n= 10 / 4\n= 2.5\nStandard deviation of Y = √(Variance of Y) = √2.5 ≈ 1.58\n\n3.

Predicted value of Y for an employee with an annual income of $70,000:\n\nY = 4.55 + 0.0531 * 70 ≈ 8.21\n\nThe predicted value of Y (years of education) for an employee with an annual income of $70,000 is approximately 8.21 years."
