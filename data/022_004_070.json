    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the complex function f(z) = (z-2)/(z^2-4z+4), we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator is a quadratic function: z^2 - 4z + 4. We can factor this expression:\n\n(z^2 - 4z + 4) = (z - 2)(z - 2)\n\nNow, we set the factored expression equal to zero and solve for z:\n\n(z - 2)(z - 2) = 0\n\nThis equation has a double root at z = 2.\n\nNow, we check if the function has a removable singularity at z = 2. If the numerator and denominator share a common factor, then the singularity is removable. In this case, both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of (z - 2):\n\nf(z) = (z - 2) / [(z - 2)(z - 2)]\n\nWe can simplify the function by canceling out the common factor:\n\nf(z) = 1 / (z - 2)\n\nThe simplified function has a singularity at z = 2, which is a pole of order 1. Therefore, the original function f(z) = (z-2)/(z^2-4z+4) has a singularity at z = 2, which is a pole of order 1."
