    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 with respect to x using the power rule of differentiation, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\n1. Differentiate the first term, 2x^2:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the derivative is (2 * 2) * x^(2-1) = 4x.\n\n2. Differentiate the second term, 5x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the derivative is (1 * 5) * x^(1-1) = 5.\n\n3. Differentiate the constant term, 3:\nThe derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x + 5 + 0 = 4x + 5"
