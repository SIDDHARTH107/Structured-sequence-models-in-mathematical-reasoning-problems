    "message_2": "Let the signal f(t) be represented as:\n\nf(t) = A1 * sin(2π * 100 * t) + A2 * sin(2π * 200 * t)\n\nwhere A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of the sinusoids with frequencies 100 Hz and 200 Hz, respectively.\n\nThe Fourier transform of the signal is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[t=0 to t=T] f(t) e^(-jωt) dt\n\nWe can find the Fourier transform of each sinusoid separately and then add them together, as the Fourier transform is a linear operation. Let's find the Fourier transform of the first sinusoid:\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[t=0 to t=T] A1 * sin(2π * 100 * t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nSimilarly, for the second sinusoid:\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[t=0 to t=T] A2 * sin(2π * 200 * t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we can use the following formula for the Fourier transform of a sine function:\n\n∫[t=0 to t=T] sin(2π * f * t) * e^(-jωt) dt = (j/2) * [δ(ω - 2πf) - δ(ω + 2πf)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nApplying this formula to F1(ω) and F2(ω), we get:\n\nF1(ω) = (j * A1 / 2) * [δ(ω - 2π * 100) - δ(ω + 2π * 100)]\nF2(ω) = (j * A2 / 2) * [δ(ω - 2π * 200) - δ(ω + 2π * 200)]\n\nNow, we can add F1(ω) and F2(ω) to obtain the Fourier transform of the entire signal:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\nF(ω) = (j * A1 / 2) * [δ(ω - 2π * 100) - δ(ω + 2π * 100)] + (j * A2 / 2) * [δ(ω - 2π * 200) - δ(ω + 2π * 200)]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given signal, which is a sum of two sinusoids with frequencies 100 Hz and 200 Hz."
