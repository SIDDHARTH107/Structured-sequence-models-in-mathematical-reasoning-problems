    "message_2": "To find the probability of a flood occurring in the next two years, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of an event NOT occurring. In this case, we want to find the probability of a flood NOT occurring in both years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a flood NOT occurring in any given year is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nThe probability of a flood NOT occurring in both years is 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of a flood occurring in the next two years:\n\n1 - 0.36 = 0.64\n\nSo, the probability of a flood occurring in the next two years in this region is 0.64 or 64%."
