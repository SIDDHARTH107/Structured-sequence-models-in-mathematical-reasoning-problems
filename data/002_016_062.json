    "message_2": "To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides. An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.\n\nPerimeter = 36 cm\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 36 cm / 3 = 12 cm\n\nEach side of the equilateral triangle is 12 cm long."
