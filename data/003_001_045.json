    "message_2": "To find the length of the other leg, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm, and one leg (a) is 6 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n\nNow, subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\n100 - 36 = b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), take the square root of both sides:\n\nâˆš64 = b\n8 = b\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
