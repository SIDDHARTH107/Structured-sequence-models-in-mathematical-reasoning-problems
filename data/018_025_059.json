    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 2} ∪ {6, 7} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter, i.e., A ∆ B = B ∆ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A. In this case, we need to show that (A ∆ B) ∩ A ≠ A ∩ (A ∆ B).\n\nLet's find (A ∆ B) ∩ A:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A = {1, 2, 6, 7} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2}\n\nNow let's find A ∩ (A ∆ B):\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 6, 7} = {1, 2}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∩ A = A ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 2}, the symmetric difference of A and B is actually commutative with respect to intersection in this specific case. However, this does not mean that symmetric difference is always commutative with respect to intersection for all sets."
