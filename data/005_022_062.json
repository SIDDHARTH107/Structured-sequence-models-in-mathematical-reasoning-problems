Using robust statistics, determine the minimum and maximum life span of the battery that is within the acceptable range for 95% of the batteries.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum and maximum life span of the battery that is within the acceptable range for 95% of the batteries, we can use the concept of the interquartile range (IQR) in robust statistics. The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data. \n\nFirst, let's find the first and third quartiles. Since the data is normally distributed, we can use the z-scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles. The z-scores for these percentiles are approximately -0.674 and 0.674, respectively.\n\nNow, we can calculate the first and third quartiles using the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the battery life:\n\nQ1 = μ + (z-score for 25th percentile) * σ\nQ1 = 100 + (-0.674) * 8\nQ1 ≈ 94.608\n\nQ3 = μ + (z-score for 75th percentile) * σ\nQ3 = 100 + (0.674) * 8\nQ3 ≈ 105.392\n\nNext, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\nIQR = 105.392 - 94.608\nIQR ≈ 10.784\n\nNow, we can determine the lower and upper bounds for the acceptable range using the 1.5 * IQR rule:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\nLower Bound = 94.608 - 1.5 * 10.784\nLower Bound ≈ 78.324\n\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\nUpper Bound = 105.392 + 1.5 * 10.784\nUpper Bound ≈ 121.676\n\nTherefore, the minimum and maximum life span of the battery that is within the acceptable range for 95% of the batteries is approximately 78.324 hours and 121.676 hours, respectively."
