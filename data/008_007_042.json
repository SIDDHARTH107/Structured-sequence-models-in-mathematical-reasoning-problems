    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue and form the matrix P using these eigenvectors as columns. Then, we can compute P^(-1)AP, which will be a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\n1. Find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue:\n\nFor λ1 = -2:\n\n(A - (-2)I)v1 = 0\n(A + 2I)v1 = 0\n\nSolve for v1.\n\nFor λ2 = 1:\n\n(A - 1I)v2 = 0\n\nSolve for v2.\n\nFor λ3 = 3:\n\n(A - 3I)v3 = 0\n\nSolve for v3.\n\n2. Form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = |v1 v2 v3|\n\n3. Compute P^(-1)AP:\n\nSince P is formed by linearly independent eigenvectors, it is invertible. Compute the inverse of P, denoted as P^(-1).\n\n4. Multiply P^(-1)AP:\n\nP^(-1)AP = D\n\nD is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues λ1, λ2, and λ3 on the diagonal.\n\nNote: Without the actual matrix A, we cannot provide specific eigenvectors or the matrices P, P^(-1), and D. The process outlined above is the general method for diagonalizing a matrix given its eigenvalues."
