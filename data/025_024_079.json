    "message_1": "A math student studies Geometric Invariant Theory and is asked to find the polynomial equation of a conic section that goes through 5 given points in the Cartesian plane. The 5 points are (0,0), (2,1), (3,2), (1,3), and (-1,2). Can the student find the equation of the conic section that passes through these 5 points using the tools of Geometric Invariant Theory?",
    "message_2": "Yes, the student can find the equation of the conic section that passes through these 5 points using the tools of Geometric Invariant Theory. \n\nA general conic section in the Cartesian plane can be represented by a quadratic equation of the form:\n\nAx^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n\nTo find the equation of the conic section that passes through the 5 given points, we can substitute the coordinates of each point into the equation and obtain a system of linear equations:\n\n1. A(0)^2 + B(0)(0) + C(0)^2 + D(0) + E(0) + F = 0\n2. A(2)^2 + B(2)(1) + C(1)^2 + D(2) + E(1) + F = 0\n3. A(3)^2 + B(3)(2) + C(2)^2 + D(3) + E(2) + F = 0\n4. A(1)^2 + B(1)(3) + C(3)^2 + D(1) + E(3) + F = 0\n5. A(-1)^2 + B(-1)(2) + C(2)^2 + D(-1) + E(2) + F = 0\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n1. F = 0\n2. 4A + 2B + C + 2D + E = 0\n3. 9A + 6B + 4C + 3D + 2E = 0\n4. A + 3B + 9C + D + 3E = 0\n5. A - 2B + 4C - D + 2E = 0\n\nSince we have 5 equations and 6 unknowns (A, B, C, D, E, F), we can solve this system of linear equations to find the coefficients of the conic section. However, note that the conic section is only determined up to a scalar multiple, so we can set one of the coefficients to a fixed value (e.g., A = 1) and solve for the remaining coefficients.\n\nUsing the tools of Geometric Invariant Theory, the student can analyze the properties of the conic section and determine the coefficients that satisfy the given conditions. Once the coefficients are found, the student can write the equation of the conic section that passes through the 5 given points."
