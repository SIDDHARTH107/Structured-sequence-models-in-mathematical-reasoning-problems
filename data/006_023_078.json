    "message_1": "Suppose in a market of 100 potential customers, the probability of a customer buying product A is 0.3 and the probability of a customer buying product B is 0.5. What is the probability that a customer will buy either product A or B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a customer will buy either product A or B, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nHowever, we don't have the information about the probability of a customer buying both products A and B (P(A ∩ B)). We need to make an assumption about the relationship between the two events.\n\nIf we assume that the events are independent (meaning the purchase of product A does not affect the purchase of product B), then we can calculate P(A ∩ B) as follows:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15\n\nNow we can find the probability of a customer buying either product A or B:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.3 + 0.5 - 0.15 = 0.65\n\nSo, under the assumption of independence, the probability that a customer will buy either product A or B is 0.65."
