Hence, round your answers to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan method, we first need to form the augmented matrix:\n\n| 3 -4  5 | 8\n| 2  7  3 | 2\n| 1 -2  3 | 1\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n| 1 -4/3  5/3 | 8/3\n| 2   7    3  | 2\n| 1  -2    3  | 1\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first row from the second and third rows to eliminate the leading 1 in the second and third rows:\n\n| 1 -4/3  5/3 |  8/3\n| 0 17/3 -1/3 | -2/3\n| 0 -2/3  4/3 |  1/3\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by 3/17 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n| 1 -4/3  5/3 |  8/3\n| 0   1   -1/17 | -2/17\n| 0 -2/3  4/3 |  1/3\n\nStep 4: Add appropriate multiples of the second row to the first and third rows to eliminate the non-zero entries below the leading 1 in the second row:\n\n| 1   0  13/17 |  22/17\n| 0   1   -1/17 | -2/17\n| 0   0   8/17 |   1/17\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 8/17 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n| 1   0  13/17 |  22/17\n| 0   1   -1/17 | -2/17\n| 0   0    1   |   1/8\n\nStep 6: Add appropriate multiples of the third row to the first and second rows to eliminate the non-zero entries above the leading 1 in the third row:\n\n| 1   0    0   |  15/8\n| 0   1    0   |  -1/8\n| 0   0    1   |   1/8\n\nNow, the matrix is in RREF, and we can read off the solutions:\n\nx = 15/8 ≈ 1.88\ny = -1/8 ≈ -0.13\nz = 1/8 ≈ 0.13\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x = 1.88, y = -0.13, and z = 0.13."
