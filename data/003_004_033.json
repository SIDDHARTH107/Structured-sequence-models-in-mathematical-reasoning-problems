    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation 2sin(x) = 1 in the interval [0, 2π], we first isolate sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) = 1\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2π] for which the sine function equals 1/2. Recall that the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. The reference angle for which sin(x) = 1/2 is π/6 (or 30°). \n\nIn the first quadrant, the angle x is simply the reference angle:\n\nx = π/6\n\nIn the second quadrant, the angle x is the difference between π and the reference angle:\n\nx = π - π/6 = 5π/6\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation 2sin(x) = 1 in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = π/6 and x = 5π/6"
