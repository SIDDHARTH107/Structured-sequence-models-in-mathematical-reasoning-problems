    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. Find (A △ B) △ {2} and A △ (B △ {2}) where △ represents the symmetric difference and x △ {y} represents the set obtained by removing y from x and adding all the elements of {y} that are not in x. Show that the two sets are not equal.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in both. So, A △ B = {1, 3} since 1 is in A but not in B, and 3 is in B but not in A.\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ {2}. We have A △ B = {1, 3} and we want to find the symmetric difference with {2}. Since 2 is not in {1, 3}, we add it to the set, and we get (A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nNext, let's find B △ {2}. We have B = {2, 3} and we want to find the symmetric difference with {2}. Since 2 is in B, we remove it from the set, and we get B △ {2} = {3}.\n\nNow, let's find A △ (B △ {2}). We have A = {1, 2} and B △ {2} = {3}. Since 1 is in A but not in {3}, and 3 is not in A, we add them to the set, and we get A △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that (A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 2, 3} and A △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2, 3}. Therefore, the two sets are equal. My initial statement about the sets not being equal was incorrect."
