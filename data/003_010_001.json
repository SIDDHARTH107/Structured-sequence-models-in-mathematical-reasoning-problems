    "message_1": "A tree has a shadow that is 15 meters long. If the angle of elevation from the tip of the shadow to the top of the tree is 60 degrees, what is the height of the tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tree (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the length of the shadow, which is 15 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 15\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = height / 15\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 15 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 15 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 25.98 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 25.98 meters."
