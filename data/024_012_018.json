    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of the 2-form α = dx ∧ dy + dy ∧ dz on M with respect to the Riemannian metric g = dx ⊗ dx + 2dy ⊗ dy + 3dz ⊗ dz at the point p = (1,1,1), we first need to find the volume form associated with the metric g.\n\nThe volume form can be computed as the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The metric tensor G in matrix form corresponding to g is:\n\nG = | 1  0  0 |\n      | 0  2  0 |\n      | 0  0  3 |\n\nThe determinant of G is det(G) = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6. Therefore, the volume form is:\n\nvol_g = sqrt(6) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator of α:\n\n*α = (α ∧ (vol_g)^(-1)) / ||α||^2\n\nwhere ||α||^2 is the square of the norm of α with respect to the metric g. To compute ||α||^2, we need to find the dual of α with respect to g, which is given by:\n\nα^# = g(α, -)\n\nα^# = (dx ∧ dy)(dx ⊗ dx + 2dy ⊗ dy + 3dz ⊗ dz) + (dy ∧ dz)(dx ⊗ dx + 2dy ⊗ dy + 3dz ⊗ dz)\n\nα^# = (dx ∧ dy)(dx ⊗ dx) + (dx ∧ dy)(2dy ⊗ dy) + (dx ∧ dy)(3dz ⊗ dz) + (dy ∧ dz)(dx ⊗ dx) + (dy ∧ dz)(2dy ⊗ dy) + (dy ∧ dz)(3dz ⊗ dz)\n\nα^# = 0 + 2(dx ∧ dy) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3(dy ∧ dz)\n\nα^# = 2(dx ∧ dy) + 3(dy ∧ dz)\n\nNow, we can compute ||α||^2:\n\n||α||^2 = α ∧ α^# = (dx ∧ dy + dy ∧ dz) ∧ (2(dx ∧ dy) + 3(dy ∧ dz))\n\n||α||^2 = 2(dx ∧ dy ∧ dx ∧ dy) + 3(dx ∧ dy ∧ dy ∧ dz) + 6(dy ∧ dz ∧ dx ∧ dy) + 9(dy ∧ dz ∧ dy ∧ dz)\n\nUsing the antisymmetry property of the wedge product, we have:\n\n||α||^2 = 2(0) + 3(0) + 6(0) + 9(0) = 0\n\nSince ||α||^2 = 0, the Hodge star operator of α is undefined. This is because α is a degenerate 2-form with respect to the given metric g."
