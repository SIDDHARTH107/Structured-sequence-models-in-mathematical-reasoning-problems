    "message_1": "A boat is traveling northwest at a speed of 10 meters per second. What is the magnitude and direction of its velocity vector? (Assume the positive x-axis is East and the positive y-axis is North.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector, we need to break it down into its x and y components. Since the boat is traveling northwest, it is moving at a 45-degree angle with respect to the positive x-axis (East) and the positive y-axis (North).\n\nWe can use trigonometry to find the x and y components of the velocity vector. The x-component (Vx) is the velocity in the east-west direction, and the y-component (Vy) is the velocity in the north-south direction.\n\nVx = magnitude * cos(angle)\nVy = magnitude * sin(angle)\n\nSince the angle is 45 degrees, the cosine and sine of 45 degrees are both equal to √2/2.\n\nVx = 10 * (√2/2) = 5√2 m/s (westward)\nVy = 10 * (√2/2) = 5√2 m/s (northward)\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector is 10 m/s, as given in the problem. The direction of the velocity vector can be represented as the combination of the x and y components, which are both 5√2 m/s. Therefore, the velocity vector is:\n\n(5√2 m/s, 5√2 m/s) in the northwest direction."
