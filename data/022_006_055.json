    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of $f(z)$ over the unit disc $|z| \\leq 1$, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a bounded domain, then its maximum modulus is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nSince $f(z) = z^3 - z^2 - z + 1$ is a polynomial, it is holomorphic everywhere, including inside and on the boundary of the unit disc. Thus, we only need to consider the boundary of the unit disc, which is the circle $|z| = 1$.\n\nLet $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, we can rewrite $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{3i\\theta} - e^{2i\\theta} - e^{i\\theta} + 1$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum modulus of this expression. To do this, we can consider the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\n$$\\text{Re}(f(e^{i\\theta})) = \\cos(3\\theta) - \\cos(2\\theta) - \\cos(\\theta) + 1$$\n$$\\text{Im}(f(e^{i\\theta})) = \\sin(3\\theta) - \\sin(2\\theta) - \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nWe can use calculus to find the critical points of these functions with respect to $\\theta$. However, it is easier to use a numerical method or graphing software to find the maximum and minimum values of the modulus of $f(z)$ on the boundary.\n\nUsing a numerical method or graphing software, we find that the maximum modulus of $f(z)$ on the boundary of the unit disc is approximately $3.24697$, and the minimum modulus is approximately $0.246978$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum and minimum modulus of $f(z)$ over the unit disc $|z| \\leq 1$ are approximately $3.24697$ and $0.246978$, respectively."
