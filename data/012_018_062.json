    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to remove enough edges so that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect it.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 10 vertices and 18 edges. To find the edge connectivity, we can use the following formula:\n\nEdge Connectivity (Î») = min (degree(v)) for all vertices v in G\n\nwhere degree(v) is the number of edges connected to vertex v.\n\nSince we don't have the specific degrees of each vertex, we can use the average degree of the graph to get an upper bound on the edge connectivity. The average degree of a graph is given by:\n\nAverage Degree = (2 * Total Number of Edges) / Total Number of Vertices\n\nIn our case:\n\nAverage Degree = (2 * 18) / 10 = 36 / 10 = 3.6\n\nSince the average degree is 3.6, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the graph is at most 3.\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect the graph is 3. The edge connectivity of the graph is 3."
