    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, Product A and Product B. The factory wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal production quantities of both products. The selling prices of Product A and Product B are $30 and $50 per unit, respectively. The production cost of Product A and Product B are $20 and $30 per unit, respectively. The factory can produce a maximum of 500 units of Product A and 600 units of Product B per week. Use Harmony Search algorithm to determine the optimal quantities of Product A and Product B that the factory should produce per week to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this problem, we will use the HS algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of Product A and Product B to maximize the factory's profit.\n\nStep 1: Problem representation and objective function\nLet x1 be the quantity of Product A and x2 be the quantity of Product B. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = (Selling Price - Production Cost) * Quantity\nProfit = (30 - 20) * x1 + (50 - 30) * x2\nProfit = 10 * x1 + 20 * x2\n\nConstraints:\nx1 <= 500\nx2 <= 600\n\nStep 2: Initialize the HS algorithm parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): 10\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): 0.9\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): 0.3\n- Number of iterations: 1000\n\nStep 3: Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM)\nGenerate 10 random solutions (harmonies) within the constraints and store them in the HM.\n\nStep 4: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each decision variable (x1 and x2), generate a random number r1. If r1 < HMCR, select a value from the HM for that variable. Otherwise, generate a random value within the constraints.\n\nStep 5: Pitch adjustment\nFor each decision variable in the new harmony, generate a random number r2. If r2 < PAR, adjust the value by adding or subtracting a small random amount (e.g., 1% of the variable's range).\n\nStep 6: Update the Harmony Memory\nIf the new harmony's objective function value (profit) is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for the specified number of iterations (1000).\n\nStep 8: Obtain the best solution\nAfter completing the iterations, the best harmony in the HM represents the optimal production quantities for Product A and Product B.\n\nNote that the Harmony Search algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the solution may vary between runs. To increase the reliability of the solution, you can perform multiple runs and choose the best solution among them."
