    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)(6x - 1) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^2 + 3x\nv(x) = 6x - 1\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x)/dx = 4x + 3\nv'(x) = d(6x - 1)/dx = 6\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In other words:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we can plug in our expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (4x + 3)(6x - 1) + (2x^2 + 3x)(6)\n\nNow, we can distribute and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = (4x)(6x) + (4x)(-1) + (3)(6x) + (3)(-1) + (2x^2)(6) + (3x)(6)\nf'(x) = 24x^2 - 4x + 18x - 3 + 12x^2 + 18x\nf'(x) = 24x^2 + 12x^2 + (-4x + 18x + 18x) - 3\nf'(x) = 36x^2 + 32x - 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)(6x - 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = 36x^2 + 32x - 3"
