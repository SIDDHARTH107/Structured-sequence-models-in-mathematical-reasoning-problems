    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² + 5x - 3\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nSo, we have two x-intercepts:\n\nx₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\nx₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12 / 4 = -3\n\nThe x-intercepts are x = 1/2 and x = -3.\n\nNow, to find the vertex of the parabola, we can use the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nx_vertex = -5 / (2 * 2) = -5 / 4\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can plug it back into the original equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny_vertex = 2(-5/4)² + 5(-5/4) - 3\n\ny_vertex = 2(25/16) - (25/4) - 3\n\ny_vertex = (50/16) - (100/16) - (48/16)\n\ny_vertex = -98/16 = -49/8\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-5/4, -49/8)."
