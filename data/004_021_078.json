    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the object, we first need to find the velocity function, which is the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, and then find the acceleration function, which is the second derivative of the position function with respect to time.\n\nThe position function is given by:\n$s(t) = t^3 - 6t^2 + 9t + 2$\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative (velocity function):\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - 6t^2 + 9t + 2) = 3t^2 - 12t + 9$\n\nNow, we find the second derivative (acceleration function):\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(t^3 - 6t^2 + 9t + 2) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 12t + 9) = 6t - 12$\n\nFinally, we find the acceleration at time $t = 2$ seconds:\n$a(2) = 6(2) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0$\n\nThe acceleration of the object at time $t = 2$ seconds is 0."
