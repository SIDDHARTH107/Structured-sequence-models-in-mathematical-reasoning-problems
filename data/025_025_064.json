    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring in two variables, given by $R:=k\\{x,y\\}/(yx-xy-1)$, where $k$ is a field. Let $M:=R/(x-1,y-1)$ be an $R$-module. Find the Hilbert series of $M$, which is given by $H_M(t):=\\sum_{d\\ge 0} \\dim_k [M]_dt^d$, where $[M]_d$ denotes the degree-$d$ component of $M$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Hilbert series of $M$, we first need to understand the structure of $M$ as an $R$-module. Since $M = R/(x-1, y-1)$, we can think of $M$ as the quotient of the free $k$-module generated by monomials in $x$ and $y$ modulo the relations $x-1$ and $y-1$. \n\nLet's consider the degree-$d$ component $[M]_d$. In the free $k$-module generated by monomials in $x$ and $y$, the basis elements of degree $d$ are of the form $x^i y^j$ with $i+j=d$. However, we need to account for the relations $x-1$ and $y-1$. \n\nUsing the relation $yx-xy-1=0$, we can rewrite any monomial of the form $x^i y^j$ with $i \\geq 1$ and $j \\geq 1$ as a linear combination of monomials of lower degree in $x$ or $y$. Specifically, we have:\n\n$x^i y^j = x^{i-1} y^{j-1} (yx) = x^{i-1} y^{j-1} (xy + 1) = x^{i-1} y^j + x^{i-1} y^{j-1}$.\n\nBy repeatedly applying this identity, we can express any monomial $x^i y^j$ with $i, j \\geq 1$ as a linear combination of monomials of the form $x^i$ and $y^j$. Therefore, the basis elements of $[M]_d$ are of the form $x^i$ and $y^j$ with $i, j \\leq d$. \n\nNow, we need to account for the relations $x-1$ and $y-1$. Since $x-1$ and $y-1$ are in the ideal defining $M$, we have $x \\equiv 1$ and $y \\equiv 1$ in $M$. Therefore, any monomial of the form $x^i$ or $y^j$ with $i, j \\geq 1$ is equivalent to $1$ in $M$. This means that the only basis element of $[M]_d$ is $1$ for all $d \\geq 0$. \n\nThus, the Hilbert series of $M$ is given by:\n\n$H_M(t) = \\sum_{d \\geq 0} \\dim_k [M]_d t^d = \\sum_{d \\geq 0} 1 \\cdot t^d = \\frac{1}{1-t}$.\n\nSo, the Hilbert series of $M$ is $\\frac{1}{1-t}$."
