    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem into intervals of 5 seconds:\n\nAt time 5 seconds, 1 process is created (1 process running).\n\nAt time 10 seconds, 1 process is created and 1 process is terminated (1 - 1 = 0 processes running).\n\nAt time 15 seconds, 1 process is created (1 process running).\n\nAt time 20 seconds, 1 process is created and 1 process is terminated (1 - 1 = 0 processes running).\n\nAt time 25 seconds, 1 process is created (1 process running).\n\nAt time 30 seconds, 1 process is created and 1 process is terminated (1 - 1 = 0 processes running).\n\nSo, at time 30 seconds, there will be 0 processes running."
