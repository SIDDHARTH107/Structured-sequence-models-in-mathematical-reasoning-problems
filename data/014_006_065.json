    "message_1": "Suppose you want to send a secret message of length 10 characters using the One-time pad encryption method. You want to make sure that the message is completely secure, so each character of the message will be encrypted using a different key of length 10. \nIf you generate random keys for each character, what is the total number of possible keys that you can use for encrypting the message?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total number of possible keys, we need to consider the number of possible characters for each position in the key. Assuming we are using the standard ASCII character set, there are 128 possible characters (including letters, numbers, and special characters).\n\nSince each character in the key can be one of 128 possible characters, and the key is 10 characters long, the total number of possible keys for a single character in the message is 128^10.\n\nNow, since we are using a different key for each of the 10 characters in the message, we need to multiply the number of possible keys for a single character by itself 10 times:\n\nTotal number of possible keys = (128^10)^10 = 128^100\n\nSo, there are 128^100 possible keys that can be used for encrypting the 10-character message using the One-time pad encryption method."
