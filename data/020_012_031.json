    "message_1": "A company wants to produce cylindrical tanks with a volume of 25 cubic meters. The company has two options for the dimensions of the tank - they can either make the height 10 meters and the radius 1.58 meters, or they can make the height 5 meters and the radius 3.16 meters. The cost of material for the top and bottom of the tank is $30 per square meter, and the cost of material for the sides of the tank is $20 per square meter. Which option should the company choose in order to minimize their cost?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option is more cost-effective, we need to calculate the surface area of each tank and then multiply the respective areas by their material costs.\n\nOption 1: Height = 10 meters, Radius = 1.58 meters\nSurface area of top and bottom = 2 * π * r^2 = 2 * π * (1.58)^2 ≈ 15.73 square meters\nSurface area of the side = 2 * π * r * h = 2 * π * 1.58 * 10 ≈ 99.32 square meters\n\nCost of top and bottom = 15.73 * $30 = $471.90\nCost of side = 99.32 * $20 = $1986.40\nTotal cost for Option 1 = $471.90 + $1986.40 = $2458.30\n\nOption 2: Height = 5 meters, Radius = 3.16 meters\nSurface area of top and bottom = 2 * π * r^2 = 2 * π * (3.16)^2 ≈ 62.93 square meters\nSurface area of the side = 2 * π * r * h = 2 * π * 3.16 * 5 ≈ 99.32 square meters\n\nCost of top and bottom = 62.93 * $30 = $1887.90\nCost of side = 99.32 * $20 = $1986.40\nTotal cost for Option 2 = $1887.90 + $1986.40 = $3874.30\n\nComparing the total costs, Option 1 has a lower cost ($2458.30) than Option 2 ($3874.30). Therefore, the company should choose Option 1 (height = 10 meters, radius = 1.58 meters) to minimize their cost."
