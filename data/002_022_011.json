    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π² * R * r²\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (also known as the major radius), and r is the radius of the tube (also known as the minor radius).\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 8 cm and the inner radius is 4 cm. To find the major radius R, we can take the average of the outer and inner radii:\n\nR = (8 + 4) / 2 = 6 cm\n\nThe minor radius r is the difference between the outer and inner radii divided by 2:\n\nr = (8 - 4) / 2 = 2 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π² * 6 * 2²\nVolume = 2 * π² * 6 * 4\nVolume = 48 * π² cm³\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 48 * π² cm³ or approximately 1501.60 cm³."
