    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n[ 4  3  2 | 12 ]\n[ 6  5  3 | 20 ]\n[ 8  7  4 | 28 ]\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 4 to get a leading 1:\n\n[ 1  3/4  1/2 | 3 ]\n[ 6  5    3  | 20 ]\n[ 8  7    4  | 28 ]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 6*Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 8*Row1\n\n[ 1  3/4  1/2 | 3   ]\n[ 0  1/2  1/2 | 2   ]\n[ 0  1    0   | 4   ]\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 1/2 to get a leading 1:\n\n[ 1  3/4  1/2 | 3 ]\n[ 0  1    1   | 4 ]\n[ 0  1    0   | 4 ]\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - Row2\n\n[ 1  3/4  1/2 | 3 ]\n[ 0  1    1   | 4 ]\n[ 0  0   -1   | 0 ]\n\nStep 5: Solve for z:\n\n-1z = 0 => z = 0\n\nStep 6: Back-substitute to find y and x:\n\ny + z = 4 => y = 4\nx + 3/4y + 1/2z = 3 => x = 3 - 3/4(4) = 3 - 3 = 0\n\nSo, the solution is x = 0, y = 4, z = 0.\n\nNow, let's discuss the effect of the ill-conditioned matrix on the accuracy of the solution. The condition number of 625 indicates that the matrix is ill-conditioned, which means that the system of equations is sensitive to small changes in the input data. This can lead to large errors in the solution, even if the input data is only slightly perturbed.\n\nIn this case, the Gaussian elimination method was able to find a solution, but the accuracy of this solution might be questionable due to the ill-conditioning of the matrix. If there were small errors in the input data, the solution could be significantly different from the true solution. It is important to be cautious when interpreting the results of an ill-conditioned system, as the solution may not be reliable."
