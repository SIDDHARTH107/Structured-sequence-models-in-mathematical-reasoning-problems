    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$$\\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\mathbf{v} = 0$$\n\nFirst, let's compute the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$:\n\n$$\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = (-\\sin(t), \\cos(t), 2)$$\n\nNow, let's find the covariant derivative $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\mathbf{v}$. We can write $\\mathbf{v}$ as a function of $t$:\n\n$$\\mathbf{v}(t) = (v_1(t), v_2(t), v_3(t))$$\n\nThen, the covariant derivative is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\frac{dv_1}{dt} - \\Gamma^1_{ij}v^j\\gamma'^i, \\frac{dv_2}{dt} - \\Gamma^2_{ij}v^j\\gamma'^i, \\frac{dv_3}{dt} - \\Gamma^3_{ij}v^j\\gamma'^i\\right)$$\n\nHere, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind. However, since we are working in Euclidean space, the Christoffel symbols are all zero. Therefore, the covariant derivative simplifies to:\n\n$$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\frac{dv_1}{dt}, \\frac{dv_2}{dt}, \\frac{dv_3}{dt}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n$$\\frac{dv_1}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dv_2}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dv_3}{dt} = 0$$\n\nwith the initial conditions $v_1(0) = 1$, $v_2(0) = 2$, and $v_3(0) = 3$. The solutions to these ODEs are:\n\n$$v_1(t) = 1, \\quad v_2(t) = 2, \\quad v_3(t) = 3$$\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\\mathbf{v}(t) = (1, 2, 3)$$\n\nThis means that the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ remains constant along the curve $\\gamma(t)$."
