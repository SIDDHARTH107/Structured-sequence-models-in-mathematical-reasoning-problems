    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller tetrahedra from the initial larger tetrahedron. In each iteration, the number of removed tetrahedra is multiplied by 4. \n\nLet's denote the total number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of n iterations as T(n). For the base case, a Sierpinski pyramid of 0 iterations (a single tetrahedron) has 4 triangular faces, so T(0) = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the first iteration. The initial tetrahedron is divided into four smaller tetrahedra, and the central one is removed. The remaining three tetrahedra form a Sierpinski pyramid of 1 iteration, with each of the three tetrahedra contributing 4 triangular faces. Therefore, T(1) = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of triangular faces increases by a factor of 3, as each of the remaining tetrahedra from the previous iteration is replaced by three new ones. Thus, the total number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of six iterations can be calculated as follows:\n\nT(6) = T(0) * 3^6 = 4 * 3^6 = 4 * 729 = 2916\n\nSo, there are 2916 triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of six iterations."
