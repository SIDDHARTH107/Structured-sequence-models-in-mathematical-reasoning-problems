    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [3 - λ, -1; 4, 2 - λ]\n\nNow, we find the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (3 - λ)(2 - λ) - (-1)(4) = λ^2 - 5λ + 6 + 4 = λ^2 - 5λ + 10\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 10 = 0\n\nThis equation does not have rational roots, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the eigenvalues:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4 * 10)) / 2 = (5 ± √(25 - 40)) / 2 = (5 ± √(-15)) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √(-15))/2 and λ2 = (5 - √(-15))/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([3 - (5 + √(-15))/2, -1; 4, 2 - (5 + √(-15))/2])v1 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\n([(-1 - √(-15))/2, -1; 4, (-1 - √(-15))/2])v1 = 0\n\nLet v1 = [x; y]. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\n((-1 - √(-15))/2)x - y = 0\n4x + ((-1 - √(-15))/2)y = 0\n\nWe can solve this system to find the eigenvector v1:\n\nx = ((1 + √(-15))/2)y\n\nSo, v1 = [((1 + √(-15))/2)y; y] = y[(1 + √(-15))/2; 1], where y is a scalar.\n\nFor λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([3 - (5 - √(-15))/2, -1; 4, 2 - (5 - √(-15))/2])v2 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\n([(-1 + √(-15))/2, -1; 4, (-1 + √(-15))/2])v2 = 0\n\nLet v2 = [x; y]. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\n((-1 + √(-15))/2)x - y = 0\n4x + ((-1 + √(-15))/2)y = 0\n\nWe can solve this system to find the eigenvector v2:\n\nx = ((1 - √(-15))/2)y\n\nSo, v2 = [((1 - √(-15))/2)y; y] = y[(1 - √(-15))/2; 1], where y is a scalar.\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √(-15))/2 and λ2 = (5 - √(-15))/2, and the corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = y[(1 + √(-15))/2; 1] and v2 = y[(1 - √(-15))/2; 1], where y is a scalar."
