    "message_2": "There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 6:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_6: This group has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, where a^6 = 1. It is generated by a single element a, and every element has an order that divides 6.\n\n2. Dihedral group D_3 (also known as the symmetric group S_3): This group consists of the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, including rotations and reflections. It has elements {1, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r is a rotation by 120 degrees, s is a reflection, r^3 = 1, and s^2 = 1. The group is non-abelian, meaning that the group operation is not commutative (i.e., the order in which elements are combined matters).\n\nThese are the only two non-isomorphic groups of order 6, as any group of order 6 must either be cyclic (in which case it is isomorphic to C_6) or have a non-cyclic structure (in which case it is isomorphic to D_3)."
