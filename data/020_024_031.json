The cost function for producing the product is C(q) = 2000 + 4q. Find the price per unit that maximizes the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the price per unit that maximizes the company's profit, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function is given by the revenue function minus the cost function: P(q) = R(q) - C(q).\n\nThe revenue function is given by the price per unit times the quantity demanded: R(q) = pq. We can rewrite the demand function in terms of p: p = (500 - q)/10. So, R(q) = q(500 - q)/10.\n\nNow we have the profit function: P(q) = R(q) - C(q) = q(500 - q)/10 - (2000 + 4q).\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the derivative of P(q) with respect to q and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(q) = d/dq [q(500 - q)/10 - (2000 + 4q)] = (500 - 2q)/10 - 4.\n\nSetting P'(q) = 0, we get:\n\n(500 - 2q)/10 - 4 = 0.\n\nSolving for q:\n\n(500 - 2q)/10 = 4\n500 - 2q = 40\n2q = 460\nq = 230.\n\nNow we can find the price per unit that corresponds to this quantity demanded using the demand function:\n\np = (500 - q)/10 = (500 - 230)/10 = 270/10 = 27.\n\nSo, the price per unit that maximizes the company's profit is $27."
