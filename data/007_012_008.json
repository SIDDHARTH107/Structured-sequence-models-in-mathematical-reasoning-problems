We want to find the smallest n > 1 such that (n! - 1) is not congruent to -1 modulo n, or equivalently, n! is not congruent to 1 modulo n. \n\nWe can test some small values of n:\n\nFor n = 2, 2! = 2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), so n = 2 doesn't work.\n\nFor n = 3, 3! = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so n = 3 doesn't work.\n\nFor n = 4, 4! = 24 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so n = 4 doesn't work.\n\nFor n = 5, 5! = 120 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so n = 5 doesn't work.\n\nFor n = 6, 6! = 720 ≡ 0 (mod 6), so n = 6 works.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer greater than 1 for which the factorial of the integer minus one is not congruent to -1 modulo that integer is 6."
