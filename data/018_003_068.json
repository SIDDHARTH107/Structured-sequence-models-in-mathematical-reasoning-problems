    "message_2": "The union of set A and set B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all the elements of set A and set B, without any duplicates. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {3, 4, 5}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's check if the union is a superset of set A and set B individually. A set C is a superset of set A if every element of set A is also an element of set C. The same applies to set B.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nFor set A:\n1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor set B:\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of set A and set B is also an element of the union A ∪ B, we can conclude that the union A ∪ B is a superset of set A and set B individually."
