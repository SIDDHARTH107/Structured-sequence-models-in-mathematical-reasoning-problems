    "message_2": "To find the total number of critical points in this 2-dimensional Morse-Smale complex, we simply add the number of critical points for each index:\n\n- Index 0: 2 critical points\n- Index 1: 3 critical points\n- Index 2: 1 critical point\n\nTotal critical points = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 critical points.\n\nSo, we can expect 6 critical points for this Morse-Smale complex."
