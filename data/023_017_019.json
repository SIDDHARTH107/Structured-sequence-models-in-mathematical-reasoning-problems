    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the velocity potential function, we first need to determine the velocity potential function itself. For a plane wave propagating in a fluid, the velocity potential function (Φ) can be expressed as:\n\nΦ(x, t) = A * cos(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wavenumber, x is the position, t is the time, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nWe are given the frequency (f) and can find the angular frequency (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = 2 * π * f\n\nPlugging in the given frequency (f = 500 Hz):\n\nω = 2 * π * 500 = 1000 * π rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the wavenumber (k). We are given the wave velocity (u) and can use the formula:\n\nu = ω / k\n\nRearranging to solve for k:\n\nk = ω / u\n\nPlugging in the given wave velocity (u = 10 m/s) and the calculated angular frequency (ω = 1000 * π rad/s):\n\nk = (1000 * π) / 10 = 100 * π rad/m\n\nNow we have all the necessary information to write the velocity potential function:\n\nΦ(x, t) = 2 * cos(100 * π * x - 1000 * π * t)\n\nNext, we will find the Fourier transform of Φ(x, t) with respect to x. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nΦ(k', t) = ∫ Φ(x, t) * e^(-i * k' * x) dx\n\nPlugging in our expression for Φ(x, t):\n\nΦ(k', t) = ∫ 2 * cos(100 * π * x - 1000 * π * t) * e^(-i * k' * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\ncos(a) = (e^(ia) + e^(-ia)) / 2\n\nApplying this identity to our integral:\n\nΦ(k', t) = ∫ (e^(i * (100 * π * x - 1000 * π * t)) + e^(-i * (100 * π * x + 1000 * π * t))) * e^(-i * k' * x) dx\n\nNow, we can separate the integral into two parts:\n\nΦ(k', t) = ∫ e^(i * (100 * π * x - 1000 * π * t) - i * k' * x) dx + ∫ e^(-i * (100 * π * x + 1000 * π * t) - i * k' * x) dx\n\nBoth integrals are of the form:\n\n∫ e^(i * c * x) dx\n\nwhere c is a constant. The integral of this function is:\n\n(1/i * c) * e^(i * c * x)\n\nApplying this to both integrals and combining them back together:\n\nΦ(k', t) = (1 / i * (100 * π - k')) * e^(i * (100 * π - k') * x) + (1 / i * (-100 * π - k')) * e^(-i * (100 * π + k') * x)\n\nSince we are interested in the Fourier transform as a function of wavenumber k, we can write the final expression as:\n\nΦ(k', t) = (1 / i * (100 * π - k')) * e^(i * (100 * π - k') * x) + (1 / i * (-100 * π - k')) * e^(-i * (100 * π + k') * x)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the velocity potential function as a function of wavenumber k'."
