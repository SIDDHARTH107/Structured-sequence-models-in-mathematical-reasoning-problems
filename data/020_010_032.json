    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y, with a limited production capacity of 1200 units per day. The profit per unit of X is $10 and for Y is $8. However, the demand for these products is uncertain, and can vary between a low demand scenario of 800 units of X and 600 units of Y, and a high demand scenario of 1000 units of X and 1000 units of Y. The company wants to determine the optimal production plan that maximizes their expected profit, while ensuring that they meet the demands for both products in both demand scenarios. \n\nFormulate the problem as a robust optimization problem and solve it for the company.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this problem as a robust optimization problem, we will first define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nDecision variables:\nLet x be the number of units of product X produced per day.\nLet y be the number of units of product Y produced per day.\n\nObjective function:\nThe company wants to maximize their expected profit. The profit per unit of X is $10 and for Y is $8. So, the objective function is:\n\nMaximize P = 10x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. The total production capacity is limited to 1200 units per day:\nx + y ≤ 1200\n\n2. The company needs to meet the demands for both products in both demand scenarios:\n\nLow demand scenario:\nx ≥ 800 (at least 800 units of X)\ny ≥ 600 (at least 600 units of Y)\n\nHigh demand scenario:\nx ≥ 1000 (at least 1000 units of X)\ny ≥ 1000 (at least 1000 units of Y)\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow we have the robust optimization problem:\n\nMaximize P = 10x + 8y\nSubject to:\nx + y ≤ 1200\nx ≥ 800\ny ≥ 600\nx ≥ 1000\ny ≥ 1000\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem, we can analyze the constraints and determine the feasible region:\n\n1. Since x ≥ 1000 and y ≥ 1000, the low demand constraints (x ≥ 800 and y ≥ 600) are redundant and can be removed.\n\n2. The constraint x + y ≤ 1200 combined with x ≥ 1000 and y ≥ 1000 implies that the only feasible solution is x = 1000 and y = 1000, which is the high demand scenario.\n\nThus, the optimal production plan is to produce 1000 units of product X and 1000 units of product Y per day. The expected profit for this plan is:\n\nP = 10(1000) + 8(1000) = $18,000 per day."
