    "message_1": "Let f(z) = (z^3 - 8)/(z - 2) be a meromorphic function on the complex plane. Determine the number of poles and zeros of the function f(z) inside the disk centered at the origin of radius 3.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator becomes zero, i.e., z^3 - 8 = 0.\n\nz^3 = 8\nz = 2 (since 2^3 = 8)\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function f(z). A pole occurs when the denominator becomes zero, i.e., z - 2 = 0.\n\nz = 2\n\nNotice that the zero and the pole occur at the same point z = 2. This means that f(z) has a removable singularity at z = 2, and we can simplify the function by canceling out the common factor (z - 2) from the numerator and the denominator.\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - 8)/(z - 2) = (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4)/(z - 2)\n\nAfter canceling out the common factor, we get:\n\nf(z) = z^2 + 2z + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the zeros of this simplified function inside the disk centered at the origin of radius 3. To do this, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 4.\n\nz = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nz = (-2 ± √(-12)) / 2\nz = -1 ± i√3\n\nBoth zeros, -1 + i√3 and -1 - i√3, lie inside the disk centered at the origin of radius 3.\n\nSince the simplified function f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 4 has no poles, there are no poles inside the disk centered at the origin of radius 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) has 2 zeros and 0 poles inside the disk centered at the origin of radius 3."
