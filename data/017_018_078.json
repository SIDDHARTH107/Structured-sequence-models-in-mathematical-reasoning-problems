    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we will use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 32 = 2^5, we are looking for groups with a 2-Sylow subgroup of order 32.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide the index of the 2-Sylow subgroup, which is 1 in this case. Thus, there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, and it must be normal. This means that the group is a semi-direct product of its 2-Sylow subgroup and a group of order 1. Since there is only one group of order 1 (the trivial group), we only need to consider the structure of the 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\nA group of order 2^5 has a composition series with factors isomorphic to either Z_2 or Z_4. There are five possible cases for the composition factors:\n\n1. Five factors of Z_2: This corresponds to the elementary abelian group of order 32, which is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n\n2. One factor of Z_4 and three factors of Z_2: There are two possibilities for the group structure in this case: Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 and Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2. The first one is an abelian group, while the second one is non-abelian.\n\n3. Two factors of Z_4 and one factor of Z_2: This corresponds to the group Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2, which is abelian.\n\n4. Three factors of Z_4: This corresponds to the group Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_4, which is abelian.\n\n5. One factor of Z_8 and one factor of Z_2: This corresponds to the group Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2, which is non-abelian.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 32:\n\n1. Z_32 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 (elementary abelian group)\n3. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2 (abelian group)\n4. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_4 (abelian group)\n5. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2 (non-abelian group)\n\nNow, let's identify which of these groups are isomorphic to the given groups:\n\n- The cyclic group C32 is isomorphic to Z_32.\n- The dihedral group D16 is not isomorphic to any of the groups listed above, as it has order 2 * 16 = 32 and is non-abelian, but its structure is different from the non-abelian group Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n- None of the six non-abelian groups of order 32 are listed above, as there is only one non-abelian group in the list (Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2), and it is not isomorphic to any of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
