    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that fills a unit square. With each iteration (order), the curve becomes more complex and covers more area of the square. The length of the curve increases with each order.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n, the length of the curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * (1 / 2^(n-1))\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, we can plug in the value of n into the formula:\n\nLength = (2^3 - 1) * (1 / 2^(3-1))\nLength = (8 - 1) * (1 / 4)\nLength = 7 * (1 / 4)\nLength = 7 / 4\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve of order 3 when constructed on a unit square is 7/4 or 1.75 units."
