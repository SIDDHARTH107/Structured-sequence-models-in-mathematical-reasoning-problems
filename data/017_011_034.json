    "message_2": "To prove that a group with 12 elements is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will first analyze the possible structures of a group with 12 elements and then show that each structure corresponds to one of the three mentioned groups.\n\nLet G be a group with 12 elements. The order of G is 12, which has prime divisors 2 and 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. Let n_2 and n_3 denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 12 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\n3. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Let P_2 and P_3 be these subgroups, with orders 4 and 3, respectively. Since both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, their product P_2P_3 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are relatively prime, we have |P_2P_3| = |P_2| * |P_3| = 12. Thus, P_2P_3 = G, and G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3. This means G is a cyclic group of order 12, and G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3, with order 3. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can consider the quotient group G/P_3. The order of G/P_3 is 12/3 = 4, which is a power of 2. Thus, G/P_3 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If G/P_3 is isomorphic to C4, then G has a normal subgroup of order 4, which contradicts the assumption that n_2 = 3. Therefore, G/P_3 must be isomorphic to V4. In this case, G is an extension of V4 by P_3, and it can be shown that G is isomorphic to A4, the alternating group on 4 elements.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, say P_2, with order 4. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can consider the quotient group G/P_2. The order of G/P_2 is 12/4 = 3, which is a power of 3. Thus, G/P_2 is isomorphic to C3. In this case, G is an extension of C3 by P_2, and it can be shown that G is isomorphic to D6, the dihedral group of order 12.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group with 12 elements must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6."
