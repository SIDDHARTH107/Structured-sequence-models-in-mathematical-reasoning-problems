    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to meet the demand of all stores from all warehouses, we can use the transportation algorithm. The transportation algorithm is an optimization technique used to find the most cost-effective way to transport goods from a number of sources to a number of destinations.\n\nStep 1: Check if the problem is balanced.\nTotal supply = 100 + 180 + 220 + 140 = 640\nTotal demand = 150 + 170 + 180 + 120 = 620\n\nSince the total supply is greater than the total demand, we need to add a dummy store with a demand of 20 to balance the problem.\n\n|     | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Dummy | Demand |\n| --- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |\n| W1  | 6       | 11      | 8       | 10      | 6       | 6       | 0     | 100    |\n| W2  | 12      | 7       | 6       | 7       | 5       | 10      | 0     | 180    |\n| W3  | 8       | 7       | 9       | 7       | 16      | 4       | 0     | 220    |\n| W4  | 5       | 8       | 5       | 9       | 11      | 4       | 0     | 140    |\n| Supply | 150    | 170     | 180     | 120     |         |         | 20    |        |\n\nStep 2: Find the initial feasible solution.\nWe can use the northwest corner method to find the initial feasible solution.\n\n1. Start at the top-left corner (W1, Store 1). Allocate the minimum of supply and demand, which is min(100, 150) = 100. Update the supply and demand.\n2. Move to the next cell in the same row (W1, Store 2). Since the supply of W1 is now 0, move to the next row (W2, Store 2). Allocate min(180, 170) = 170. Update the supply and demand.\n3. Move to the next cell in the same row (W2, Store 3). Allocate min(10, 180) = 10. Update the supply and demand.\n4. Move to the next row (W3, Store 3). Allocate min(220, 170) = 170. Update the supply and demand.\n5. Move to the next cell in the same row (W3, Store 4). Allocate min(50, 120) = 50. Update the supply and demand.\n6. Move to the next row (W4, Store 4). Allocate min(140, 70) = 70. Update the supply and demand.\n7. Move to the next cell in the same row (W4, Store 5). Allocate min(70, 0) = 0. Since the demand of Store 5 is already met, move to the next cell (W4, Store 6). Allocate min(70, 0) = 0. Since the demand of Store 6 is already met, move to the next cell (W4, Dummy). Allocate min(70, 20) = 20. Update the supply and demand.\n\nThe initial feasible solution is:\n\n|     | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Dummy |\n| --- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |\n| W1  | 100     | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0     |\n| W2  | 0       | 170     | 10      | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0     |\n| W3  | 0       | 0       | 170     | 50      | 0       | 0       | 0     |\n| W4  | 0       | 0       | 0       | 70      | 0       | 0       | 20    |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost.\nTotal cost = (100 * 6) + (170 * 7) + (10 * 6) + (170 * 9) + (50 * 7) + (70 * 9) = 600 + 1190 + 60 + 1530 + 350 + 630 = 4360\n\nThe minimum cost to meet the demand of all stores from all warehouses is 4360."
