    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 players in a Beauty Contest game, and each player is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the contest will be the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers chosen by the players. \n\nWhat number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning the contest?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning the contest, each player should try to predict what the other players will choose and then choose a number that is 2/3 of the predicted average.\n\nLet's assume that all players think rationally and believe that the other players will choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. In this case, the average of the chosen numbers would be 50. Then, each player should choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think one step ahead and believe that the other players will choose 33.33, then the new predicted average would be 33.33, and each player should choose 2/3 * 33.33 â‰ˆ 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, and each time the players update their predictions, the chosen number will get closer to 0. In practice, the best strategy would be to choose a number slightly below the result of the last iteration, as most players will not iterate the process indefinitely.\n\nIn summary, there is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on the level of rationality and the number of iterations the players are willing to perform. However, choosing a number around 22.22 could be a reasonable strategy to maximize the chances of winning the contest."
