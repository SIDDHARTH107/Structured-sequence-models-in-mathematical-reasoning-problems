    "message_1": "A motorcycle travels along a straight line with a velocity given by the function $v(t) = 6t - 2t^2$, where $t$ is the time in seconds. What is the acceleration of the motorcycle after 2 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the motorcycle, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time. The velocity function is given by $v(t) = 6t - 2t^2$. \n\nTaking the derivative with respect to time, we get:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t - 2t^2) = 6 - 4t$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration after 2 seconds. Plug in $t=2$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 6 - 4(2) = 6 - 8 = -2$\n\nThe acceleration of the motorcycle after 2 seconds is -2 m/sÂ²."
