    "message_1": "A standard deck of 52 cards contains 4 aces (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). What is the probability of drawing an ace from the deck on the first draw?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of drawing an ace from the deck on the first draw, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of aces in the deck, which is 4. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cards in the deck, which is 52.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is:\n\nProbability = 4 / 52\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 1 / 13\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is 1/13 or approximately 0.0769, or 7.69%."
