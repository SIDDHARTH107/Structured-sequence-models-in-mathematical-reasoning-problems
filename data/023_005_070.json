    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit, and k is the frequency variable. The Fourier transform of the second derivative y''(x) is given by:\n\nF{y''(x)} = (ik)^2 * Y(k)\n\nSimilarly, the Fourier transform of the first derivative y'(x) is given by:\n\nF{y'(x)} = ik * Y(k)\n\nNow, we can take the Fourier transform of the entire differential equation:\n\n(ik)^2 * Y(k) + 4(ik) * Y(k) + 4 * Y(k) = F{cos(2x)}\n\nThe Fourier transform of cos(2x) is given by:\n\nF{cos(2x)} = π[δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2)]\n\nwhere δ(k) is the Dirac delta function. Now, we can substitute the Fourier transforms into the differential equation:\n\nY(k) * [-(k^2) - 4ik + 4] = π[δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2)]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(k):\n\nY(k) = π[δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2)] / [-(k^2) - 4ik + 4]\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Fourier transform to find the solution y(x):\n\ny(x) = F^(-1){π[δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2)] / [-(k^2) - 4ik + 4]}\n\nTo find the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 2, we can use the convolution theorem. The convolution theorem states that the inverse Fourier transform of a product of two functions is equal to the convolution of the inverse Fourier transforms of the individual functions:\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[F^(-1){δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2)} * F^(-1){π / [-(k^2) - 4ik + 4]}] dk\n\nLet g(x) = F^(-1){δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2)}. Then, the initial conditions can be written as:\n\ng(0) = 0\ng'(0) = 2\n\nNow, we can find the particular solution y(x) that satisfies the initial conditions:\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[g(k) * F^(-1){π / [-(k^2) - 4ik + 4]}] dk\n\nUnfortunately, finding an explicit expression for y(x) in terms of elementary functions is not possible in this case. However, this integral representation of the solution can be used for numerical computations and approximations."
