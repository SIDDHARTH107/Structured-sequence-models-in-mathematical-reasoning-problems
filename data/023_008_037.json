    "message_2": "Given the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 with period 2, we can find the Fourier coefficients by computing the Fourier series. The Fourier series for a function with period 2L (in this case, L = 1) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nTo find the coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from -L to L\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\n\nFor our function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 with L = 1, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[(x^2 - 2x + 1) dx] from -1 to 1\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x^2 - 2x + 1) * cos(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x^2 - 2x + 1) * sin(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nCalculating the integrals, we get:\n\na_0 = [x^3/3 - x^2 + x] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - 1 + 1) - (-1/3 - 1 - 1) = 2/3\na_n = ∫[(x^2 - 2x + 1) * cos(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1 = (2/(n^2π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n) (for n ≠ 0)\nb_n = ∫[(x^2 - 2x + 1) * sin(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1 = 0 (since f(x) is an even function)\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients are:\n\na_0 = 2/3\na_n = (2/(n^2π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n) for n ≠ 0\nb_n = 0\n\nAnd the Fourier series for f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 2/3 + Σ[(2/(n^2π^2)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(nπx)] for n = 1 to infinity"
