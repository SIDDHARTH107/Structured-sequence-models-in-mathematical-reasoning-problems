    "message_2": "The given function is already in the sum of sines form, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the amplitudes and frequencies of the sine waves that make up the signal.\n\nThe function is given by:\n\n$f(x) = \\sin(10x) + \\sin(20x)$\n\nHere, we can see that there are two sine waves with the following amplitudes and frequencies:\n\n1. Amplitude: 1, Frequency: 10\n2. Amplitude: 1, Frequency: 20\n\nSo, the signal is composed of two sine waves with amplitudes of 1 and frequencies of 10 and 20."
