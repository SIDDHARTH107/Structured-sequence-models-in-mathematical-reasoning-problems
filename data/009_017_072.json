    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\n∮ B * dl = μ₀ * I\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field (B) is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. Therefore, we can choose a circular loop of radius r (2 cm in this case) as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is constant along this path, so we can write:\n\nB * ∮ dl = μ₀ * I\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular path, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nWe are given the current (I) as 10 A and the distance (r) as 2 cm (0.02 m). The permeability of free space (μ₀) is a constant with a value of 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 10 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) T·m/A * 10 A) / (2 * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-6) T·m) / 0.04 m\n\nB = 1 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 2 cm from the center of the wire is 1 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
