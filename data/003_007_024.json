    "message_1": "A triangle has sides of length 12, 17, and x. If the angle opposite the side of length 12 is 35 degrees, what is the length of x using the law of cosines?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side x. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 12, b = 17, and C = 35 degrees. We want to find the length of side x, which we'll call c. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC = 35 * (π / 180) ≈ 0.610865 radians\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nx² = 12² + 17² - 2 * 12 * 17 * cos(0.610865)\n\nx² = 144 + 289 - 408 * cos(0.610865)\n\nx² ≈ 433 - 408 * 0.819152\n\nx² ≈ 433 - 334.097\n\nx² ≈ 98.903\n\nNow we take the square root of both sides to find the length of x:\n\nx ≈ √98.903\n\nx ≈ 9.945\n\nSo, the length of side x is approximately 9.945."
