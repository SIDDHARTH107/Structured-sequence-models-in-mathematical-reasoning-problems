According to the theorem, if a function is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed contour in that domain is zero.\n\nFirst, we need to check if f(z) is analytic in the given domain. The function f(z) is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in the domain. The function f(z) has singularities at z = -2 and z = -1-i. Since both of these singularities are outside the square, f(z) is analytic in the given domain.\n\nNow, since f(z) is analytic in the domain, we can apply Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of f(z) over the closed contour is zero.\n\nTherefore, the integral of f(z) = z^3 / (z+2)^2 * (z+1+i) along the boundary of the square with vertices at (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,1), and (-1,-1) in the counterclockwise direction is 0."
