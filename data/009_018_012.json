    "message_2": "To find the periodic solutions of the given nonlinear differential equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Let's assume a solution of the form:\n\ny(t) = A sin(t) + B cos(t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined. Now, we need to find the first and second derivatives of y(t) with respect to t:\n\ny'(t) = A cos(t) - B sin(t)\ny''(t) = -A sin(t) - B cos(t)\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives into the given differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + sin(y(t)) = 0\n-A sin(t) - B cos(t) + sin(A sin(t) + B cos(t)) = 0\n\nSince we are looking for a periodic solution with a period of 4π, we can set the following boundary conditions:\n\ny(0) = y(4π)\ny'(0) = y'(4π)\n\nNow, let's evaluate y(t) and y'(t) at t = 0 and t = 4π:\n\ny(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B\ny'(0) = A cos(0) - B sin(0) = A\n\ny(4π) = A sin(4π) + B cos(4π) = B\ny'(4π) = A cos(4π) - B sin(4π) = A\n\nFrom the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nA = A\nB = B\n\nThese conditions do not provide any additional information about the constants A and B. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values of A and B for the periodic solution with a period of 4π. However, we can still express the general form of the periodic solution as:\n\ny(t) = A sin(t) + B cos(t)\n\nThis general form represents the family of periodic solutions with a period of 4π for the given nonlinear differential equation."
