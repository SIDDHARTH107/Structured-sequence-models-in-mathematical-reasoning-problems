    "message_1": "A possible numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the chaotic dynamics of the forced van der Pol oscillator could be:\n\nSuppose a van der Pol oscillator is forced by a sinusoidal signal of amplitude 0.3 and frequency 2π/5, with natural frequency ω0 = 1 and damping parameter ε = 0.1. Use numerical methods to determine the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the system over a time horizon of T = 100 s, assuming initial conditions x(0) = 0.2 and y(0) = 0.1, where x(t) and y(t) are the position and velocity (normalized by √εω0) of the oscillator at time t. Round the result to three decimal places.",

Find the maximum Lyapunov exponent.\n\nStep 1: Equations of motion for the forced van der Pol oscillator\n\nThe equations of motion for the forced van der Pol oscillator are given by:\n\ndx/dt = y\ndy/dt = ε(1 - x^2)y - x + A*sin(ω*t)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the forcing signal, ω is the frequency of the forcing signal, ε is the damping parameter, and x(t) and y(t) are the position and velocity of the oscillator at time t.\n\nStep 2: Discretize the equations of motion using the Runge-Kutta method\n\nWe will use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to discretize the equations of motion. The method involves updating the position and velocity at each time step using the following equations:\n\nk1_x = h * y\nk1_y = h * (ε(1 - x^2)y - x + A*sin(ω*t))\n\nk2_x = h * (y + 0.5 * k1_y)\nk2_y = h * (ε(1 - (x + 0.5 * k1_x)^2)(y + 0.5 * k1_y) - (x + 0.5 * k1_x) + A*sin(ω*(t + 0.5 * h)))\n\nk3_x = h * (y + 0.5 * k2_y)\nk3_y = h * (ε(1 - (x + 0.5 * k2_x)^2)(y + 0.5 * k2_y) - (x + 0.5 * k2_x) + A*sin(ω*(t + 0.5 * h)))\n\nk4_x = h * (y + k3_y)\nk4_y = h * (ε(1 - (x + k3_x)^2)(y + k3_y) - (x + k3_x) + A*sin(ω*(t + h)))\n\nx_new = x + (k1_x + 2 * k2_x + 2 * k3_x + k4_x) / 6\ny_new = y + (k1_y + 2 * k2_y + 2 * k3_y + k4_y) / 6\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Jacobian matrix of the discretized system\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J of the discretized system is given by:\n\nJ = [[∂x_new/∂x, ∂x_new/∂y],\n     [∂y_new/∂x, ∂y_new/∂y]]\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Lyapunov exponents using the Jacobian matrix and the initial conditions\n\nThe Lyapunov exponents are calculated by iterating the system over the time horizon T and updating the Jacobian matrix at each time step. The maximum Lyapunov exponent is given by the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix.\n\nStep 5: Find the maximum Lyapunov exponent\n\nAfter iterating the system over the time horizon T and updating the Jacobian matrix at each time step, the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be found by taking the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix and dividing it by the total time T.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a programming language like Python to implement the above steps and find the maximum Lyapunov exponent. The final result should be rounded to three decimal places."
