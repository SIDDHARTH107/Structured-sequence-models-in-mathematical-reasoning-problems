    "message_2": "The perimeter of a Koch snowflake after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (1/3)^n\n\nFor the 4th iteration, the formula becomes:\n\nPerimeter = 10 * (4^4) * (1/3)^4\n\nPerimeter = 10 * 256 * (1/81)\n\nPerimeter = 2560/81\n\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 31.60 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 4th iteration with an original side length of 10 cm is approximately 31.60 cm."
