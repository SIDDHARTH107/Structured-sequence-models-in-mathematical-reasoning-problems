Use the Schwarz Reflection Principle to find the value of $\\int_C f(z) dz$.\n\nEnter the solution to this problem to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first note that the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}$ has simple poles at $z = 1$ and $z = -1$. Since the contour $C$ is the circle $|z| = 2$, it encloses both poles. \n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the value of the integral. The residue theorem states that for a function with isolated singularities inside a simple closed contour, the integral of the function around the contour is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of the function at the singularities.\n\nThe residues of $f(z)$ at $z = 1$ and $z = -1$ can be found using the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), z_0) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)$$\n\nFor $z_0 = 1$:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = \\lim_{z \\to 1} (z - 1) \\frac{1}{z^2 - 1} = \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\frac{1}{2z} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nFor $z_0 = -1$:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), -1) = \\lim_{z \\to -1} (z + 1) \\frac{1}{z^2 - 1} = \\lim_{z \\to -1} \\frac{-1}{2z} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the value of the integral:\n\n$$\\int_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2\\pi i$$\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the solution to two decimal places, which means we need to find the numerical value of the integral. Since the integral is purely imaginary, its numerical value is simply the imaginary part:\n\n$$\\text{Im}(2\\pi i) = 2\\pi \\approx 6.28$$\n\nSo, the value of the integral is approximately $6.28$."
