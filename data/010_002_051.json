    "message_2": "To determine if the function f(x) = |x| is continuous, we need to check if it satisfies the definition of continuity for all x in the domain X (set of all real numbers).\n\nA function is continuous at a point x=a if the following three conditions are met:\n\n1. f(a) is defined.\n2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a exists.\n3. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is equal to f(a).\n\nLet's check these conditions for f(x) = |x|.\n\n1. f(a) is defined: Since the absolute value function is defined for all real numbers, f(a) is defined for all a in X.\n\n2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a exists: The absolute value function can be split into two cases:\n\n   a) x ≥ 0: In this case, f(x) = x, and the limit as x approaches a is a.\n   b) x < 0: In this case, f(x) = -x, and the limit as x approaches a is -a.\n\nSince the limit exists for both cases, the limit of f(x) as x approaches a exists.\n\n3. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is equal to f(a): As we found in step 2, the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is a for x ≥ 0 and -a for x < 0. Since f(a) = |a|, we have:\n\n   a) a ≥ 0: f(a) = a, which is equal to the limit as x approaches a.\n   b) a < 0: f(a) = -a, which is equal to the limit as x approaches a.\n\nSince the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is equal to f(a) for all a in X, the function f(x) = |x| is continuous for all x in the domain X (set of all real numbers)."
