    "message_2": "To find the smallest non-trivial factor of the number 2049041 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n2. Choose a random starting point x_0.\n3. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of numbers: x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ...\n4. At each step, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between the current and previous numbers and the given number (2049041).\n5. If the GCD is greater than 1 and less than the given number, it is a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's choose x_0 = 2 and use f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\n1. x_1 = f(x_0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n   GCD(5 - 2, 2049041) = GCD(3, 2049041) = 1\n\n2. x_2 = f(x_1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n   GCD(26 - 5, 2049041) = GCD(21, 2049041) = 1\n\n3. x_3 = f(x_2) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n   GCD(677 - 26, 2049041) = GCD(651, 2049041) = 1\n\n4. x_4 = f(x_3) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330\n   GCD(458330 - 677, 2049041) = GCD(457653, 2049041) = 1\n\n5. x_5 = f(x_4) = 458330^2 + 1 = 1311041 (mod 2049041)\n   GCD(1311041 - 458330, 2049041) = GCD(852711, 2049041) = 97\n\nThe smallest non-trivial factor of 2049041 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 97."
