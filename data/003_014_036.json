    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the given sine function y = 2sin(3x), we need to compare it to the general form of a sine function, which is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, the given function is y = 2sin(3x). Comparing it to the general form, we can see that:\n\nA = 2 (amplitude)\nB = 3\nC = 0 (phase shift)\nD = 0 (vertical shift)\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude, period, and phase shift:\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is the coefficient of the sine function. In our case, A = 2, so the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In our case, B = 3, so the period is (2π)/|3| = (2π)/3.\n\n3. Phase Shift (C): The phase shift is given by the value of C, which is the horizontal shift of the function. In our case, C = 0, so there is no phase shift.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, and there is no phase shift."
