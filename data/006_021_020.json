    "message_1": "A state has experienced snow on Christmas Day for 9 of the past 20 years. What is the probability that it will snow on Christmas Day this year, given that it has snowed on Christmas Day the past 3 years in a row?",
    "message_2": "Based on the given information, we can calculate the probability of snow on Christmas Day as follows:\n\nSince it has snowed on Christmas Day for 9 of the past 20 years, the overall probability of snow on Christmas Day is:\n\nP(Snow) = (Number of years with snow) / (Total number of years) = 9/20 = 0.45 or 45%\n\nHowever, we are given additional information that it has snowed on Christmas Day for the past 3 years in a row. We don't have enough information to determine if there's a pattern or trend in the snowfall, so we cannot directly use this information to adjust the probability.\n\nIn this case, the best estimate we can make is to use the overall probability of snow on Christmas Day, which is 0.45 or 45%."
