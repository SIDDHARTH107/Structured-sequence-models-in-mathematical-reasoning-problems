Let's first find A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) x {6}:\n\n(A x B) x {6} = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nNext, let's find B x {6}:\n\nB x {6} = {(4, 6), (5, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find (B x {6}) x A:\n\n(B x {6}) x A = {((4, 6), 1), ((4, 6), 2), ((4, 6), 3), ((5, 6), 1), ((5, 6), 2), ((5, 6), 3)}\n\nFinally, let's find A x (B x {6}):\n\nA x (B x {6}) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow, let's verify if the Cartesian product of two sets is associative. For the Cartesian product to be associative, we need to show that (A x B) x {6} = A x (B x {6}). \n\n(A x B) x {6} = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\nA x (B x {6}) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nWe can see that (A x B) x {6} â‰  A x (B x {6}). Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative."
