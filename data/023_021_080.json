    "message_2": "To find the electric field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the wire, we need to first find the total current flowing through the wire and then use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field around the wire. Finally, we can use Faraday's Law to find the electric field.\n\n1. Find the total current flowing through the wire:\n\nThe current density (J) is given as 5 A/cm². We need to find the total current (I) flowing through the wire.\n\nThe cross-sectional area (A) of the wire can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr², where r is the radius of the wire.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 mm = 0.5 cm, we can calculate the area:\n\nA = π(0.5)² = 0.25π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the total current (I) using the current density (J) and the area (A):\n\nI = J × A = 5 A/cm² × 0.25π cm² = 1.25π A ≈ 3.93 A\n\n2. Use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field (B) around the wire:\n\nAmpere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying conductor is equal to μ₀ times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a cylindrical wire, the magnetic field (B) is in the azimuthal direction and is constant along a circle of radius R (10 cm in this case) centered at the wire. Therefore, the line integral becomes:\n\nB × 2πR = μ₀I\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀I) / (2πR)\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the total current (3.93 A), and R is the distance from the center of the wire (10 cm = 0.1 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 3.93 A) / (2π × 0.1 m) ≈ 2.48 × 10^(-6) T\n\n3. Use Faraday's Law to find the electric field (E):\n\nSince the wire is in a steady state, the electric field (E) is related to the magnetic field (B) through Faraday's Law:\n\nE = -d(B⋅A)/dt\n\nIn this case, the magnetic field (B) is constant, so the time derivative is zero, and the electric field (E) is also zero:\n\nE = 0 V/m\n\nSo, the electric field at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the wire is 0 V/m."
