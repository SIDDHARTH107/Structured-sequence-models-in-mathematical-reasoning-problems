    "message_1": "An industrial machine produces nails, and the weight of each nail is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 5 grams and a standard deviation of 0.1 grams. A sample of 30 nails is taken from the machine.\n\nWhat is the probability that the sample mean weight of the nails is less than 4.8 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 30, which is large enough to apply the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nThe mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the population are given as 5 grams and 0.1 grams, respectively. We want to find the probability that the sample mean weight (x̄) is less than 4.8 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_x̄ = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ_x̄ is the standard deviation of the sample mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nσ_x̄ = 0.1 / √30 ≈ 0.0182\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean weight of 4.8 grams. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σ_x̄\n\nz = (4.8 - 5) / 0.0182 ≈ -10.989\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -10.989. This value is extremely low, and the probability of obtaining a z-score less than -10.989 is practically 0. In other words, it is highly unlikely that the sample mean weight of the nails will be less than 4.8 grams."
