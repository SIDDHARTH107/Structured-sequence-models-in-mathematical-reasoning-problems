    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to transport 600 units of product from their factory to three different warehouses using a network of roads. The first warehouse requires 200 units, the second requires 250 units, and the third requires 150 units. Each road has a certain capacity and the maximum units that can be transported on that road is as follows: \n- From the factory to warehouse 1: 150 units\n- From the factory to warehouse 2: 200 units\n- From the factory to warehouse 3: 250 units\n- From warehouse 1 to warehouse 2: 100 units\n- From warehouse 1 to warehouse 3: 50 units\n- From warehouse 2 to warehouse 1: 70 units\n- From warehouse 2 to warehouse 3: 130 units\n- From warehouse 3 to warehouse 1: 30 units\n- From warehouse 3 to warehouse 2: 90 units\n\nWhat is the maximum number of units that can be transported from the factory to the warehouses, given these capacity constraints?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of units transported from the factory to the warehouses, we need to find the optimal distribution of units across the roads. Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. From the factory to warehouse 1, we can transport 150 units.\n2. From the factory to warehouse 2, we can transport 200 units.\n3. From the factory to warehouse 3, we can transport 250 units.\n\nNow, let's see how we can distribute the remaining units to the warehouses:\n\n1. From warehouse 1 (150 units) to warehouse 2, we can transport 100 units.\n2. From warehouse 1 (50 units left) to warehouse 3, we can transport 50 units.\n3. From warehouse 2 (300 units) to warehouse 1, we can transport 70 units.\n4. From warehouse 2 (230 units left) to warehouse 3, we can transport 130 units.\n5. From warehouse 3 (300 units) to warehouse 1, we can transport 30 units.\n6. From warehouse 3 (270 units left) to warehouse 2, we can transport 90 units.\n\nNow, let's sum up the units in each warehouse:\n\n1. Warehouse 1: 150 (from factory) + 70 (from warehouse 2) + 30 (from warehouse 3) = 250 units\n2. Warehouse 2: 200 (from factory) + 100 (from warehouse 1) + 90 (from warehouse 3) = 390 units\n3. Warehouse 3: 250 (from factory) + 50 (from warehouse 1) + 130 (from warehouse 2) = 430 units\n\nHowever, we need to consider the required units for each warehouse:\n\n1. Warehouse 1 requires 200 units, so we need to transfer 50 units from warehouse 1 to warehouse 2 (since warehouse 1 has 250 units and only needs 200 units).\n2. Warehouse 2 requires 250 units, so it will have exactly the required amount after receiving the 50 units from warehouse 1.\n3. Warehouse 3 requires 150 units, so it has an excess of 280 units (430 units - 150 units).\n\nSo, the maximum number of units that can be transported from the factory to the warehouses, given these capacity constraints, is:\n\n200 units (warehouse 1) + 250 units (warehouse 2) + 150 units (warehouse 3) = 600 units."
