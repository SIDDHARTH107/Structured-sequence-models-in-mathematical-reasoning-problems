    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher structure comprised of four rounds. Each round uses a 32-bit block and a 48-bit key to produce an output. If the plaintext consists of a single 32-bit block and the key consists of a single 64-bit block, what is the size of the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "A Feistel cipher structure works on the principle of dividing the plaintext into two equal halves and then applying a series of rounds to transform the data. In this case, the plaintext is a single 32-bit block, so it will be divided into two 16-bit halves.\n\nSince there are four rounds in this Feistel cipher, each round will use a 32-bit block (the two 16-bit halves combined) and a 48-bit key to produce an output. However, the size of the data being processed in each round remains the same, i.e., 32 bits.\n\nAfter the final round, the two 16-bit halves are combined to form the final 32-bit ciphertext block. Therefore, the size of the resulting ciphertext is 32 bits."
