    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, it is a bijective function that maps the graph onto itself such that the edge set remains unchanged. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, and its size is the number of distinct automorphisms.\n\nTo find the size of the automorphism group of G, we need to find all possible ways to permute the vertices such that the adjacency relations are preserved.\n\n1. The identity automorphism: This is the trivial automorphism where each vertex is mapped to itself. It always exists for any graph.\n\n```\n   1 --- 2\n   |     |\n   3 --- 4\n   |\\   /|\n   | \\ / |\n   |  5  |\n   | / \\ |\n   |/   \\|\n   6     7\n```\n\n2. Rotation by 120 degrees clockwise: This automorphism maps vertex 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 1, 2 to 4, 4 to 7, and 7 to 2, while keeping 5 fixed.\n\n```\n   3 --- 1\n   |     |\n   6 --- 2\n   |\\   /|\n   | \\ / |\n   |  5  |\n   | / \\ |\n   |/   \\|\n   4     7\n```\n\n3.
