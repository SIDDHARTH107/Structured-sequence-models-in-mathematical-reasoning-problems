    "message_1": "In a magic show, the magician has a deck of 52 cards. Out of these cards, 10 cards are marked as \"lucky cards\" that bring good fortunes to the audience if they are picked. If the magician randomly picks 5 cards from the deck to perform his trick, what is the probability that at least one of the lucky cards will be chosen? Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one lucky card being chosen, we can find the probability of not choosing any lucky cards and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are 42 non-lucky cards in the deck (52 - 10). The probability of choosing 5 non-lucky cards is:\n\n(42/52) * (41/51) * (40/50) * (39/49) * (38/48)\n\nNow, we'll calculate the probability:\n\n(42/52) * (41/51) * (40/50) * (39/49) * (38/48) = 0.6588 (approximately)\n\nNow, we'll subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of choosing at least one lucky card:\n\n1 - 0.6588 = 0.3412\n\nSo, the probability of choosing at least one lucky card is approximately 0.341 or 34.1%."
