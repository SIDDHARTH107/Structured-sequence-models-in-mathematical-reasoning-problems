    "message_1": "A company has a fixed cost of $10,000 and a marginal cost of $20 per unit. The market demand curve is given by Q = 500 - 10P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price. The company is a leader in the Stackelberg competition and can set its output level before a follower company, which will then choose its own output level. What output level should the leader choose to maximize its profit and what output level should the follower choose in response?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal output level for the leader and follower in a Stackelberg competition, we need to first find the reaction function of the follower. We will assume that both the leader and follower have the same marginal cost, which is $20 per unit.\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function: P = 50 - 0.1Q\n2. Find the total revenue function for the follower: TR_follower = P * q_follower = (50 - 0.1(Q_leader + q_follower)) * q_follower\n3. Find the total cost function for the follower: TC_follower = 20 * q_follower\n4. Find the profit function for the follower: π_follower = TR_follower - TC_follower\n5. Differentiate the profit function with respect to q_follower and set it to zero to find the reaction function of the follower: dπ_follower/dq_follower = 0\n6. Solve for q_follower in terms of Q_leader.\n\nNow, let's perform these calculations:\n\n1. P = 50 - 0.1Q\n2. TR_follower = (50 - 0.1(Q_leader + q_follower)) * q_follower\n3. TC_follower = 20 * q_follower\n4. π_follower = (50 - 0.1(Q_leader + q_follower)) * q_follower - 20 * q_follower\n5. dπ_follower/dq_follower = 30 - 0.2(Q_leader + q_follower) = 0\n6. q_follower = 150 - 0.5 * Q_leader (reaction function of the follower)\n\nNow that we have the reaction function of the follower, we can find the optimal output level for the leader:\n\n1. Find the total quantity demanded: Q = Q_leader + q_follower\n2. Substitute the reaction function of the follower into the total quantity demanded: Q = Q_leader + 150 - 0.5 * Q_leader\n3. Find the total revenue function for the leader: TR_leader = P * Q_leader = (50 - 0.1Q) * Q_leader\n4. Find the total cost function for the leader: TC_leader = 10000 + 20 * Q_leader\n5. Find the profit function for the leader: π_leader = TR_leader - TC_leader\n6. Differentiate the profit function with respect to Q_leader and set it to zero to find the optimal output level for the leader: dπ_leader/dQ_leader = 0\n7. Solve for Q_leader.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Q = Q_leader + q_follower\n2. Q = Q_leader + 150 - 0.5 * Q_leader => Q = 0.5 * Q_leader + 150\n3. TR_leader = (50 - 0.1Q) * Q_leader = (50 - 0.1(0.5 * Q_leader + 150)) * Q_leader\n4. TC_leader = 10000 + 20 * Q_leader\n5. π_leader = (50 - 0.1(0.5 * Q_leader + 150)) * Q_leader - (10000 + 20 * Q_leader)\n6. dπ_leader/dQ_leader = 0\n7. Q_leader = 100\n\nNow that we have the optimal output level for the leader, we can find the optimal output level for the follower using the reaction function:\n\nq_follower = 150 - 0.5 * Q_leader = 150 - 0.5 * 100 = 100\n\nSo, the leader should choose an output level of 100 units, and the follower should choose an output level of 100 units in response."
