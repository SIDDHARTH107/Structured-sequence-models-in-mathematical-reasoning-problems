    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (also known as the fractal dimension) of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and R is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, each iteration removes the middle third of the remaining line segments, leaving two segments of equal length. So, N = 2 (two self-similar pieces) and R = 3 (each piece is one-third the length of the previous one).\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309."
