    "message_1": "Let X be a complex projective variety with Hodge numbers (h^{p,q}) given by \n\nh^{1,0} = 2, h^{2,0} = 1, h^{0,1} = h^{0,2} = h^{1,1} = 0.\n\nCompute the dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on X.",
    "message_2": "The dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on X is given by the Hodge number h^{1,0}. In this case, h^{1,0} = 2, so the dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on X is 2."
