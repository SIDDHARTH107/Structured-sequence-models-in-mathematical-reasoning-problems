    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is 20 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 10 meters.\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 10\nC ≈ 62.8318 meters\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the garden is approximately 62.8318 meters."
