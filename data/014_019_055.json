The resulting ciphertext was \"MAERAEEHFRETTEPTTYO\". Assuming that the key used in transposition cipher is a number, what is the key used to encrypt this message?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the key length used in the transposition cipher. We can do this by trying different key lengths and checking if the decrypted message makes sense.\n\nThe original message has 21 characters (ignoring spaces): \"MEETMEAFTERTHEPARTY\"\n\nLet's try different key lengths:\n\n1. Key length = 3\n   Divide the ciphertext into 3 columns:\n   M A E\n   R A E\n   E H F\n   R E T\n   T E P\n   T T Y\n   O\n\n   Read the columns vertically: \"MRETTOMAEAEAEHFTPTY\"\n   This doesn't make sense, so let's try another key length.\n\n2. Key length = 4\n   Divide the ciphertext into 4 columns:\n   M A E R\n   A E E H\n   F R E T\n   T E P T\n   T Y O\n\n   Read the columns vertically: \"MAFTEAERYEEOHETRPTT\"\n   This doesn't make sense either, so let's try another key length.\n\n3. Key length = 5\n   Divide the ciphertext into 5 columns:\n   M A E R A\n   E E H F R\n   E T T E P\n   T T Y O\n\n   Read the columns vertically: \"MEETMEAFTERTHEPARTY\"\n   This makes sense and matches the original message.\n\nSo, the key used to encrypt the message is 5."
