    "message_2": "The girth of a graph G is the length of the shortest cycle in G. To determine the girth of G, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the girth to be infinity.\n2. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on the graph starting from each vertex.\n3. During the traversal, keep track of the depth of each vertex from the starting vertex.\n4. When a back edge is encountered (i.e., an edge connecting the current vertex to an already visited vertex), calculate the length of the cycle formed by the back edge and the path from the starting vertex to the current vertex.\n5. Update the girth if the calculated cycle length is smaller than the current girth.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all vertices in the graph.\n\nAfter performing the algorithm, the girth will be the length of the shortest cycle in the graph.\n\nHowever, without any information about the edges in the given graph G, we cannot determine the exact value of its girth. The girth of a graph with 10 vertices can range from 3 (if it's a triangle) to infinity (if it's a tree, which has no cycles)."
