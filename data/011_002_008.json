    "message_2": "To choose 3 objects from a set of 8 objects, we use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of objects (8 in this case) and k is the number of objects to choose (3 in this case).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1)(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo there are 56 ways to choose 3 objects from a set of 8 objects."
