    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 students in a class and you want to investigate the relationship between the number of hours they study per week and their final exam scores. If the correlation coefficient between study hours and exam scores is 0.6, what is the strength and direction of the relationship?",
    "message_2": "The correlation coefficient, also known as Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n\n-1 indicates a strong negative relationship\n0 indicates no relationship\n1 indicates a strong positive relationship\n\nIn this case, the correlation coefficient between study hours and exam scores is 0.6. This value indicates a moderate positive relationship between the number of hours students study per week and their final exam scores. In other words, as the number of study hours increases, the exam scores tend to increase as well, but the relationship is not extremely strong."
