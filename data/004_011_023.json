If the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base is 6 meters from the wall?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 meters long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second, so dx/dt = 2 m/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 6 meters.\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWhen x = 6, we can find y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 100 - 36 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow substitute the values of x and y into the equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSolve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\n(dy/dt) = -24/16 = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 meters per second when the base is 6 meters from the wall."
