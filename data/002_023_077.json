    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (6 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 36 cm^2\nSurface area = 144π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface area ≈ 144 * 3.14 cm^2\nSurface area ≈ 452.16 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 6 cm is approximately 452.16 cm^2."
