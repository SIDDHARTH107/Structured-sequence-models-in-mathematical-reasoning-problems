    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nIn the Ultimatum Game, two players are given a total of $10. Player 1 proposes a division of the money to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the proposal, they keep the money as divided. If Player 2 rejects the proposal, no one gets any money. What is the maximum amount that Player 1 can offer such that Player 2 would still accept the offer according to the standard assumptions of rationality and self-interest?",
    "message_2": "Under the standard assumptions of rationality and self-interest, Player 2 would accept any offer that gives them a positive amount of money, as it is better than getting nothing. Therefore, Player 1 can offer the maximum amount of $9.99 (or any amount very close to $10) to Player 2, keeping only $0.01 (or a very small amount) for themselves. In this scenario, Player 2 would still accept the offer, as they would prefer to have $9.99 rather than nothing."
