    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a diameter of 50 feet and completes one full revolution every 36 seconds. At what height above the ground is a rider after 14 seconds if they start from the bottom of the wheel? Assume that the rider starts at the 3 o'clock position. Round your answer to the nearest foot.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of a circle and the concept of angular velocity.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the Ferris wheel. Since the diameter is 50 feet, the radius is half of that, which is 25 feet.\n\nNext, let's find the angular velocity of the Ferris wheel. Since it completes one full revolution (360 degrees) in 36 seconds, the angular velocity (ω) can be calculated as:\n\nω = 360 degrees / 36 seconds = 10 degrees/second\n\nNow, let's find the angle (θ) the rider has traveled after 14 seconds:\n\nθ = ω * time = 10 degrees/second * 14 seconds = 140 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the properties of a circle to find the height (h) above the ground. We know that the rider is on the circumference of the circle, and we can use the sine function to find the height:\n\nsin(θ) = h / radius\n\nh = radius * sin(θ)\n\nh = 25 feet * sin(140 degrees)\n\nConverting degrees to radians:\n\n140 degrees * (π / 180) = 2.443 radians\n\nNow, calculate the height:\n\nh = 25 feet * sin(2.443 radians) ≈ 25 feet * 0.9744 ≈ 24.36 feet\n\nSince we need to round the answer to the nearest foot, the rider is approximately 24 feet above the ground after 14 seconds."
