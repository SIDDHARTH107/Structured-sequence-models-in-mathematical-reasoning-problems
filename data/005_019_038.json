    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will be sunny two days from now, we need to consider two possible scenarios: \n\n1. Tomorrow is rainy, and the day after tomorrow is sunny.\n2. Tomorrow is sunny, and the day after tomorrow is sunny.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:\n\n1. The probability of a rainy day tomorrow, given that today is rainy, is 0.3. The probability of a sunny day after a rainy day is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So, the probability of this scenario is 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21.\n\n2. The probability of a sunny day tomorrow, given that today is rainy, is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The probability of a sunny day after a sunny day is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So, the probability of this scenario is 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of both scenarios to find the total probability of a sunny day two days from now:\n\n0.21 + 0.56 = 0.77\n\nSo, the probability that it will be sunny two days from now is 0.77."
