    "message_2": "The largest bulb in the Mandelbrot set with a diameter of 0.25 is the circle centered at -1 on the real axis. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nSince the diameter is 0.25, the radius is half of that, which is 0.125.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area:\n\nA = π(0.125)^2\nA ≈ 3.14159 × 0.015625\nA ≈ 0.049087\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the largest bulb in the Mandelbrot set with a diameter of 0.25 is approximately 0.05."
