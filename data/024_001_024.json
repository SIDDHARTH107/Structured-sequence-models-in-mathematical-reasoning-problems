    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t. \n\nFirst derivatives:\nx'(t) = -2sin(t)\ny'(t) = 2cos(t)\nz'(t) = 3\n\nSecond derivatives:\nx''(t) = -2cos(t)\ny''(t) = -2sin(t)\nz''(t) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||\n\nwhere T(t) is the unit tangent vector, T'(t) is the derivative of the unit tangent vector, and r'(t) is the first derivative of the position vector.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + z'(t)^2) = sqrt((-2sin(t))^2 + (2cos(t))^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(4sin^2(t) + 4cos^2(t) + 9)\n\nSince sin^2(t) + cos^2(t) = 1, we have:\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13)\n\nNow, we need to find the unit tangent vector T(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)|| = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)) / sqrt(13) = (-2sin(t)/sqrt(13), 2cos(t)/sqrt(13), 3/sqrt(13))\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the unit tangent vector T'(t):\n\nT'(t) = (-2cos(t)/sqrt(13), -2sin(t)/sqrt(13), 0)\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of T'(t):\n\n||T'(t)|| = sqrt((-2cos(t)/sqrt(13))^2 + (-2sin(t)/sqrt(13))^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(4cos^2(t)/13 + 4sin^2(t)/13)\n\nSince sin^2(t) + cos^2(t) = 1, we have:\n\n||T'(t)|| = sqrt(4/13)\n\nFinally, we can find the curvature k(t):\n\nk(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)|| = (sqrt(4/13)) / (sqrt(13)) = 2/sqrt(169) = 2/13\n\nNow, to find the torsion (τ), we use the formula:\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • T'(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, we find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (-2sin(t), 2cos(t), 3) x (-2cos(t), -2sin(t), 0) = (6sin(t), 6cos(t), -4)\n\nNext, we find the dot product of (r'(t) x r''(t)) and T'(t):\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • T'(t) = (6sin(t), 6cos(t), -4) • (-2cos(t)/sqrt(13), -2sin(t)/sqrt(13), 0) = -12sin(t)cos(t)/sqrt(13) - 12cos(t)sin(t)/sqrt(13) = -24sin(t)cos(t)/sqrt(13)\n\nNow, we find the magnitude squared of r'(t) x r''(t):\n\n||(r'(t) x r''(t))||^2 = (6sin(t))^2 + (6cos(t))^2 + (-4)^2 = 36sin^2(t) + 36cos^2(t) + 16\n\nSince sin^2(t) + cos^2(t) = 1, we have:\n\n||(r'(t) x r''(t))||^2 = 36 + 16 = 52\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion τ(t):\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • T'(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2 = (-24sin(t)cos(t)/sqrt(13)) / 52 = -12sin(t)cos(t) / (13*sqrt(13))\n\nSo, the curvature k(t) = 2/13 and the torsion τ(t) = -12sin(t)cos(t) / (13*sqrt(13))."
