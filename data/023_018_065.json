    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to the input signal f(t) = 2*sin(3t) - 3*cos(4t), we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal.\n\nThe Laplace transform of sin(at) is a/(s^2 + a^2) and the Laplace transform of cos(at) is s/(s^2 + a^2). Therefore, the Laplace transform of the input signal F(s) is:\n\nF(s) = 2*(3/(s^2 + 3^2)) - 3*(s/(s^2 + 4^2))\n\nNow, we can find the output signal's Laplace transform Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input signal's Laplace transform F(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * F(s)\n\nY(s) = ((10s + 1)/(s^2 + 6s + 5)) * (2*(3/(s^2 + 3^2)) - 3*(s/(s^2 + 4^2)))\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s). However, this is a complex calculation that requires partial fraction decomposition and inverse Laplace transform techniques. Instead, we can analyze the frequency response of the system to find the amplitude and phase shift of the output signal.\n\nThe frequency response of the system is given by G(jω), where ω is the frequency of the input signal. We have two frequencies in the input signal: ω1 = 3 and ω2 = 4. We need to evaluate G(jω) at these frequencies:\n\nG(j3) = (10(j3) + 1)/((j3)^2 + 6(j3) + 5)\nG(j4) = (10(j4) + 1)/((j4)^2 + 6(j4) + 5)\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude and phase shift of the output signal at each frequency:\n\nAmplitude at ω1 = |G(j3)| * 2 (since the input amplitude at ω1 is 2)\nPhase shift at ω1 = angle(G(j3))\n\nAmplitude at ω2 = |G(j4)| * 3 (since the input amplitude at ω2 is 3)\nPhase shift at ω2 = angle(G(j4))\n\nThe steady-state response of the system to the input signal will be the sum of the responses at each frequency:\n\ny(t) = Amplitude at ω1 * sin(3t + Phase shift at ω1) - Amplitude at ω2 * cos(4t + Phase shift at ω2)\n\nTo find the exact values of the amplitude and phase shift, you would need to compute the complex values of G(j3) and G(j4) and then calculate their magnitudes and angles."
