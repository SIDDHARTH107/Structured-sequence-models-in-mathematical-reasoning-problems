    "message_1": "Consider a square with side length 4 units. Subdivide this square into smaller squares of side length 1 unit. How many smaller squares will there be in the subdivision?",
    "message_2": "When you subdivide a square with side length 4 units into smaller squares of side length 1 unit, you create a grid of 4 rows and 4 columns. To find the total number of smaller squares, you can multiply the number of rows by the number of columns: \n\n4 rows Ã— 4 columns = 16 smaller squares\n\nSo, there will be 16 smaller squares in the subdivision."
