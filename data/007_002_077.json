    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 6, 8, and 15, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nPrime factorization of the numbers:\n6 = 2 × 3\n8 = 2^3\n15 = 3 × 5\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations:\n\n2^3 × 3 × 5 = 8 × 3 × 5 = 24 × 5 = 120\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 6, 8, and 15 is 120."
