    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products A and B. The time to manufacture A is 3 hours and B is 5 hours. The total time available for production is 120 hours. The profit for each product A and B is $10 and $15 respectively. Find how many units to manufacture of each product to maximize profit given that there are only 100 units of raw material available for production.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Time constraint: 3x + 5y ≤ 120 (since the total time available for production is 120 hours)\n2. Raw material constraint: x + y ≤ 100 (since there are only 100 units of raw material available)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since we cannot produce a negative number of units)\n\nOur objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 5y ≤ 120\n   y ≤ (120 - 3x) / 5\n\n2. x + y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ 100 - x\n\n3. x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of 3x + 5y = 120 and x + y = 100:\n   Solving the system of equations:\n   3x + 5y = 120\n   x + y = 100\n   Subtracting the second equation from the first equation multiplied by 3:\n   3x + 5y - 3(x + y) = 120 - 300\n   2y = -180\n   y = -90\n   Since y cannot be negative, this intersection point is not in the feasible region.\n\n2. Intersection of 3x + 5y = 120 and y = 0:\n   3x + 5(0) = 120\n   x = 40\n\n3. Intersection of x + y = 100 and y = 0:\n   x + 0 = 100\n   x = 100\n\n4. Intersection of x + y = 100 and x = 0:\n   0 + y = 100\n   y = 100\n\n5. Intersection of 3x + 5y = 120 and x = 0:\n   3(0) + 5y = 120\n   y = 24\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y at the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(40, 0) = 10(40) + 15(0) = 400\n2. P(100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = 1000\n3. P(0, 100) = 10(0) + 15(100) = 1500\n4. P(0, 24) = 10(0) + 15(24) = 360\n\nThe maximum profit of $1500 is achieved when 0 units of product A and 100 units of product B are produced."
