    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 8, 12, and 18 can be found by finding the prime factors of each number and then multiplying the highest powers of each prime factor together.\n\n8 = 2^3\n12 = 2^2 * 3^1\n18 = 2^1 * 3^2\n\nThe highest powers of each prime factor are 2^3 and 3^2. Multiply them together:\n\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, the LCM of 8, 12, and 18 is 72."
