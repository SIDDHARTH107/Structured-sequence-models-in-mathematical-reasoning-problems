    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, it is composed of 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 2 (s = 2) compared to the original triangle.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Sierpinski triangle is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nTherefore, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.5849625."
