    "message_1": "Assume that there are two doors, A and B in front of you. Behind one door is a prize of $10,000, while the other is empty. You have to choose one door without knowing what is behind it. Additionally, I will offer you the chance to switch your choice to the other door once you have made a choice. If you want to maximize your chances of getting the prize, what is the optimal choice, and what is the probability of getting the prize?",
    "message_2": "This problem is known as the Monty Hall problem. To maximize your chances of getting the prize, you should always switch your choice to the other door once you have made an initial choice. Here's why:\n\n1. Initially, you have a 1/2 chance of choosing the door with the prize and a 1/2 chance of choosing the empty door.\n2. After you make your initial choice, I offer you the chance to switch your choice to the other door.\n3. If you initially chose the door with the prize (1/2 probability), switching will lead to the empty door.\n4. If you initially chose the empty door (1/2 probability), switching will lead to the door with the prize.\n\nSo, by always switching your choice, you have a 1/2 probability of getting the prize, which is higher than the 1/2 probability of sticking with your initial choice. Therefore, the optimal choice is to always switch, and the probability of getting the prize is 1/2."
