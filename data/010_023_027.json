    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem on Geometric Topology and Knot Theory for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider an unknot K in the 3-dimensional space, with a radius r of 5 units. Also, consider a torus T in the same space, with an inner radius of 7 units and an outer radius of 8 units. Assume that K lies entirely inside T. What is the minimum number of times the knot must twist around the torus in order to be unknotted (i.e., to become a trivial knot)?\n\nHint: The minimum number of twists required for an unknot in a torus is given by the winding number.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of times the knot must twist around the torus in order to be unknotted, we need to determine the winding number. The winding number is the number of times a curve wraps around a point in a given direction.\n\nIn this case, the unknot K has a radius of 5 units and lies entirely inside the torus T, which has an inner radius of 7 units and an outer radius of 8 units. Since the unknot is inside the torus, it must wrap around the central hole of the torus at least once to be unknotted.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of times the knot must twist around the torus in order to be unknotted is 1. This corresponds to a winding number of 1."
