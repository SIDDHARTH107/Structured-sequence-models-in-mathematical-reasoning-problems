    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The ladder is 12 meters long and makes an angle of 60 degrees with the ground. What is the distance of the foot of the ladder from the wall?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance of the foot of the ladder from the wall, we can use trigonometry. In this case, we have a right triangle formed by the ladder, the wall, and the ground. The ladder acts as the hypotenuse of the triangle, and we are trying to find the length of the adjacent side (the distance from the wall).\n\nWe can use the cosine function to solve this problem:\n\ncos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\ncos(60°) = adjacent side / 12 meters\n\nWe know that cos(60°) = 0.5, so:\n\n0.5 = adjacent side / 12 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for the adjacent side:\n\nAdjacent side = 0.5 * 12 meters\nAdjacent side = 6 meters\n\nThe foot of the ladder is 6 meters away from the wall."
