    "message_2": "Yes, these two graphs are isomorphic. \n\nAn isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency. In other words, two graphs are isomorphic if there is a way to relabel the vertices of one graph so that it becomes identical to the other graph.\n\nIn this case, we can establish the following correspondence between the vertices of the two graphs:\n\nA ↔ 1\nB ↔ 3\nC ↔ 2\n\nWith this correspondence, the adjacency relationships are preserved:\n\n- A is adjacent to B and C in Graph 1, and 1 is adjacent to 3 and 2 in Graph 2.\n- B is adjacent to A and C in Graph 1, and 3 is adjacent to 1 and 2 in Graph 2.\n- C is adjacent to A and B in Graph 1, and 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3 in Graph 2.\n\nSince there is a bijection between the vertex sets that preserves adjacency, the two graphs are isomorphic."
