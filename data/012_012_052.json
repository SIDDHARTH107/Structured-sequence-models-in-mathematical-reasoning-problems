    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. Let's find the shortest cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can see that there are several 3-length cycles in the graph, such as (1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 6), (3, 4, 7), and so on. Since a cycle cannot have a length less than 3, the girth of this graph is 3."
