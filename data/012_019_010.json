    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 12 edges and 8 vertices, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 12) / 8 = 3. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 3. However, it could also be 4, as a graph with a vertex of degree 4 and the remaining vertices having degree 3 or less can still have 12 edges.\n\nNow, we'll use Vizing's Theorem, which states that for any graph G, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. Since Δ(G) is either 3 or 4, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. If Δ(G) = 3, then 3 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 4.\n2. If Δ(G) = 4, then 4 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 5.\n\nWe need to determine which case applies to our graph. If Δ(G) = 3, then the graph would be 3-regular, meaning every vertex has a degree of 3. However, a 3-regular graph with 8 vertices would have (3 * 8) / 2 = 12 edges, which is the same as the number of edges in our graph. Therefore, our graph G is indeed 3-regular, and Δ(G) = 3.\n\nSo, using Vizing's Theorem, we have 3 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 4. Since G is a 3-regular graph, it is not a bipartite graph, and thus, by Vizing's Theorem, χ'(G) = Δ(G) + 1. Therefore, the chromatic index of G is χ'(G) = 3 + 1 = 4."
