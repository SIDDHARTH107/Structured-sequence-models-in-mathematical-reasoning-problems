When we glue the two shapes together, we identify the 3 vertices of the triangle with 3 of the vertices of the tetrahedron. This means that we have 4 - 3 = 1 vertex in common between the two shapes, and we also identify one edge and one face between the two shapes. \n\nTherefore, the combined simplicial complex has: \n- 4 vertices (from the tetrahedron) \n- 8 edges (6 from the tetrahedron and 2 from the triangle, minus 1 identified edge) \n- 5 faces (4 from the tetrahedron and 1 from the triangle, minus 1 identified face) \n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get: \n\nχ = V - E + F \nχ = 4 - 8 + 5 \nχ = 1 \n\nSo the Euler characteristic of the combined simplicial complex is 1.",
