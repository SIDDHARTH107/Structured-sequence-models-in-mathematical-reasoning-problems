    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product at a price of $100 per unit. The cost function of manufacturing units (in thousands) is given by C(x) = 25x + 3x^2, where x is the number of units produced. The company wants to find the optimal production level that will maximize its profit. Using non-convex optimization techniques, what is the maximum profit the company can earn and at what production level?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production level that maximizes profit, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function is given by the revenue function minus the cost function:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x)\n\nThe revenue function is the price per unit multiplied by the number of units produced:\n\nR(x) = 100x\n\nNow, we can find the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 100x - (25x + 3x^2)\n\nP(x) = 75x - 3x^2\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nP'(x) = 75 - 6x\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n75 - 6x = 0\n\n6x = 75\n\nx = 12.5\n\nSince the production level must be a whole number, we need to check the profit at both x = 12 and x = 13:\n\nP(12) = 75(12) - 3(12)^2 = 900 - 432 = 468\nP(13) = 75(13) - 3(13)^2 = 975 - 507 = 468\n\nBoth production levels give the same maximum profit. Therefore, the company can produce either 12 or 13 units to maximize its profit. The maximum profit the company can earn is $468,000 (since the profit function is in thousands)."
