    "message_1": "A control engineer needs to design a controller for a system with a transfer function given by G(s) = 1/(s^3 + 4s^2 + 5s). The engineer decides to use the Fourier transform approach to design the controller. What is the value of the controller gain K to achieve a steady-state error of 0.1 when the input signal is a sine wave with frequency 2 rad/s?",
    "message_2": "To find the controller gain K, we first need to determine the steady-state response of the system to the sinusoidal input. The input signal can be represented in the frequency domain as:\n\nX(jω) = A * e^(jωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the sine wave, ω is the frequency (2 rad/s), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe steady-state response of the system can be found by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input signal X(jω) in the frequency domain:\n\nY(jω) = G(jω) * X(jω)\n\nThe transfer function G(s) is given by:\n\nG(s) = 1 / (s^3 + 4s^2 + 5s)\n\nSubstitute s = jω:\n\nG(jω) = 1 / ((jω)^3 + 4(jω)^2 + 5(jω))\n\nG(jω) = 1 / (-j(ω^3) - 4(ω^2) + 5jω)\n\nNow, let's find G(jω) at ω = 2 rad/s:\n\nG(j2) = 1 / (-j(2^3) - 4(2^2) + 5j(2))\nG(j2) = 1 / (-j(8) - 16 + 10j)\nG(j2) = 1 / (-8j - 16 + 10j)\nG(j2) = 1 / (-16 - 8j + 10j)\nG(j2) = 1 / (-16 + 2j)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of G(j2):\n\n|G(j2)| = √((-16)^2 + (2)^2) = √(256 + 4) = √260 ≈ 16.12\n\nThe steady-state error is given by the following formula:\n\nSteady-state error = (1 - |G(jω)|) * A\n\nWe want the steady-state error to be 0.1, so:\n\n0.1 = (1 - |G(j2)|) * A\n\nAssuming the amplitude A of the input sine wave is 1, we can solve for the controller gain K:\n\n0.1 = (1 - 16.12) * 1\n0.1 = -15.12\n\nThis result indicates that there is an issue with the problem statement or the system, as the steady-state error cannot be achieved with the given transfer function and input signal. The steady-state error is larger than the desired value, and the controller gain K cannot be determined in this case."
