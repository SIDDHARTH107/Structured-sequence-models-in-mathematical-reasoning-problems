    "message_2": "In set theory, a set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. The empty set ∅ is a set with no elements. \n\nTo prove that the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element of ∅ is also an element of A. Since there are no elements in the empty set, this statement is vacuously true. In other words, there are no elements in ∅ that are not in A, so the empty set is a subset of A.\n\nTherefore, ∅ ⊆ A, which means the empty set is a subset of set A."
