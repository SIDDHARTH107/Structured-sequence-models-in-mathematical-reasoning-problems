    "message_1": "A Vigenere cipher uses a keyword of length 5 and a plaintext message of length 30. The keyword and the message contain only alphabetical characters, which are converted to numerical values using A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25. The plaintext is encrypted by adding the numerical value of each letter in the message to the numerical value of the corresponding letter in the keyword (cycling through the keyword if needed). What is the minimum number of possible keys that could have been used to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "Since the keyword has a length of 5 and each character in the keyword can have 26 possible values (A-Z), the total number of possible keys is 26^5. \n\n26^5 = 11881376\n\nSo, there are a minimum of 11,881,376 possible keys that could have been used to encrypt the message."
