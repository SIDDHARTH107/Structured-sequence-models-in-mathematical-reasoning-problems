    "message_1": "Suppose that $M$ is a compact, orientable, connected $d$-dimensional manifold and $N$ is a closed submanifold of $M$ of codimension $k$. If $[M]$ and $[N]$ denote the fundamental classes of $M$ and $N$ respectively, what is the intersection number $[M] \\cdot [N]$?",
    "message_2": "The intersection number $[M] \\cdot [N]$ is defined as the evaluation of the cup product of the cohomology classes $[M]$ and $[N]$ on the fundamental class of $M$. In other words, it is the algebraic count of the number of points in the intersection of $M$ and $N$.\n\nSince $M$ is a $d$-dimensional manifold and $N$ is a submanifold of codimension $k$, the dimension of $N$ is $d-k$. The cup product of the cohomology classes $[M]$ and $[N]$ will be non-zero only if the sum of their degrees is equal to the dimension of $M$, i.e., $d = d + (d-k)$. This implies that $k=0$, which means that $N$ is not a proper submanifold of $M$, but rather $N=M$ itself.\n\nIn this case, the intersection number $[M] \\cdot [N] = [M] \\cdot [M]$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $M$, denoted by $\\chi(M)$. The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant that depends on the number of vertices, edges, and faces in a cell decomposition of the manifold.\n\nIn summary, the intersection number $[M] \\cdot [N]$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $M$, $\\chi(M)$, if $N=M$, and is zero otherwise."
