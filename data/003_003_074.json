    "message_2": "To find the sine and cosine of 120 degrees, we first need to convert the angle to radians. To do this, we use the conversion factor: 1 radian = 180/π degrees.\n\n120 degrees * (π/180) = (2π/3) radians\n\nNow, we can find the sine and cosine of the angle using the unit circle. The angle 120 degrees (or 2π/3 radians) is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive and cosine is negative.\n\nWe can use the reference angle of 60 degrees (or π/3 radians) to find the sine and cosine values. The sine and cosine of 60 degrees are:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(π/3) = √3/2\ncos(60°) = cos(π/3) = 1/2\n\nSince the angle 120 degrees is in the second quadrant, the sine will be positive and the cosine will be negative. Therefore, the sine and cosine of 120 degrees are:\n\nsin(120°) = sin(2π/3) = √3/2\ncos(120°) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2"
