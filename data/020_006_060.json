    "message_1": "A factory produces two herbal supplements, Supplement A and Supplement B. The production of Supplement A requires 2 grams of ingredient X and 5 grams of ingredient Y, while the production of Supplement B requires 3 grams of ingredient X and 4 grams of ingredient Y. The factory has 18 grams of ingredient X and 26 grams of ingredient Y available for production each day. Each supplement must be produced in whole numbers. If the profit for each unit of Supplement A is $5 and for each unit of Supplement B is $7, then what is the maximum profit that the factory can earn in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let's use a system of linear inequalities to represent the constraints of this problem. Let A be the number of units of Supplement A produced and B be the number of units of Supplement B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the ingredients are:\n2A + 3B ≤ 18 (ingredient X)\n5A + 4B ≤ 26 (ingredient Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit:\nP = 5A + 7B\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2A + 3B ≤ 18\n3B ≤ -2A + 18\nB ≤ (-2/3)A + 6\n\n5A + 4B ≤ 26\n4B ≤ -5A + 26\nB ≤ (-5/4)A + 6.5\n\nSince A and B must be whole numbers (integer values), we will look for the integer coordinates within the feasible region. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices (0,0), (0,6), (4,3), and (9,0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices and any other integer points within the feasible region:\n\n1. (0,0): P = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. (0,6): P = 5(0) + 7(6) = $42\n3. (4,3): P = 5(4) + 7(3) = $41\n4. (9,0): P = 5(9) + 7(0) = $45\n5. (1,5): P = 5(1) + 7(5) = $40\n6. (2,4): P = 5(2) + 7(4) = $38\n7. (3,3): P = 5(3) + 7(3) = $36\n8. (6,2): P = 5(6) + 7(2) = $40\n9. (8,1): P = 5(8) + 7(1) = $47\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when 8 units of Supplement A and 1 unit of Supplement B are produced, resulting in a profit of $47."
