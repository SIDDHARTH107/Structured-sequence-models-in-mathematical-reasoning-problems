    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x + 1 between x = 1 and x = 5, we will integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral between the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = 2x + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(2x + 1) dx = x^2 + x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the definite integral between the limits x = 1 and x = 5:\n\nArea = [x^2 + x] (from x = 1 to x = 5)\n\n= (5^2 + 5) - (1^2 + 1)\n= (25 + 5) - (1 + 1)\n= 30 - 2\n= 28\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x + 1 between x = 1 and x = 5 is 28 square units."
