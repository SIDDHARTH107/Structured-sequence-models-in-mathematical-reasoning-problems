    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a linear programming question:\n\nA furniture manufacturer can produce two types of chairs: one with a wooden frame and one with a metal frame. The wooden chair requires 10 feet of lumber and 6 hours of labor to produce, while the metal chair requires 1 foot of metal tubing and 4 hours of labor to produce. The manufacturer has 240 feet of lumber, 40 feet of metal tubing, and 120 hours of labor available. The profit for each wooden chair is $30 and for each metal chair is $40. What is the maximum profit the manufacturer can make, and how many of each type of chair should they produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wooden chairs and y be the number of metal chairs.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\n1. Lumber: 10x ≤ 240\n2. Metal tubing: y ≤ 40\n3. Labor: 6x + 4y ≤ 120\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 30x + 40y.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. x ≤ 24 (divide by 10)\n2. y ≤ 40 (already solved)\n3. 6x + 4y ≤ 120 -> 3x + 2y ≤ 60 (divide by 2) -> y ≤ 30 - 1.5x\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA. (0, 0) - intersection of x = 0 and y = 0\nB. (0, 40) - intersection of x = 0 and y = 40\nC. (24, 0) - intersection of x = 24 and y = 0\nD. (24, 12) - intersection of x = 24 and y = 30 - 1.5x\nE. (16, 12) - intersection of y = 40 and y = 30 - 1.5x\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nA. P(0, 0) = 30(0) + 40(0) = $0\nB. P(0, 40) = 30(0) + 40(40) = $1600\nC. P(24, 0) = 30(24) + 40(0) = $720\nD. P(24, 12) = 30(24) + 40(12) = $1680\nE. P(16, 12) = 30(16) + 40(12) = $1440\n\nThe maximum profit is $1680 when producing 24 wooden chairs and 12 metal chairs."
