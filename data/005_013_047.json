Suppose in a week, the factory sells the following number of units of each product: 100 units of A, 50 units of B, and 30 units of C. Find the total profit earned by the factory in that week using multivariate analysis.",
    "message_2": "To find the total profit earned by the factory in that week using multivariate analysis, we can set up a profit function P(x, y, z) that depends on the number of units sold for each product (x for product A, y for product B, and z for product C).\n\nP(x, y, z) = 10x + 20y + 30z\n\nNow, we can plug in the given number of units sold for each product:\n\nP(100, 50, 30) = 10(100) + 20(50) + 30(30)\n\nP(100, 50, 30) = 1000 + 1000 + 900\n\nP(100, 50, 30) = 2900\n\nSo, the total profit earned by the factory in that week is $2,900."
