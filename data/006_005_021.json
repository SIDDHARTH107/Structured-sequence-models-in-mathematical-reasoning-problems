    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 5 within the first two rolls, we can use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability of not rolling a 5 in both rolls and then subtract it from 1.\n\nProbability of not rolling a 5 in one roll = 5/6 (since there are 5 other outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6)\n\nProbability of not rolling a 5 in both rolls = (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36\n\nNow, we'll find the complementary probability:\n\nProbability of rolling a 5 within the first two rolls = 1 - Probability of not rolling a 5 in both rolls\n\nProbability of rolling a 5 within the first two rolls = 1 - 25/36 = 11/36"
