    "message_1": "A farmer has a field with an area of 500 square meters. He wants to enclose the field with a fence that costs $10 per meter on three sides, as the fourth side borders a river. What is the minimum cost to enclose the field?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of the fence, we need to minimize the perimeter of the field while maintaining the area of 500 square meters. Since the field borders a river, we can assume it is a rectangle with one side along the river. Let the length of the field be L and the width be W. Then, the area of the field is given by:\n\nA = L * W = 500\n\nWe need to minimize the perimeter P, which is given by:\n\nP = L + 2W (since only three sides need fencing)\n\nTo minimize P, we can use calculus. First, we need to express W in terms of L using the area equation:\n\nW = 500 / L\n\nNow, we can express the perimeter P in terms of L:\n\nP(L) = L + 2(500 / L)\n\nTo find the minimum value of P(L), we can take the derivative of P with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\ndP/dL = 1 - (1000 / L^2) = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n1000 / L^2 = 1\nL^2 = 1000\nL = √1000 ≈ 31.62 meters\n\nNow, we can find the width W:\n\nW = 500 / L ≈ 500 / 31.62 ≈ 15.81 meters\n\nFinally, we can find the minimum cost to enclose the field by calculating the perimeter and multiplying it by the cost per meter:\n\nP_min = L + 2W ≈ 31.62 + 2(15.81) ≈ 63.24 meters\n\nCost = P_min * $10/meter ≈ 63.24 * 10 ≈ $632.40\n\nThe minimum cost to enclose the field is approximately $632.40."
