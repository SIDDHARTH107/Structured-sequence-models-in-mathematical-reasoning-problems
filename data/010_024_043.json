    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic plane, the area of a triangle can be determined using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a hyperbolic triangle is equal to the difference between the sum of its angles and pi (π) times the absolute value of the curvature (K).\n\nArea = |K| * (π - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3))\n\nGiven the curvature K = -1.5, and the angles are 45°, 60°, and 75°, we first need to convert the angles to radians.\n\nangle1 = 45° * (π / 180) = π / 4\nangle2 = 60° * (π / 180) = π / 3\nangle3 = 75° * (π / 180) = 5π / 12\n\nNow, we can calculate the area using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\nArea = |-1.5| * (π - (π / 4 + π / 3 + 5π / 12))\nArea = 1.5 * (π - (4π / 12 + 4π / 12 + 5π / 12))\nArea = 1.5 * (π - (13π / 12))\nArea = 1.5 * (-π / 12)\nArea = -1.5π / 12\n\nThe area of the triangle in this hyperbolic plane is -1.5π / 12 square units."
