    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student in Linear Algebra to solve based on the subtopic of solving systems of linear equations with noisy data:\n\nA company conducted a study analyzing the relationship between the sales of their products with respect to the number of advertisements made on television, radio and newspapers. The study was done over 5 weeks, but due to data collection errors, the collected data was imprecise. Here is  a system of linear equations that summarizes their data:\n\n```\n1.01x + 1.02y + 1.03z = 234\n2.05x + 0.98y + 1.07z = 421\n1.08x + 0.99y + 1.01z = 312\n```\nwhere x is the number of advertisements made on television, y is the number of advertisements made on the radio, and z is the number of advertisements made on newspapers, and the values on the right-hand side of the equations represent the total number of product sales across all channels. Assuming that the coefficients have an error range of ±0.05, use linear algebra techniques to find a more precise estimate of the number of advertisements on each channel that led to the reported sales.",
    "message_2": "To find a more precise estimate of the number of advertisements on each channel, we can use the least squares method. This method minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the actual data and the estimated data. We can represent the system of linear equations as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the vector of sales.\n\nA = [[1.01, 1.02, 1.03],\n     [2.05, 0.98, 1.07],\n     [1.08, 0.99, 1.01]]\n\nb = [234, 421, 312]\n\nTo apply the least squares method, we need to find the normal equations, which are given by A^T * A * x = A^T * b. First, let's find the transpose of A (A^T) and the product A^T * A:\n\nA^T = [[1.01, 2.05, 1.08],\n       [1.02, 0.98, 0.99],\n       [1.03, 1.07, 1.01]]\n\nA^T * A = [[6.2666, 3.0806, 4.2626],\n           [3.0806, 3.0202, 3.1003],\n           [4.2626, 3.1003, 3.2803]]\n\nNow, let's find the product A^T * b:\n\nA^T * b = [1500.97,  734.98,  997.99]\n\nNow, we can solve the normal equations (A^T * A * x = A^T * b) using any method for solving systems of linear equations, such as Gaussian elimination or the inverse matrix method. For this example, we'll use the inverse matrix method. First, we need to find the inverse of (A^T * A):\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = [[ 0.4920, -0.0546, -0.6388],\n                  [-0.0546,  0.9986, -0.0466],\n                  [-0.6388, -0.0466,  1.2780]]\n\nNow, we can find the solution x by multiplying the inverse of (A^T * A) by A^T * b:\n\nx = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * b = [ 37.9634,  76.9786,  87.9922]\n\nSo, the more precise estimate of the number of advertisements on each channel that led to the reported sales is:\n\nx ≈ 37.96 (television)\ny ≈ 76.98 (radio)\nz ≈ 87.99 (newspapers)"
