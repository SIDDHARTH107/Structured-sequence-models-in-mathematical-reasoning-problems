    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 60 are there, and can you provide an example of one of these groups? Furthermore, can you demonstrate why every group of order 60 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the non-abelian groups of order 60?",
    "message_2": "There are two non-abelian groups of order 60, up to isomorphism. One example of such a group is the symmetric group S5, which is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. Another example is the non-abelian group A5 × C2, which is the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the group of even permutations of 5 elements) and the cyclic group C2 of order 2.\n\nTo demonstrate why every group of order 60 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 60. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n5 are 1 and 6. If n5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n3) divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n3 are 1, 4, and 10. If n3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the cases:\n\n1. If both n5 = 1 and n3 = 1, then G has a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup P5 and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P3. In this case, G is the direct product of P5 and P3, which is a cyclic group of order 15, C15. But this contradicts the assumption that G has order 60.\n\n2. If n5 = 6 and n3 = 1, then G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P3. Let P5 be any Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Then the product of P3 and P5 has order 15, and G is a semi-direct product of P3 and P5. In this case, G is isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\n3. If n5 = 1 and n3 = 4 or 10, then G has a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup P5. Let P3 be any Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then the product of P5 and P3 has order 15, and G is a semi-direct product of P5 and P3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the symmetric group S5.\n\n4. If n5 = 6 and n3 = 4 or 10, then G has no unique normal Sylow subgroups. In this case, G is non-abelian and not isomorphic to either S5 or A5 × C2. However, this case does not occur for groups of order 60.\n\nThus, every group of order 60 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the non-abelian groups of order 60 (S5 or A5 × C2)."
