Using a mathematical model, what is the optimal route the delivery truck should take if the distances between the locations are as follows:\n\n- Location 1 to Location 2: 10 km\n- Location 1 to Location 3: 15 km\n- Location 1 to Location 4: 20 km\n- Location 1 to Location 5: 25 km\n- Location 2 to Location 3: 12 km\n- Location 2 to Location 4: 18 km\n- Location 2 to Location 5: 22 km\n- Location 3 to Location 4: 8 km\n- Location 3 to Location 5: 16 km\n- Location 4 to Location 5: 10 km\n\nWhat is the optimal route and how long is it?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance of all possible routes and choose the shortest one. There are 5 locations, so there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible routes.
