    "message_2": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 462 and 936 using the Euclidean Algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (936) by the smaller number (462) and find the remainder.\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0. The GCF is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\nStep 1:\n936 รท 462 = 2 with a remainder of 12\n\nStep 2:\nReplace 936 with 462 and 462 with 12\n\nStep 3:\n462 รท 12 = 38 with a remainder of 6\n\nReplace 462 with 12 and 12 with 6\n\n12 รท 6 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder, which is 6, is the GCF of 462 and 936. Therefore, the greatest common factor of 462 and 936 is 6."
