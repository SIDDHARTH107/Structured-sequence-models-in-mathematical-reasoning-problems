    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. Since 27 = 3^3, there is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which we will denote as P. The Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of G (which is 27) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G.\n\nSince there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let's denote this subgroup as P. The order of P is 3^2 = 9, so P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. If P is isomorphic to C9, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, as G is generated by the elements of P and an element outside of P. If P is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of elements of order 3 in G. If G is isomorphic to C27, then there are exactly 9 elements of order 3 in G, as every element of order 3 generates a subgroup of order 9, and there are 9 such subgroups in C27. If G is a non-abelian group of order 27, then P is isomorphic to C3 × C3, and there are 2 * 2 = 4 elements of order 3 in P. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, the number of elements of order 3 in G is a multiple of 4.\n\nThus, if we can calculate the number of elements of order 3 in G, we can determine whether G is isomorphic to C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27. By the Cauchy theorem, G has an element of order 3, say x. The subgroup generated by x has order 9, and there are 9 - 1 = 8 non-identity elements in this subgroup. Each of these 8 elements has order 3, as they are all powers of x. Therefore, there are at least 8 elements of order 3 in G.\n\nSince the number of elements of order 3 in G is a multiple of 4, there must be at least 12 elements of order 3 in G. However, this contradicts the fact that there are only 9 elements of order 3 in C27. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C27, and it must be the non-abelian group of order 27."
