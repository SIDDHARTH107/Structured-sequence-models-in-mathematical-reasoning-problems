    "message_2": "To analyze the function f(x) = 2sin(x + pi/3), we will first find the amplitude, period, and phase shift.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which in this case is 2. So, the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of the sine function is 2pi. Since there is no coefficient of x inside the sine function, the period remains 2pi.\n\nPhase Shift: The phase shift is determined by the value inside the sine function. In this case, it is x + pi/3. To find the phase shift, we set the value inside the sine function to 0 and solve for x:\n\nx + pi/3 = 0\nx = -pi/3\n\nSo, the phase shift is -pi/3.\n\nNow, let's find the x and y intercepts:\n\nx-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we set f(x) to 0 and solve for x:\n\n2sin(x + pi/3) = 0\nsin(x + pi/3) = 0\n\nThe sine function is 0 at integer multiples of pi. So,\n\nx + pi/3 = n*pi (where n is an integer)\n\nx = n*pi - pi/3\n\nThe x-intercepts occur at x = n*pi - pi/3 for integer values of n.\n\ny-intercept: To find the y-intercept, we set x to 0 and solve for f(x):\n\nf(0) = 2sin(0 + pi/3)\nf(0) = 2sin(pi/3)\nf(0) = 2*(√3/2)\nf(0) = √3\n\nThe y-intercept is at (0, √3).\n\nFinally, let's find the x values where the maximum and minimum values occur. The maximum value of the sine function occurs at pi/2 and the minimum value occurs at 3pi/2. So, we set the value inside the sine function to pi/2 and 3pi/2 and solve for x:\n\nFor maximum value:\nx + pi/3 = pi/2\nx = pi/2 - pi/3\nx = pi/6\n\nFor minimum value:\nx + pi/3 = 3pi/2\nx = 3pi/2 - pi/3\nx = 7pi/6\n\nSo, the maximum value occurs at x = pi/6 and the minimum value occurs at x = 7pi/6.\n\nIn summary:\n- Amplitude: 2\n- Period: 2pi\n- Phase Shift: -pi/3\n- x-intercepts: x = n*pi - pi/3 (for integer values of n)\n- y-intercept: (0, √3)\n- Maximum value at x = pi/6\n- Minimum value at x = 7pi/6"
