    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the message in a zigzag pattern along the rails:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A H A I I T\n  T   M   C\n\n2. Read the message along the rails from left to right, top to bottom:\n\nMEAS AHAIT TMC\n\n3. Combine the message into a single string:\n\nMEASAHAITTMC\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails is \"MEASAHAITTMC\"."
