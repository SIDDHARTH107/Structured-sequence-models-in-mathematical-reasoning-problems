    "message_2": "Let G be a group with 8 elements. We will prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of elements of each order in G.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 8. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\nThere is exactly one element of order 1, which is the identity element e.\n\nStep 2: Consider the case where G has an element of order 8.\n\nIf G has an element of order 8, say a, then G is generated by a, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nStep 3: Consider the case where G has no element of order 8 but has an element of order 4.\n\nLet a be an element of order 4 in G. Then the subgroup H = {e, a, a^2, a^3} is a cyclic subgroup of G with order 4. Since the index of H in G is 2, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let b be an element in G that is not in H. Since the order of b cannot be 8 (by assumption), the order of b must be either 1, 2, or 4. Since b is not in H, the order of b cannot be 1 or 4. Therefore, the order of b is 2.\n\nConsider the element ab. Since H is normal in G, (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2 = a^2 * e = a^2 is in H. Since a^2 is not the identity, the order of ab is 4. Thus, G has another element of order 4 outside of H.\n\nNow, G has at least five elements of order 4: e, a, a^2, a^3, and ab. Since G has only 8 elements, there can be at most 3 more elements of order 4. Therefore, G has exactly 1, 2, or 3 elements of order 2.\n\nIf G has exactly one element of order 2, then G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIf G has more than one element of order 2, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\nStep 4: Consider the case where G has no elements of order 8 or 4.\n\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G have order 2. By the Cauchy's theorem, G has an element of order 2, say a. Then G has a subgroup H = {e, a} of order 2. Since the index of H in G is 4, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nLet b be an element in G that is not in H. Then the order of b is 2, and the subgroup K = {e, b} is another subgroup of G with order 2. Since H and K have trivial intersection, the product HK has order 4. However, this contradicts the assumption that G has no elements of order 4.\n\nTherefore, G must have an element of order 8 or an element of order 4, and we have already shown that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4 in those cases."
