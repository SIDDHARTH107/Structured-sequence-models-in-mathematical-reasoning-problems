    "message_2": "To verify if (A x B)' = A' x B' and (A x C)' = A' x C', we first need to find the Cartesian products A x B and A x C, and then find their complements. After that, we will find the complements of sets A, B, and C, and then find the Cartesian products A' x B' and A' x C'. Finally, we will compare the results.\n\n1. Find A x B and A x C:\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\nA x C = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\n2. Find the complements of A x B and A x C:\nSince the Cartesian products are pairs of integers, we can assume the universal set U to be the set of all pairs of integers from 1 to 3, i.e., U = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}.\n\n(A x B)' = U - A x B = {(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\n(A x C)' = U - A x C = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\n3. Find the complements of sets A, B, and C:\nAssuming the universal set U' to be the set of integers from 1 to 3, i.e., U' = {1, 2, 3}.\nA' = U' - A = {3}\nB' = U' - B = {1}\nC' = U' - C = {}\n\n4. Find A' x B' and A' x C':\nA' x B' = {(3,1)}\nA' x C' = {} (since C' is an empty set)\n\n5. Compare the results:\n(A x B)' = {(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)} ≠ A' x B' = {(3,1)}\n(A x C)' = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)} ≠ A' x C' = {}\n\nThus, (A x B)' ≠ A' x B' and (A x C)' ≠ A' x C'."
