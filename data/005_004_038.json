    "message_1": "Suppose a researcher wants to investigate the effect of three different brands of fertilizer on the growth of tomatoes. The tomatoes are randomly divided into three groups, with each group receiving a different fertilizer. After 1 month, the heights of the tomato plants were measured and the results are shown in the table below. \n\nBrand A: 20, 22, 24, 21, 23\n\nBrand B: 24, 25, 23, 22, 26\n\nBrand C: 19, 19, 17, 20, 18\n\nUsing ANOVA, investigate if there is a significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants among the three brands of fertilizer at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we first need to calculate the means, sum of squares, and other necessary values.\n\n1. Calculate the mean height for each brand:\n\nBrand A: (20 + 22 + 24 + 21 + 23) / 5 = 110 / 5 = 22\nBrand B: (24 + 25 + 23 + 22 + 26) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24\nBrand C: (19 + 19 + 17 + 20 + 18) / 5 = 93 / 5 = 18.6\n\n2. Calculate the overall mean height:\n\n(110 + 120 + 93) / 15 = 323 / 15 ≈ 21.53\n\n3. Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB):\n\nSSB = 5 * (22 - 21.53)^2 + 5 * (24 - 21.53)^2 + 5 * (18.6 - 21.53)^2\nSSB ≈ 5 * (0.47)^2 + 5 * (2.47)^2 + 5 * (-2.93)^2\nSSB ≈ 5 * 0.2209 + 5 * 6.1009 + 5 * 8.5849\nSSB ≈ 1.1045 + 30.5045 + 42.9245\nSSB ≈ 74.5335\n\n4. Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW):\n\nSSW = Σ(Height_i - Mean_Brand)^2 for each brand\n\nFor Brand A: (20-22)^2 + (22-22)^2 + (24-22)^2 + (21-22)^2 + (23-22)^2 = 6\nFor Brand B: (24-24)^2 + (25-24)^2 + (23-24)^2 + (22-24)^2 + (26-24)^2 = 6\nFor Brand C: (19-18.6)^2 + (19-18.6)^2 + (17-18.6)^2 + (20-18.6)^2 + (18-18.6)^2 ≈ 5.2\n\nSSW = 6 + 6 + 5.2 = 17.2\n\n5. Calculate the degrees of freedom:\n\nBetween groups: df1 = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\nWithin groups: df2 = N - k = 15 - 3 = 12\n\n6. Calculate the mean square values:\n\nMSB (Mean Square Between) = SSB / df1 = 74.5335 / 2 ≈ 37.2668\nMSW (Mean Square Within) = SSW / df2 = 17.2 / 12 ≈ 1.4333\n\n7. Calculate the F statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 37.2668 / 1.4333 ≈ 25.98\n\n8. Determine the critical F value:\n\nUsing an F-distribution table and a significance level of 0.05, we find the critical F value for df1 = 2 and df2 = 12 is F(2,12) = 3.89.\n\n9. Compare the F statistic to the critical F value:\n\nSince the calculated F statistic (25.98) is greater than the critical F value (3.89), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants among the three brands of fertilizer.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAt a significance level of 0.05, there is a significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants among the three brands of fertilizer."
