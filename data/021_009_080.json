    "message_1": "Suppose you are trying to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 using the gradient descent method. Starting with an initial value of x0 = 0, determine the next 3 values of x (x1, x2, and x3) using a step size of 0.1 and a tolerance level of 0.001.",
    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient at any point x.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 4x + 5) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent update rule to find the next values of x:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - α * f'(x_n)\n\nwhere α is the step size (0.1 in this case) and x_n is the current value of x.\n\nLet's find the next 3 values of x:\n\nx0 = 0\n\nx1 = x0 - 0.1 * f'(x0) = 0 - 0.1 * (2*0 - 4) = 0 + 0.4 = 0.4\n\nx2 = x1 - 0.1 * f'(x1) = 0.4 - 0.1 * (2*0.4 - 4) = 0.4 + 0.32 = 0.72\n\nx3 = x2 - 0.1 * f'(x2) = 0.72 - 0.1 * (2*0.72 - 4) = 0.72 + 0.256 = 0.976\n\nSo, the next 3 values of x are x1 = 0.4, x2 = 0.72, and x3 = 0.976."
