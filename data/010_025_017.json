    "message_2": "Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) are a class of quantum field theories that are invariant under continuous deformations of the underlying space. In the context of this problem, we are asked to determine the number of different types of TQFTs that can be constructed on a topological space X with 5 connected components.\n\nThe Atiyah-Segal axioms for TQFTs provide a framework for understanding the structure of these theories. One of the key aspects of TQFTs is that they assign a vector space to each connected component of the topological space. In our case, with 5 connected components, a TQFT would assign a vector space to each of these components.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide any information about the specific properties of the connected components or the TQFTs we are considering. As a result, it is impossible to determine the number of different types of TQFTs that can be constructed on X without more information.\n\nIn general, the number of TQFTs that can be constructed on a given topological space depends on the specific properties of the space and the TQFTs being considered. Some examples of TQFTs include Chern-Simons theory, BF theory, and Gromov-Witten theory, each of which has its own set of requirements and properties. Without more information about the topological space X and the TQFTs being considered, it is not possible to determine the number of different types of TQFTs that can be constructed on X."
