    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze its impulse response. The given function f(t) is a linear combination of sinusoids, which can be considered as the impulse response of the system. A system is stable if its impulse response is absolutely integrable, meaning that the integral of the absolute value of the impulse response over all time is finite.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 2cos(3t) + 6sin(5t) + cos(10t). To determine if the system is stable, we need to find if the integral of the absolute value of f(t) over all time is finite:\n\n∫|f(t)| dt = ∫|2cos(3t) + 6sin(5t) + cos(10t)| dt\n\nSince the functions cos(3t), sin(5t), and cos(10t) are all periodic and bounded, their absolute values are also bounded. The sum of bounded functions is also bounded. Therefore, the absolute value of f(t) is bounded.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the absolute value of f(t) over all time:\n\n∫|f(t)| dt = ∫|2cos(3t) + 6sin(5t) + cos(10t)| dt\n\nThis integral is challenging to compute directly. However, we can use the fact that the integral of a bounded function over a single period is finite. Since f(t) is a linear combination of sinusoids with periods 2π/3, 2π/5, and 2π/10, the function is periodic with a period of LCM(2π/3, 2π/5, 2π/10) = 2π.\n\nTherefore, the integral of |f(t)| over a single period is finite:\n\n∫[0 to 2π]|f(t)| dt = ∫[0 to 2π]|2cos(3t) + 6sin(5t) + cos(10t)| dt < ∞\n\nSince the function is periodic, the integral of |f(t)| over all time is also finite:\n\n∫[-∞ to ∞]|f(t)| dt < ∞\n\nThus, the system is stable because its impulse response is absolutely integrable."
