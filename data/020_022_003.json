    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $500,000 to invest in two different projects. Project A has an expected return on investment (ROI) of 25% and Project B has an expected ROI of 15%. However, due to limited resources, the company can only invest a maximum of $350,000 in Project A. \n\nWhat is the optimal resource allocation that maximizes the company's total expected ROI?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount invested in Project A and y be the amount invested in Project B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y = $500,000 (total budget)\n2. x â‰¤ $350,000 (maximum investment in Project A)\n\nWe want to maximize the total expected ROI, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal ROI = 0.25x + 0.15y\n\nFrom constraint 1, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = $500,000 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the Total ROI equation:\n\nTotal ROI = 0.25x + 0.15($500,000 - x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nTotal ROI = 0.25x + $75,000 - 0.15x\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\nTotal ROI = 0.1x + $75,000\n\nSince we want to maximize the Total ROI, we should invest as much as possible in Project A, which has a higher ROI. Therefore, we should invest the maximum allowed amount of $350,000 in Project A:\n\nx = $350,000\n\nNow, find the corresponding investment in Project B using the expression for y:\n\ny = $500,000 - x = $500,000 - $350,000 = $150,000\n\nSo, the optimal resource allocation is to invest $350,000 in Project A and $150,000 in Project B. To find the maximum total expected ROI, plug these values into the Total ROI equation:\n\nTotal ROI = 0.1($350,000) + $75,000 = $35,000 + $75,000 = $110,000"
