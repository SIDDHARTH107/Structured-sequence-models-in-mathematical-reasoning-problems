    "message_2": "Let A be the set of integers from 1 to 10, inclusive. That is, A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all integers that are not in A. Since A contains all integers from 1 to 10, A' contains all integers that are not in the range of 1 to 10.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A'. By definition, the intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nSince A contains all integers from 1 to 10 and A' contains all integers that are not in the range of 1 to 10, there are no common elements between A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and A', A ∩ A', is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nProof:\n\nTo prove that A ∩ A' = ∅, we need to show that for any integer x, if x is in A, then x is not in A', and vice versa.\n\nLet x be an integer in A. Since A contains all integers from 1 to 10, x must be in the range of 1 to 10. By definition of the complement, A' contains all integers that are not in the range of 1 to 10. Therefore, x cannot be in A'. This shows that if x is in A, then x is not in A'.\n\nSimilarly, let x be an integer in A'. Since A' contains all integers that are not in the range of 1 to 10, x must not be in the range of 1 to 10. By definition of A, A contains all integers from 1 to 10. Therefore, x cannot be in A. This shows that if x is in A', then x is not in A.\n\nSince we have shown that for any integer x, if x is in A, then x is not in A', and if x is in A', then x is not in A, we can conclude that A ∩ A' = ∅."
