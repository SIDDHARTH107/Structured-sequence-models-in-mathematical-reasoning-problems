    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a flood occurring in the next 10 years, we can use the complementary probability method. This means we will first calculate the probability of no floods occurring in the next 10 years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no flood occurring in a single year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor 10 years, the probability of no floods occurring in all 10 years is (0.95)^10.\n\n(0.95)^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one flood occurring in the next 10 years.\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability of a flood occurring in the next 10 years is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
