    "message_2": "A second-order formula is a formula that quantifies over predicates or functions, rather than just individual variables. In this case, we are considering a predicate symbol that takes two variables. Let's denote this predicate symbol as P(x, y).\n\nThere are several ways to construct second-order formulas using this predicate symbol, and we will consider the distinct formulas that can be generated.\n\n1. Atomic formulas: These are formulas that involve the predicate symbol P(x, y) and two variables. There is only one such formula: P(x, y).\n\n2. Quantified formulas: These are formulas that involve quantifiers over the variables x and y. We can have the following quantified formulas:\n\n   a. ∀x P(x, y)\n   b. ∀y P(x, y)\n   c. ∃x P(x, y)\n   d. ∃y P(x, y)\n   e. ∀x∀y P(x, y)\n   f. ∀x∃y P(x, y)\n   g. ∃x∀y P(x, y)\n   h. ∃x∃y P(x, y)\n\n3. Formulas with logical connectives: We can create more complex formulas by using logical connectives like ∧ (and), ∨ (or), → (implies), and ¬ (not). However, since we are only considering distinct formulas, we will not include formulas that can be reduced to simpler forms or are equivalent to the ones we already listed. For example, ¬¬P(x, y) is equivalent to P(x, y), so we won't count it as a distinct formula.\n\nConsidering the atomic and quantified formulas, we have a total of 1 + 8 = 9 distinct second-order formulas that can be constructed using a predicate symbol that takes two variables."
