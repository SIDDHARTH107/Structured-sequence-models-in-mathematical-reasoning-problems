    "message_1": "Consider a European call option on a non-dividend paying stock with a strike price of $50, maturity of 6 months and a volatility of 0.2. The current stock price is $55 and the risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum. Using the Black-Scholes equation, find the price of the call option.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to calculate the following variables:\n\n1. d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ^2/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\n2. d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n3. Call option price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nWhere:\nS = current stock price = $55\nK = strike price = $50\nT = time to maturity = 0.5 years (6 months)\nσ = volatility = 0.2\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.05\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nln(x) = natural logarithm of x\n\nLet's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(55/50) + (0.05 + 0.2^2/2) * 0.5) / (0.2 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = (0.09531 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 0.5) / (0.2 * 0.70711)\nd1 = (0.09531 + 0.035) / 0.14142\nd1 ≈ 0.922\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = 0.922 - 0.2 * 0.70711\nd2 ≈ 0.780\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in cumulative distribution function. For this example, we'll use approximate values:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.821\nN(d2) ≈ 0.782\n\nFinally, let's calculate the call option price:\n\nCall option price = 55 * 0.821 - 50 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * 0.782\nCall option price = 45.155 - 50 * 0.97531 * 0.782\nCall option price ≈ 45.155 - 38.076\nCall option price ≈ $7.08\n\nSo, the price of the European call option is approximately $7.08."
