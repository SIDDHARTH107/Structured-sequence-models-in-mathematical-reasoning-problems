    "message_1": "A graph has 6 vertices and each vertex can be colored either red, green or blue. In addition, no two adjacent vertices can have the same color. How many different ways are there to color the vertices of the graph according to these conditions?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the structure of the graph. The number of ways to color the vertices depends on the connections between the vertices (i.e., the edges of the graph). \n\nFor example, if the graph is a cycle with 6 vertices, the number of ways to color it would be different than if the graph is a tree with 6 vertices. Please provide more information about the graph's structure or the connections between the vertices."
