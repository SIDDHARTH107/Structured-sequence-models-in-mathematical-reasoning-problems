    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct items into k non-empty indistinguishable groups. In this case, we want to find the number of ways to divide 10 distinct items into 3 indistinguishable groups, so we need to find S(10, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(10, 3), we first need to find the values for S(9, 3), S(9, 2), S(8, 3), S(8, 2), and so on. We can use the following table to calculate these values:\n\nn\\k | 1 | 2 | 3\n----------------\n1 | 1 | 0 | 0\n2 | 1 | 1 | 0\n3 | 1 | 3 | 1\n4 | 1 | 7 | 6\n5 | 1 | 15 | 25\n6 | 1 | 31 | 90\n7 | 1 | 63 | 301\n8 | 1 | 127 | 966\n9 | 1 | 255 | 3025\n10 | 1 | 511 | 9330\n\nFrom the table, we can see that S(10, 3) = 9330. Therefore, there are 9330 ways to divide 10 distinct items into 3 indistinguishable groups using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
