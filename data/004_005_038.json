    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0 with initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 1, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the given differential equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = ±√(-4)\nr = ±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution of the given differential equation is in the form:\n\ny(x) = e^(αx) (A * cos(βx) + B * sin(βx))\n\nIn our case, α = 0 and β = 2, so the general solution is:\n\ny(x) = A * cos(2x) + B * sin(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions.\n\n1. y(0) = 2:\n\ny(0) = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\n2 = A * 1 + B * 0\nA = 2\n\n2. y'(0) = 1:\n\nTo find y'(x), we need to differentiate y(x) with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = -2A * sin(2x) + 2B * cos(2x)\n\nNow, we use the initial condition y'(0) = 1:\n\ny'(0) = -2A * sin(0) + 2B * cos(0)\n1 = -2 * 2 * 0 + 2B * 1\n1 = 2B\nB = 1/2\n\nSo, the solution of the given differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = 2 * cos(2x) + (1/2) * sin(2x)"
