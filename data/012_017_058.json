    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in which every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In order to have a perfect matching, there must be an even number of vertices, which is the case here with 6 vertices.\n\nNow, let's apply the Tutte's theorem to determine if a perfect matching exists in this graph. Tutte's theorem states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of vertices in G, the number of odd components (components with an odd number of vertices) in G - U is less than or equal to |U|.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the number of edges in the graph would be C(6, 2) = 15, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. However, our graph has only 9 edges, which means it is not a complete graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we remove a vertex from the graph. In this case, we have 5 vertices left. The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10. However, since our graph has only 9 edges, removing a vertex will result in a graph with fewer than 9 edges. This means that there will always be at least one vertex with a degree less than the maximum possible degree for a graph with 5 vertices, which is 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we remove two vertices from the graph. In this case, we have 4 vertices left. The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 4 vertices is C(4, 2) = 6. Since our graph has 9 edges, removing two vertices will result in a graph with at least 3 edges. This means that there will always be at least one component with an even number of vertices.\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude that for every subset U of vertices in the graph, the number of odd components in the graph minus U is less than or equal to |U|. Therefore, by Tutte's theorem, a perfect matching exists in this graph."
