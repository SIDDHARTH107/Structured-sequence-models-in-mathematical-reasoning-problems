    "message_1": "A circus performance has 10 different acts, and each act has a 0.2 probability of involving acrobats. What is the probability that at least 2 of the acts will involve acrobats?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 acts involving acrobats, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of 0 or 1 act involving acrobats. \n\nProbability of 0 acts involving acrobats:\nEach act has a 0.8 probability of not involving acrobats (1 - 0.2 = 0.8).\nP(0 acts) = 0.8^10 ≈ 0.1074\n\nProbability of 1 act involving acrobats:\nWe can use the binomial probability formula: P(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\nwhere n = 10 (total acts), x = 1 (number of acts involving acrobats), p = 0.2 (probability of an act involving acrobats), and C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time.\n\nC(10, 1) = 10 (10 ways to choose 1 act out of 10)\nP(1 act) = 10 * 0.2^1 * 0.8^9 ≈ 0.2684\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\nP(at least 2 acts) = 1 - P(0 acts) - P(1 act) ≈ 1 - 0.1074 - 0.2684 ≈ 0.6242\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 of the acts will involve acrobats is approximately 0.6242 or 62.42%."
