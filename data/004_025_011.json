    "message_1": "A car is initially travelling at 10 m/s and then its brakes are applied for 3 seconds, causing it to decelerate uniformly at a rate of 2 m/s^2. What is the distance the car travels during the braking?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following equation of motion:\n\nfinal_velocity = initial_velocity + (acceleration × time)\n\nwhere\ninitial_velocity = 10 m/s (given)\nacceleration = -2 m/s² (deceleration is given as 2 m/s², so acceleration is -2 m/s²)\ntime = 3 seconds (given)\n\nNow, let's find the final velocity:\n\nfinal_velocity = 10 + (-2 × 3)\nfinal_velocity = 10 - 6\nfinal_velocity = 4 m/s\n\nNow, we can use another equation of motion to find the distance traveled during braking:\n\ndistance = initial_velocity × time + 0.5 × acceleration × time²\n\nwhere\ninitial_velocity = 10 m/s\ntime = 3 seconds\nacceleration = -2 m/s²\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\ndistance = 10 × 3 + 0.5 × (-2) × 3²\ndistance = 30 - 0.5 × (-2) × 9\ndistance = 30 + 9\ndistance = 39 meters\n\nSo, the car travels a distance of 39 meters during the braking."
