    "message_1": "A hot air balloon is ascending vertically at a constant speed of 5 m/s. At a certain height above the ground, the angle of elevation to the nearest building is 60º and it is decreasing at a rate of 0.02 radians per minute. How fast is the balloon ascending when it is 100 meters above the ground? (Assume that the building is vertical and its height is negligible compared to the distance from the balloon to the building)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the balloon as h(t) and the horizontal distance from the balloon to the building as x(t). We are given that the rate of change of the angle of elevation, θ(t), is -0.02 radians per minute. We want to find the rate of change of the height of the balloon, dh/dt, when h(t) = 100 meters.\n\nWe know that the balloon is ascending vertically at a constant speed of 5 m/s. Since 1 minute has 60 seconds, the rate of change of the height of the balloon is dh/dt = 5 * 60 = 300 m/min.\n\nNow, let's use the angle of elevation to relate h(t) and x(t). We know that:\n\ntan(θ(t)) = h(t) / x(t)\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to time t, we get:\n\n(sec(θ(t)))^2 * dθ/dt = (x(t) * dh/dt - h(t) * dx/dt) / (x(t))^2\n\nWe are given that dθ/dt = -0.02 radians per minute. We also know that when h(t) = 100 meters, θ(t) = 60º = π/3 radians. We can use this information to find x(t) when h(t) = 100 meters:\n\ntan(π/3) = 100 / x(t)\n√3 = 100 / x(t)\nx(t) = 100 / √3\n\nNow, we can plug in the known values into the equation we derived:\n\n(sec(π/3))^2 * (-0.02) = (100 / √3 * 300 - 100 * dx/dt) / (100 / √3)^2\n\n(4/3) * (-0.02) = (30000 / √3 - 100 * dx/dt) / (10000 / 3)\n\nSolving for dx/dt, we get:\n\ndx/dt = 30000 / √3 - (4/3) * (-0.02) * (10000 / 3)\n\ndx/dt ≈ 17320.51 - 26.67\ndx/dt ≈ 17393.84 m/min\n\nHowever, the question asks for the rate at which the balloon is ascending, which we already found to be dh/dt = 300 m/min. The horizontal rate of change, dx/dt, is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nThe balloon is ascending at a rate of 300 m/min when it is 100 meters above the ground."
