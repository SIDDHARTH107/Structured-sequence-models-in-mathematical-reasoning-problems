    "message_2": "To determine if f is continuous at x = 0, we need to check if the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 exists and is equal to f(0). Recall that a function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function as it approaches that point exists and is equal to the value of the function at that point.\n\nIn this case, f(0) = 0. Now, let's consider the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0:\n\nlim (x -> 0) f(x) = lim (x -> 0) (1/x)\n\nAs x approaches 0, the value of 1/x increases without bound (i.e., it goes to infinity). Therefore, the limit does not exist:\n\nlim (x -> 0) (1/x) = âˆž\n\nSince the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 does not exist, f is not continuous at x = 0."
