    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch island after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Original Length * (4^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the original length is 5 cm, and we want to find the perimeter after 5 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = 5 * (4^5)\nPerimeter = 5 * (1024)\nPerimeter = 5120 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is 5120 cm."
