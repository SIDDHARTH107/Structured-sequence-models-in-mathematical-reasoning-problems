The sum of the bottleneck capacities will give us the maximum flow.\n\n1. First Augmenting Path: A -> B -> D\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(5, 7) = 5\n\n2. Second Augmenting Path: A -> C -> D\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(3, 1) = 1\n\n3. Third Augmenting Path: A -> C -> B -> D\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(2, 4) = 2\n\nThere are no more augmenting paths. So, the maximum flow from node A to node D is the sum of the bottleneck capacities:\n\nMaximum Flow = 5 + 1 + 2 = 8"
