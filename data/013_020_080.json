    "message_1": "Consider the following Beauty Contest Game: \n- There are 100 players who have to pick a number between 0 and 100. \n- The winner will be the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers picked. \n- If two or more players pick the same number, the prize will be split evenly among them.\n\nWhat number should you pick in order to win the game?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game, you should try to predict the average number chosen by the other players and then pick 2/3 of that average. This is because the winning number is determined by the 2/3 of the average of all numbers picked.\n\nIf all players choose their numbers randomly and uniformly between 0 and 100, the average would be around 50. In this case, you should pick 2/3 * 50 = 33.33. However, other players might also use this strategy, so you should consider that they might pick 33.33 as well. \n\nAssuming that the other players also think this way and choose 33.33, the new average would be around 33.33, and you should pick 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22. This process can be iterated several times, but it converges quickly.\n\nIn practice, the best number to pick depends on how deeply you think the other players will analyze the game. If you believe most players will choose randomly, picking around 33 might be a good strategy. If you think most players will also use this strategy, picking around 22 might be better. Ultimately, there is no definitive answer, as the optimal choice depends on the behavior of the other players. However, picking a number in the range of 22 to 33 should give you a reasonable chance of winning."
