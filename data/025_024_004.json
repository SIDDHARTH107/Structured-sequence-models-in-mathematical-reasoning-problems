    "message_1": "Consider the following set of points in the plane: {(0,0), (2,2), (3,1)}. What is the equation of the line that passes through the origin and divides this set of points into two sets of equal area?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the points as A(0,0), B(2,2), and C(3,1). We are looking for a line that passes through the origin (A) and divides the triangle ABC into two smaller triangles with equal areas.\n\nLet D be the point on the line segment BC such that the line AD divides the triangle ABC into two triangles with equal areas. Let the equation of the line AD be y = mx, where m is the slope.\n\nThe area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the determinant formula:\n\nArea(ABC) = (1/2) |(x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B))|\nArea(ABC) = (1/2) |(0(2 - 1) + 2(1 - 0) + 3(0 - 2))|\nArea(ABC) = (1/2) |-6| = 3\n\nSince the line AD divides the triangle ABC into two equal areas, the area of each smaller triangle is 3/2.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point D. Let D have coordinates (x_D, y_D). Since D lies on the line segment BC, we can use the section formula:\n\nx_D = (m_1 * x_2 + m_2 * x_1) / (m_1 + m_2)\ny_D = (m_1 * y_2 + m_2 * y_1) / (m_1 + m_2)\n\nHere, m_1 and m_2 are the ratios in which D divides the line segment BC. Since the areas of the two smaller triangles are equal, the ratio m_1 : m_2 is 1 : 1. Therefore, m_1 = m_2 = 1.\n\nx_D = (1 * 3 + 1 * 2) / (1 + 1) = 5/2\ny_D = (1 * 1 + 1 * 2) / (1 + 1) = 3/2\n\nNow, we know that D(5/2, 3/2) lies on the line AD, and the line AD passes through the origin (0,0). We can find the slope m of the line AD:\n\nm = (y_D - y_A) / (x_D - x_A)\nm = (3/2 - 0) / (5/2 - 0) = (3/2) / (5/2) = 3/5\n\nSo, the equation of the line AD that passes through the origin and divides the set of points into two sets of equal area is:\n\ny = (3/5)x"
