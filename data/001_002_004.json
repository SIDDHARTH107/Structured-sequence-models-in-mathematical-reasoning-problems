    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2,-5) and (-3,7), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (2,-5) as (x1, y1) and (-3,7) as (x2, y2), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nm = (7 - (-5)) / (-3 - 2)\nm = (7 + 5) / (-5)\nm = 12 / (-5)\nm = -12/5\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope and one of the points (either one works, we'll use (2,-5)):\n\ny - (-5) = -12/5(x - 2)\n\nSimplify and solve for y to get the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny + 5 = -12/5(x - 2)\ny = -12/5(x - 2) - 5\n\nDistribute the -12/5:\n\ny = -12/5x + 24/5 - 5\n\nConvert the -5 to a fraction with a denominator of 5:\n\ny = -12/5x + 24/5 - 25/5\n\nCombine the constants:\n\ny = -12/5x - 1/5\n\nSo the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:\n\ny = -12/5x - 1/5"
