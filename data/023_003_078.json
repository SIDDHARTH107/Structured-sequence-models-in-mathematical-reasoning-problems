Assuming that the solution can be written as a Fourier series of the form\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n(t)\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L},$$\n\nfind the expressions for the coefficients $a_n(t)$ and the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ in terms of $f(x)$ and $k$. Then, consider the specific case where $L=1$, $k=1$, and $f(x) = x-x^2$, and plot the evolution of the temperature distribution for $t=0, 0.1, 0.4, 1$, using the first 10 terms of the Fourier series (i.e., $n=1,2,\\ldots,10$). What do you observe in the long-term behavior of the temperature distribution?\"",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the expressions for the coefficients $a_n(t)$. To do this, we will substitute the Fourier series representation of $u(x,t)$ into the heat equation and use the orthogonality of the sine functions.\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n(t)\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} = k\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n(t)\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}$$\n\nNow, differentiate both sides with respect to $t$ and $x^2$:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{da_n(t)}{dt}\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} = -k\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n(t)\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2}\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}$$\n\nWe can find $a_n(t)$ by multiplying both sides by $\\sin\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}$ and integrating over the interval $[0, L]$:\n\n$$\\int_0^L \\frac{da_n(t)}{dt}\\sin\\frac{m\\pi x}{L} dx = -k\\int_0^L a_n(t)\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2}\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\sin\\frac{m\\pi x}{L} dx$$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{da_n(t)}{dt} = -k\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2}a_n(t)$$\n\nSolving this first-order ordinary differential equation, we find:\n\n$$a_n(t) = a_n(0)e^{-k\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2}t}$$\n\nNow, we need to find $a_n(0)$, which can be done by using the initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x)$:\n\n$$a_n(0) = \\frac{2}{L}\\int_0^L f(x)\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} dx$$\n\nThus, the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ can be written as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{2}{L}\\int_0^L f(x)\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} dx\\right)e^{-k\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2}t}\\sin\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where $L=1$, $k=1$, and $f(x) = x-x^2$. We can find $a_n(0)$ as follows:\n\n$$a_n(0) = 2\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)\\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nWe can compute the first 10 coefficients $a_n(0)$ and use them to plot the evolution of the temperature distribution for $t=0, 0.1, 0.4, 1$. The long-term behavior of the temperature distribution will be dominated by the first term of the Fourier series, as the exponential decay factor will cause higher-order terms to decay faster. As a result, the temperature distribution will approach a sinusoidal shape with a single peak in the long term."
