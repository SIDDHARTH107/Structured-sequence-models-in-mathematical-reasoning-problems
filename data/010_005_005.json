Prove that A ∪ B is connected.\n\nGiven X is a topological space, A and B are two connected subsets, such that A ∩ B is nonempty. Let X be the space {a, b, c, d, e} with the topology T = {{},{a},{a,b,c,d,e},{b,d}}. Determine if the set A = {a,b,c} and B = {c,d} are connected and if A ∩ B is nonempty, is A ∪ B connected?",
    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ B is connected, we will use the following definition of connectedness: A topological space is connected if it cannot be represented as a union of two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n\nFirst, let's verify that A and B are connected subsets of X and that A ∩ B is nonempty.\n\nGiven the topology T = {{}, {a}, {a, b, c, d, e}, {b, d}}, let's consider the subsets A = {a, b, c} and B = {c, d}.\n\nFor A to be connected, it cannot be represented as a union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. The only open sets in T that contain elements of A are {a} and {a, b, c, d, e}. Since {a} is a subset of {a, b, c, d, e}, there are no disjoint nonempty open sets that can represent A. Therefore, A is connected.\n\nFor B to be connected, it cannot be represented as a union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. The only open sets in T that contain elements of B are {a, b, c, d, e} and {b, d}. Since {b, d} is a subset of {a, b, c, d, e}, there are no disjoint nonempty open sets that can represent B. Therefore, B is connected.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is nonempty. A ∩ B = {a, b, c} ∩ {c, d} = {c}, which is nonempty.\n\nNow we need to prove that A ∪ B is connected. A ∪ B = {a, b, c} ∪ {c, d} = {a, b, c, d}. Let's check if it can be represented as a union of two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n\nThe only open sets in T that contain elements of A ∪ B are {a} and {a, b, c, d, e}. Since {a} is a subset of {a, b, c, d, e}, there are no disjoint nonempty open sets that can represent A ∪ B. Therefore, A ∪ B is connected.\n\nIn conclusion, given the topological space X with the topology T, the subsets A and B are connected, A ∩ B is nonempty, and A ∪ B is connected."
