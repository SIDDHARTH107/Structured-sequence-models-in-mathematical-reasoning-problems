    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 9y = 100, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 9, which is 1. Since the GCD(7, 9) = 1, there exists a solution to the equation.\n\nNow, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers s and t such that:\n\n7s + 9t = GCD(7, 9)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n9 = 1 * 7 + 2\n7 = 3 * 2 + 1\n\nNow, we work our way back up:\n\n1 = 7 - 3 * 2\n1 = 7 - 3 * (9 - 1 * 7)\n1 = 4 * 7 - 3 * 9\n\nSo, s = 4 and t = -3. Now, we multiply both sides of the equation 7s + 9t = 1 by 100:\n\n100 = 7(4 * 100) + 9(-3 * 100)\n\nThis gives us a particular solution:\n\nx₀ = 4 * 100 = 400\ny₀ = -3 * 100 = -300\n\nNow, we can find the general solution using the formula:\n\nx = x₀ + k * (9/GCD(7, 9))\ny = y₀ - k * (7/GCD(7, 9))\n\nSince GCD(7, 9) = 1, the general solution is:\n\nx = 400 + 9k\ny = -300 - 7k\n\nFor integer values of k, this will give us all the integer solutions for x and y."
