    "message_1": "A 20-foot ladder is leaning against a wall. At a certain point in time, the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 12 feet from the wall? (Assume the ladder is always in contact with the wall).",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder has a length of 20 feet, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 12 feet.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 12 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n12^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n144 + y^2 = 400\ny^2 = 256\ny = 16\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(12)(2) + 2(16)(dy/dt) = 0\n48 + 32(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dt:\n\n32(dy/dt) = -48\ndy/dt = -48/32\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 3/2 feet per second (or 1.5 ft/s) when the base of the ladder is 12 feet from the wall."
