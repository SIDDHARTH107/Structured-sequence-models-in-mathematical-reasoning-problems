    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x - 4) / (4x + 2) using the quotient rule, we first identify the numerator function u(x) and the denominator function v(x):\n\nu(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4\nv(x) = 4x + 2\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x - 4)/dx = 4x + 3\nv'(x) = d(4x + 2)/dx = 4\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule, which states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nSubstitute the expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x) into the formula:\n\nf'(x) = ((4x + 3)(4x + 2) - (2x^2 + 3x - 4)(4)) / (4x + 2)^2\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (16x^2 + 12x + 8x + 6 - 8x^2 - 12x + 16) / (16x^2 + 16x + 4)\n\nf'(x) = (8x^2 + 20x + 22) / (16x^2 + 16x + 4)\n\nThis is the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x - 4) / (4x + 2) using the quotient rule."
