    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2 - 1)^2 - x^2, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = ∂((x^2 + y^2 - 1)^2 - x^2)/∂x = 2(x^2 + y^2 - 1)(2x) - 2x = 4x(x^2 + y^2 - 1) - 2x\n\n∂f/∂y = ∂((x^2 + y^2 - 1)^2 - x^2)/∂y = 2(x^2 + y^2 - 1)(2y) = 4y(x^2 + y^2 - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n4x(x^2 + y^2 - 1) - 2x = 0\n4y(x^2 + y^2 - 1) = 0\n\nWe can factor out 2x and 4y from the equations:\n\n2x(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 2) = 0\n4y(x^2 + y^2 - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we have two cases for each equation:\n\nCase 1: 2x = 0 => x = 0\nCase 2: 2x^2 + 2y^2 - 2 = 0 => x^2 + y^2 = 1\n\nCase 3: 4y = 0 => y = 0\nCase 4: x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 => x^2 + y^2 = 1\n\nNow, let's analyze the combinations of these cases:\n\n1. x = 0 and y = 0: This case doesn't satisfy Case 4, so it's not a critical point.\n2. x = 0 and x^2 + y^2 = 1: This case gives us two critical points: (0, 1) and (0, -1).\n3. y = 0 and x^2 + y^2 = 1: This case gives us two critical points: (1, 0) and (-1, 0).\n\nNow, let's determine the nature of these critical points using the second derivative test. We need to compute the second partial derivatives and the Hessian matrix:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = ∂(4x(x^2 + y^2 - 1) - 2x)/∂x = 12x^2 + 4y^2 - 8\n∂²f/∂y² = ∂(4y(x^2 + y^2 - 1))/∂y = 4x^2 + 12y^2 - 4\n∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂(4x(x^2 + y^2 - 1) - 2x)/∂y = 8xy\n\nThe Hessian matrix H is given by:\n\nH = | ∂²f/∂x²   ∂²f/∂x∂y |\n    | ∂²f/∂x∂y  ∂²f/∂y²  |\n\nNow, let's compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\ndet(H) = (∂²f/∂x²)(∂²f/∂y²) - (∂²f/∂x∂y)^2 = (12x^2 + 4y^2 - 8)(4x^2 + 12y^2 - 4) - (8xy)^2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the determinant and the second partial derivatives at the critical points:\n\n1. (0, 1): det(H) = 4, ∂²f/∂x² = -4 => local maximum\n2. (0, -1): det(H) = 4, ∂²f/∂x² = -4 => local maximum\n3. (1, 0): det(H) = 4, ∂²f/∂x² = -4 => local maximum\n4. (-1, 0): det(H) = 4, ∂²f/∂x² = -4 => local maximum\n\nSo, there are 4 critical points, and all of them are local maxima."
