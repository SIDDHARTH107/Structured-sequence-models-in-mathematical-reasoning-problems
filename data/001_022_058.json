    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6, we need to find the values of x when y = 0.\n\n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6\n\nBy looking at the graph, we can estimate the x-intercepts to be around -1, 1, and 3. Let's check if these values satisfy the equation:\n\nFor x = -1:\n0 = (-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) + 6\n0 = -1 - 2 + 5 + 6\n0 = 8\n\nFor x = 1:\n0 = (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 - 5(1) + 6\n0 = 1 - 2 - 5 + 6\n0 = 0\n\nFor x = 3:\n0 = (3)^3 - 2(3)^2 - 5(3) + 6\n0 = 27 - 18 - 15 + 6\n0 = 0\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are -1, 1, and 3."
