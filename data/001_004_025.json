    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x^2 + 5x + 6, we need to find two binomials (ax + b)(cx + d) such that their product equals the given polynomial.\n\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the linear term). These two numbers are 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial x^2 + 5x + 6 is (x + 2)(x + 3)."
