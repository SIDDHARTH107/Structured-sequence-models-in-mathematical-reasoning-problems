    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z^2+z}$, we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. We can factor the denominator as follows:\n\n$z^2+z = z(z+1)$\n\nSo, the denominator is equal to zero when $z=0$ or $z=-1$. These are the singularities of the function.\n\nNow, we need to classify each singularity as removable, pole, or essential. To do this, we can use the following rules:\n\n1. A singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singularity to make it continuous.\n2. A singularity is a pole if the function goes to infinity as $z$ approaches the singularity.\n3. A singularity is essential if it is neither removable nor a pole.\n\nLet's analyze each singularity:\n\n1. $z=0$: In this case, we can rewrite the function as $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z(z+1)}$. As $z$ approaches $0$, the numerator approaches $\\cos(0)=1$, while the denominator approaches $0$. Thus, the function goes to infinity as $z$ approaches $0$. Therefore, $z=0$ is a pole.\n\n2. $z=-1$: In this case, we can rewrite the function as $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z(z+1)}$. As $z$ approaches $-1$, the numerator approaches $\\cos(-1)$, which is a finite value, while the denominator approaches $0$. Thus, the function goes to infinity as $z$ approaches $-1$. Therefore, $z=-1$ is a pole.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z^2+z}$ has two singularities: $z=0$ and $z=-1$. Both singularities are poles."
