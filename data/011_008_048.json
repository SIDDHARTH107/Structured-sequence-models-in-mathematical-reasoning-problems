    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct items into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 5 distinct items and k = 3 non-empty subsets.\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we can find the number of ways to partition the set as follows:\n\nS(5, 3) = S(4, 2) + 3 * S(4, 3)\n\nNow, we need to find S(4, 2) and S(4, 3):\n\nS(4, 2) = S(3, 1) + 2 * S(3, 2)\nS(4, 3) = S(3, 2) + 3 * S(3, 3)\n\nWe need to find S(3, 1), S(3, 2), and S(3, 3):\n\nS(3, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to partition a set of 3 items into 1 non-empty subset, which is the set itself)\nS(3, 2) = 3 (since there are 3 ways to partition a set of 3 items into 2 non-empty subsets: {1, 2}, {3}; {1, 3}, {2}; {1}, {2, 3})\nS(3, 3) = 1 (since there's only one way to partition a set of 3 items into 3 non-empty subsets, which is each item in its own subset: {1}, {2}, {3})\n\nNow we can calculate S(4, 2) and S(4, 3):\n\nS(4, 2) = 1 + 2 * 3 = 1 + 6 = 7\nS(4, 3) = 3 + 3 * 1 = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nFinally, we can find S(5, 3):\n\nS(5, 3) = 7 + 3 * 6 = 7 + 18 = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct items into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
