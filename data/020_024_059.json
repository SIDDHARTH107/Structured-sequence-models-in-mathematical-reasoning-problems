If the bakery offers a 20% discount for customers who purchase 10 or more cupcakes, what is the optimal number of cupcakes they should produce and sell to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's first calculate the profit per cupcake for both regular price and discounted price.\n\nRegular price:\nSelling price: $3\nCost: $1.50\nProfit per cupcake: $3 - $1.50 = $1.50\n\nDiscounted price (20% off for 10 or more cupcakes):\nDiscounted selling price: $3 * (1 - 0.20) = $2.40\nCost: $1.50\nProfit per cupcake: $2.40 - $1.50 = $0.90\n\nNow, let's analyze the profit for different quantities of cupcakes sold.\n\nFor 1 to 9 cupcakes sold, the bakery will make a profit of $1.50 per cupcake.\n\nFor 10 or more cupcakes sold, the bakery will make a profit of $0.90 per cupcake.\n\nTo maximize profit, the bakery should aim to sell as many cupcakes as possible at the regular price (1 to 9 cupcakes) and then sell additional cupcakes at the discounted price (10 or more cupcakes).\n\nHowever, the optimal number of cupcakes to produce and sell depends on the demand from customers. If the bakery can sell a large number of cupcakes at the regular price, they should focus on producing and selling those. If the demand for cupcakes increases significantly when the discount is offered, the bakery should produce and sell more cupcakes at the discounted price to maximize their profit.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal number of cupcakes to produce and sell depends on the demand from customers at both the regular and discounted prices. The bakery should analyze their customer base and sales data to determine the best balance between regular and discounted sales to maximize their profit."
