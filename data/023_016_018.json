    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of an odd function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere b_n = (2 / π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to π.\n\nLet's compute b_n for the given function:\n\nFor -π < x < 0, f(x) = 2x:\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * ∫(2x * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0\n\nIntegrating by parts:\n\nu = 2x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(2x * (-1/n) * cos(n * x)) from -π to 0 - ∫((-1/n) * cos(n * x) * 2 dx) from -π to 0]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * 0) - (-2π/n) * cos(n * (-π)) + (2/n) * ∫(cos(n * x) dx) from -π to 0]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) + (2π/n) + (2/n) * (sin(n * x) / n) from -π to 0]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(2/n) * (sin(n * 0) - sin(n * (-π)))]\n\nb_n = (4 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π)\n\nFor 0 < x < π, f(x) = 2(x + π):\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * ∫(2(x + π) * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π\n\nIntegrating by parts:\n\nu = 2(x + π), dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(2(x + π) * (-1/n) * cos(n * x)) from 0 to π - ∫((-1/n) * cos(n * x) * 2 dx) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) - (-2π/n) * cos(n * 0) + (2/n) * ∫(cos(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2π/n) - (2/n) * (sin(n * x) / n) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2π/n) - (2/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(n * 0))]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2π/n)]\n\nNow, we need to combine the two cases:\n\nb_n = (4 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π) for -π < x < 0\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2π/n)] for 0 < x < π\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the first case does not contribute to the Fourier series. Therefore, the Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[((2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2π/n)]) * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the series when x = π/4:\n\nf(π/4) = ∑[((2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2π/n)]) * sin(n * π/4)]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, we can rewrite the series as:\n\nf(π/4) = ∑[((2 / π) * [(-2π/n) * (-1)^n + (2π/n)]) * sin(n * π/4)]\n\nNow, we can plug in x = π/4 and evaluate the series. However, this series does not have a closed-form expression, so we can only approximate the sum by taking a finite number of terms. The more terms we take, the better the approximation will be."
