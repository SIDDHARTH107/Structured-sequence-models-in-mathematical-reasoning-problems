    "message_1": "What is the volume of a torus with a major radius of 6 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm?",
    "message_2": "The volume of a torus can be found using the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * (minor radius)^2) * (2 * π * major radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is 6 cm and the minor radius (r) is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * (3 cm)^2) * (2 * π * 6 cm)\n\nVolume = (π * 9 cm^2) * (12π cm)\n\nVolume = 108π^2 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 339.29 cm^3."
