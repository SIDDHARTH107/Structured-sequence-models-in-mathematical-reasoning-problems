    "message_1": "A company produces two products, X and Y. The profit per unit of X and Y are $8 and $10, respectively. The production process of X requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of man time, while production process of Y requires 1 hour of machine time and 3 hours of man time. The company has 200 hours of machine time and 180 hours of man time available per week. The company wants to know the number of units to be produced to maximize the profit while satisfying the time constraints. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit per week and the corresponding number of units of X and Y to be produced?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 8x + 10y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the available machine and man hours:\n2x + y ≤ 200 (machine time constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 180 (man time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as follows:\ny ≤ 200 - 2x\ny ≤ (180 - x) / 3\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region where all constraints are satisfied. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 60), (60, 40), and (100, 0).\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = $0\nP(0, 60) = 8(0) + 10(60) = $600\nP(60, 40) = 8(60) + 10(40) = $1040\nP(100, 0) = 8(100) + 10(0) = $800\n\nThe maximum profit is $1040 per week, which occurs when the company produces 60 units of product X and 40 units of product Y."
