    "message_2": "To determine whether the given graph is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn our case, we have V = 10 and E = 15. We need to check if there exists a value of F such that the equation holds true.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 10 + 15\nF = 7\n\nNow, we need to check if the value of F satisfies the inequality derived from the planar graph conditions. For a simple connected planar graph, the following inequality must hold:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nLet's plug in the values of V and E:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds true, which means the graph could be planar. Since we found a suitable value for F (F = 7) and the inequality is satisfied, we can conclude that the given graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges is planar."
