    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tornado occurring in a specific region in the next 5 years, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, tornadoes) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (tornadoes) in the given time period\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (tornadoes) per time period\n- k is the number of events (tornadoes) we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nIn this case, we are given that the average number of tornadoes per year is 2. Since we want to find the probability of a tornado occurring in the next 5 years, we need to adjust the average number of tornadoes for this time period. \n\nλ = 2 tornadoes/year * 5 years = 10 tornadoes\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 5 years. To do this, we can find the probability of no tornadoes occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 10^0) / 0! = e^(-10)\n\nThe probability of at least one tornado occurring in the next 5 years is:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-10) ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado occurring in the specific region in the next 5 years is approximately 99.995%."
