    "message_1": "A cone has a base radius of 7 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the cone?",
    "message_2": "The volume of a cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * π * r^2 * h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, h is the height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * π * (7^2) * 12\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 49 * 12\n\nVolume ≈ 3.14159 * 196\n\nVolume ≈ 615.752 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 615.752 cubic centimeters."
