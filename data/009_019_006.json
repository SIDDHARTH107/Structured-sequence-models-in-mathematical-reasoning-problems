    "message_1": "A particle undergoes Brownian motion such that its position at time $t$ is given by $X_t = 2W_{\\sqrt{t}} - W_t$, where $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process. What is the probability that the particle reaches a distance of at least $3$ units away from its initial position in the time interval $[0, 1]$?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the particle reaches a distance of at least 3 units away from its initial position in the time interval [0, 1], we first need to find the distribution of the position $X_t$.\n\nRecall that a standard Wiener process $W_t$ has the following properties:\n\n1. $W_0 = 0$\n2. $W_t$ has independent increments.\n3. $W_t$ has Gaussian increments, i.e., for any $0 \\le s < t$, the increment $W_t - W_s$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $t - s$.\n\nNow, let's find the mean and variance of $X_t = 2W_{\\sqrt{t}} - W_t$.\n\nMean:\n$E[X_t] = E[2W_{\\sqrt{t}} - W_t] = 2E[W_{\\sqrt{t}}] - E[W_t] = 0$\n\nVariance:\n$Var(X_t) = Var(2W_{\\sqrt{t}} - W_t) = 4Var(W_{\\sqrt{t}}) + Var(W_t) - 4Cov(W_{\\sqrt{t}}, W_t)$\n\nSince $W_t$ has Gaussian increments, the covariance between $W_{\\sqrt{t}}$ and $W_t$ is given by the minimum of the two times, i.e., $Cov(W_{\\sqrt{t}}, W_t) = \\sqrt{t}$.\n\nTherefore, the variance of $X_t$ is:\n\n$Var(X_t) = 4(\\sqrt{t}) + t - 4\\sqrt{t} = t$\n\nSo, $X_t$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $t$. In the time interval [0, 1], the position of the particle follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., $X_1 \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the particle reaches a distance of at least 3 units away from its initial position, i.e., $P(|X_1| \\ge 3)$. Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we can find the probability:\n\n$P(|X_1| \\ge 3) = 2P(X_1 \\le -3) = 2(1 - P(X_1 \\le 3))$\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, we find that $P(X_1 \\le 3) \\approx 0.9987$. Therefore,\n\n$P(|X_1| \\ge 3) = 2(1 - 0.9987) \\approx 0.0026$\n\nSo, the probability that the particle reaches a distance of at least 3 units away from its initial position in the time interval [0, 1] is approximately 0.0026 or 0.26%."
