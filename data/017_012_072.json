We will show that each of these groups is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or one of the 12 non-abelian groups of order 16.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C16. This group has order 16 and is generated by a single element of order 16. It is abelian and has the following subgroups: {1}, {1, a^8}, {1, a^4, a^8, a^12}, {1, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10, a^12, a^14}, and {1, a, a^2, ..., a^15}. This group is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nNext, let's consider the dihedral group D8. This group has order 16 and is generated by two elements, r and s, with the relations r^8 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s. It is non-abelian and has the following subgroups: {1}, {1, r^4}, {1, r^2, r^4, r^6}, {1, r, r^2, ..., r^7}, {1, s, r^4, sr}, {1, s, r^2, sr}, {1, s, r, sr}, and {1, s, r^3, sr}. This group is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian groups of order 16. There are 12 such groups, and they can be classified using the Sylow theorems and the fact that a group of order 16 must have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. These non-abelian groups can be described using generators and relations, and they are all distinct up to isomorphism.\n\nIn summary, there are 14 distinct groups of order 16: one cyclic group (C16), one dihedral group (D8), and 12 non-abelian groups. Each of these groups is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or one of the 12 non-abelian groups of order 16."
