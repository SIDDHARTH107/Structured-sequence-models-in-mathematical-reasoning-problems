    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the flow in all edges to 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path from s to t in the residual graph.\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path and update the residual capacities.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Initial flow: All edges have 0 flow.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n   Path: s -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> t\n   Minimum capacity along the path: min(3, 3, 2, 3) = 2\n\n3. Update the flow and residual capacities:\n   s -> 1: flow = 2, residual capacity = 1\n   1 -> 3: flow = 2, residual capacity = 1\n   3 -> 5: flow = 2, residual capacity = 0\n   5 -> t: flow = 2, residual capacity = 1\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n   Path: s -> 2 -> 4 -> t\n   Minimum capacity along the path: min(2, 1, 2) = 1\n\n5.

Find another augmenting path:\n   Path: s -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> t\n   Minimum capacity along the path: min(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1\n\n7. Update the flow and residual capacities:\n   s -> 1: flow = 3, residual capacity = 0\n   1 -> 2: flow = 1, residual capacity = 0\n   2 -> 4: flow = 2, residual capacity = 0\n   4 -> t: flow = 2, residual capacity = 0\n\n8. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow is the sum of the flows into the sink node t: 2 (from 5 -> t) + 2 (from 4 -> t) = 4."
