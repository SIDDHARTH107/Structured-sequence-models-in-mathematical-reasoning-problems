    "message_1": "A particle moves along a space curve given by the equation $r(t) = (t^2, t^3, 2t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Find the curvature and torsion of the curve at $t=1/2$.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position vector $r(t)$.\n\n$r(t) = (t^2, t^3, 2t)$\n\nFirst derivative:\n$r'(t) = (2t, 3t^2, 2)$\n\nSecond derivative:\n$r''(t) = (2, 6t, 0)$\n\nNow, we need to find the curvature, which is given by the formula:\n\n$κ(t) = \\frac{||r'(t) \\times r''(t)||}{||r'(t)||^3}$\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product of $r'(t)$ and $r''(t)$:\n\n$r'(t) \\times r''(t) = (2t, 3t^2, 2) \\times (2, 6t, 0) = (12t^2, -4, -6t^3 + 12t)$\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of the cross product at $t = 1/2$:\n\n$||(12(1/2)^2, -4, -6(1/2)^3 + 12(1/2))|| = ||(3, -4, 4)|| = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{41}$\n\nNext, we need to find the magnitude of $r'(t)$ at $t = 1/2$:\n\n$||r'(1/2)|| = ||(1, 3/4, 2)|| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (3/4)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{21/4}$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature at $t = 1/2$:\n\n$κ(1/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{(\\sqrt{21/4})^3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{\\frac{21\\sqrt{21}}{8}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{41}}{21\\sqrt{21}}$\n\nNow, let's find the torsion. The torsion is given by the formula:\n\n$τ(t) = \\frac{(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot r'''(t)}{||r'(t) \\times r''(t)||^2}$\n\nFirst, we need to find the third derivative of $r(t)$:\n\n$r'''(t) = (0, 6, 0)$\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the cross product and the third derivative at $t = 1/2$:\n\n$(3, -4, 4) \\cdot (0, 6, 0) = 0 - 24 + 0 = -24$\n\nFinally, let's find the torsion at $t = 1/2$:\n\n$τ(1/2) = \\frac{-24}{||3, -4, 4||^2} = \\frac{-24}{41}$\n\nSo, the curvature and torsion of the curve at $t = 1/2$ are:\n\n$κ(1/2) = \\frac{8\\sqrt{41}}{21\\sqrt{21}}$ and $τ(1/2) = \\frac{-24}{41}$."
