    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2y + y^3$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\nf_x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6xy = 3x( x - 2y)\n$$\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\nf_y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -3x^2 + 3y^2 = 3y( y - x)\n$$\n\nNow, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n3x(x - 2y) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3y(y - x) = 0\n$$\n\nFrom these equations, we get three critical points: $(0, 0)$, $(0, 0)$, and $(1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the Morse indices of these critical points. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ and evaluate it at the critical points. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\nf_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6y \\\\\nf_{xy} = f_{yx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -6x \\\\\nf_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y - 6x\n$$\n\nSo, the Hessian matrix is:\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x - 6y & -6x \\\\\n-6x & 6y - 6x\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical points:\n\n1. At $(0, 0)$:\n$$\nH(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSince the Hessian matrix is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero), we cannot determine the Morse index at this point.\n\n2. At $(1, 1)$:\n$$\nH(f)(1, 1) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -6 \\\\\n-6 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $\\lambda_1 = 6$ and $\\lambda_2 = -6$. Since there is one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue, the Morse index at $(1, 1)$ is 1.\n\nIn summary, we found two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$. The Morse index at $(1, 1)$ is 1, but we cannot determine the Morse index at $(0, 0)$ due to the singularity of the Hessian matrix."
