    "message_2": "Let G be the set of all permutations of two distinct elements from a set S with 4 elements. We can represent the elements of G as 2-cycles (i.e., transpositions) and the identity permutation. Let's denote the elements of S as {a, b, c, d}. Then, G can be represented as:\n\nG = {e, (ab), (ac), (ad), (bc), (bd), (cd)}\n\nwhere e is the identity permutation. However, this set has 7 elements, which is not of order 4. Therefore, we need to modify the problem statement to consider a group of order 4 with permutations involving two elements.\n\nLet's consider the symmetric group S_3, which has order 6, and take a subgroup H of order 4. The elements of H can be represented as:\n\nH = {e, (ab), (ac), (bc)}\n\nNow, let's check if H is a group under composition of permutations:\n\n1. Closure: The composition of any two elements in H is also in H.\n   - e * e = e\n   - e * (ab) = (ab) * e = (ab)\n   - e * (ac) = (ac) * e = (ac)\n   - e * (bc) = (bc) * e = (bc)\n   - (ab) * (ab) = e\n   - (ac) * (ac) = e\n   - (bc) * (bc) = e\n   - (ab) * (ac) = (bc) * (ab) = (bc)\n   - (ab) * (bc) = (ac) * (ab) = (ac)\n   - (ac) * (bc) = (ab) * (ac) = (ab)\n\n2. Associativity: The composition of permutations is always associative.\n\n3. Identity: The identity permutation e is in H.\n\n4. Inverse: For each element in H, its inverse is also in H.\n   - e^(-1) = e\n   - (ab)^(-1) = (ab)\n   - (ac)^(-1) = (ac)\n   - (bc)^(-1) = (bc)\n\nSince H satisfies all the group properties, it is a group under composition of permutations.\n\nNow, let's determine if H is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nC4 = {1, a, a^2, a^3} with a^4 = 1\nV4 = {e, a, b, c} with a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e and ab = c, bc = a, ac = b\n\nH is not isomorphic to C4 because there is no element in H with order 4. All non-identity elements in H have order 2.\n\nHowever, H is isomorphic to V4 because it has the same structure:\n- e^2 = e\n- (ab)^2 = e\n- (ac)^2 = e\n- (bc)^2 = e\n- (ab)(ac) = (bc)\n- (ab)(bc) = (ac)\n- (ac)(bc) = (ab)\n\nThus, the group H is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
