    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 12. These groups are:\n\n1. C12 (cyclic group of order 12)\n2. A4 (alternating group on 4 elements)\n3. D6 (dihedral group of order 12)\n4. C3 × C4 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 4)\n5. C2 × C2 × C3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 2, 2, and 3)\n\nTo show that any group of order 12 can be isomorphic to one of these groups, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 3) divides 4 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, there is either 1 or 4 such subgroups. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 4) divides 3 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2, so there is either 1 or 3 such subgroups.\n\nCase 1: There is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup and a unique 2-Sylow subgroup.\nIn this case, both subgroups are normal in G, and their intersection is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is C3 × C4.\n\nCase 2: There is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup and three 2-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal in G. Let H be a 2-Sylow subgroup. Then G acts on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation, and this action is transitive since all 2-Sylow subgroups are conjugate. The stabilizer of H in this action is a subgroup of G containing H, and by the Orbit-Stabilizer theorem, its index is 3. Thus, the stabilizer is a normal subgroup of G, and G is a semidirect product of this stabilizer and the 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the stabilizer contains a subgroup of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2. If it is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C4 and C3, which is D6. If it is isomorphic to C2 × C2, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C2 × C2 and C3, which is A4.\n\nCase 3: There are four 3-Sylow subgroups and a unique 2-Sylow subgroup.\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the possible groups are the same.\n\nCase 4: There are four 3-Sylow subgroups and three 2-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, G has no nontrivial normal subgroups. Thus, G must be a simple group. However, the only simple group of order 12 is A4, so G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 12 can be isomorphic to C12, A4, D6, C3 × C4, or C2 × C2 × C3."
