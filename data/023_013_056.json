    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve on Using the Fourier transform to solve heat transfer problems:\n\nA metal rod of length 20 cm and initial temperature 20°C is heated at one end to a temperature of 100°C. The rod is then allowed to cool at room temperature of 25°C. Given a thermal diffusivity of 0.835 x 10^-5 m²/s, determine the temperature distribution at a distance of 5 cm from the heated end of the rod after 1 minute. Use Fourier transform methods to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with Fourier transform methods. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n- Length of the rod: L = 20 cm = 0.2 m\n- Distance from the heated end: x = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n- Time: t = 1 minute = 60 s\n- Thermal diffusivity: α = 0.835 x 10^-5 m²/s\n\nNext, we need to set up the boundary and initial conditions for the problem:\n1. T(0,t) = 100°C (heated end)\n2. T(L,t) = 25°C (cool end)\n3. T(x,0) = 20°C (initial temperature)\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform method to solve the heat equation. We will apply the Fourier sine transform to the heat equation and the boundary conditions:\n\nF{∂T(x,t)/∂t} = α F{∂²T(x,t)/∂x²}\n\nwhere F denotes the Fourier sine transform. The transformed heat equation becomes:\n\n∂T*(ω,t)/∂t = -αω²T*(ω,t)\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in T*(ω,t). Solving this ODE, we get:\n\nT*(ω,t) = T*(ω,0) * exp(-αω²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier sine transform of the initial condition T(x,0) = 20°C:\n\nT*(ω,0) = F{20} = (2/L) * ∫(0 to L) 20 * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nT*(ω,0) = (40/π) * (1 - (-1)^n) / n\n\nNow, we can substitute T*(ω,0) back into the expression for T*(ω,t):\n\nT*(ω,t) = (40/π) * (1 - (-1)^n) / n * exp(-αω²t)\n\nFinally, we will apply the inverse Fourier sine transform to find the temperature distribution T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = F^(-1){T*(ω,t)} = ∑(n=1 to ∞) (40/π) * (1 - (-1)^n) / n * sin(nπx/L) * exp(-αω²t)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of x, t, and α to find the temperature distribution at a distance of 5 cm from the heated end of the rod after 1 minute:\n\nT(0.05, 60) = ∑(n=1 to ∞) (40/π) * (1 - (-1)^n) / n * sin(nπ(0.05)/0.2) * exp(-(0.835 x 10^-5)(nπ/0.2)² * 60)\n\nTo get an accurate estimate of the temperature, we can sum the first few terms of the series (e.g., up to n = 100). This will give us the temperature distribution at x = 0.05 m and t = 60 s."
