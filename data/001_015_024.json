    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 9^(2x+1) = 243, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides\nSince 9 and 243 are both powers of 3, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(3^2)^(2x+1) = 3^5\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation\nUsing the power of a power property, we can simplify the equation as:\n\n3^(4x+2) = 3^5\n\nStep 3: Set the exponents equal to each other\nSince the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n4x + 2 = 5\n\nStep 4: Solve for x\nSubtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n4x = 3\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 3/4\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 9^(2x+1) = 243 is x = 3/4."
