    "message_2": "To find the smallest non-trivial factor of the composite number 2465 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the composite number (2465 in this case).\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating their values as follows:\n   x = f(x)\n   y = f(f(y))\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n (|x - y| is the absolute value of the difference between x and y).\n5. If the GCD is 1, go back to step 3. If the GCD is equal to n, the algorithm failed. If the GCD is between 1 and n, it is a non-trivial factor of n.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to find the smallest non-trivial factor of 2465:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 2465\n2. x = 2, y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\n3. x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 2465 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 2465 = 26\n4. GCD(|5 - 26|, 2465) = GCD(21, 2465) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\n3. x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 2465 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 2465 = 1882\n4. GCD(|26 - 1882|, 2465) = GCD(1856, 2465) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\n3. x = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 2465 = 677\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(1882)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 2465 = 1882\n4. GCD(|677 - 1882|, 2465) = GCD(1205, 2465) = 5\n\nThe smallest non-trivial factor of 2465 is 5."
