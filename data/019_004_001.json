    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 3 heads in 5 flips, we need to consider the cases where we get exactly 3, 4, or 5 heads. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X=k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), q is the probability of failure (1-p, also 0.5 for a fair coin), and nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads:\n\nP(X=3) = (5C3) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^2)\nP(X=3) = (10) * (0.125) * (0.25)\nP(X=3) = 0.3125\n\nNow, let's find the probability of getting exactly 4 heads:\n\nP(X=4) = (5C4) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^1)\nP(X=4) = (5) * (0.0625) * (0.5)\nP(X=4) = 0.15625\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads:\n\nP(X=5) = (5C5) * (0.5^5) * (0.5^0)\nP(X=5) = (1) * (0.03125) * (1)\nP(X=5) = 0.03125\n\nNow, we can add these probabilities together to find the probability of getting at least 3 heads:\n\nP(X≥3) = P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5)\nP(X≥3) = 0.3125 + 0.15625 + 0.03125\nP(X≥3) = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 3 heads in 5 flips of a fair coin is 0.5 or 50%."
