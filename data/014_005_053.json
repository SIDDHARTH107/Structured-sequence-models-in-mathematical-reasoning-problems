    "message_1": "A message has been digitally signed with a private key using the RSA algorithm. The private key has a value of p=7 and q=11, while the public key has a value of e=5. The message has been converted into a numerical value of 23. Use the RSA algorithm to verify the digital signature and determine if it's valid. (Note: the modulus value is n = p*q = 77)",
    "message_2": "To verify the digital signature using the RSA algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the modulus n = p * q\n2. Calculate the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Find the decryption key d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n4. Decrypt the message using the formula: M = C^d (mod n), where C is the numerical value of the message and M is the decrypted message.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. We are given the values of p, q, and n. So, n = 7 * 11 = 77.\n\n2. Calculate the totient function φ(n):\nφ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (7-1) * (11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n\n3. Find the decryption key d:\nWe are given the value of e = 5. We need to find d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)).\nIn other words, we need to find d such that d * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 60).\nBy trial and error or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 37 satisfies this condition, as 37 * 5 = 185, and 185 ≡ 1 (mod 60).\n\n4. Decrypt the message:\nWe are given the numerical value of the message C = 23. Now, we need to calculate M = C^d (mod n).\nM = 23^37 (mod 77)\nUsing modular exponentiation, we find that M = 23^37 (mod 77) = 10\n\nThe decrypted message M is 10. Since we were able to successfully decrypt the message using the RSA algorithm, the digital signature is valid."
