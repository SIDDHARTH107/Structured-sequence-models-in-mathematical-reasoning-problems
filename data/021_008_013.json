    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) where f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 and f2(x, y) = x^3 - y. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y |\n          | 3x^2 -1 |\n\nNow, we will apply Newton's method iteratively. Let's start with an initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 1). The iterative formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nWe will apply this formula until the solution converges to 4 decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nJ(1, 1) = | 2  2 |\n          | 2 -1 |\n\nF(1, 1) = (0, 0)\n\nSince F(1, 1) = (0, 0), we have already found the solution: (x, y) = (1, 1).\n\nHowever, this is just one solution. To find another solution, let's try a different initial guess, say (x0, y0) = (2, 1).\n\nIteration 1:\nJ(2, 1) = |  4  2 |\n          | 12 -1 |\n\nF(2, 1) = (1, 7)\n\nNow we need to solve the linear system J(2, 1) * (Δx, Δy) = -(1, 7) for (Δx, Δy). We can use any method, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule. Solving this system, we get (Δx, Δy) ≈ (-0.1538, -0.3077).\n\nUpdate the guess:\n(x1, y1) = (2 - 0.1538, 1 - 0.3077) ≈ (1.8462, 0.6923)\n\nIteration 2:\nJ(1.8462, 0.6923) ≈ |  3.6924  1.3846 |\n                    | 10.2046 -1      |\n\nF(1.8462, 0.6923) ≈ (-0.0001, 0.0002)\n\nSolve J(1.8462, 0.6923) * (Δx, Δy) ≈ -(-0.0001, 0.0002) for (Δx, Δy). We get (Δx, Δy) ≈ (0.0000, -0.0001).\n\nUpdate the guess:\n(x2, y2) = (1.8462 + 0.0000, 0.6923 - 0.0001) ≈ (1.8462, 0.6922)\n\nAt this point, the solution has converged to 4 decimal places: (x, y) ≈ (1.8462, 0.6922)."
