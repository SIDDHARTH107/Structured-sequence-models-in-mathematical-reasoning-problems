    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw a graph with the given degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1). Here's one way to draw the graph:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n2. Connect vertex A to vertices B, C, and D. Now, A has a degree of 3.\n3. Connect vertex B to vertices C and E. Now, B has a degree of 3.\n4. Connect vertex C to vertex F. Now, C has a degree of 2.\n5. Connect vertex D to vertex G. Now, D has a degree of 2.\n6. Connect vertex E to vertex F. Now, E has a degree of 2.\n7. Connect vertex F to vertex G. Now, F has a degree of 2.\n8. Vertex G has a degree of 1.\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1)."
