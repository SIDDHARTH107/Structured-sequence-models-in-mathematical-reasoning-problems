Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of materials, while product B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of materials. The company has 100 labor hours and 120 materials hours available per day. If the profit for each unit of A is $5 and for each unit of B is $4, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?\n\nPlease provide the answer in terms of the number of units of product A and product B. Use matrix methods to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 100 (labor hours)\n2x + 4y ≤ 120 (materials hours)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities.\n\n1. Solve for y in terms of x in both inequalities:\n\nFor the labor hours constraint:\ny ≤ (100 - 3x) / 2\n\nFor the materials hours constraint:\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 4\n\n2. Find the intersection points of the constraints:\n\nSet the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:\n(100 - 3x) / 2 = (120 - 2x) / 4\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions:\n2(100 - 3x) = 120 - 2x\n\nExpanding and solving for x:\n200 - 6x = 120 - 2x\n4x = 80\nx = 20\n\nNow, plug x back into one of the equations to find y:\ny = (100 - 3(20)) / 2\ny = (100 - 60) / 2\ny = 40 / 2\ny = 20\n\nSo, the intersection point is (20, 20).\n\n3. Check the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nThe corner points are (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 20), and (33.33, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\nP(0, 30) = 5(0) + 4(30) = 120\nP(20, 20) = 5(20) + 4(20) = 100 + 80 = 180\nP(33.33, 0) = 5(33.33) + 4(0) ≈ 166.65\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (20, 20), with a profit of $180.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B to maximize their profit."
