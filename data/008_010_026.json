    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n|  3   2  -4 |  7  |\n|  2  -3   2 | -4  |\n| -5   1   3 |  5  |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n|  2  -3   2 | -4  |\n|  3   2  -4 |  7  |\n| -5   1   3 |  5  |\n\nStep 2: Add 3/2 * Row 1 to Row 2 and 5/2 * Row 1 to Row 3 to eliminate the first column below the pivot:\n\n|  2  -3   2 | -4  |\n|  0   5  -7 |  1  |\n|  0  -5/2  8 |  1  |\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 3 by -2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n|  2  -3   2 | -4  |\n|  0   5  -7 |  1  |\n|  0   5  -16 | -2  |\n\nStep 4: Add Row 2 to Row 3 to eliminate the second column below the pivot:\n\n|  2  -3   2 | -4  |\n|  0   5  -7 |  1  |\n|  0   0  -9 | -1  |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nRow 3: -9z = -1 => z = 1/9\n\nRow 2: 5y - 7z = 1 => 5y - 7(1/9) = 1 => y = (1 + 7/9) / 5 => y = 8/9\n\nRow 1: 2x - 3y + 2z = -4 => 2x - 3(8/9) + 2(1/9) = -4 => x = (-4 + 6/3 - 2/9) / 2 => x = -2\n\nSo, the solution is x = -2, y = 8/9, and z = 1/9."
