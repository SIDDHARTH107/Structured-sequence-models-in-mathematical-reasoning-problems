    "message_1": "A student is given an isosceles triangle with two equal sides measuring 5 inches each and an included angle of 72 degrees. What is the length of the remaining side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the remaining side of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the two equal sides are a and b, both measuring 5 inches, and the included angle C is 72 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nc² = 5² + 5² - 2(5)(5) * cos(72)\n\nc² = 25 + 25 - 50 * cos(72)\n\nNow, we need to find the cosine of 72 degrees. Using a calculator or a trigonometric table, we find that:\n\ncos(72) ≈ 0.309017\n\nPlugging this value back into the formula, we get:\n\nc² = 25 + 25 - 50 * 0.309017\n\nc² = 50 - 15.45085\n\nc² ≈ 34.54915\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √34.54915\n\nc ≈ 5.877\n\nTherefore, the length of the remaining side of the triangle is approximately 5.877 inches."
