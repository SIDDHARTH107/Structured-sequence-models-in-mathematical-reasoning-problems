    "message_2": "The Laplace transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 2t^3 - 5t^2 + 9t - 8. So, we need to find the Laplace transform of this function:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * (2t^3 - 5t^2 + 9t - 8)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nTo solve this integral, we can break it into separate integrals for each term:\n\nF(s) = 2∫(e^(-st) * t^3) dt - 5∫(e^(-st) * t^2) dt + 9∫(e^(-st) * t) dt - 8∫(e^(-st)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can use the integration by parts formula to solve each integral. The integration by parts formula is:\n\n∫(u * dv) = uv - ∫(v * du)\n\nFor the first integral, let u = t^3 and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = 3t^2 dt and v = -1/s * e^(-st). Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n∫(e^(-st) * t^3) dt = -t^3/s * e^(-st) - 3/s ∫(e^(-st) * t^2) dt\n\nWe need to apply integration by parts again for the remaining integral. Let u = t^2 and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = -1/s * e^(-st). Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n∫(e^(-st) * t^2) dt = -t^2/s * e^(-st) - 2/s ∫(e^(-st) * t) dt\n\nSimilarly, for the third integral, let u = t and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/s * e^(-st). Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n∫(e^(-st) * t) dt = -t/s * e^(-st) - 1/s ∫(e^(-st)) dt\n\nFinally, for the fourth integral, we have:\n\n∫(e^(-st)) dt = -1/s * e^(-st)\n\nNow, we can substitute these results back into the expression for F(s):\n\nF(s) = 2[-t^3/s * e^(-st) - 3/s ∫(e^(-st) * t^2) dt] - 5[-t^2/s * e^(-st) - 2/s ∫(e^(-st) * t) dt] + 9[-t/s * e^(-st) - 1/s ∫(e^(-st)) dt] - 8[-1/s * e^(-st)]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these expressions at the limits of integration (0 and infinity). Since all terms have a factor of e^(-st), as t approaches infinity, all terms will approach 0. Therefore, we only need to evaluate the expressions at t = 0:\n\nF(s) = 2[0 - 3/s * 0] - 5[0 - 2/s * 0] + 9[0 - 1/s * 1] - 8[-1/s * 1]\n\nF(s) = -9/s^2 + 8/s\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 2t^3 - 5t^2 + 9t - 8 is:\n\nF(s) = -9/s^2 + 8/s"
