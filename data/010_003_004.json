If X is normal, prove that there exist two open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. \n\nAs an example, let X be the closed interval [0, 1], A = [0, 1/3] and B = [2/3, 1]. Prove that there exist two open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.",
    "message_2": "To prove the statement, we will use the definition of normality. A topological space X is normal if for every pair of disjoint closed subsets A and B of X, there exist disjoint open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nGiven that X is a normal topological space and A, B are two disjoint closed subsets of X, by the definition of normality, there exist open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nNow, let's consider the example where X is the closed interval [0, 1], A = [0, 1/3] and B = [2/3, 1]. Since A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, we can apply the definition of normality to find open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nOne possible choice for U and V is U = (0 - ε, 1/3 + ε) and V = (2/3 - ε, 1 + ε) for some small ε > 0. We can see that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, and since 1/3 + ε < 2/3 - ε, we have U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nThus, we have shown that for a normal topological space X and disjoint closed subsets A and B, there exist open subsets U and V of X such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. In the specific example with X = [0, 1], A = [0, 1/3], and B = [2/3, 1], we found open subsets U and V that satisfy the conditions."
