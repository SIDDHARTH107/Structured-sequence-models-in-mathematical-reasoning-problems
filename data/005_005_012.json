    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected light bulb will last more than 1100 hours, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (1100 hours), μ is the mean (1000 hours), and σ is the standard deviation (50 hours).\n\nFirst, let's find the z-score:\n\nz = (1100 - 1000) / 50\nz = 100 / 50\nz = 2\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a randomly selected light bulb will have a z-score greater than 2. The table gives us the probability that a value is less than a given z-score, so we need to find the complement of the probability.\n\nP(Z > 2) = 1 - P(Z < 2)\n\nLooking up the z-score of 2 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that P(Z < 2) ≈ 0.9772.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected light bulb will last more than 1100 hours is:\n\nP(Z > 2) = 1 - 0.9772\nP(Z > 2) ≈ 0.0228\n\nSo, there is approximately a 2.28% chance that a randomly selected light bulb will last more than 1100 hours."
