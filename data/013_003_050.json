    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, Player 1 proposes a division of $100 between herself and Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the proposal, each player receives their share. However, if Player 2 rejects the proposal, neither player receives anything. If Player 2 cares only about their own payoff, what is the smallest offer Player 1 can make that Player 2 will still accept?",
    "message_2": "If Player 2 cares only about their own payoff and wants to maximize it, they will accept any offer that gives them a positive amount of money, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. Therefore, the smallest offer Player 1 can make that Player 2 will still accept is $1 (assuming we are dealing with whole dollar amounts). In this case, Player 1 would receive $99, and Player 2 would receive $1."
