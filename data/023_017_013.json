    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = cos(2x) + sin(3x) in the domain [-π, π], we will use the Fourier series representation of the function. The Fourier series of a function f(x) in the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor f(x) = cos(2x) + sin(3x), we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (cos(2x) + sin(3x)) dx = 0 (due to the symmetry of the functions)\n\nTo find a_n, we integrate:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (cos(2x) + sin(3x)) * cos(nx) dx\n\nSince cos(2x) and sin(3x) are orthogonal functions, we only need to consider the cases n = 2 and n = 3:\n\na_2 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] cos(2x) * cos(2x) dx = 1/2\na_3 = 0 (due to orthogonality)\n\nSimilarly, for b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (cos(2x) + sin(3x)) * sin(nx) dx\n\nb_2 = 0 (due to orthogonality)\nb_3 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] sin(3x) * sin(3x) dx = 1/2\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 * cos(2x) + 1/2 * sin(3x)\n\nNow, let's use the Fourier transform to solve the fluid dynamics problem. In fluid dynamics, the velocity of a fluid as it flows past an object with a cross-sectional shape given by f(x) can be determined using the Fourier series representation of the function.\n\nThe velocity potential function, Φ(x, y), can be expressed as:\n\nΦ(x, y) = Σ [A_n * cos(nx) * e^(-ny) + B_n * sin(nx) * e^(-ny)]\n\nwhere A_n and B_n are the Fourier coefficients of the velocity potential function.\n\nSince we have already found the Fourier series representation of f(x), we can use it to find the velocity potential function:\n\nΦ(x, y) = 1/2 * cos(2x) * e^(-2y) + 1/2 * sin(3x) * e^(-3y)\n\nNow, we can find the velocity components u(x, y) and v(x, y) by taking the partial derivatives of Φ(x, y) with respect to x and y, respectively:\n\nu(x, y) = ∂Φ/∂x = -2 * (1/2) * sin(2x) * e^(-2y) + 3 * (1/2) * cos(3x) * e^(-3y)\nv(x, y) = -∂Φ/∂y = 2 * (1/2) * cos(2x) * e^(-2y) + 3 * (1/2) * sin(3x) * e^(-3y)\n\nSo, the velocity of the fluid as it flows past the object with the cross-sectional shape given by f(x) = cos(2x) + sin(3x) is:\n\nu(x, y) = -sin(2x) * e^(-2y) + (3/2) * cos(3x) * e^(-3y)\nv(x, y) = cos(2x) * e^(-2y) + (3/2) * sin(3x) * e^(-3y)"
