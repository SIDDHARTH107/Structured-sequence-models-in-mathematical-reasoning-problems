    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system in matrix form. The given system can be represented as:\n\nAX = B\n\nWhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1  3 |\n    | 4  3  1 |\n    | 1  2  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 9 |\n    | 8 |\n\nNow, we will convert the coefficient matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, our matrix A doesn't have any zero elements, so we will use the given matrix as it is.\n\nNext, we will solve the system AX = B using the inverse of matrix A. If A is invertible, then the solution is given by:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. We can do this using the following steps:\n\n1. Find the determinant of A.\n2. Find the matrix of minors of A.\n3. Find the adjugate of the matrix of minors.\n4. Divide each element of the adjugate by the determinant.\n\nLet's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(3*2 - 2*1) - 1(4*2 - 1*1) + 3(4*2 - 3*1)\n       = 2(6 - 2) - 1(8 - 1) + 3(8 - 3)\n       = 2(4) - 1(7) + 3(5)\n       = 8 - 7 + 15\n       = 16\n\nNow, let's find the matrix of minors of A:\n\nM = | (3*2 - 1*2)  (4*2 - 1*1)  (4*3 - 3*1) |\n    | (1*2 - 2*2)  (2*2 - 1*1)  (2*3 - 1*1) |\n    | (1*3 - 2*1)  (2*3 - 4*1)  (2*4 - 4*1) |\n\nM = | 4  7 11 |\n    |-2  3  5 |\n    | 1 -2  4 |\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of the matrix of minors:\n\nadj(M) = |  4 -7 11 |\n         |  2  3 -5 |\n         | -1  2 -4 |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(M)\n       = (1/16) * |  4 -7 11 |\n                 |  2  3 -5 |\n                 | -1  2 -4 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n  = (1/16) * |  4 -7 11 | * | 7 |\n             |  2  3 -5 |   | 9 |\n             | -1  2 -4 |   | 8 |\n\nX = (1/16) * |  4*7 - 7*9 + 11*8 |\n             |  2*7 + 3*9 - 5*8  |\n             | -1*7 + 2*9 - 4*8  |\n\nX = (1/16) * | -3  |\n             |  1  |\n             |  3  |\n\nX = | -3/16 |\n    |  1/16 |\n    |  3/16 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -3/16\ny = 1/16\nz = 3/16"
