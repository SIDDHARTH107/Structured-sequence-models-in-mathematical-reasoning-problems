    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2+z}$ centered at $z=0$, we first factor the denominator:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z(z+1)}$\n\nNow, we use partial fraction decomposition to split the function into two simpler fractions:\n\n$\\frac{1}{z(z+1)} = \\frac{A}{z} + \\frac{B}{z+1}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $z(z+1)$, we get:\n\n$1 = A(z+1) + Bz$\n\nTo solve for $A$ and $B$, we can use the following system of equations:\n\n1. Set $z = 0$: $1 = A(0+1) + B(0) \\Rightarrow A = 1$\n2. Set $z = -1$: $1 = A(-1+1) + B(-1) \\Rightarrow B = -1$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\frac{1}{z+1}$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n1. For $\\frac{1}{z}$, the Laurent series is simply $\\frac{1}{z}$, as it is already in the desired form.\n2. For $-\\frac{1}{z+1}$, we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{z+1} = -\\frac{1}{1-(-z)} = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-z)^n = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n$\n\nCombining both expansions, we get the Laurent series for $f(z)$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n$\n\nThe annulus of convergence for the geometric series is $|z| < 1$, and since the $\\frac{1}{z}$ term converges for $z \\neq 0$, the annulus of convergence for the entire Laurent series is $0 < |z| < 1$."
