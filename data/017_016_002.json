    "message_2": "To prove that either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems and group properties.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3), G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 9, say H. Since the order of G is 27, the index of H in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G. By a theorem in group theory, this implies that G is a semi-direct product of H and some subgroup K of order 3. \n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27:\n\nIf G is cyclic, then it has an element of order 27. In this case, G is generated by this element, and G is isomorphic to C27. The multiplication table of G would be the same as the multiplication table of C27, which has a simple structure with elements {1, g, g^2, ..., g^26}, where g is a generator of G, and the product of any two elements is given by g^i * g^j = g^(i+j) (mod 27).\n\n2. G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27:\n\nIf G is not cyclic, then it does not have an element of order 27. In this case, G is a semi-direct product of H and K, where H is a normal subgroup of order 9 and K is a subgroup of order 3. Since H has order 9, it must be isomorphic to either C9 or C3 x C3. However, if H were isomorphic to C3 x C3, then G would be isomorphic to (C3 x C3) x C3, which is abelian, contradicting the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, H must be isomorphic to C9, and it has a generator h with order 9.\n\nLet K = {1, k, k^2}, where k has order 3. Since G is a semi-direct product of H and K, the multiplication in G is determined by the action of K on H. There exists a homomorphism φ: K → Aut(H), where Aut(H) is the group of automorphisms of H. Since H is isomorphic to C9, Aut(H) is isomorphic to C6 (the group of units modulo 9). The homomorphism φ maps K to a subgroup of Aut(H) isomorphic to C3. There is only one such subgroup in C6, generated by the automorphism x ↦ x^4 (mod 9). Thus, φ(k) is this automorphism, and the multiplication in G is given by:\n\nh^i * k^j = h^i * (h^4)^j = h^(i + 4j) (mod 9)\n\nThe multiplication table of G in this case has a more complex structure, reflecting the non-abelian nature of the group.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, or G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27, as described above. The multiplication table of G will have a simple structure in the first case and a more complex structure in the second case, reflecting the group's structure."
