    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 6 sunny days out of 7, we need to consider two cases: exactly 6 sunny days and all 7 sunny days.\n\n1. Exactly 6 sunny days: There are 7 ways to choose which day will not be sunny (7 choose 1). The probability of 6 sunny days and 1 non-sunny day is (0.3)^6 * (1-0.3) = (0.3)^6 * 0.7. So, the probability of exactly 6 sunny days is 7 * (0.3)^6 * 0.7.\n\n2. All 7 sunny days: The probability of all 7 days being sunny is (0.3)^7.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two cases to find the probability of at least 6 sunny days:\n\nP(at least 6 sunny days) = P(exactly 6 sunny days) + P(all 7 sunny days)\nP(at least 6 sunny days) = 7 * (0.3)^6 * 0.7 + (0.3)^7\n\nCalculating the values:\nP(at least 6 sunny days) ≈ 0.01417 + 0.0002187 ≈ 0.01439\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 6 sunny days out of 7 is approximately 0.01439 or 1.439%."
