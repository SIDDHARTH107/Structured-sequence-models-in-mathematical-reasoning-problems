    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a polygon is given by the formula:\n\nAngle sum = (n - 2)π + A,\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon, π is the constant pi (approximately 3.14159), and A is the area of the polygon.\n\nFor a regular heptagon (n = 7) in a hyperbolic plane with a curvature of -1, the area A can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = (7 - 2)π / |K|,\n\nwhere K is the curvature. In this case, K = -1, so |K| = 1.\n\nA = (7 - 2)π / 1 = 5π.\n\nNow, we can find the angle sum of the regular heptagon:\n\nAngle sum = (7 - 2)π + A = 5π + 5π = 10π.\n\nSo, the total angle sum of a regular heptagon in a hyperbolic plane with a curvature of -1 is 10π."
