    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π]. Since f(x) is an odd function, we only need to find the sine coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier sine series is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere b_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx) from 0 to L, and L = π in this case.\n\nSo, b_n = (2/π) * ∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π.\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = -cos(n * x) / n\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts: ∫(u * dv) = u * v - ∫(v * du)\n\n∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) = -x * cos(n * x) / n + ∫(cos(n * x) dx / n)\n\nNow, integrate cos(n * x) dx:\n\n∫(cos(n * x) dx) = sin(n * x) / n\n\nSo, ∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) = -x * cos(n * x) / n + sin(n * x) / n^2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from 0 to π:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * (-π * cos(n * π) / n + sin(n * π) / n^2 - 0)\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the second term vanishes. Also, cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, so:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * (-π * (-1)^n / n)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier sine series representation of f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = x = ∑((-1)^n * 2 * x / (n * π) * sin(n * x))\n\nNow, let's solve the partial differential equation (PDE) ∂u/∂t = ∂²u/∂x² with boundary conditions u(0, t) = u(π, t) = 0 and initial condition u(x, 0) = 0.\n\nSince the PDE is a heat equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x) * T(t). Then, the PDE becomes:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDivide both sides by X(x) * T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\nT'(t) + λ * T(t) = 0\nX''(x) + λ * X(x) = 0\n\nThe boundary conditions for X(x) are X(0) = X(π) = 0. The ODE for X(x) is an eigenvalue problem, and its solutions are:\n\nX(x) = sin(n * x), λ = n^2, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we can find the solution for T(t):\n\nT'(t) + n^2 * T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT(t) = e^(-n^2 * t)\n\nNow, we have the separated solutions:\n\nu_n(x, t) = e^(-n^2 * t) * sin(n * x)\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these separated solutions:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑(c_n * e^(-n^2 * t) * sin(n * x))\n\nTo find the coefficients c_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = 0:\n\n0 = ∑(c_n * sin(n * x))\n\nComparing this with the Fourier sine series representation of f(x) = x, we have:\n\nc_n = (-1)^n * 2 / (n * π)\n\nSo, the solution to the PDE is:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑((-1)^n * 2 / (n * π) * e^(-n^2 * t) * sin(n * x))"
