    "message_1": "Let M be a smooth manifold with a de Rham cohomology vector space H^1(M) of dimension 3. If the first Betti number of the manifold is b_1(M) = 6, what is the dimension of the de Rham cohomology vector space H^2(M)?",
    "message_2": "The first Betti number b_1(M) is the dimension of the first de Rham cohomology vector space H^1(M). In this case, we are given that b_1(M) = 6, but H^1(M) has dimension 3. This is a contradiction, as the first Betti number should be equal to the dimension of H^1(M). Please check the problem statement for any errors or inconsistencies."
