If it does not, then show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18 or the non-abelian group of order 18.",
    "message_2": "First, we will prove that G contains a normal subgroup of order 9. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 9-subgroups (subgroups of order 9) in G must divide the order of G, which is 18, and must be congruent to 1 modulo 9. The only possibilities for the number of Sylow 9-subgroups are 1 and 2. If there is only one Sylow 9-subgroup, then it must be normal, since it is unique. If there are two Sylow 9-subgroups, their intersection must have order dividing 9, and since they are distinct, their intersection must have order 1. Thus, the product of these two subgroups has order 18, which implies that G is the direct product of these two subgroups. In this case, the Sylow 9-subgroups are also normal, since they are part of the direct product.\n\nNow, let H be a normal subgroup of order 9 in G. Since the order of H is 9, which is a prime power, H must be a cyclic group, and thus isomorphic to C9. Let K be a subgroup of G of order 2. Since the order of K is 2, which is prime, K must be a cyclic group, and thus isomorphic to C2. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, their intersection must be the identity element. Also, since H is normal in G, the product HK is a subgroup of G. Since the order of HK is the product of the orders of H and K, which is 18, we have that HK = G.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are isomorphic to C9 and C2, respectively. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a group of order 9.\n\nIf G does not contain a normal subgroup of order 9, then by the Sylow Theorems, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18 or the non-abelian group of order 18."
