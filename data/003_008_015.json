    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle. So, we need to find the angle first. Since we have the base and height, we can use the right triangle formed by half of the base, the height, and the hypotenuse (which is one of the sides of the original triangle). Let's call half of the base 'a', the height 'b', and the hypotenuse 'c'. \n\na = 12/2 = 6 cm\nb = 8 cm\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find 'c':\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n6^2 + 8^2 = c^2\n36 + 64 = c^2\n100 = c^2\nc = 10 cm\n\nNow that we have all the sides of the right triangle, we can find the angle (let's call it 'θ') between the base and the height using the inverse tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = b/a\ntan(θ) = 8/6\nθ = arctan(8/6)\nθ ≈ 53.13°\n\nNow we can find the area of the original triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 8 * sin(53.13°)\nArea ≈ 0.5 * 12 * 8 * 0.8\nArea ≈ 38.4 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 38.4 cm²."
