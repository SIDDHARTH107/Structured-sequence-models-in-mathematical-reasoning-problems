    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The factory can produce up to 300 units per day. Each chair requires 3 hours of carpentry and 2 hours of painting, while each table requires 2 hours of carpentry and 4 hours of painting. The profit per chair is $30 and the profit per table is $50. However, due to limited resources, the factory cannot produce more than 100 tables per day. How many chairs and tables should the factory produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 300 (total units produced per day)\n2. y ≤ 100 (maximum tables produced per day)\n\nWe also have the constraint for the available hours of carpentry and painting:\n\n3. 3x + 2y ≤ Carpentry hours available\n4. 2x + 4y ≤ Painting hours available\n\nWe need to find the values of Carpentry hours available and Painting hours available to proceed further."
