    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 4y + 4 at the point (2, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's define the parametric representation of the surface as:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2 - 4u - 4v + 4)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u - 4)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v - 4)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = ru • ru = (1, 0, 2u - 4) • (1, 0, 2u - 4) = 1 + (2u - 4)^2\nF = ru • rv = (1, 0, 2u - 4) • (0, 1, 2v - 4) = (2u - 4)(2v - 4)\nG = rv • rv = (0, 1, 2v - 4) • (0, 1, 2v - 4) = 1 + (2v - 4)^2\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives:\n\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = ruu • n = (0, 0, 2) • n\nM = ruv • n = (0, 0, 0) • n\nN = rvv • n = (0, 0, 2) • n\n\nTo find the normal vector n, we take the cross product of ru and rv:\n\nn = ru × rv = (1, 0, 2u - 4) × (0, 1, 2v - 4) = (-(2u - 4), -(2v - 4), 1)\n\nNow, we find L, M, and N:\n\nL = (0, 0, 2) • (-(2u - 4), -(2v - 4), 1) = 2\nM = (0, 0, 0) • (-(2u - 4), -(2v - 4), 1) = 0\nN = (0, 0, 2) • (-(2u - 4), -(2v - 4), 1) = 2\n\nFinally, we find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (2, 2):\n\nE = 1 + (2*2 - 4)^2 = 1\nF = (2*2 - 4)(2*2 - 4) = 0\nG = 1 + (2*2 - 4)^2 = 1\n\nK = (2*2 - 0^2) / (1*1 - 0^2) = 4\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (2, 2) is 4."
