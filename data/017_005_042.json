    "message_2": "To show that either G is a cyclic group or G is isomorphic to the direct product of Z3 and Z9, we will use the Sylow Theorems and properties of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number.\n\nSince G is a group of order 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides |G|, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisors that satisfy the second condition are 1 and 27. We will consider these two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be of order 3^3 = 27. Since this subgroup has the same order as G, it must be equal to G itself. This means that G is a 3-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z27, Z3 x Z9, or Z3 x Z3 x Z3.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to Z27, then G is a cyclic group, and we are done. If G is isomorphic to Z3 x Z9, then we have the desired result. If G is isomorphic to Z3 x Z3 x Z3, then G has an element of order 9 (by considering the element (1,1,0) in Z3 x Z3 x Z3). However, this contradicts the fact that the order of any element in G must divide |G| = 27, and 9 does not divide 27. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to Z3 x Z3 x Z3.\n\nSo in this case, G must be either a cyclic group or isomorphic to the direct product of Z3 and Z9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 27\nIn this case, there are 27 distinct 3-Sylow subgroups, each of order 3^2 = 9. Since any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups intersect trivially, we have at least 27 * (9 - 1) = 216 distinct non-identity elements in the union of these subgroups. However, this is a contradiction, as |G| = 27, and G cannot have more than 26 non-identity elements.\n\nThus, the only possible case is n_3 = 1, and we have shown that G must be either a cyclic group or isomorphic to the direct product of Z3 and Z9."
