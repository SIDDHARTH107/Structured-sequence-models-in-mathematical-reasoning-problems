    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the base measures 5 cm and each of the two equal sides measures 8 cm. What is the length of the altitude (height) drawn from the vertex to the base?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the altitude (height) in the isosceles triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Since the altitude bisects the base, we can create two right triangles with one leg being half of the base (2.5 cm) and the other leg being the altitude (h). The hypotenuse of these right triangles is the equal side of the isosceles triangle, which is 8 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(2.5)^2 + h^2 = (8)^2\n6.25 + h^2 = 64\n\nNow, subtract 6.25 from both sides:\n\nh^2 = 57.75\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the altitude (height):\n\nh = √57.75 ≈ 7.6 cm"
