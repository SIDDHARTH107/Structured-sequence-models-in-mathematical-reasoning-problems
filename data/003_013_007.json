    "message_1": "A cable 80 meters long is attached to the top of a pole and anchored to the ground 60 meters away from the base of the pole. Find the maximum height on the pole where the cable reaches. (Assume the pole is standing straight up and down.)",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the height of the pole where the cable reaches as h and the distance from the base of the pole to the anchor point as d. In this case, d = 60 meters. The length of the cable is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle formed by the pole, the ground, and the cable, so the cable length is 80 meters.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse (cable), a is the height of the pole where the cable reaches (h), and b is the distance from the base of the pole to the anchor point (d).\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n80^2 = h^2 + 60^2\n\n6400 = h^2 + 3600\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh^2 = 6400 - 3600\nh^2 = 2800\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nh = √2800\nh ≈ 52.92 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height on the pole where the cable reaches is approximately 52.92 meters."
