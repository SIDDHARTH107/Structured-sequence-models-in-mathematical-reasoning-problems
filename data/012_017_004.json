    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Determine if the graph contains a perfect matching. If it does, provide one example of a perfect matching. If it does not, explain why a perfect matching is not possible.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching pairs up all the vertices in the graph.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The graph must have an even number of vertices.\n2. The graph must satisfy the Tutte-Berge formula.\n\nThe given graph has 8 vertices, which is an even number, so it satisfies the first condition. Now let's check the second condition using the Tutte-Berge formula:\n\nTutte-Berge formula: α'(G) ≥ (|V(G)| - p(G) + o(G)) / 2\n\nwhere α'(G) is the size of the maximum matching in the graph G, |V(G)| is the number of vertices in G, p(G) is the number of odd components in G, and o(G) is the number of components in G.\n\nIn order to have a perfect matching, α'(G) must be equal to |V(G)| / 2, which in this case is 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nSince we don't have information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot directly calculate p(G) and o(G). However, we can use the Handshaking Lemma to check if a perfect matching is possible.\n\nHandshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 12 = 24. Since there are 8 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is 24 / 8 = 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario: the graph has a vertex of degree 1. In this case, the graph cannot have a perfect matching because the vertex with degree 1 can only be matched with its single neighbor, and this would leave an odd number of vertices (6) in the remaining subgraph, which cannot form a perfect matching.\n\nHowever, if all vertices have a degree of at least 2, then it is possible to have a perfect matching. For example, consider the following graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4\n|         |    |\n8 -- 7 -- 6 -- 5\n\nIn this graph, a perfect matching can be formed by selecting the edges (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), and (7, 8).\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot definitively determine if the graph contains a perfect matching. However, we have shown that it is possible for a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges to have a perfect matching, as long as all vertices have a degree of at least 2."
