    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 meters, a width of 4 meters and a height of 3 meters. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 meters * 4 meters * 3 meters\nVolume = (1/3) * 72 cubic meters\nVolume = 24 cubic meters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 24 cubic meters."
