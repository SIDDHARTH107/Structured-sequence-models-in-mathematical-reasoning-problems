    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow let's find the union of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B) are equal. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. The Cartesian product itself is not commutative, as A x B ≠ B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, which shows that the Cartesian product is not commutative. The fact that their unions are equal only demonstrates that the union operation is commutative, i.e., (A x B) U (B x A) = (B x A) U (A x B)."
