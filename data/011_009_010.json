    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we use the Bell number, which is denoted by B(n). The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle or through the Dobinski's formula, but for small values of n, it's easier to look it up in a table or use a recursive formula.\n\nFor n = 6, the Bell number B(6) is 203.\n\nSo, there are 203 ways to partition a set of 6 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
