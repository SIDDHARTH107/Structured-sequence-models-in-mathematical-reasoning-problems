    "message_1": "A delivery driver needs to deliver packages to three different locations in the most efficient way possible. The distances between the locations are: Location A to Location B is 5 km, Location A to Location C is 10 km, and Location B to Location C is 7 km. Assuming the driver can only travel directly between locations, what is the shortest distance the driver can travel to complete all deliveries?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, the driver should travel in the following order: Location A to Location B, then Location B to Location C. \n\nThe total distance would be:\n\nA to B: 5 km\nB to C: 7 km\n\nTotal distance: 5 km + 7 km = 12 km\n\nThe driver needs to travel 12 km to complete all deliveries in the most efficient way possible."
