    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them).\n\nFor R(3,4), it is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size 3 (a triangle) or an independent set of size 4 (4 vertices with no edges between them).\n\nThe Ramsey number R(3,4) is 9. This means that in any graph with 9 vertices, there will always be either a triangle or an independent set of 4 vertices."
