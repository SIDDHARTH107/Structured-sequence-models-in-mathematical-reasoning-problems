    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, we form all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {4, 5}\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)'.\n\nSince A × B contains all possible ordered pairs of elements from A and B, the complement of A × B, (A × B)', would be the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∉ A or b ∉ B.\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'.\n\nA' = {x | x ∉ A}\nB' = {y | y ∉ B}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A' and B', denoted as A' × B'.\n\nA' × B' = {(a', b') | a' ∈ A', b' ∈ B'}\n\nSince A' and B' are infinite sets, A' × B' is also an infinite set. However, we can observe that A' × B' does not contain any ordered pairs from A × B. \n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement.\n\nIf the Cartesian product were distributive over complement, then (A × B)' = A' × B' would hold true. However, as we have seen, (A × B)' contains all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∉ A or b ∉ B, while A' × B' contains all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' ∈ A' and b' ∈ B'. \n\nSince A' × B' does not contain any ordered pairs from A × B, it cannot be equal to (A × B)'. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
