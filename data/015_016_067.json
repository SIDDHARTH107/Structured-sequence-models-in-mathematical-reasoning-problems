    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent of a Chua circuit with the given parameters, we first need to derive the equations governing the circuit's behavior. The Chua circuit is described by the following three nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV_C1}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C_1}(I_L - I_{Chua}(V_C1))\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV_C2}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C_2}(I_{Chua}(V_C1) - \\frac{V_C2}{R_2})\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dI_L}{dt} = \\frac{1}{L}(V_C2 - R_1I_L)\n$$\n\nwhere $V_C1$ and $V_C2$ are the voltages across capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$, $I_L$ is the current through the inductor $L$, and $I_{Chua}(V_C1)$ is the current through the Chua diode, which is given by:\n\n$$\nI_{Chua}(V_C1) = m_0V_C1 + \\frac{1}{2}(m_1 - m_0)(|V_C1 + 1| - |V_C1 - 1|)\n$$\n\nwith $m_1 = -m_0R_1/R_2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. To do this, we can use numerical methods such as the Wolf algorithm or Rosenstein's method. These methods involve calculating the Lyapunov exponent from the time series of the system's variables (e.g., $V_C1$, $V_C2$, and $I_L$) obtained through numerical integration of the differential equations.\n\nHowever, calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a specific set of parameters requires specialized software and is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response. I recommend using software like MATLAB or Python with appropriate libraries (e.g., SciPy) to perform the numerical integration and Lyapunov exponent calculation."
