    "message_1": "Consider two polynomial equations in two variables: \n\nf(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy and g(x,y) = x - y. \n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, determine the number of intersection points of the curves defined by f and g.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two curves defined by polynomial equations f(x, y) and g(x, y) is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the intersection points are finite and counted with their multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the degree of f(x, y) is 3 (since the highest degree term is x^3 or y^3), and the degree of g(x, y) is 1 (since the highest degree term is x or y). Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of the curves defined by f and g is 3 * 1 = 3."
