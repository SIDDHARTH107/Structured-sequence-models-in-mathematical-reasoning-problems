    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4xy = 0, we first need to find the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 4y\n∂f/∂y = 2y - 4x\n∂f/∂z = 2z\n\nA point (x, y, z) is a singular point if all the partial derivatives are zero at that point. So we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n2x - 4y = 0\n2y - 4x = 0\n2z = 0\n\nFrom the third equation, we get z = 0. Now we can focus on the first two equations:\n\n2x - 4y = 0\n2y - 4x = 0\n\nThe first equation can be rewritten as x = 2y, and substituting this into the second equation gives:\n\n2y - 4(2y) = 0\n2y - 8y = 0\n-6y = 0\n\nSo y = 0. Then, from x = 2y, we get x = 0.\n\nThus, the only singular point is (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow we need to classify this singular point. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of f, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\nH(f) = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y  ∂²f/∂x∂z |\n          | ∂²f/∂y∂x  ∂²f/∂y²  ∂²f/∂y∂z |\n          | ∂²f/∂z∂x  ∂²f/∂z∂y  ∂²f/∂z² |\n\nComputing the second partial derivatives, we get:\n\nH(f) = |  2   -4    0  |\n          | -4    2    0  |\n          |  0    0    2  |\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix at the singular point (0, 0, 0) is:\n\ndet(H(f)) = 2(2^2 - (-4)^2) = 2(4 - 16) = -24\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the singular point (0, 0, 0) is an isolated singular point.\n\nTo determine if it is ordinary or non-ordinary, we need to compute the multiplicity of the singular point. The multiplicity is the smallest positive integer k such that the k-th order partial derivatives are non-zero. In this case, the first-order partial derivatives are already non-zero, so the multiplicity is 1.\n\nSince the multiplicity is 1, the singular point (0, 0, 0) is an ordinary isolated singular point."
