    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher encrypted message, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword \"MATHS\".\n2. Break the ciphertext into digraphs (pairs of letters).\n3. Decrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix.\n\nStep 1: Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword \"MATHS\"\n\nThe keyword \"MATHS\" has no repeated letters. We will fill the matrix with the keyword first, followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, since I and J are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher).\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nStep 2: Break the ciphertext into digraphs\n\nDR KB KE DV BF NU V\n\nStep 3: Decrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix\n\nFor each digraph, we will follow these rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other letter's column.\n\nDecrypting the digraphs:\n\nDR -> PL\nKB -> AY\nKE -> FA\nDV -> IR\nBF -> C\nNU -> E\nV -> S\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is: \"PLAYFAIRCS\"."
