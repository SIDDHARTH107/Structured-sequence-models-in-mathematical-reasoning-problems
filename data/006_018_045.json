    "message_1": "A company has reported that there is a 10% chance of a financial fraud occurring in a given year. What is the probability that the company will experience at least one financial fraud in the next five years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring, we will find the probability of no financial fraud occurring in the next five years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no financial fraud occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nFor no financial fraud to occur in the next five years, it has to not occur in each of the five years. So, we will multiply the probability of no financial fraud occurring in a single year (0.90) by itself five times:\n\n0.90 × 0.90 × 0.90 × 0.90 × 0.90 = 0.90^5 = 0.59049\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in the next five years:\n\n1 - 0.59049 = 0.40951\n\nSo, the probability that the company will experience at least one financial fraud in the next five years is approximately 40.95%."
