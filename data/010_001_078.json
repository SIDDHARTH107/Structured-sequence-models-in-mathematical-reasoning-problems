    "message_2": "To prove that the closure of the union of A and B is a subset of the union of the closures of A and B, we need to show that:\n\n(𝐴∪𝐵)¯ ⊆ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element in (𝐴∪𝐵)¯. We want to show that x ∈ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯.\n\nRecall that x is in the closure of a set if and only if every open neighborhood U of x intersects the set. In other words, x ∈ (𝐴∪𝐵)¯ if and only if for every open set U containing x, U ∩ (𝐴∪𝐵) ≠ ∅.\n\nNow, let U be an open set containing x. Since U ∩ (𝐴∪𝐵) ≠ ∅, there exists an element y ∈ U such that y ∈ 𝐴∪𝐵. This means that y ∈ 𝐴 or y ∈ 𝐵. \n\nIf y ∈ 𝐴, then U ∩ 𝐴 ≠ ∅, which implies that x ∈ 𝐴¯, since this holds for every open set U containing x. Similarly, if y ∈ 𝐵, then U ∩ 𝐵 ≠ ∅, which implies that x ∈ 𝐵¯. In either case, x ∈ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯.\n\nSince x was an arbitrary element in (𝐴∪𝐵)¯, we have shown that (𝐴∪𝐵)¯ ⊆ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯.\n\nNow, let's prove the other direction. We want to show that if there exists an open set U containing x such that 𝑈∩(𝐴∪𝐵) ⊂ (𝑈∩𝐴)∪(𝑈∩𝐵) for all 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, then (𝐴∪𝐵)¯ ⊆ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯.\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element in 𝑋. If x ∈ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯, then x ∈ 𝐴¯ or x ∈ 𝐵¯. If x ∈ 𝐴¯, then for every open set U containing x, U ∩ 𝐴 ≠ ∅. Similarly, if x ∈ 𝐵¯, then for every open set U containing x, U ∩ 𝐵 ≠ ∅. In either case, U ∩ (𝐴∪𝐵) ≠ ∅, which implies that x ∈ (𝐴∪𝐵)¯.\n\nSince x was an arbitrary element in 𝑋, we have shown that if there exists an open set U containing x such that 𝑈∩(𝐴∪𝐵) ⊂ (𝑈∩𝐴)∪(𝑈∩𝐵) for all 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, then (𝐴∪𝐵)¯ ⊆ 𝐴¯∪𝐵¯.\n\nThus, we have proved that the closure of the union of A and B is a subset of the union of the closures of A and B."
