    "message_2": "To determine if G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nFirst, let's look at the degrees of the vertices in both graphs. Since G has 6 vertices and 8 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in G is 2 * 8 = 16. Similarly, since H has 6 vertices and 7 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in H is 2 * 7 = 14.\n\nNow, let's consider the average degree of the vertices in both graphs. The average degree in G is 16 / 6 ≈ 2.67, and the average degree in H is 14 / 6 ≈ 2.33. Since the average degrees are different, it is likely that the degree sequences of G and H are different.\n\nTo confirm this, let's find the degree sequences of G and H. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in non-increasing order.\n\nLet's assume the degree sequence of G is (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6) and the degree sequence of H is (e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6). Since the sum of degrees in G is 16 and the sum of degrees in H is 14, we know that:\n\nd1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 16\ne1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + e5 + e6 = 14\n\nIf G and H were isomorphic, their degree sequences would be the same (or a permutation of each other). However, since the sums of their degree sequences are different, G and H cannot have the same degree sequences, and therefore, they are not isomorphic.\n\nIn conclusion, graphs G and H are not isomorphic because their degree sequences are different."
