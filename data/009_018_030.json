    "message_2": "To find the period T of the small-amplitude oscillations in the non-linear oscillator, we can use the method of linearization. We will linearize the given nonlinear differential equation around the equilibrium point x = 0. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equation as:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 = -sin(x)\n\nSince the amplitude of oscillations is small, we can approximate sin(x) with its first-order Taylor series expansion around x = 0:\n\nsin(x) ≈ x\n\nSo, the linearized equation becomes:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 = -x\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation, and its general solution is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ω*t) + B*sin(ω*t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and ω is the angular frequency. \n\nNow, we can use the initial conditions to find A and B:\n\nx(0) = 1 => A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = 1 => A = 1\nx'(0) = 0 => -ω*A*sin(0) + ω*B*cos(0) = 0 => B = 0\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nx(t) = cos(ω*t)\n\nNow, we need to find the angular frequency ω. For a simple pendulum, the angular frequency is given by:\n\nω^2 = g/L\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and L is the length of the pendulum. In our case, we can assume that L = 1 (since we are working with small angles and the length is not given). Therefore:\n\nω^2 = 9.8/1 => ω = sqrt(9.8)\n\nFinally, the period T of the oscillations is given by:\n\nT = 2π/ω = 2π/sqrt(9.8)\n\nSo, the period T of the small-amplitude oscillations in the non-linear oscillator is approximately:\n\nT ≈ 2π/sqrt(9.8) s"
