    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups of the 3-sphere, we can use the fact that the cohomology groups of spheres are well-known. In general, for an n-sphere $S^n$, we have:\n\n$H^k(S^n, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbb{Z} & \\text{if } k = 0 \\text{ or } k = n \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$\n\nNow, we can apply this formula to the 3-sphere $S^3$:\n\n1. For $k = 0$, we have $H^0(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since there is always a single connected component in any sphere.\n2. For $k = 1$, we have $H^1(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, since there are no nontrivial 1-dimensional cycles in a 3-sphere.\n3. For $k = 2$, we have $H^2(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, since there are no nontrivial 2-dimensional cycles in a 3-sphere.\n4. For $k = 3$, we have $H^3(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since the entire 3-sphere is a nontrivial 3-dimensional cycle.\n\nSo, the cohomology groups of the 3-sphere $S^3$ are:\n\n$H^0(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$H^1(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$,\n$H^2(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, and\n$H^3(S^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$."
