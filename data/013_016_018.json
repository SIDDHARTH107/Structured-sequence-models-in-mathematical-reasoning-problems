    "message_1": "Suppose a firm hires two employees (A and B) to complete a project, and each employee can choose to exert low effort (L) or high effort (H) to complete the project. The firm's profit is $100 if both employees exert high effort, $50 if one exerts high effort and the other low effort, and $0 if both exert low effort. However, if an employee exerts high effort, they incur a personal cost of $25. If the probability that employee A exerts high effort is 0.6 and the probability that employee B exerts high effort is 0.5, what is the expected profit of the firm?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected profit of the firm, we need to consider all possible combinations of efforts exerted by employees A and B, and their corresponding probabilities.\n\n1. Both employees exert high effort (H, H):\nProbability: 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3\nFirm's profit: $100\n\n2. Employee A exerts high effort, and employee B exerts low effort (H, L):\nProbability: 0.6 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3\nFirm's profit: $50\n\n3. Employee A exerts low effort, and employee B exerts high effort (L, H):\nProbability: (1 - 0.6) * 0.5 = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2\nFirm's profit: $50\n\n4. Both employees exert low effort (L, L):\nProbability: (1 - 0.6) * (1 - 0.5) = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2\nFirm's profit: $0\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected profit by multiplying the probabilities with their corresponding profits and summing them up:\n\nExpected profit = (0.3 * $100) + (0.3 * $50) + (0.2 * $50) + (0.2 * $0)\nExpected profit = $30 + $15 + $10 + $0\nExpected profit = $55\n\nThe expected profit of the firm is $55."
