    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of the two faces with dimensions length x width: 2 * (10 cm * 5 cm) = 2 * 50 cm² = 100 cm²\n2. The area of the two faces with dimensions length x height: 2 * (10 cm * 3 cm) = 2 * 30 cm² = 60 cm²\n3. The area of the two faces with dimensions width x height: 2 * (5 cm * 3 cm) = 2 * 15 cm² = 30 cm²\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together:\n\n100 cm² + 60 cm² + 30 cm² = 190 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 190 cm²."
