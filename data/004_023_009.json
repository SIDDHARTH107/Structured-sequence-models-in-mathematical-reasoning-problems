    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n2x^2 = 6x - x^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x^2 = 6x\nx^2 = 2x\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two points of intersection: x = 0 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we can find the area enclosed between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 3]:\n\nArea = ∫(6x - x^2 - 2x^2)dx from 0 to 3\n\nFirst, we can simplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫(6x - 3x^2)dx from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nF(x) = 3x^2 - x^3 + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\nArea = F(3) - F(0) = (3(3)^2 - (3)^3) - (3(0)^2 - (0)^3)\nArea = (27 - 27) - (0)\nArea = 0\n\nThe area enclosed between the curves y = 2x^2 and y = 6x - x^2 for the interval x = 0 to x = 3 is 0 square units."
