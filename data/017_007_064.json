    "message_2": "Case 1: Element a in G has order 6.\n\nSince the order of a is 6, we have a^6 = e (identity element), and a^k ≠ e for any k < 6. Now, consider the elements {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}. These are all distinct, because if a^i = a^j for some i, j with 0 ≤ i < j < 6, then a^(j-i) = e, which contradicts the fact that a has order 6. Since we have 6 distinct elements in G, and G has order 6, these elements form the entire group G. Therefore, G is cyclic, generated by a, and isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 6, C6.\n\nCase 2: Element a in G has order 2 and element b in G has order 3.\n\nSince a has order 2, a^2 = e, and since b has order 3, b^3 = e. Now, consider the element ab in G. We want to show that (ab)^2 = e. Indeed, (ab)^2 = abab. Since G is a group, it is closed under the operation, so ab is also an element of G. Now, we have:\n\n(abab)^3 = (ab)^6 = e (since G has order 6, every element's order must divide 6)\n\n(abab)^2 = (ab)^4 = e (since the order of ab must divide 6 and cannot be 1 or 3, it must be 2 or 6; but if it were 6, G would be cyclic, which contradicts the assumption that a and b have orders 2 and 3, respectively)\n\nNow, consider the elements {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}. We claim that these are all distinct. Suppose for contradiction that two of these elements are equal. We have the following possibilities:\n\n1) a = b^2: Then a^2 = b^4, which implies e = b^4, contradicting the fact that b has order 3.\n\n2) a = ab^k for some k: Then b^k = e, which implies that k = 0 or k = 3. But k cannot be 0, as a ≠ e, and k cannot be 3, as b^3 = e.\n\n3) b^i = ab^j for some i, j: Then a = b^(i-j), which implies that a is a power of b, contradicting the fact that a and b have different orders.\n\nTherefore, the elements {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2} are all distinct, and since G has order 6, these elements form the entire group G. Now, we can define a mapping φ: G → D3 (the dihedral group of order 6) as follows:\n\nφ(e) = e'\nφ(a) = r^2\nφ(b) = r\nφ(b^2) = r^2\nφ(ab) = sr\nφ(ab^2) = sr^2\n\nwhere e' is the identity element of D3, r is the rotation of 120 degrees, and s is the reflection. It is easy to verify that φ is a homomorphism, and since it maps the 6 distinct elements of G to the 6 distinct elements of D3, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D3."
