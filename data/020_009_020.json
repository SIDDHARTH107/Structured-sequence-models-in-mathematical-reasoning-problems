    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $10 and for product B is $8. The production of product A requires 2 machine hours and 1 labor hour, whereas the production of product B requires 1 machine hour and 2 labor hours. If the total machine hours available per week are 60 and total labor hours are 50, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize the profit using stochastic optimization techniques? Assume that the demand for both products is random and follows a normal distribution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using stochastic optimization techniques, we can use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the optimal production levels for products A and B that maximize profit. \n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for machine and labor hours are:\n\n2x + y ≤ 60 (machine hours)\nx + 2y ≤ 50 (labor hours)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nSince the demand for both products is random and follows a normal distribution, we can generate random demand scenarios for both products and calculate the profit for each scenario. We can then average the profits across all scenarios to estimate the expected profit for different production levels.\n\n1. Generate a large number of random demand scenarios for products A and B, following a normal distribution. The specific parameters for the normal distribution (mean and standard deviation) should be based on historical data or market research.\n\n2. For each demand scenario, calculate the profit for different production levels of products A and B, considering the constraints on machine and labor hours.\n\n3. Average the profits across all demand scenarios for each production level.\n\n4. Identify the production levels of products A and B that result in the highest average profit.\n\n5. Perform sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the optimal production levels to changes in the demand distribution parameters.\n\nBy following these steps, the company can estimate the optimal production levels for products A and B that maximize the expected profit, taking into account the stochastic nature of the demand."
