    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = ln(z) centered at z0 = 1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-1). Since ln(z) = ln(1 + (z-1)), we can use the natural logarithm power series expansion:\n\nln(1 + x) = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ...\n\nNow, we substitute x = (z-1) to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z0 = 1:\n\nf(z) = (z-1) - (z-1)^2/2 + (z-1)^3/3 - (z-1)^4/4 + ...\n\nThis series converges in the annulus 1/2 < |z-1| < 3/2."
