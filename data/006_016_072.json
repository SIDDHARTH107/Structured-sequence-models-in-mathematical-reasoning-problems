    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of defect occurring in a product is 0.2. If a factory produces 500 such products, what is the probability that exactly 100 of them will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (defects) in n trials (products)\n- n choose k is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defect) in a single trial (product), which is 0.2 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (defects) we are interested in, which is 100\n- n is the total number of trials (products), which is 500\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 100) = (500 choose 100) * 0.2^100 * (1-0.2)^(500-100)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 500 choose 100:\n\n(500 choose 100) = 500! / (100!(500-100)!) = 500! / (100!400!)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.2^100 and (1-0.2)^(500-100):\n\n0.2^100 = 1.26765 * 10^(-70)\n(1-0.2)^(500-100) = 0.8^400 = 6.22302 * 10^(-91)\n\nNow, let's multiply all these values together:\n\nP(X = 100) = (500 choose 100) * 1.26765 * 10^(-70) * 6.22302 * 10^(-91)\n\nTo calculate (500 choose 100), we can use the approximation formula for large factorials:\n\nn! ≈ sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n\n\nUsing this approximation, we get:\n\n500! ≈ 1.22074 * 10^1133\n100! ≈ 9.33262 * 10^157\n400! ≈ 2.63769 * 10^1085\n\nNow, let's calculate (500 choose 100) using these approximations:\n\n(500 choose 100) ≈ (1.22074 * 10^1133) / ((9.33262 * 10^157) * (2.63769 * 10^1085)) ≈ 2.04194 * 10^290\n\nFinally, let's multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 100) ≈ (2.04194 * 10^290) * (1.26765 * 10^(-70)) * (6.22302 * 10^(-91)) ≈ 1.61893 * 10^129\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 100 of the 500 products will have this type of defect is approximately 1.61893 * 10^(-129)."
