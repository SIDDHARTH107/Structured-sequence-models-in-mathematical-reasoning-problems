    "message_2": "To find the slope-intercept equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (4, 9), we first need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).\n\n1. Find the slope (m):\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nUsing the given points (2, 5) and (4, 9), we can label them as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively.\nSo, x1 = 2, y1 = 5, x2 = 4, and y2 = 9.\n\nNow, plug the values into the slope formula:\nm = (9 - 5) / (4 - 2)\nm = 4 / 2\nm = 2\n\n2. Find the y-intercept (b):\nWe can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the y-intercept:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlug in the slope (m = 2) and one of the given points, for example, (2, 5):\ny - 5 = 2(x - 2)\n\nNow, solve for y:\ny - 5 = 2x - 4\ny = 2x - 4 + 5\ny = 2x + 1\n\nSo, the slope-intercept equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (4, 9) is y = 2x + 1."
