    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 5 using GWO, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the algorithm parameters:\n   - Number of wolves (population size) N = 20 (for example)\n   - Maximum number of iterations T = 100 (for example)\n   - Search space bounds: lower bound LB = -10 and upper bound UB = 10 (for example)\n\n2. Initialize the positions of the grey wolves randomly within the search space.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf using the objective function f(x).\n\n4. Identify the three best wolves with the lowest fitness values: alpha, beta, and delta.\n\n5. Update the positions of the wolves using the following equations:\n\n   a = 2 - (2 * (t / T)) (where t is the current iteration)\n\n   For each wolf i:\n   - Calculate the distance to alpha, beta, and delta:\n     D_alpha = abs(C1 * alpha_position - wolf_position)\n     D_beta = abs(C2 * beta_position - wolf_position)\n     D_delta = abs(C3 * delta_position - wolf_position)\n\n   - Calculate the new position of the wolf:\n     new_position = (alpha_position - A1 * D_alpha) + (beta_position - A2 * D_beta) + (delta_position - A3 * D_delta)\n\n   - Ensure the new position is within the search space bounds.\n\n6. Evaluate the fitness of the new positions and update alpha, beta, and delta if necessary.\n\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the maximum number of iterations T is reached.\n\n8. The position of the alpha wolf represents the minimum value of the function.\n\nBy applying the GWO algorithm with the given parameters, you will find an approximate minimum value for the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 5. Note that the GWO algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution might not be the exact global minimum. However, it should be close to the true minimum, which can be found analytically as f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 5 has a minimum value of 1 when x = -2."
