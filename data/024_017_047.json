    "message_1": "Consider a unit sphere with radius 1. Suppose we have a curve that follows the equator of the sphere from the point $(1,0,0)$ to the point $(0,0,1)$ in a time interval of 2 seconds. If we have a vector initially pointing in the direction of the positive $x$-axis at the starting point, what is the direction of the vector at the end of the curve using parallel transport?",
    "message_2": "To find the direction of the vector at the end of the curve using parallel transport, we need to follow the curve along the equator of the sphere while keeping the vector tangent to the sphere and maintaining a constant angle with the curve.\n\nLet's parameterize the curve along the equator from the point $(1,0,0)$ to the point $(0,0,1)$. Since the curve follows the equator, we can use the angle $\\theta$ as the parameter, where $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe curve can be parameterized as:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) \\\\\ny(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) \\\\\nz(\\theta) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the vector initially pointing in the direction of the positive $x$-axis at the starting point. As we move along the curve, the vector will remain tangent to the sphere and maintain a constant angle with the curve. This means that the vector will always be orthogonal to the radial vector from the center of the sphere to the point on the curve.\n\nThe radial vector at any point on the curve can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo find the vector tangent to the sphere and orthogonal to the radial vector, we can take the cross product of the radial vector with the unit vector in the $z$-direction:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(\\theta) = \\mathbf{r}(\\theta) \\times \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nCalculating the cross product, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n\\cos(\\theta) \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nAt the end of the curve, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the direction of the vector using parallel transport is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThus, the direction of the vector at the end of the curve using parallel transport is in the negative $x$-axis direction."
