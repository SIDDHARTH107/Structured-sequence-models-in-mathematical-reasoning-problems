    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. The company has 540 units of raw materials and 320 units of labor hours per week. Product A requires 3 units of raw materials and 2 units of labor hours, while Product B requires 2 units of raw materials and 4 units of labor hours. Each unit of Product A sells for $50 and each unit of product B sells for $70. Determine the number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize their weekly revenue.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the weekly revenue, we need to find the optimal combination of Product A and Product B that the company should produce, given the constraints on raw materials and labor hours. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n\n1. Raw materials constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 540\n2. Labor hours constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 320\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total revenue, which is given by:\n\nRevenue = 50x + 70y\n\nNow, we will solve the problem using the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraints in the slope-intercept form:\n\n1. Raw materials constraint: y ≤ (540 - 3x) / 2\n2. Labor hours constraint: y ≤ (320 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we will plot the constraints:\n\n1. y = (540 - 3x) / 2\n   When x = 0, y = 270\n   When y = 0, x = 180\n\n2. y = (320 - 2x) / 4\n   When x = 0, y = 80\n   When y = 0, x = 160\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 80), (120, 40), and (180, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. Revenue at (0, 0) = 50(0) + 70(0) = $0\n2. Revenue at (0, 80) = 50(0) + 70(80) = $5,600\n3. Revenue at (120, 40) = 50(120) + 70(40) = $6,000 + $2,800 = $8,800\n4. Revenue at (180, 0) = 50(180) + 70(0) = $9,000\n\nThe maximum revenue is $9,000, which occurs when the company produces 180 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B."
