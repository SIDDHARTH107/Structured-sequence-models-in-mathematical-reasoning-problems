    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation: \n\nu_xx + u_yy = -12(x^2 + y^2)exp(-2(x^2 + y^2))\n\nwith the boundary conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = u(x,1) = u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0.\n\nUsing the finite element method, find the approximate solution u(x,y) with step size h = 0.1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with step size h = 0.1, we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak formulation of the problem.\n\n1. Discretize the domain:\nDivide the domain [0, 1] x [0, 1] into a grid with step size h = 0.1. This will give us a grid with 11 points in the x-direction and 11 points in the y-direction, resulting in 121 nodes in total.\n\n2. Set up the weak formulation:\nMultiply the given PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫(u_xx * v + u_yy * v) dxdy = -∫∫(12(x^2 + y^2)exp(-2(x^2 + y^2)) * v) dxdy\n\nNow, integrate the left side by parts to obtain:\n\n∫∫(u_x * v_x + u_y * v_y) dxdy - ∫(u_x * v) ds - ∫(u_y * v) ds = -∫∫(12(x^2 + y^2)exp(-2(x^2 + y^2)) * v) dxdy\n\nSince u(x,0) = u(x,1) = u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0, the boundary terms vanish, and we are left with:\n\n∫∫(u_x * v_x + u_y * v_y) dxdy = -∫∫(12(x^2 + y^2)exp(-2(x^2 + y^2)) * v) dxdy\n\n3. Finite element approximation:\nApproximate the solution u(x, y) and test function v(x, y) using piecewise linear basis functions on the grid:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ Σ U_i * φ_i(x, y)\nv(x, y) ≈ Σ V_i * φ_i(x, y)\n\nSubstitute these approximations into the weak formulation and apply the Galerkin method. This will result in a linear system of equations:\n\nK * U = F\n\nwhere K is the stiffness matrix, U is the vector of unknown coefficients, and F is the load vector.\n\n4. Solve the linear system:\nSolve the linear system of equations for the unknown coefficients U. This can be done using various numerical methods, such as the conjugate gradient method or direct solvers like LU decomposition.\n\n5. Compute the approximate solution:\nOnce the coefficients U are found, the approximate solution u(x, y) can be computed using the basis functions:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ Σ U_i * φ_i(x, y)\n\nDue to the complexity of the problem and the need for numerical methods to solve the linear system, it is not possible to provide an explicit solution here. However, this outline provides the necessary steps to solve the given PDE using the finite element method with a step size of h = 0.1. The actual computation can be performed using specialized software like FEniCS, COMSOL, or MATLAB."
