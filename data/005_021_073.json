    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean age of the class using bootstrapping techniques, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean age of the original sample.\n2. Generate a large number of bootstrap samples by randomly sampling with replacement from the original sample.\n3. Calculate the mean age for each bootstrap sample.\n4. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap means.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean age of the original sample:\n(18 + 23 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22) / 10 = 205 / 10 = 20.5\n\n2. Generate a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000 samples) by randomly sampling with replacement from the original sample. For example, one bootstrap sample might be [18, 19, 19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 23].\n\n3. Calculate the mean age for each bootstrap sample. For example, the mean age of the sample above would be 20.5.\n\n4. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap means. After calculating the mean age for each of the 1000 bootstrap samples, sort the means in ascending order and find the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. For example, if the sorted means are [19.5, 19.6, 19.7, ..., 21.4, 21.5], the 2.5th percentile value might be 19.7, and the 97.5th percentile value might be 21.3.\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean age of the class would be approximately (19.7, 21.3). This means that we are 95% confident that the true mean age of the class lies between 19.7 and 21.3 years."
