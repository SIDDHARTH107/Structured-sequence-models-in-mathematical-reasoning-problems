    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all automorphisms of the graph.\n\nFor the given graph, we can identify the following automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity automorphism (no change in the graph):\n```\n      1\n     / \\\n    2 - 3 - 4\n         |\n         5\n```\n\n2. Swap vertices 2 and 4:\n```\n      1\n     / \\\n    4 - 3 - 2\n         |\n         5\n```\n\nThese are the only two automorphisms for this graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph has order 2 and can be represented as the group {id, (2 4)}, where \"id\" is the identity automorphism and (2 4) is the automorphism that swaps vertices 2 and 4. This group is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as Z_2 or C_2."
