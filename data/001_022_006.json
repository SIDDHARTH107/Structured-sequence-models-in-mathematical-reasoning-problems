    "message_2": "a) To find the x-intercepts of the graph of the function f(x), we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n2x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the roots can be challenging. However, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to help us find possible rational roots. The theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (6 in this case) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (2 in this case). \n\nFactors of 6: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/2, ±3/2\n\nBy trying these possible rational roots, we find that x = 1 and x = -2 are roots of the polynomial:\n\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 - 4(1) + 6 = 0\nf(-2) = 2(-2)^3 - 5(-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining factor:\n\n(2x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 6) / (x - 1) = 2x^2 - 3x - 6\n(2x^2 - 3x - 6) / (x + 2) = 2x - 3\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\nf(x) = (x - 1)(x + 2)(2x - 3)\n\nThe x-intercepts are x = 1, x = -2, and x = 3/2.\n\nb) To find the vertex of the graph of the function f(x), we need to find the critical points of the function. The critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to 0 or undefined. Let's find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 6)/dx = 6x^2 - 10x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x where f'(x) = 0:\n\n6x^2 - 10x - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (10 ± √(10^2 - 4(6)(-4))) / (2(6))\nx = (10 ± √(100 + 96)) / 12\nx = (10 ± √196) / 12\nx = (10 ± 14) / 12\n\nx = -1/3 or x = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y-values for these x-values:\n\nf(-1/3) = 2(-1/3)^3 - 5(-1/3)^2 - 4(-1/3) + 6 ≈ 6.37\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 - 4(2) + 6 = -2\n\nSince the graph of a cubic function has only one vertex, we can determine that the vertex is at the point (2, -2) because it is the local maximum.\n\nc) To sketch the graph of the function f(x), we can use the x-intercepts, the vertex, and the general shape of a cubic function:\n\n1. Plot the x-intercepts at x = 1, x = -2, and x = 3/2.\n2. Plot the vertex at the point (2, -2).\n3. Since the leading coefficient is positive (2), the graph will have the general shape of a cubic function with the left tail going down and the right tail going up.\n4. Connect the points with a smooth curve, making sure to pass through the x-intercepts and the vertex.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\n          *\n       *\n    *\n *\n*-----*-----*-----*-----*\n          *\n             *\n                *\n                   *\n```\n\nThe x-intercepts are at x = 1, x = -2, and x = 3/2, and the vertex is at the point (2, -2)."
