    "message_1": "A factory produces crates of bottled drinks. The weights of the crates follow a normal distribution with a mean of 45 kg and a standard deviation of 2 kg. However, 5% of the crates are filled improperly, causing them to be overweight. These overweight crates have a mean weight of 50 kg and a standard deviation of 3 kg. \nDetermine the weight that separates the heaviest 95% of properly filled crates from the lightest 5% of improperly filled crates.",
    "message_2": "To find the weight that separates the heaviest 95% of properly filled crates from the lightest 5% of improperly filled crates, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile of the properly filled crates and the 5th percentile of the improperly filled crates.\n\nFor the properly filled crates (mean = 45 kg, standard deviation = 2 kg), we want to find the 95th percentile. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, we can use the z-score formula to find the weight (x) corresponding to this z-score:\n\nz = (x - mean) / standard deviation\n1.645 = (x - 45) / 2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1.645 * 2 + 45\nx ≈ 48.29 kg\n\nFor the improperly filled crates (mean = 50 kg, standard deviation = 3 kg), we want to find the 5th percentile. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile is approximately -1.645.\n\nNow, we can use the z-score formula to find the weight (x) corresponding to this z-score:\n\nz = (x - mean) / standard deviation\n-1.645 = (x - 50) / 3\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = -1.645 * 3 + 50\nx ≈ 45.065 kg\n\nSince 48.29 kg (95th percentile of properly filled crates) is greater than 45.065 kg (5th percentile of improperly filled crates), the weight that separates the heaviest 95% of properly filled crates from the lightest 5% of improperly filled crates is approximately 48.29 kg."
