    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(z) is defined as:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(z) * e^(-2πikz)]dz, where the integral is taken over the entire complex plane.\n\nHowever, the function f(z) = e^(-|z|) is not well-suited for the Fourier transform in the complex plane, as the modulus function |z| is not holomorphic (i.e., it does not have a complex derivative). The Fourier transform is typically applied to functions of real variables, not complex variables.\n\nIf you meant to find the Fourier transform of a real function f(x) = e^(-|x|), we can proceed as follows:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)]dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nSince f(x) = e^(-|x|), we can split the integral into two parts, one for x < 0 and one for x > 0:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-|x|) * e^(-2πikx)]dx = ∫[e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)]dx (for x < 0) + ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-2πikx)]dx (for x > 0)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals separately:\n\n∫[e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)]dx (for x < 0) = ∫[e^(x - 2πikx)]dx = [e^(x - 2πikx) / (1 - 2πik)] (evaluated from -∞ to 0)\n\n∫[e^(-x) * e^(-2πikx)]dx (for x > 0) = ∫[e^(-x - 2πikx)]dx = [-e^(-x - 2πikx) / (1 + 2πik)] (evaluated from 0 to ∞)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limits:\n\n[e^(x - 2πikx) / (1 - 2πik)] (evaluated from -∞ to 0) = [1 / (1 - 2πik)]\n\n[-e^(-x - 2πikx) / (1 + 2πik)] (evaluated from 0 to ∞) = [1 / (1 + 2πik)]\n\nFinally, we can add the two results:\n\nF(k) = [1 / (1 - 2πik)] + [1 / (1 + 2πik)]\n\nTo simplify, we can find a common denominator:\n\nF(k) = [(1 + 2πik) + (1 - 2πik)] / [(1 - 2πik)(1 + 2πik)]\n\nF(k) = 2 / (1 + (2πik)^2)\n\nF(k) = 2 / (1 - 4π^2k^2)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-|x|) is F(k) = 2 / (1 - 4π^2k^2) for all values of k in the real line."
