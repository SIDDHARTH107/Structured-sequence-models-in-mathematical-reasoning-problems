    "message_1": "In a restaurant, there are 10 different types of soups available. A customer would like to order exactly 5 bowls of soup, with at least 2 bowls of the same type. How many different orders are possible? Use second-kind Stirling numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the second-kind Stirling numbers, which are denoted by S(n, k) and represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 types of soups (n = 10) and the customer wants to order 5 bowls (k = 5). We need to find the number of ways to partition the 10 types of soups into 5 non-empty subsets, with at least 2 bowls of the same type.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to partition the 10 types of soups into 5 non-empty subsets without any restrictions: S(10, 5).\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of ways to partition the 10 types of soups into 5 non-empty subsets with exactly 1 bowl of each type. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 5 types of soups from the 10 available types, which can be calculated using the combination formula: C(10, 5).\n\nSo, the total number of different orders possible is:\n\nS(10, 5) - C(10, 5)\n\nUsing the Stirling number table or calculator, we find that S(10, 5) = 42525.\n\nUsing the combination formula, we find that C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!) = 252.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different orders possible is:\n\n42525 - 252 = 42273\n\nSo, there are 42,273 different orders possible for the customer to choose from."
