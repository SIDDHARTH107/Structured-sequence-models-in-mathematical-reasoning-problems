    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, there is 1 Ace of spades and 1 King of hearts. To find the probability of drawing either of these cards, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, there are 2 favorable outcomes (drawing the Ace of spades or the King of hearts) and 52 possible outcomes (total number of cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an Ace of spades or a King of hearts is:\n\nProbability = 2/52 = 1/26 â‰ˆ 0.0385 or 3.85%"
