    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (5x^2 - 7) / (3x + 1) using the quotient rule, we first identify the numerator function u(x) = 5x^2 - 7 and the denominator function v(x) = 3x + 1. The quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(5x^2 - 7)/dx = 10x\nv'(x) = d(3x + 1)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((3x + 1) * 10x - (5x^2 - 7) * 3) / (3x + 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (30x^2 + 10x - 15x^2 + 21) / (9x^2 + 6x + 1)\n\nf'(x) = (15x^2 + 10x + 21) / (9x^2 + 6x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = (15x^2 + 10x + 21) / (9x^2 + 6x + 1)."
