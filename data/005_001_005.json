    "message_1": "A chocolate factory claims that their chocolates weigh exactly 100 grams each. A group of customers thinks that the chocolates weigh less than that. In order to test this claim, a sample of 40 chocolates is taken and the average weight is calculated to be 98 grams with a standard deviation of 5.2 grams. Does this sample provide enough evidence to reject the claim that the chocolates weigh exactly 100 grams each at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To test this claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the chocolates weigh exactly 100 grams each, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the chocolates weigh less than 100 grams each.\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 40\nSample mean (x̄) = 98 grams\nSample standard deviation (s) = 5.2 grams\nPopulation mean (μ) = 100 grams\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (98 - 100) / (5.2 / √40)\nt = -2 / (5.2 / 6.324)\nt = -2 / 0.82\nt ≈ -2.44\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a 5% significance level and 39 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.685\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-2.44) is less than the critical t-value (-1.685), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1).\n\nConclusion: The sample provides enough evidence to reject the claim that the chocolates weigh exactly 100 grams each at a 5% significance level. The customers are likely correct in thinking that the chocolates weigh less than 100 grams each."
