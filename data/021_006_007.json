    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the finite element method, we first need to convert it into its weak form. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by a test function $v(x)$ and integrating over the domain $[0, 1]$:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 (-\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + u(x))v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 (x^2 - 5x + 6)v(x) dx$$\n\nNow, we integrate the left-hand side by parts:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}v(x) dx = [v(x)\\frac{du}{dx}]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 \\frac{du}{dx}\\frac{dv}{dx} dx$$\n\nSince $u(0) = u(1) = 0$, the boundary term vanishes, and we are left with:\n\n$$-\\int_0^1 \\frac{du}{dx}\\frac{dv}{dx} dx + \\int_0^1 u(x)v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 (x^2 - 5x + 6)v(x) dx$$\n\nNow, we approximate $u(x)$ using linear elements and divide the interval into $N$ equally-spaced subintervals. Let $x_i = i\\Delta x$, where $\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{N}$, and $u(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} u_i \\phi_i(x)$, where $\\phi_i(x)$ are linear basis functions. We also approximate the test function $v(x)$ using the same basis functions.\n\nFor $N=4$, we have $\\Delta x = 0.25$, and the basis functions are:\n\n$$\\phi_1(x) = \\begin{cases}\n4x & 0 \\le x \\le 0.25 \\\\\n4(1-x) & 0.25 \\le x \\le 0.5 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n$$\\phi_2(x) = \\begin{cases}\n4(x-0.25) & 0.25 \\le x \\le 0.5 \\\\\n4(0.75-x) & 0.5 \\le x \\le 0.75 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n$$\\phi_3(x) = \\begin{cases}\n4(x-0.5) & 0.5 \\le x \\le 0.75 \\\\\n4(1-x) & 0.75 \\le x \\le 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the approximations for $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ into the weak form and solve for the coefficients $u_i$. This will result in a linear system of equations, which can be written in matrix form as $KU = F$, where $K$ is the stiffness matrix, $U$ is the vector of coefficients $u_i$, and $F$ is the load vector.\n\nFor $N=4$, the stiffness matrix $K$ and load vector $F$ are:\n\n$$K = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{17}{3} & -\\frac{8}{3} & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{8}{3} & \\frac{32}{3} & -\\frac{8}{3} \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{8}{3} & \\frac{17}{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$F = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{48} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{48}\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nSolving this linear system, we get the coefficients $U = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.09375 \\\\ 0.125 \\\\ 0.09375 \\end{bmatrix}$, and the approximate solution for $N=4$ is:\n\n$$u(x) \\approx 0.09375\\phi_1(x) + 0.125\\phi_2(x) + 0.09375\\phi_3(x)$$\n\nFor $N=8$, we follow the same procedure but with $\\Delta x = 0.125$. After solving the linear system, we obtain the approximate solution for $N=8$.\n\nFinally, we compare the numerical solutions to the exact solution $u(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2$. The finite element method provides an approximate solution that converges to the exact solution as the number of subintervals $N$ increases. In this case, the approximate solutions for $N=4$ and $N=8$ will be closer to the exact solution as $N$ increases."
