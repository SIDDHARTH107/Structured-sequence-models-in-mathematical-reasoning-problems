    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the velocity function $v(t)$.\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - 6t^2 + 9t)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 3t^2 - 12t + 9$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t = 2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 9 = 3(4) - 24 + 9 = 12 - 24 + 9 = -12 + 9 = -3$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $-3$ meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 12t + 9)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 6t - 12$\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at $t = 2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 6(2) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $0$ meters per second squared.\n\nIn conclusion, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $-3$ meters per second, and the acceleration is $0$ meters per second squared."
