    "message_2": "To determine the possible number of distinct subgroups of a group of order 12, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. Every group has at least two distinct subgroups: the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element and the group itself.\n2. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. In this case, the order of the group is 12, so the possible orders of subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nNow, let's consider each possible order of subgroups:\n\n1. Order 1: There is always exactly one subgroup of order 1, the trivial subgroup.\n2. Order 2: A subgroup of order 2 must be generated by an element of order 2. If the group has one or more elements of order 2, there will be at least one subgroup of order 2.\n3. Order 3: A subgroup of order 3 must be generated by an element of order 3. If the group has one or more elements of order 3, there will be at least one subgroup of order 3.\n4. Order 4: A subgroup of order 4 must be generated by an element of order 4 or two elements of order 2. If the group has one or more elements of order 4 or two or more elements of order 2, there will be at least one subgroup of order 4.\n5. Order 6: A subgroup of order 6 must be generated by an element of order 6 or two elements of orders 2 and 3. If the group has one or more elements of order 6 or at least one element of order 2 and one element of order 3, there will be at least one subgroup of order 6.\n6. Order 12: There is always exactly one subgroup of order 12, the group itself.\n\nNow, we can see that there must be at least two distinct subgroups (the trivial subgroup and the group itself). If the group has no elements of order 2, 3, 4, or 6, then there are exactly two distinct subgroups. However, this is not possible since a group of order 12 must have elements of order 2 or 3 by Cauchy's theorem.\n\nTherefore, there must be at least one more distinct subgroup, making a total of at least three distinct subgroups. In some cases, there can be more than three distinct subgroups, but there must always be at least three."
