    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the distance between two points is not measured in the same way as in Euclidean geometry. The hyperbolic distance depends on the curvature of the hyperbolic plane, which is usually denoted by K. The formula for the hyperbolic distance between two points on a hyperbolic line is given by:\n\nd = (1/√|K|) * arcosh(cosh(√|K| * L))\n\nwhere d is the hyperbolic distance, L is the length of the line (10 units in this case), and arcosh is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function.\n\nHowever, without knowing the value of K (the curvature of the hyperbolic plane), we cannot compute the exact hyperbolic distance between the two ends of the line."
