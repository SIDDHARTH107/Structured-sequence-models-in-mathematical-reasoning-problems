    "message_2": "To find the value of the tangent of 240 degrees using the unit circle, we first need to convert the angle to radians. \n\n1 degree = π/180 radians\n\n240 degrees = (240 * π) / 180 = (4 * π) / 3 radians\n\nNow, we need to find the reference angle. Since 240 degrees is in the third quadrant, we subtract 180 degrees to find the reference angle:\n\n240 - 180 = 60 degrees\n\nThe reference angle in radians is:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of the reference angle (π / 3 radians):\n\ntan(π / 3) = √3\n\nSince the tangent function is negative in the third quadrant, the tangent of 240 degrees is:\n\ntan(240) = -√3"
