    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the plane's velocity vector, we can break down the velocity into its components along the North and East directions. Since the plane is flying due Northeast, it is flying at a 45-degree angle with respect to the North and East directions.\n\nLet V_N be the component of the velocity in the North direction and V_E be the component of the velocity in the East direction. We can use trigonometry to find these components:\n\nV_N = V * cos(45°)\nV_E = V * sin(45°)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (500 km/h) and 45° is the angle between the velocity vector and the North direction. Since cos(45°) = sin(45°) = √2/2, we have:\n\nV_N = 500 * (√2/2) = 250√2 km/h\nV_E = 500 * (√2/2) = 250√2 km/h\n\nNow we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|V| = √(V_N^2 + V_E^2)\n|V| = √((250√2)^2 + (250√2)^2)\n|V| = √(2 * (250^2))\n|V| = 250√2 km/h\n\nSince the magnitude of the velocity vector is the same as the given velocity (500 km/h), the magnitude of the plane's velocity vector is 500 km/h.\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector can be found using the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(V_E / V_N)\nθ = arctan(250√2 / 250√2)\nθ = arctan(1)\n\nSince arctan(1) = 45°, the direction of the plane's velocity vector is 45° from the North towards the East, which is due Northeast."
