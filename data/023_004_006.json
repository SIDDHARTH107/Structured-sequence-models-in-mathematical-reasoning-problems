    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = 3cos(2x) + 4sin(4x), we'll use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the range -π to π.\n\nFirst, let's break the function into two parts: f1(x) = 3cos(2x) and f2(x) = 4sin(4x).\n\nNow, we'll find the Fourier transform of each part separately:\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[3cos(2x) * e^(-jωx)] dx from -π to π\nF2(ω) = ∫[4sin(4x) * e^(-jωx)] dx from -π to π\n\nNow, we'll use the Euler's formula to convert the trigonometric functions into complex exponentials:\n\ncos(2x) = (e^(j2x) + e^(-j2x))/2\nsin(4x) = (e^(j4x) - e^(-j4x))/(2j)\n\nSubstitute these expressions into F1(ω) and F2(ω):\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 ∫[(e^(j2x) + e^(-j2x)) * e^(-jωx)] dx from -π to π\nF2(ω) = 2 ∫[(e^(j4x) - e^(-j4x)) * e^(-jωx)/(2j)] dx from -π to π\n\nNow, we'll distribute the exponential terms:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 ∫[e^((2-ω)jx) + e^((-2-ω)jx)] dx from -π to π\nF2(ω) = 1/j ∫[e^((4-ω)jx) - e^((-4-ω)jx)] dx from -π to π\n\nNow, we'll integrate each term separately:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 [1/(2-ω)j * e^((2-ω)jx) - 1/(-2-ω)j * e^((-2-ω)jx)] from -π to π\nF2(ω) = 1/j [1/(4-ω)j * e^((4-ω)jx) - 1/(-4-ω)j * e^((-4-ω)jx)] from -π to π\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integrals at the limits:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 [1/(2-ω)j * (e^((2-ω)jπ) - e^((2-ω)j(-π))) - 1/(-2-ω)j * (e^((-2-ω)jπ) - e^((-2-ω)j(-π)))]\nF2(ω) = 1/j [1/(4-ω)j * (e^((4-ω)jπ) - e^((4-ω)j(-π))) - 1/(-4-ω)j * (e^((-4-ω)jπ) - e^((-4-ω)j(-π)))]\n\nNow, we'll use the property e^(jπ) = -1 and e^(-jπ) = 1:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 [1/(2-ω)j * (-2) - 1/(-2-ω)j * 2]\nF2(ω) = 1/j [1/(4-ω)j * (-2) - 1/(-4-ω)j * 2]\n\nNow, we'll simplify the expressions:\n\nF1(ω) = -3/(2-ω)j + 3/(-2-ω)j\nF2(ω) = -2/(4-ω)j + 2/(-4-ω)j\n\nFinally, we'll add F1(ω) and F2(ω) to get the Fourier transform of the original function:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\nF(ω) = (-3/(2-ω)j + 3/(-2-ω)j) + (-2/(4-ω)j + 2/(-4-ω)j)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 3cos(2x) + 4sin(4x) over the range -π to π."
