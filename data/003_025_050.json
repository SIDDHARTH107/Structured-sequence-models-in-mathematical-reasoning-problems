    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's displacement from its starting point, we can use the components of the displacement vector. The displacement vector can be represented as:\n\nD = <Dx, Dy>\n\nwhere Dx is the displacement in the east direction and Dy is the displacement in the north direction.\n\nWe can find the components of the displacement vector using the given bearing and distance traveled:\n\nDx = distance * cos(bearing)\nDy = distance * sin(bearing)\n\nGiven that the boat travels 8 km at a bearing of 40 degrees north of east, we can find the components of the displacement vector:\n\nDx = 8 * cos(40°)\nDy = 8 * sin(40°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n40° * (π / 180°) = 0.698 radians\n\nNow, we can find the components:\n\nDx = 8 * cos(0.698) ≈ 6.13 km\nDy = 8 * sin(0.698) ≈ 5.14 km\n\nSo, the displacement vector is:\n\nD = <6.13, 5.14>\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the displacement vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|D| = √(Dx^2 + Dy^2)\n|D| = √(6.13^2 + 5.14^2)\n|D| = √(37.5769 + 26.4196)\n|D| = √(63.9965)\n|D| ≈ 8.00 km\n\nThe magnitude of the boat's displacement from its starting point is approximately 8.00 km.\n\nTo find the direction of the displacement vector, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Dy / Dx)\nθ = arctan(5.14 / 6.13)\nθ ≈ 0.727 radians\n\nNow, we can convert the angle from radians to degrees:\n\nθ = 0.727 * (180° / π)\nθ ≈ 41.7°\n\nThe direction of the boat's displacement from its starting point is approximately 41.7° north of east.\n\nSo, the boat's displacement from its starting point is approximately 8.00 km at a bearing of 41.7° north of east."
