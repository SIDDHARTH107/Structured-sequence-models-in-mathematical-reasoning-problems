    "message_1": "A math student is asked to calculate the Floer homology of a 2-dimensional torus embedded in 4-dimensional Euclidean space with certain chosen boundary conditions. Specifically, the student is given the following data: \n\n- The torus is defined as the Cartesian product of two circles, each of radius 1 in Euclidean space.\n- The chosen boundary conditions are such that, for any loop on the torus, the only possible holomorphic discs with boundary on that loop are those which lie entirely in one of the two circles that define the torus.\n- The coefficient ring for the Floer homology is given by Z/2Z.\n\nThe student is then asked to compute the Floer homology of the torus with these boundary conditions, and to state their result as a finite-dimensional vector space over Z/2Z.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology of the 2-dimensional torus with the given boundary conditions, we first note that the torus can be represented as the quotient space (S^1 x S^1)/~ where S^1 is the circle and ~ is the equivalence relation identifying points on the boundary circles. \n\nSince the only possible holomorphic discs with boundary on any loop of the torus are those which lie entirely in one of the two circles that define the torus, we can consider the Floer homology of each circle separately. The Floer homology of a circle is isomorphic to the singular homology of the circle, which is given by:\n\nH_0(S^1) = Z/2Z\nH_1(S^1) = Z/2Z\nH_k(S^1) = 0 for k > 1\n\nNow, we can compute the Floer homology of the torus using the Künneth formula, which states that the Floer homology of the Cartesian product of two spaces is the tensor product of their Floer homologies:\n\nHF(T^2) = HF(S^1) ⊗ HF(S^1)\n\nUsing the Floer homology of the circle computed above, we get:\n\nHF(T^2) = (Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z) ⊗ (Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z)\n\nExpanding the tensor product, we obtain:\n\nHF(T^2) = (Z/2Z ⊗ Z/2Z) ⊕ (Z/2Z ⊗ Z/2Z) ⊕ (Z/2Z ⊗ Z/2Z) ⊕ (Z/2Z ⊗ Z/2Z)\n\nSince the tensor product of Z/2Z with itself is Z/2Z, we have:\n\nHF(T^2) = Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z\n\nThus, the Floer homology of the 2-dimensional torus with the given boundary conditions is a 4-dimensional vector space over Z/2Z."
