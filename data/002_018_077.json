    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible volume of a sphere that can be inscribed in the cube, we first need to find the side length of the cube. Since the volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the side length, we can find the side length by taking the cube root of the volume.\n\nThe cube root of 216 is 6, so the side length of the cube is 6 units.\n\nNow, the diameter of the inscribed sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 6 units, and its radius is half of that, which is 3 units.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius. Plugging in the radius of 3 units, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3^3) = (4/3)π(27) = 36π cubic units\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the maximum possible volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 113.10 cubic units."
