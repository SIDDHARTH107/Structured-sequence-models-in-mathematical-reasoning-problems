    "message_1": "A person standing on the ground looks up at a hot air balloon at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. If the person is 50 meters away from the balloon, what is the height of the balloon above the ground?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the hot air balloon above the ground, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and the distance between the person and the balloon is 50 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60) = height / 50\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so:\n\n√3 = height / 50\n\nTo find the height, multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nheight = 50 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the height of the hot air balloon above the ground is approximately 86.6 meters."
