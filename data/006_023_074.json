    "message_1": "In a survey of 500 shoppers conducted in a certain market, it was found that 60% of the shoppers buy product A. What is the probability that in a random sample of 100 shoppers from the same market, at least 70 buy product A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a shopper buying product A)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of shoppers in the sample)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of shoppers who buy product A)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 100 (the number of shoppers in the sample)\n- p = 0.60 (the probability of a shopper buying product A)\n- k = 70 (the number of shoppers who buy product A)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 70 shoppers buy product A, which means we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 70, 71, 72, ..., 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = P(X = 70) + P(X = 71) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) = Σ [(100Ck) * (0.60^k) * (0.40^(100-k))] for k = 70 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 70) ≈ 0.0284\n\nSo, the probability that at least 70 shoppers buy product A in a random sample of 100 shoppers from the same market is approximately 2.84%."
