    "message_1": "Suppose a farmer wants to plant crops of corn, wheat, and soybeans. Each acre of corn requires 8 hours of labor, 2 hours of tractor work, and $200 of investment. Each acre of wheat requires 4 hours of labor, 3 hours of tractor work, and $150 of investment. Each acre of soybeans requires 3 hours of labor, 1 hour of tractor work, and $100 of investment. The farmer has 400 hours of labor, 120 hours of tractor work, and $15,000 of investment available. If the profit from each acre of corn, wheat, and soybeans is $500, $300, and $200, respectively, how many acres of each crop should the farmer plant to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn, y be the number of acres of wheat, and z be the number of acres of soybeans.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\nLabor constraint: 8x + 4y + 3z ≤ 400\nTractor constraint: 2x + 3y + z ≤ 120\nInvestment constraint: 200x + 150y + 100z ≤ 15000\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y, z) = 500x + 300y + 200z.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the simplex method or graphical method. In this case, we will use the graphical method to find the feasible region and then evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint:\n8x + 4y + 3z ≤ 400\nWe can rewrite this constraint as z ≤ (400 - 8x - 4y)/3\n\n2. Tractor constraint:\n2x + 3y + z ≤ 120\nWe can rewrite this constraint as z ≤ (120 - 2x - 3y)\n\n3. Investment constraint:\n200x + 150y + 100z ≤ 15000\nWe can rewrite this constraint as z ≤ (15000 - 200x - 150y)/100\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint planes:\n\n1. Intersection of labor and tractor constraints:\n8x + 4y + 3z = 400\n2x + 3y + z = 120\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 10, y = 20, and z = 40.\n\n2. Intersection of labor and investment constraints:\n8x + 4y + 3z = 400\n200x + 150y + 100z = 15000\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 0, y = 50, and z = 100.\n\n3. Intersection of tractor and investment constraints:\n2x + 3y + z = 120\n200x + 150y + 100z = 15000\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 30, y = 0, and z = 60.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y, z) = 500x + 300y + 200z at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(10, 20, 40) = 500(10) + 300(20) + 200(40) = 5000 + 6000 + 8000 = $19,000\n2. P(0, 50, 100) = 500(0) + 300(50) + 200(100) = 0 + 15000 + 20000 = $35,000\n3. P(30, 0, 60) = 500(30) + 300(0) + 200(60) = 15000 + 0 + 12000 = $27,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $35,000, which occurs when the farmer plants 0 acres of corn, 50 acres of wheat, and 100 acres of soybeans."
