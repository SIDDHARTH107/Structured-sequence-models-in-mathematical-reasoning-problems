    "message_2": "One of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36 is the semi-direct product of Z_9 and Z_4, denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_4. This group can be represented as a set of ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of Z_9 (integers modulo 9) and b is an element of Z_4 (integers modulo 4). The group operation is defined as:\n\n(a, b) * (c, d) = (a + c + φ(b)(c), b + d)\n\nwhere φ: Z_4 → Aut(Z_9) is a homomorphism that defines the action of Z_4 on Z_9. In this case, we can choose φ to be given by:\n\nφ(0) = id (identity map)\nφ(1)(x) = 2x mod 9\nφ(2)(x) = 4x mod 9\nφ(3)(x) = 8x mod 9\n\nNow, let's construct the Cayley table for this group. Since there are 36 elements in the group, the table will be 36x36. However, due to the size of the table, it is not feasible to display the entire table here. Instead, let's verify that the group is non-abelian by finding two elements that do not commute.\n\nConsider the elements (1, 1) and (0, 1). Using the group operation, we have:\n\n(1, 1) * (0, 1) = (1 + 0 + φ(1)(0), 1 + 1) = (1, 2)\n(0, 1) * (1, 1) = (0 + 1 + φ(1)(1), 1 + 1) = (3, 2)\n\nSince (1, 1) * (0, 1) ≠ (0, 1) * (1, 1), the group is non-abelian."
