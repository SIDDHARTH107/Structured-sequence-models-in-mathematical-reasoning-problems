    "message_1": "Suppose you have a data set with observations on six variables. You want to examine the underlying structure of the data to determine which variables are related to one another. If you perform a factor analysis and obtain five factors with the following variance explained for each one:\n\nFactor 1: 30%\nFactor 2: 25%\nFactor 3: 20%\nFactor 4: 15%\nFactor 5: 10%\n\nWhat percentage of the total variance in the data is accounted for by these five factors?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the total variance accounted for by these five factors, you simply add the percentages of variance explained by each factor:\n\n30% (Factor 1) + 25% (Factor 2) + 20% (Factor 3) + 15% (Factor 4) + 10% (Factor 5) = 100%\n\nSo, these five factors account for 100% of the total variance in the data."
