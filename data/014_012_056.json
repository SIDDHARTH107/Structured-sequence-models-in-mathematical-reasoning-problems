    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere cipher with the key \"CRYPT\", we first need to write down the message and the repeated key below it:\n\nMATHEMATICS\nCRYPTCRYPTC\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square (also called the tabula recta) to find the encrypted letter for each pair of letters from the message and the key. The Vigenere square consists of 26 rows and columns of the alphabet, with each row shifted one position to the left compared to the previous row.\n\nUsing the Vigenere square, we find the encrypted message as follows:\n\nM + C = O\nA + R = R\nT + Y = G\nH + P = W\nE + T = B\nM + C = O\nA + R = R\nT + Y = G\nI + P = S\nC + T = W\nS + C = U\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"ORRGWBOORGSWU\"."
