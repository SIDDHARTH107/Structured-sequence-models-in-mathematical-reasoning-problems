    "message_1": "A person standing 50 meters away from a building measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 30 degrees. What is the height of the building? (Assume the person's eye level is 1.6 meters from the ground.)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the building as h meters and the distance from the person to the building as d meters. In this case, d = 50 meters. The angle of elevation is 30 degrees.\n\nWe have:\n\ntan(30°) = (h - 1.6) / 50\n\nWe know that tan(30°) = 1 / √3. Therefore:\n\n1 / √3 = (h - 1.6) / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh - 1.6 = 50 * (1 / √3)\n\nh - 1.6 ≈ 50 * 0.577\n\nh - 1.6 ≈ 28.85\n\nh ≈ 28.85 + 1.6\n\nh ≈ 30.45\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 30.45 meters."
