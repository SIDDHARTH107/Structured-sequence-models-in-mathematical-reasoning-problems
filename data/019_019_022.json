    "message_2": "To find the value of f(100), we need to find the largest number k such that k! divides 100!.\n\nLet's consider the prime factorization of k!. The prime factors of k! are the prime numbers less than or equal to k. The highest power of a prime number p that divides k! can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n\nhighest power of p in k! = (k - S_p(k)) / (p - 1),\n\nwhere S_p(k) is the sum of the digits of k in base p.\n\nFor k! to divide 100!, the highest power of each prime factor in k! must be less than or equal to the highest power of that prime factor in 100!.\n\nLet's find the highest powers of the prime factors in 100!:\n\n1. For p = 2: S_2(100) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 7\n   highest power of 2 in 100! = (100 - 7) / (2 - 1) = 93\n\n2. For p = 3: S_3(100) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 20\n   highest power of 3 in 100! = (100 - 20) / (3 - 1) = 40\n\n3. For p = 5: S_5(100) = 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 24\n   highest power of 5 in 100! = (100 - 24) / (5 - 1) = 19\n\n4. For p = 7: S_7(100) = 16 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 6 = 81\n   highest power of 7 in 100! = (100 - 81) / (7 - 1) = 3\n\nNow, let's find the largest k such that the highest powers of the prime factors in k! are less than or equal to the highest powers of the prime factors in 100!:\n\n1. For p = 2: k = 93 / 2 = 46 (since 46! has 46 + 23 = 69 powers of 2, which is less than 93)\n\n2. For p = 3: k = 40 / 3 = 13 (since 13! has 13 + 4 = 17 powers of 3, which is less than 40)\n\n3. For p = 5: k = 19 / 5 = 3 (since 3! has 3 powers of 5, which is less than 19)\n\n4. For p = 7: k = 3 / 7 = 0 (since 0! has 0 powers of 7, which is less than 3)\n\nThe largest k that satisfies all these conditions is k = 46. Therefore, f(100) = 46."
