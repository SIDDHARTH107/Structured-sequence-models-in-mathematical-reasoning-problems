    "message_1": "Bob proposes to Alice that they split $100 between them. Bob suggests that he keeps $80 and Alice takes the remaining $20. Alice can either accept or reject this offer. If Alice accepts, the money is split according to Bob's proposal. If Alice rejects, then neither of them gets any money. Using game theory analysis, what is the best strategy for Alice? What offer should Bob make to maximize his chances of success?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, we can use game theory to analyze the best strategies for both Alice and Bob. We will assume that both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.\n\nFor Alice, her choices are to either accept or reject Bob's offer. If she accepts the offer, she gets $20. If she rejects the offer, she gets $0. Since $20 is greater than $0, Alice's best strategy is to accept any offer that gives her a positive amount of money.\n\nFor Bob, his goal is to maximize his share of the $100 while still making an offer that Alice will accept. Since Alice will accept any offer that gives her a positive amount of money, Bob should offer Alice the smallest possible positive amount to maximize his own share. In this case, Bob could offer Alice $1 (or an amount very close to $1) and keep $99 for himself.\n\nBy offering Alice $1, Bob maximizes his chances of success, as Alice's best strategy is to accept any positive amount. Therefore, Bob should offer Alice $1 (or an amount very close to $1) to maximize his share of the $100."
