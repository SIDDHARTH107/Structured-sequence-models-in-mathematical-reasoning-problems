    "message_1": "Suppose you're rolling a fair die (each side has an equal chance of showing up) 100 times. Using Monte Carlo simulation, estimate the probability of getting a sum of 300 or higher for all 100 rolls.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the probability using Monte Carlo simulation, we will perform a large number of experiments (simulations) and count the number of times we get a sum of 300 or higher. Then, we will divide this count by the total number of experiments to get the probability.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_die():\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\n\ndef experiment(num_rolls):\n    total = 0\n    for _ in range(num_rolls):\n        total += roll_die()\n    return total\n\ndef monte_carlo_simulation(num_experiments, num_rolls, target_sum):\n    successful_experiments = 0\n    for _ in range(num_experiments):\n        if experiment(num_rolls) >= target_sum:\n            successful_experiments += 1\n    return successful_experiments / num_experiments\n\nnum_experiments = 100000\nnum_rolls = 100\ntarget_sum = 300\n\nprobability = monte_carlo_simulation(num_experiments, num_rolls, target_sum)\nprint(\"Estimated probability:\", probability)\n```\n\nThis code will run 100,000 experiments, each consisting of 100 die rolls, and count the number of experiments where the sum is 300 or higher. The estimated probability will be printed at the end.\n\nPlease note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the process. However, with a large number of experiments, the estimate should be reasonably accurate."
