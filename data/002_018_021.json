    "message_2": "To find the volume of the largest sphere that can fit inside the cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, its diameter will be equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge length of the cube = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nPlugging in the radius value:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)^3\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 125 cm^3\nVolume = (500/3) * π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the largest sphere that can fit inside the cube is approximately:\n\nVolume ≈ (500/3) * 3.1416 cm^3\nVolume ≈ 523.6 cm^3"
