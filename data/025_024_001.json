    "message_2": "To prove that the set of closed points of D(θ) is Zariski-dense in D(θ), we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The action of G on X is proper.\n2. The stabilizer of a closed point x ∈ X is a reductive subgroup of G.\n3. The fixed point set of a reductive subgroup of G acting on a projective variety is non-empty.\n\nLet U be a non-empty open subset of D(θ). We want to show that U contains a closed point of D(θ).\n\nSince L is an ample line bundle on X, there exists a positive integer n such that the linear system |nL| is base-point free and very ample. Let φ: X → P(V) be the morphism associated to the linear system |nL|, where V = H^0(X, nL) is the space of global sections of nL.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on V given by g(v) = θ(g)⁻¹v for all g ∈ G and v ∈ V. This action is linear and lifts the action of G on X. Moreover, the action of G on V is proper since the action of G on X is proper.\n\nLet W = φ(U) be the image of U in P(V). Since U is non-empty and open in D(θ), W is a non-empty open subset of P(V). Let w ∈ W be a closed point. Since the action of G on P(V) is proper, the stabilizer G_w of w in G is a reductive subgroup.\n\nNow, consider the action of G_w on the fiber φ⁻¹(w). By Fact 3, there exists a closed point x ∈ φ⁻¹(w) fixed by G_w. Since x ∈ U and G_w ⊆ G, we have g(x) = θ(g)x for all g ∈ G_w. Therefore, x ∈ D(θ) and U contains a closed point of D(θ).\n\nThus, the set of closed points of D(θ) is Zariski-dense in D(θ)."
