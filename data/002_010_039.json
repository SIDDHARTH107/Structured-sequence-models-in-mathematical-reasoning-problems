    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular octagon, you simply multiply the length of one side by the total number of sides. In this case, the length of one side is 5 cm and there are 8 sides in an octagon.\n\nPerimeter = (side length) × (number of sides)\nPerimeter = 5 cm × 8\nPerimeter = 40 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular octagon is 40 cm."
