    "message_2": "1. To show that $f$ is not defined at the point $[0:0:1]$, we need to show that the map is not well-defined at this point. Recall that a rational map is given by a collection of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. In this case, the map $f$ is given by the polynomials $x$ and $y$. \n\nConsider the point $[0:0:1] \\in X$. When we try to evaluate $f([0:0:1])$, we get $f([0:0:1]) = [0:0]$. However, this is not a valid point in the projective space $Y$, as all the coordinates are zero. Therefore, the map $f$ is not defined at the point $[0:0:1]$.\n\n2. To find a non-empty Zariski open subset of $Y$ over which $f$ is an isomorphism, we need to find an open subset $U \\subseteq Y$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $f^{-1}(U)$ is an isomorphism. \n\nRecall that a Zariski open subset of a projective space is the complement of a closed subset, which is defined by the vanishing of a homogeneous polynomial. In this case, we can consider the polynomial $y$ in $Y$. The closed subset defined by the vanishing of $y$ is $V(y) = \\{[x:0]\\}$. The complement of this closed subset is the Zariski open subset $U = Y \\setminus V(y) = \\{[x:y] \\in Y \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the preimage of $U$ under $f$, which is $f^{-1}(U) = \\{[x:y:z] \\in X \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$. The restriction of $f$ to $f^{-1}(U)$ is given by $f|_{f^{-1}(U)}([x:y:z]) = [x:y]$. This map is clearly bijective, as it is both injective and surjective. Moreover, it is a morphism of varieties, as it is given by the same polynomials $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the restriction of $f$ to $f^{-1}(U)$ is an isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, the non-empty Zariski open subset of $Y$ over which $f$ is an isomorphism is $U = \\{[x:y] \\in Y \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$."
