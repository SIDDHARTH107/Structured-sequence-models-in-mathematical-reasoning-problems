    "message_1": "Consider a network flow problem modeling the transportation of goods from a source to a destination. Let the source have a supply of 500 units, the destination have a demand of 800 units, and there be three intermediate nodes with the following capacities:\n\n- Node 1: can send at most 300 units\n- Node 2: can send at most 400 units\n- Node 3: can send at most 200 units\n\nFind the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from the source to the destination.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from the source to the destination, we need to consider the capacities of the intermediate nodes. The total capacity of the intermediate nodes is:\n\nNode 1: 300 units\nNode 2: 400 units\nNode 3: 200 units\nTotal capacity: 900 units\n\nHowever, the source has a supply of only 500 units, so the maximum amount of goods that can be transported is limited by the source's supply. Therefore, the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from the source to the destination is 500 units."
