    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $20, and for product B it is $30. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The company has a total of 200 labor hours and 150 machine hours available. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize the profit? Use the cuckoo search algorithm to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. In this algorithm, we represent the potential solutions as nests, and the goal is to find the best nest (solution) that maximizes the profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 200 (labor hours constraint)\nx + 3y <= 150 (machine hours constraint)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, let's implement the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Initialize the population of nests (solutions) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each nest.\n3. Choose a nest randomly and generate a new solution (cuckoo egg) by using a random walk (Levy flight).\n4. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n5. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the original nest with the new solution.\n6. Perform a fraction of the worst nests to be replaced by new nests (local search).\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution for the number of units of product A and B to maximize the profit. In this case, the optimal solution is:\n\nx = 50 units of product A\ny = 50 units of product B\n\nThe maximum profit is:\n\nProfit = 20(50) + 30(50) = $2500\n\nSo, the company should produce 50 units of product A and 50 units of product B to maximize the profit."
