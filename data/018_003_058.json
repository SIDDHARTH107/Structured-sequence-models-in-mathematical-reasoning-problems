    "message_2": "To find the union of sets A and B, we combine all the elements from both sets without repeating any element. The union of sets A and B is denoted as A ∪ B.\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3}\nSet B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B. A set C is a superset of set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set A:\n1 ∈ A ∪ B (True)\n2 ∈ A ∪ B (True)\n3 ∈ A ∪ B (True)\n\nSince all elements of set A are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set B:\n3 ∈ A ∪ B (True)\n4 ∈ A ∪ B (True)\n5 ∈ A ∪ B (True)\n\nSince all elements of set B are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that the union of sets A and B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, is a superset of each set, A and B."
