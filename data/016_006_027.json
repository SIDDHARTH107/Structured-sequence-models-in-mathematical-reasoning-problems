    "message_1": "What is the scaling ratio used to generate the Barnsley fern if the base segment of its stem has a length of 1 unit? (Hint: the scaling ratios for the stem and fern segments are 0.5, 0.85, 0.09, and 0.1)",
    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is generated using four affine transformations with different scaling ratios and probabilities. The scaling ratios provided (0.5, 0.85, 0.09, and 0.1) correspond to the four transformations. The base segment of the stem has a length of 1 unit, and the scaling ratio for the stem is 0.5. Therefore, the scaling ratio used to generate the Barnsley fern for the base segment of the stem is 0.5."
