    "message_2": "The next smallest even perfect number after 28,828,960 is 33,550,336. \n\nEven perfect numbers can be expressed in the form 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem. The perfect number 28,828,960 can be expressed as 2^(11-1) * (2^11 - 1) = 2^10 * 2047, where p = 11.\n\nTo find the next even perfect number, we need to find the next prime number greater than 11 and check if 2^p - 1 is also prime. The next prime number after 11 is 13. 2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is also prime. Therefore, the next even perfect number is 2^(13-1) * (2^13 - 1) = 2^12 * 8191 = 33,550,336."
