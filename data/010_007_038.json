    "message_1": "A math student is studying the Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces in Topology. The question for them to solve is:\n\nLet X be a topological space that is path-connected, locally path-connected and semi-locally simply connected. Let p: Y -> X be a covering map such that Y is path-connected. If Y is simply connected, show that the covering map p is a homeomorphism.\n\nAlso, prove that the Galois correspondence between subgroups of the fundamental group of X and covering spaces of X is a bijection.",
    "message_2": "To show that the covering map p is a homeomorphism, we need to show that p is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse.\n\n1. Continuity of p:\nSince p is a covering map, it is continuous by definition.\n\n2. Bijectiveness of p:\nSince X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, and Y is path-connected and simply connected, we can apply the lifting criterion for covering spaces. Given any continuous map f: Z -> X, where Z is a simply connected and locally path-connected space, there exists a unique lift f': Z -> Y such that p ∘ f' = f. In our case, let Z = X and f = id_X (the identity map on X). Then, there exists a unique lift id_Y: X -> Y such that p ∘ id_Y = id_X. This implies that p is surjective.\n\nNow, let x1, x2 ∈ X be such that p(x1) = p(x2). Since X is path-connected, there exists a path α: [0, 1] -> X with α(0) = x1 and α(1) = x2. Since Y is simply connected, the fundamental group π_1(Y) is trivial. Therefore, the induced homomorphism p_*: π_1(Y) -> π_1(X) is the trivial homomorphism. By the lifting criterion, there exists a unique path β: [0, 1] -> Y such that p ∘ β = α and β(0) = x1. Since p(β(0)) = p(β(1)), we have x1 = x2. This implies that p is injective.\n\nSince p is both surjective and injective, it is bijective.\n\n3. Continuity of the inverse of p:\nLet p^(-1): X -> Y be the inverse of p. Since p is a covering map, for each x ∈ X, there exists an open neighborhood U ⊆ X such that p^(-1)(U) is a disjoint union of open sets in Y, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto U by p. This implies that p^(-1) is continuous on each U. Since X is covered by such open sets U, p^(-1) is continuous on X.\n\nSince p is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse, p is a homeomorphism.\n\nNow, let's prove that the Galois correspondence between subgroups of the fundamental group of X and covering spaces of X is a bijection.\n\nGiven a covering space (Y, p) of X, we can associate it with the subgroup p_*(π_1(Y)) of π_1(X). Conversely, given a subgroup H of π_1(X), we can associate it with a covering space (Y_H, p_H) of X, where Y_H is the space of right cosets of H in π_1(X), and p_H is the projection map.\n\nTo show that this correspondence is a bijection, we need to show that it is both injective and surjective.\n\nInjectivity: Suppose (Y_1, p_1) and (Y_2, p_2) are two covering spaces of X that correspond to the same subgroup H of π_1(X). Then, p_(1*)(π_1(Y_1)) = p_(2*)(π_1(Y_2)) = H. By the uniqueness of the lifting criterion, there exists a unique isomorphism f: Y_1 -> Y_2 such that p_2 ∘ f = p_1. This implies that (Y_1, p_1) and (Y_2, p_2) are isomorphic as covering spaces, and the correspondence is injective.\n\nSurjectivity: Given any subgroup H of π_1(X), we can construct a covering space (Y_H, p_H) as described above. By construction, p_(H*)(π_1(Y_H)) = H, and the correspondence is surjective.\n\nSince the Galois correspondence is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection between subgroups of the fundamental group of X and covering spaces of X."
