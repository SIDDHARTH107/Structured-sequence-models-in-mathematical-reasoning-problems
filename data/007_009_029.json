    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers less than or equal to n that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nFor a prime number p, φ(p) = p - 1, since all numbers less than p are relatively prime to p.\n\nFor a power of a prime number, p^k, the totient function can be calculated using the formula:\n\nφ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the value of Euler's totient function for the number 16. Since 16 is a power of the prime number 2 (16 = 2^4), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(16) = φ(2^4) = 2^4 - 2^(4-1) = 16 - 8 = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 16 is 8."
