    "message_1": "Assuming a length of 1 meter for each arm of the pendulum and an initial angle of 60 degrees for the first arm and 30 degrees for the second arm, how many oscillations will the double pendulum complete in one minute?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of oscillations a double pendulum will complete in one minute, we need to find the period of oscillation for the system. However, the motion of a double pendulum is chaotic and non-linear, which means there is no general closed-form solution for the period of oscillation. The motion of a double pendulum depends on various factors, such as the lengths of the arms, the masses of the pendulum bobs, and the initial angles.\n\nTo find the number of oscillations, one would need to use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to simulate the motion of the double pendulum and count the number of oscillations in a given time frame (in this case, one minute).\n\nIt is important to note that the number of oscillations for a double pendulum can vary greatly depending on the initial conditions and the parameters of the system. Therefore, without a specific simulation or numerical solution, it is not possible to provide an exact number of oscillations for the given scenario."
