    "message_2": "To find the smallest number x such that 3^x ≡ 13 (mod 19), we can use the method of successive squaring and modular exponentiation. We will compute the powers of 3 modulo 19 until we find one that is congruent to 13.\n\n1. 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 19)\n2. 3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n3. 3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 8 (mod 19)\n4. 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n5. 3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 13 (mod 19)\n\nWe found that 3^5 ≡ 13 (mod 19). Therefore, the smallest number x is 5."
