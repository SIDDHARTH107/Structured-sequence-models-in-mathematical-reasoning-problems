    "message_1": "A metal cylinder of height 10 cm and radius 5 cm needs to be coated with a material that costs $2 per square centimeter. What is the minimum cost of the material required to coat the entire cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of the material required to coat the entire cylinder, we first need to find the surface area of the cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the height (h) = 10 cm and radius (r) = 5 cm, we can calculate the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(10 + 5)\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 150π square centimeters\n\nNow, we know the cost of the material is $2 per square centimeter. Therefore, the minimum cost of the material required to coat the entire cylinder is:\n\nCost = Surface Area × Price per square centimeter\nCost = 150π × $2\nCost = $300π\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14, the minimum cost is:\n\nCost ≈ $300 × 3.14\nCost ≈ $942"
