    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of a rectangular wave signal using Fourier transform, we first need to define the time-domain function of the signal. In this case, the rectangular wave has a width of 4ms (T = 4ms) and an amplitude of 6V (A = 6V). We can represent the time-domain function as:\n\nx(t) = A * rect(t/T)\n\nwhere rect(t/T) is the rectangular function defined as:\n\nrect(t/T) = { 1, for |t| <= T/2\n              0, for |t| > T/2 }\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of x(t):\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nSince x(t) is a rectangular function, we can simplify the integral:\n\nX(f) = A * ∫[rect(t/T) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, from -T/2 to T/2\n\nX(f) = A * ∫[e^(-j2πft)] dt, from -T/2 to T/2\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to t:\n\nX(f) = A * [-j/(2πf) * e^(-j2πft)] | from -T/2 to T/2\n\nX(f) = A * [-j/(2πf) * (e^(-jπfT) - e^(jπfT))]\n\nUsing the identity 2j * sin(x) = e^(jx) - e^(-jx), we can rewrite X(f) as:\n\nX(f) = A * T * sinc(πfT)\n\nwhere sinc(x) = sin(x)/x.\n\nIn this case, A = 6V and T = 4ms, so the frequency domain representation of the rectangular wave signal is:\n\nX(f) = 6 * 4 * 10^(-3) * sinc(4 * π * 10^(-3) * f)\n\nX(f) = 24 * 10^(-3) * sinc(4 * π * 10^(-3) * f)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given rectangular wave signal is X(f) = 24 * 10^(-3) * sinc(4 * π * 10^(-3) * f)."
