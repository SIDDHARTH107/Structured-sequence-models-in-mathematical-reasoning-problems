    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\n```\nA = | 3  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -2  4 |\n    |-1  1/2 -1 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 10 |\n    |  1 |\n    | -1 |\n```\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\n1. First, we need to find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A using the Gram-Schmidt process.\n\nLet's denote the columns of A as a1, a2, and a3:\n\na1 = | 3 |\n     | 2 |\n     |-1 |\n\na2 = |  2  |\n     | -2  |\n     | 1/2 |\n\na3 = | -1 |\n     |  4 |\n     | -1 |\n\nNow, we apply the Gram-Schmidt process:\n\nu1 = a1 = |  3 |\n          |  2 |\n          | -1 |\n\nu2 = a2 - proj_u1(a2) = a2 - ((a2·u1) / (u1·u1)) * u1\n   = |  2  |\n     | -2  |\n     | 1/2 |\n\n   - ( (2*3 - 2*2 + 1/2*(-1)) / (3*3 + 2*2 + (-1)*(-1)) ) * u1\n   = |  2  |\n     | -2  |\n     | 1/2 |\n\n   - ( 2 / 14 ) * |  3 |\n                  |  2 |\n                  | -1 |\n\n   = |  1/7  |\n     | -12/7 |\n     |  5/7  |\n\nu3 = a3 - proj_u1(a3) - proj_u2(a3) = a3 - ((a3·u1) / (u1·u1)) * u1 - ((a3·u2) / (u2·u2)) * u2\n   = | -1 |\n     |  4 |\n     | -1 |\n\n   - ( (-1*3 + 4*2 + (-1)*(-1)) / (3*3 + 2*2 + (-1)*(-1)) ) * u1\n   - ( (-1*1/7 + 4*(-12/7) + (-1)*(5/7)) / (1/7*1/7 + (-12/7)*(-12/7) + (5/7)*(5/7)) ) * u2\n\n   = | 0 |\n     | 0 |\n     | 0 |\n\nSince u3 is a zero vector, we have a linearly dependent column in A, which means that the given system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. Therefore, we cannot proceed with the QR decomposition method to solve this system."
