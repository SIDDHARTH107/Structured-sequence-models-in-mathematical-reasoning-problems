    "message_1": "A company wants to predict customer churn rate based on their behaviours. They have collected data on 1000 customers regarding their age, income, gender, and the number of products they have purchased in the last month. Out of these 1000 customers, 150 have churned. If the company wants to build a model with 80% accuracy, how many of the remaining customers should they survey to achieve this accuracy?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of customers the company needs to survey as x. The company wants to achieve an 80% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn. \n\nFirst, we need to find the current accuracy of the model without surveying any additional customers. We know that 150 out of 1000 customers have churned, so the current churn rate is 150/1000 = 0.15 or 15%.\n\nSince the company wants to achieve an 80% accuracy rate, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(1000 + x) * 0.8 = 1000 * 0.85 + x * 0.15\n\nWhere (1000 + x) represents the total number of customers after surveying x more customers, and 0.8 is the desired accuracy rate. The right side of the equation represents the number of correct predictions the model would make with the current churn rate (0.85) and the additional customers surveyed (x * 0.15).\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n800 + 0.8x = 850 + 0.15x\n0.65x = 50\nx = 50 / 0.65\nx â‰ˆ 76.92\n\nSince the company cannot survey a fraction of a customer, they should survey approximately 77 more customers to achieve an 80% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn."
