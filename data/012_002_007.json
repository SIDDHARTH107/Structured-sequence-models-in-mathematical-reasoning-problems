    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of G, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph (Δ(G)). Since G has 12 vertices and 18 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 18) / 12 = 3. Therefore, the maximum degree of the graph must be at least 4 (since the average degree is 3, there must be at least one vertex with a degree higher than 3).\n\nNow, let's use the theorem that states that the chromatic number χ(G) is bounded by Δ(G) + 1, i.e., χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. Since Δ(G) ≥ 4, we have χ(G) ≤ 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, we can't conclude that the chromatic number is 5 without further information about the graph. We need to check if the graph can be colored with fewer colors. Let's consider the following cases:\n\n1. If G contains a subgraph that is a complete graph with 4 vertices (K4), then the chromatic number is 4, as each vertex in K4 is connected to every other vertex, and we need 4 colors to color them.\n\n2. If G does not contain a K4 subgraph but contains a subgraph that is a cycle with an odd number of vertices (e.g., a triangle or a 5-cycle), then the chromatic number is 3, as we need at least 3 colors to color the vertices of an odd cycle.\n\n3. If G does not contain any K4 subgraph or odd cycles, then the graph is bipartite, and the chromatic number is 2, as we can color the vertices in two sets such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of G, we can only conclude that the chromatic number of G is between 2 and 5, i.e., 2 ≤ χ(G) ≤ 5."
