    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the length of each side of the snowflake is multiplied by 4/3.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations:\n\n1. Original equilateral triangle: side length = 10 units\n2. First iteration: side length = 10 * (4/3) = 40/3 units\n3. Second iteration: side length = (40/3) * (4/3) = 160/9 units\n4. Third iteration: side length = (160/9) * (4/3) = 640/27 units\n5. Fourth iteration: side length = (640/27) * (4/3) = 2560/81 units\n\nSince the Koch snowflake has 3 sides, the perimeter after 4 iterations is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (2560/81) = 7680/81 units â‰ˆ 94.8148 units"
