    "message_2": "a) The cyclic group C20:\nG is a group of order 20, and C20 is the cyclic group of order 20. Since there is only one group of order 20 up to isomorphism, G must be isomorphic to C20. Let's find the isomorphism.\n\nLet g be a generator of G, and let c be a generator of C20. Then, we can define the isomorphism φ: G → C20 as φ(g^k) = c^k for all k = 0, 1, ..., 19. This is a well-defined isomorphism since it is a bijection and preserves the group operation.\n\nb) The dihedral group D10:\nThe dihedral group D10 has order 20, but it is non-abelian. Since G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, which is abelian, G cannot be isomorphic to D10. Therefore, there are no isomorphisms between G and D10.\n\nc) The non-abelian group of order 20:\nSince G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, which is abelian, G cannot be isomorphic to any non-abelian group of order 20. Therefore, there are no isomorphisms between G and any non-abelian group of order 20."
