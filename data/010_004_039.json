    "message_2": "To prove that f is bounded, we will use the fact that continuous functions on compact sets are bounded.\n\nSince X is a compact metric space and f is continuous, the image of X under f, denoted as f(X), is also compact. This is a well-known result in topology, which states that the continuous image of a compact set is compact.\n\nNow, since f(X) is a compact subset of R, it is also closed and bounded. This means that there exist real numbers m and M such that m ≤ f(x) ≤ M for all x ∈ X.\n\nFor the specific example where X = [0,1] and f(x) = x², we can show that f is bounded on [0,1] as follows:\n\nSince X is a closed and bounded interval in R, it is a compact set. The function f(x) = x² is continuous on X, so by the result above, f(X) is also compact. Therefore, there exist real numbers m and M such that m ≤ f(x) ≤ M for all x ∈ X.\n\nIn this case, we can find m and M explicitly. Since x² is a monotonically increasing function on the interval [0,1], we have:\n\nm = f(0) = 0² = 0\nM = f(1) = 1² = 1\n\nThus, 0 ≤ f(x) ≤ 1 for all x ∈ [0,1], which shows that f is bounded on [0,1]."
