Suppose that Y is path-connected and that there exists y0 ∈ p−1(x0) with the property that the subgroup p∗(π(Y, y0)) of π(X, x0) generated by the image of π(Y, y0) in π(X, x0) is equal to the whole group π(X, x0), where p∗: π(Y, y0) → π(X, x0) is the induced homomorphism. Determine the fundamental group of Y at y0.",
    "message_2": "Since X is path-connected and has a fundamental group isomorphic to the cyclic group Z of integers, we can write π(X, x0) ≅ Z. Let's denote the generator of Z as a, so π(X, x0) = <a>.\n\nNow, we are given that p: Y → X is a covering space of X, and Y is path-connected. We are also given that there exists y0 ∈ p^(-1)(x0) such that the subgroup p∗(π(Y, y0)) of π(X, x0) generated by the image of π(Y, y0) in π(X, x0) is equal to the whole group π(X, x0).\n\nBy the covering space theory, we know that the induced homomorphism p∗: π(Y, y0) → π(X, x0) is injective. Since p∗(π(Y, y0)) = π(X, x0), this implies that π(Y, y0) is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z.\n\nThe only subgroups of Z are of the form nZ, where n is a non-negative integer. Since p∗(π(Y, y0)) = π(X, x0), we must have that π(Y, y0) is isomorphic to Z itself. Therefore, the fundamental group of Y at y0 is π(Y, y0) ≅ Z."
