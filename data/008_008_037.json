Each basic chair requires 2 hours of labor and 1 unit of raw material, while each deluxe chair requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of raw material. The company has 100 hours of labor and 80 units of raw material available per week. The basic chair sells for $50 and the deluxe chair sells for $80. How many of each type of chair should the company produce in a week to maximize its revenue?\n\nLet x be the number of basic chairs and y the number of deluxe chairs produced per week. Then, the objective is to maximize revenue z = 50x + 80y subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 80 (raw material constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negative constraint)\n\nThis problem can be solved using matrix methods such as the simplex algorithm or graphical method.",
    "message_2": "We will solve this problem using the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\n2. x + 2y ≤ 80 (raw material constraint)\n3. x, y ≥ 0 (non-negative constraint)\n\nTo graph the constraints, we can rewrite them as equalities and solve for y:\n\n1. y = (100 - 2x) / 3\n2. y = (80 - x) / 2\n\nNow, we graph these equations along with the non-negative constraints (x, y ≥ 0) and find the feasible region:\n\n1. The labor constraint (blue line) intersects the y-axis at (0, 33.33) and the x-axis at (50, 0).\n2. The raw material constraint (red line) intersects the y-axis at (0, 40) and the x-axis at (80, 0).\n\nThe feasible region is the area enclosed by the intersection of these lines and the non-negative quadrant. The vertices of this region are:\n\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (0, 33.33)\nC. (20, 30)\nD. (80, 0)\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function z = 50x + 80y at each vertex:\n\nA. z(0, 0) = 0\nB. z(0, 33.33) = 2666.4\nC. z(20, 30) = 2900\nD. z(80, 0) = 4000\n\nThe maximum revenue is achieved at vertex D, where x = 80 and y = 0. Therefore, the company should produce 80 basic chairs and 0 deluxe chairs per week to maximize its revenue, which will be $4000."
