    "message_1": "A certain population has an initial size of 1000 individuals, and a growth rate proportional to the population size, with a constant of proportionality of 0.05. Write a differential equation that represents this population growth, and use it to determine the population size after 5 years.",
    "message_2": "To write a differential equation representing the population growth, we can use the following equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population (P) with respect to time (t), k is the constant of proportionality (0.05), and P is the population size.\n\nNow, we need to solve this differential equation to find the population size after 5 years. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition that the population size is 1000 when t = 0:\n\nln(1000) = 0 + C\n\nC = ln(1000)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = 0.05t + ln(1000)\n\nTo find the population size after 5 years (t = 5), we can plug in t = 5:\n\nln(P) = 0.05(5) + ln(1000)\n\nln(P) = 0.25 + ln(1000)\n\nNow, we can solve for P by taking the exponential of both sides:\n\nP = e^(0.25 + ln(1000))\n\nP = e^(0.25) * e^(ln(1000))\n\nP = e^(0.25) * 1000\n\nP ≈ 1.284 * 1000\n\nP ≈ 1284\n\nSo, the population size after 5 years is approximately 1284 individuals."
