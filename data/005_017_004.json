    "message_1": "A researcher conducted a study on student performance and collected data on the following variables: hours spent studying per week, GPA, and number of extracurricular activities. The researcher wants to reduce the dimensionality of the data using principal component analysis. The first principal component explains 70% of the total variance in the data. The eigenvector coefficients for the first principal component for each variable are 0.60, 0.65, and 0.45, respectively. If a student has a GPA of 3.5, spends 12 hours studying per week, and is involved in 2 extracurricular activities, what is their score on the first principal component?",
    "message_2": "To find the score on the first principal component, we need to multiply each variable by its corresponding eigenvector coefficient and then sum the results.\n\nScore on the first principal component = (Hours spent studying * Eigenvector coefficient for hours spent studying) + (GPA * Eigenvector coefficient for GPA) + (Number of extracurricular activities * Eigenvector coefficient for extracurricular activities)\n\nScore on the first principal component = (12 * 0.60) + (3.5 * 0.65) + (2 * 0.45)\n\nScore on the first principal component = 7.2 + 2.275 + 0.9\n\nScore on the first principal component = 10.375"
