    "message_2": "According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. In other words, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, p = 17 (a prime number) and a = 17 (not divisible by 17). So, we have:\n\n17^(17-1) ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder of 17^22 (mod 17). We can rewrite 17^22 as (17^16) * (17^6). Since 17^16 ≡ 1 (mod 17) from Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n(17^16) * (17^6) ≡ 1 * (17^6) (mod 17)\n\nSo, the remainder when 17^22 is divided by 17 is the same as the remainder when 17^6 is divided by 17. Since 17 is divisible by 17, any power of 17 will also be divisible by 17. Therefore, the remainder is 0."
