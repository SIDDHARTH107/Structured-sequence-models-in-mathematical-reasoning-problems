    "message_2": "To find the geodesics connecting two points A and B on the surface of a sphere, we need to find the shortest path between these two points along the surface of the sphere. In this case, the shortest path will be along a great circle.\n\nA great circle is a circle on the surface of a sphere whose center is the same as the center of the sphere. The geodesics on a sphere are the great circles.\n\nGiven a sphere of radius 5 centimeters, let's first find the angle between points A and B.\n\nUsing the arc length formula, we have:\n\nArc length = radius × angle (in radians)\n\n8 cm = 5 cm × angle\n\nangle = 8 cm / 5 cm = 1.6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the geodesics connecting points A and B. Since the shortest path between A and B is along a great circle, we need to find the plane that contains points A, B, and the center of the sphere (O).\n\nOnce we have the plane, we can find the great circle by intersecting this plane with the sphere. The intersection will be a circle, and the arc of this circle connecting points A and B will be the geodesic.\n\nThere will be two possible geodesics connecting points A and B: one along the shorter arc (1.6 radians) and one along the longer arc (2π - 1.6 radians = 4.6832 radians). Both of these arcs are part of the same great circle, but they represent two different paths between points A and B on the surface of the sphere."
