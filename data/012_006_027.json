    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 7 vertices, where each vertex has degree 3. Determine whether a Eulerian path exists in this graph or not. If an Eulerian path exists, find the path. If it does not exist, explain why.",
    "message_2": "A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree. In this case, the graph G has 7 vertices, and each vertex has degree 3, which is odd. Since all 7 vertices have an odd degree, the graph does not satisfy the condition for having an Eulerian path.\n\nTherefore, an Eulerian path does not exist in this graph."
