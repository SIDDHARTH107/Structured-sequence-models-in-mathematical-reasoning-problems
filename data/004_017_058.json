    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = sqrt(1 + cos(2x)) between x = 0 and x = pi/2, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = sqrt(1 + cos(2x))\ndy/dx = d/dx [sqrt(1 + cos(2x))]\ndy/dx = (1/2) * (1 + cos(2x))^(-1/2) * (-2 * sin(2x))\n\nNow, we will square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = 1 + ((1/2) * (1 + cos(2x))^(-1/2) * (-2 * sin(2x)))^2\n= 1 + (1/4) * (1 + cos(2x))^(-1) * (4 * sin^2(2x))\n= 1 + sin^2(2x) / (1 + cos(2x))\n\nNow, we will find the arc length L by integrating the expression from x = 0 to x = pi/2:\n\nL = ∫[0, pi/2] sqrt(1 + sin^2(2x) / (1 + cos(2x))) dx\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. To find the numerical value of the arc length, you would need to use a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule, or use a computer software like Wolfram Alpha or a graphing calculator."
