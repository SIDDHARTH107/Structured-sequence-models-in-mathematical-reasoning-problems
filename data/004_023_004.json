    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval [-1, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 12)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 12) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the two curves do not intersect over the interval [-1, 2]. In this case, we need to find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the given interval.\n\nThe difference between the two functions is:\n\n(2x - 3) - x^2\n\nNow, we integrate this function over the interval [-1, 2]:\n\n∫((-1 to 2) (2x - 3 - x^2) dx)\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we get:\n\n[2(x^2)/2 - 3x - (x^3)/3] evaluated from -1 to 2\n\nNow, we plug in the limits of integration:\n\n(2(2)^2/2 - 3(2) - (2)^3/3) - (2(-1)^2/2 - 3(-1) - (-1)^3/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4 - 6 - 8/3) - (1 + 3 + 1/3)\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(-2 - 8/3) - (4 + 1/3)\n\nNow, subtract:\n\n-2 - 8/3 - 4 - 1/3 = -6 - 9/3 = -6 - 3 = -9\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-9| = 9\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval [-1, 2] is 9 square units."
