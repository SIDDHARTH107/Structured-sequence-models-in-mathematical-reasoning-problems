    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nu · v = (5i + 12j) · (-3i + 4j) = 5(-3) + 12(4) = -15 + 48 = 33\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|u| = √(5² + 12²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13\n|v| = √((-3)² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n33 = 13 * 5 * cos(θ)\n33 = 65 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 65:\n\ncos(θ) = 33/65\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(33/65)\n\nθ ≈ 0.588 radians or 33.7 degrees"
