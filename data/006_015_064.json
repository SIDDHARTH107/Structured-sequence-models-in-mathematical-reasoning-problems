    "message_1": "Assuming that a network is likely to experience a cyber attack of a certain type once in every six months, what is the probability that the network will experience the attack at least once in the next two years (24 months)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of finding the probability of experiencing the attack at least once, we will find the probability of not experiencing the attack at all in the next 24 months and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of not experiencing the attack in a 6-month period is 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.\n\nThere are 24 months in 2 years, which is equal to 4 periods of 6 months. The probability of not experiencing the attack in all four 6-month periods is (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6).\n\nNow, we can find the probability of experiencing the attack at least once in the next 24 months:\n\n1 - (5/6)^4 = 1 - (625/1296) = 671/1296 â‰ˆ 0.5177\n\nSo, the probability that the network will experience the attack at least once in the next two years is approximately 51.77%."
