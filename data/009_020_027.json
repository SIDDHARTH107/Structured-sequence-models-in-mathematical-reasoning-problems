    "message_2": "To find the optimal control signal u*(t) that minimizes the performance index, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function H:\n\nH(x, y, u, p_x, p_y) = u² + x² + y² + p_x(x + 3y - u) + p_y(2x + 4y)\n\nwhere p_x and p_y are the costate variables.\n\nAccording to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control u*(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian function. To find the minimum, we take the partial derivative of H with respect to u and set it to zero:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u - p_x = 0\n\nSolving for u, we get the optimal control signal:\n\nu*(t) = p_x(t)/2\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations by taking the negative partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to x and y:\n\ndp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x = -2x - p_x + 2p_y\ndp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y = -2y - 3p_x + 4p_y\n\nWe have a system of four first-order differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = x + 3y - u*(t)\ndy/dt = 2x + 4y\ndp_x/dt = -2x - p_x + 2p_y\ndp_y/dt = -2y - 3p_x + 4p_y\n\nwith initial conditions x(0) = 1, y(0) = 1.\n\nTo solve this system of differential equations, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or other suitable techniques. Once we have the solutions for x(t), y(t), p_x(t), and p_y(t), we can find the optimal control signal u*(t) = p_x(t)/2."
