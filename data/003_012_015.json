    "message_1": "A lighthouse is located 200 meters away from a cliff. If the angle of depression from the top of the cliff to the base of the lighthouse is 45 degrees, what is the height of the lighthouse above the water level?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Since the angle of depression from the top of the cliff to the base of the lighthouse is 45 degrees, the angle of elevation from the base of the lighthouse to the top of the cliff is also 45 degrees. \n\nLet's denote the height of the lighthouse above the water level as h, and the height of the cliff as c. We can form a right triangle with the lighthouse, the cliff, and the horizontal distance between them. The horizontal distance is given as 200 meters.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 right triangle, the legs are congruent, and the hypotenuse is âˆš2 times the length of each leg. In this case, the legs are the height of the cliff (c) and the horizontal distance (200 meters). Since the angle of elevation from the base of the lighthouse to the top of the cliff is 45 degrees, we can use the tangent function to find the height of the cliff:\n\ntan(45) = c / 200\n\nSince tan(45) = 1:\n\nc = 200 meters\n\nNow we know the height of the cliff is 200 meters. The height of the lighthouse above the water level (h) is the difference between the height of the cliff and the height of the lighthouse base:\n\nh = c - height of the lighthouse base\n\nSince the lighthouse base and the cliff form a right triangle with a 45-degree angle, the height of the lighthouse base is equal to the horizontal distance between the lighthouse and the cliff:\n\nheight of the lighthouse base = 200 meters\n\nNow we can find the height of the lighthouse above the water level:\n\nh = c - height of the lighthouse base\nh = 200 - 200\nh = 0 meters\n\nThe height of the lighthouse above the water level is 0 meters."
