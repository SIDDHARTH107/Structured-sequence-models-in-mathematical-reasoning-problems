    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a number c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function on the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) be the number of bags of cement produced by the factory at time t, where t is measured in hours. We know that f(0) = 0 and f(8) = 240. We want to find a time c in the interval (0, 8) such that the rate of cement production at time c is 40 bags per hour.\n\nFirst, let's find the average rate of change of the function on the interval [0, 8]:\n\nAverage rate of change = (f(8) - f(0)) / (8 - 0) = (240 - 0) / 8 = 30 bags per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find a time c in the interval (0, 8) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to 40 bags per hour. Since the production is uniform throughout the day, the derivative of the function, f'(t), represents the rate of cement production at time t. We want to find a time c such that f'(c) = 40.\n\nHowever, we have a contradiction here. The average rate of change of the function on the interval [0, 8] is 30 bags per hour, which means that the factory produces cement at an average rate of 30 bags per hour throughout the day. It is not possible for the factory to produce cement at a rate of 40 bags per hour at any time during the day, as this would contradict the uniform production rate of 30 bags per hour.\n\nTherefore, there is no time during the day when the factory produces cement at a rate of 40 bags per hour."
