    "message_1": "A metal plate fits inside a square with side length 2 meters. The temperature is initially given by f(x,y)=100sin(pi*x)sin(pi*y) degrees Celsius. The plate is kept insulated on all sides except one, where the temperature is kept fixed at zero degrees Celsius. \n\nUsing the Fourier transform, find the steady-state temperature distribution u(x,y) in the square.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution u(x, y) in the square, we need to solve the Laplace equation with the given boundary conditions:\n\nΔu(x, y) = 0, where Δ is the Laplacian operator.\n\nBoundary conditions:\n1. u(x, 0) = 100sin(pi*x)sin(pi*0) = 100sin(pi*x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2\n2. u(x, 2) = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2\n3. u(0, y) = 0 for 0 ≤ y ≤ 2\n4. u(2, y) = 0 for 0 ≤ y ≤ 2\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve the Laplace equation. Let u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Then, the Laplace equation becomes:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ\nY''(y)/Y(y) = λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nY''(y) - λY(y) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we have:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(sqrt(λ)x) + B*sin(sqrt(λ)x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0, y) = 0 and u(2, y) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0\nX(2) = B*sin(sqrt(λ)*2) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we have:\n\nsin(sqrt(λ)*2) = 0\n\nThis implies that sqrt(λ)*2 = n*pi for some integer n. Thus, λ = (n*pi/2)^2.\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation:\n\nY''(y) - λY(y) = 0\n\nSubstituting λ = (n*pi/2)^2:\n\nY''(y) - (n*pi/2)^2*Y(y) = 0\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nY(y) = C*cos(n*pi/2*y) + D*sin(n*pi/2*y)\n\nApplying the boundary condition u(x, 2) = 0:\n\nY(2) = C*cos(n*pi) + D*sin(n*pi) = 0\n\nSince D cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we have:\n\ncos(n*pi) = 0\n\nThis implies that n is an odd integer. Thus, λ = ((2m+1)*pi/2)^2 for some integer m.\n\nNow, the general solution for u(x, y) is:\n\nu(x, y) = Σ [B_m*sin((2m+1)*pi/2*x) * (C_m*cos((2m+1)*pi/2*y) + D_m*sin((2m+1)*pi/2*y))]\n\nApplying the boundary condition u(x, 0) = 100sin(pi*x):\n\n100sin(pi*x) = Σ [B_m*sin((2m+1)*pi/2*x) * C_m]\n\nSince sin((2m+1)*pi/2*x) and sin(pi*x) form an orthogonal basis on the interval [0, 2], we can find the coefficients B_m and C_m by taking the inner product:\n\nB_mC_m = (1/2) * ∫[0,2] 100sin(pi*x)sin((2m+1)*pi/2*x) dx\n\nUsing the orthogonality of sine functions, we get:\n\nB_mC_m = 0 if m is even\nB_mC_m = 100/((2m+1)*pi) if m is odd\n\nNow, we have the steady-state temperature distribution u(x, y):\n\nu(x, y) = Σ [(100/((2m+1)*pi)) * sin((2m+1)*pi/2*x) * sin((2m+1)*pi/2*y)] for odd m\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the steady-state temperature distribution in the square."
