    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nA ∩ B = {5, 7}\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of sets B and A, denoted as B △ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, we have:\n\nB △ A = A △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these symmetric differences:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ (B △ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's confirm that the symmetric difference of sets A and B is distributive over the union of sets A and B:\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nWe already found that:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nA ∩ B = {5, 7}\n\nSo, (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} - {5, 7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}\n\nSince A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B), we can confirm that the symmetric difference of sets A and B is distributive over the union of sets A and B."
