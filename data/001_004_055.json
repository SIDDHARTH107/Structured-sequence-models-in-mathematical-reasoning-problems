    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial x^2 + 5x + 6, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give the original polynomial. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the linear term).\n\nThe two numbers that meet these conditions are 2 and 3. Therefore, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n(x + 2)(x + 3)"
