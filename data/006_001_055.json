    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips)\n- x is the number of successful outcomes (heads)\n- p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (1-p, also 0.5 for a fair coin)\n\nIn this case, n = 100, x = 50, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5.\n\nP(50) = (100! / (50! * 50!)) * (0.5^50) * (0.5^50)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials and probabilities, we get:\n\nP(50) â‰ˆ 0.0795892\n\nSo the probability of getting 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips is approximately 7.96%."
