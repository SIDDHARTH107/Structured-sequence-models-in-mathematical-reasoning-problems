    "message_2": "To prove that there is only one group of order 9 up to isomorphism, we will use the fact that every group of prime power order is a p-group, and we will show that the only group of order 9 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 9.\n\nLet G be a group of order 9. Since 9 is a prime power (3^2), G is a 3-group. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 9. The only possibilities are 1 and 3. However, if there were 3 Sylow 3-subgroups, their intersection would be of order 3, which is not possible since the order of the intersection of any two Sylow 3-subgroups must divide the order of the group, which is 9. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in G, and it is normal.\n\nLet H be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since H is normal and has order 9, it must be equal to G. Thus, G is a 3-group with a unique subgroup of order 3. Let x be an element of G with order 3. Then the subgroup generated by x, ⟨x⟩, has order 3 and is the unique subgroup of order 3 in G.\n\nNow, let y be an element of G not in ⟨x⟩. Since G has order 9, the order of y must be either 1, 3, or 9. If the order of y is 1, then y is the identity element, which is a contradiction since the identity element is in ⟨x⟩. If the order of y is 3, then ⟨y⟩ is another subgroup of order 3, which is a contradiction since ⟨x⟩ is the unique subgroup of order 3. Therefore, the order of y must be 9.\n\nSince y has order 9, the subgroup generated by y, ⟨y⟩, has order 9 and is equal to G. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 9. Since there is only one cyclic group of order 9 up to isomorphism, we have shown that there is only one group of order 9 up to isomorphism."
