    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, a proposer is given 10 dollars and must offer a split of the money to a responder. If the responder accepts the split, both players keep their respective shares, but if the responder rejects the split, both players receive nothing. What is the highest possible offer that the proposer can make to the responder such that the responder is likely to accept the offer? Assume that the responder would accept any offer that gives them at least $3, but that they will reject any offer less than that amount.",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, the highest possible offer the proposer can make to the responder such that the responder is likely to accept the offer is $7 for the proposer and $3 for the responder. This is because the responder will accept any offer that gives them at least $3, and the proposer would want to keep as much money as possible for themselves while still ensuring the responder accepts the offer."
