    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic countable linear models of L, we will consider the possible order types of countable linear orders.\n\nThere are four main order types for countable linear orders:\n\n1. The order type of the natural numbers (ℕ, <), denoted as ω.\n2. The order type of the integers (ℤ, <), denoted as ω + ω* (where ω* is the reverse order of ω).\n3. The order type of the rational numbers (ℚ, <), denoted as η.\n4. The order type of the natural numbers with an additional element at the beginning or end, denoted as ω + 1 or 1 + ω, respectively.\n\nThese four order types represent non-isomorphic countable linear models of L because they have different properties that cannot be preserved by isomorphisms. For example, the natural numbers have a least element, while the integers and rational numbers do not. Similarly, the integers have a unique element with no immediate predecessor, while the rational numbers have no such element.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 non-isomorphic countable linear models of L."
