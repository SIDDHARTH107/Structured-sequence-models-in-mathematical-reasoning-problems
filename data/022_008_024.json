    "message_2": "To find the order of the entire function f(z) = e^z - 1, we need to find the order of the zeros of the function. The zeros of the function are the solutions to the equation f(z) = 0, which is e^z - 1 = 0.\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we get e^z = 1. Using the properties of complex exponentials, we know that e^(2πin) = 1 for any integer n. Therefore, the zeros of the function are z = 2πin, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the order of the zeros. The order of a zero is the number of times the zero appears in the function. To find the order, we can differentiate the function and see how many times the zero appears in the derivative.\n\nf'(z) = d(e^z - 1)/dz = e^z\n\nNow, let's find the zeros of the derivative:\n\ne^z = e^(2πin) = 1\n\nSince the zeros of the derivative are the same as the zeros of the original function, the order of the zeros is 1. Therefore, the order of the entire function f(z) = e^z - 1 is 1."
