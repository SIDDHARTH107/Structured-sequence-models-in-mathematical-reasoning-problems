    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function, we first perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2(z-1)} = \\frac{A}{z} + \\frac{B}{z^2} + \\frac{C}{z-1}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $z^2(z-1)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(z^2)(z-1) + B(z)(z-1) + C(z^2)(z)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for A, B, and C by plugging in values of z that simplify the equation:\n\n1. For $z = 0$:\n\n$$1 = A(0)(-1) + B(0)(-1) + C(0) \\Rightarrow A = -1$$\n\n2. For $z = 1$:\n\n$$1 = A(1)(0) + B(1)(0) + C(1)(1) \\Rightarrow C = 1$$\n\n3. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to z and then setting $z = 0$:\n\n$$0 = A(3z^2 - 2z) + B(2z - 1) + C(3z^2)$$\n\n$$0 = A(0) + B(-1) + C(0) \\Rightarrow B = 0$$\n\nNow we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{-1}{z} + \\frac{0}{z^2} + \\frac{1}{z-1} = -\\frac{1}{z} + \\frac{1}{z-1}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n1. For $-\\frac{1}{z}$, the Laurent series is just $-\\frac{1}{z}$ since it's already a simple pole.\n\n2. For $\\frac{1}{z-1}$, we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z-1} = \\frac{1}{1 - (1-z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-z)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n$$\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ is:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{z} + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n$$\n\nNow, we need to determine the set of points where the expansion converges absolutely. The geometric series converges absolutely when $|1-z| < 1$, which is equivalent to $|z| < 1$. The term $-\\frac{1}{z}$ converges everywhere except at $z = 0$. Therefore, the Laurent series converges absolutely in the annular region:\n\n$$0 < |z| < 1$$"
