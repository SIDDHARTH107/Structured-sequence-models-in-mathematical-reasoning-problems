    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the properties of exponents. When multiplying two exponents with the same base, we add the exponents: \n\n(2³ × 2⁴) = 2^(3+4) = 2^7\n\nNow, when dividing two exponents with the same base, we subtract the exponents:\n\n(2^7) / (2²) = 2^(7-2) = 2^5\n\nSo, the simplified expression in exponential form is 2^5."
