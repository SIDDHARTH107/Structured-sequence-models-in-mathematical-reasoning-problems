    "message_1": "There are 10 identical balls that need to be distributed into 3 distinct boxes such that each box must have at least one ball. In how many ways can the balls be distributed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. Since each box must have at least one ball, we can first place one ball in each of the 3 boxes. Now, we have 7 balls left to distribute among the 3 boxes.\n\nWe can think of this as placing 2 dividers (bars) among the 7 remaining balls (stars). The dividers will separate the balls into 3 groups, representing the number of balls in each box.\n\nFor example, if we have the following arrangement:\n\n**|***|****\n\nThis represents 2 balls in the first box, 3 balls in the second box, and 4 balls in the third box.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the 7 balls and 2 dividers. There are a total of 9 positions (7 balls + 2 dividers), and we need to choose 2 of these positions for the dividers.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 9 and k = 2:\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!)\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!7!)\nC(9, 2) = (9*8*7!)/(2!7!)\nC(9, 2) = (9*8)/(2)\nC(9, 2) = 36\n\nSo there are 36 ways to distribute the 10 identical balls into the 3 distinct boxes, with each box having at least one ball."
