    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, we simply multiply the side length by the number of sides. In this case, the side length is 4 cm and there are 6 sides.\n\nPerimeter = side length × number of sides\nPerimeter = 4 cm × 6\nPerimeter = 24 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the hexagon is 24 cm."
