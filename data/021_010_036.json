    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function using Newton's method, we need to find the critical points of the function, which are the points where the derivative is equal to zero. So, first, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 1\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the zeros of the derivative. The formula for Newton's method is:\n\nx_new = x_old - f'(x_old) / f''(x_old)\n\nWe also need the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 8\n\nNow, let's start with the initial guess x = 2 and iterate until the difference between successive approximations is less than 0.0001:\n\n1. x_old = 2\n2. x_new = x_old - (f'(x_old) / f''(x_old))\n3. Check if |x_new - x_old| < 0.0001, if not, update x_old = x_new and go back to step 2.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = 2\nx_new = 2 - (3(2)^2 - 8(2) + 1) / (6(2) - 8) = 2 - (-7 / 4) = 2 + 1.75 = 3.75\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = 3.75\nx_new = 3.75 - (3(3.75)^2 - 8(3.75) + 1) / (6(3.75) - 8) = 3.75 - (42.1875 / 14.5) ≈ 3.75 - 2.9086 ≈ 2.8414\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = 2.8414\nx_new ≈ 2.8414 - (3(2.8414)^2 - 8(2.8414) + 1) / (6(2.8414) - 8) ≈ 2.8414 - 0.0023 ≈ 2.8391\n\nThe difference between x_new and x_old in the third iteration is less than 0.0001, so we can stop here.\n\nNow, we have found the critical point x ≈ 2.8391. To find the minimum value of the function, we plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(2.8391) ≈ (2.8391)^3 - 4(2.8391)^2 + (2.8391) + 6 ≈ -3.5063\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) is approximately -3.5063."
