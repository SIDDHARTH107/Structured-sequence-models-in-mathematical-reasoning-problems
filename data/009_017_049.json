    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 3mm away from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is symmetrical and circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop with a radius of 3mm as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop at every point, so the dot product simplifies to:\n\n∮Bdl = B∮dl\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB∮dl = B(2πr)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the current I and the radius r:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nB(2π(3x10⁻³ m)) = (4πx10⁻⁷ Tm/A)(5A)\n\nB = (4πx10⁻⁷ Tm/A)(5A) / (2π(3x10⁻³ m))\n\nB = (20πx10⁻⁷ Tm/A) / (6πx10⁻³ m)\n\nB ≈ 3.33x10⁻⁴ T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 3mm away from the center of the wire is approximately 3.33x10⁻⁴ T (tesla)."
