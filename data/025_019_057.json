    "message_2": "To find the degree of the Fano variety that is the intersection of the two quadrics in projective 4-space, we first need to understand the geometry of the intersection.\n\nThe first equation, $x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2=0$, represents a quadric cone in projective 4-space. The second equation, $x_0x_2+x_1x_3=0$, represents a hyperplane section of the first quadric.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these two quadrics. We can rewrite the second equation as $x_1x_3=-x_0x_2$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2=x_0^2+x_1^2-x_1^2x_3^2/x_0^2=0$\n\nNow, let's factor out $x_0^2$:\n\n$x_0^2(1-\\frac{x_1^2x_3^2}{x_0^4})+x_1^2=0$\n\nSince $x_0^2$ cannot be negative, we have two cases:\n\n1) $x_0=0$: In this case, the first equation becomes $x_1^2+x_2^2=0$, which implies that $x_1=x_2=0$. This is a single point in projective 4-space.\n\n2) $1-\\frac{x_1^2x_3^2}{x_0^4}=0$: This implies that $x_1^2x_3^2=x_0^4$. This is a smooth quadric surface in projective 3-space.\n\nThe intersection of the two quadrics is the union of a point and a smooth quadric surface. The degree of a Fano variety is the number of points in the intersection of the variety with a general linear space of complementary dimension. In this case, the complementary dimension is 1, so we are looking for the number of points in the intersection of the variety with a general line.\n\nThe smooth quadric surface is a Fano variety of degree 1, as it intersects a general line in exactly one point. The single point does not contribute to the degree, as it is not part of the smooth quadric surface.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the Fano variety that is the intersection of the two quadrics in projective 4-space is 1."
