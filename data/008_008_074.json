    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: type A and type B. Each product requires time on two different machines: machine 1 and machine 2. Type A requires 2 hours on machine 1 and 1 hour on machine 2. Type B requires 1 hour on machine 1 and 3 hours on machine 2. Each day, the factory has 12 hours of time on each machine. The profit per unit for type A is $6 and for type B it is $9. What is the maximum profit the factory can make in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A products and y be the number of type B products produced in a day. We have the following constraints based on the time required on each machine:\n\n2x + y ≤ 12 (machine 1)\nx + 3y ≤ 12 (machine 2)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 6x + 9y\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\ny ≤ -2x + 12 (from 2x + y ≤ 12)\ny ≤ -(1/3)x + 4 (from x + 3y ≤ 12)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4), (6, 0), and (3, 3). We will now evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 6(0) + 9(0) = $0\nP(0, 4) = 6(0) + 9(4) = $36\nP(6, 0) = 6(6) + 9(0) = $36\nP(3, 3) = 6(3) + 9(3) = $45\n\nThe maximum profit of $45 is achieved when the factory produces 3 units of type A and 3 units of type B in a day."
