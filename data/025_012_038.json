    "message_2": "To find the rational points on the elliptic curve $E : y^2 = x^3 + 5x^2 + 7x + 10$ with $y$-coordinate greater than $10$, we can use the method of descent.\n\nFirst, we find an initial rational point on the curve. By inspection, we can see that $(x, y) = (0, \\pm\\sqrt{10})$ are points on the curve. Since we are interested in points with $y$-coordinate greater than $10$, we can choose the point $P = (0, \\sqrt{10})$.\n\nNow, we can use the group law on elliptic curves to find other rational points. Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, their sum $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is also a point on the curve, and its coordinates can be computed using the following formulas:\n\n1. If $P \\neq Q$, then\n$$\nx_3 = \\left(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\right)^2 - x_1 - x_2\n$$\n$$\ny_3 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x_1 - x_3) - y_1\n$$\n\n2. If $P = Q$, then\n$$\nx_3 = \\left(\\frac{3x_1^2 + 10x_1 + 7}{2y_1}\\right)^2 - 2x_1\n$$\n$$\ny_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 + 10x_1 + 7}{2y_1}(x_1 - x_3) - y_1\n$$\n\nWe can repeatedly apply the group law to the point $P$ to generate other points on the curve. However, this process may not find all rational points on the curve, and it can be computationally expensive.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use a computer algebra system or specialized software for elliptic curves, such as SageMath or Magma, to find all rational points on the curve. These tools implement more efficient algorithms for finding rational points on elliptic curves.\n\nIn summary, finding all rational points on an elliptic curve with a specific condition, such as the $y$-coordinate being greater than $10$, can be a challenging task. It often requires using advanced techniques from number theory and algebraic geometry, as well as specialized software tools."
