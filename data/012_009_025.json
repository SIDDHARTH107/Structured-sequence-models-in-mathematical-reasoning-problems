    "message_1": "Consider an undirected graph G with 10 vertices and degree sequence {3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}. Is it possible for G to have a Hamiltonian cycle? If yes, provide an example of such a cycle. If no, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "No, it is not possible for the graph G with the given degree sequence to have a Hamiltonian cycle. \n\nA Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In order to have a Hamiltonian cycle, each vertex must have a degree of at least 2, because each vertex must be connected to two other vertices in the cycle.\n\nHowever, in the given degree sequence, there are three vertices with a degree of 1. These vertices can only be connected to one other vertex, which means they cannot be part of a Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore, a graph with this degree sequence cannot have a Hamiltonian cycle."
