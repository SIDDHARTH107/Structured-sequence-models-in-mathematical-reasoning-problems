    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, we are given that the population distribution is already normal.\n\nThe mean (μ) of the population is 150 grams, and the standard deviation (σ) is 20 grams. We have a sample size (n) of 50 apples. \n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean), which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nσ_sample_mean = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of average weights (145 grams and 155 grams). The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor 145 grams:\n\nz1 = (145 - 150) / 2.83 ≈ -1.77\n\nFor 155 grams:\n\nz2 = (155 - 150) / 2.83 ≈ 1.77\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score lies between -1.77 and 1.77. We can use a z-table or calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-1.77 < z < 1.77) ≈ 0.9236\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the 50 randomly selected apples is between 145 grams and 155 grams is approximately 92.36%."
