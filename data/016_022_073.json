    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal that is constructed by repeatedly removing tetrahedra from the structure. In each iteration, the number of smaller tetrahedra added to the structure is three times the number of tetrahedra added in the previous iteration.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of triangles needed for each iteration:\n\n1st iteration: 1 large tetrahedron (4 triangles)\n2nd iteration: 4 smaller tetrahedra (4 * 4 = 16 triangles)\n3rd iteration: 4 * 3 = 12 smaller tetrahedra (12 * 4 = 48 triangles)\n4th iteration: 12 * 3 = 36 smaller tetrahedra (36 * 4 = 144 triangles)\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of triangles for all 4 iterations:\n\n4 (1st iteration) + 16 (2nd iteration) + 48 (3rd iteration) + 144 (4th iteration) = 212 triangles\n\nSo, a total of 212 triangles are needed to construct the Sierpinski pyramid up to the 4th iteration."
