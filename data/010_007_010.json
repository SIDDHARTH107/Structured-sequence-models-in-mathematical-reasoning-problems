Suppose there exists a covering space $p: \\tilde{X} \\rightarrow X$ with cardinality $|\\tilde{X}|=6$. \n\nFind the number of non-isomorphic covering spaces $p': \\hat{X} \\rightarrow X$ such that $p'$ is a regular covering and $\\pi_1(\\hat{X}, \\hat{x_0}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.",
    "message_2": "Let $G = \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and let $H = \\pi_1(\\hat{X}, \\hat{x_0}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. We know that $G$ acts on the fiber of the covering space $p': \\hat{X} \\rightarrow X$ by deck transformations. Since $p'$ is a regular covering, the action of $G$ on the fiber is transitive, and the stabilizer of a point in the fiber is isomorphic to $H$. \n\nBy the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the order of the fiber is equal to the index of $H$ in $G$. Since $G$ is infinite cyclic, it has a unique subgroup of each positive index, so the index of $H$ in $G$ is well-defined. Let $n = [G : H]$. Then, the cardinality of the fiber is $n$, and the cardinality of $\\hat{X}$ is $6n$. \n\nNow, we want to find the number of non-isomorphic covering spaces $p': \\hat{X} \\rightarrow X$ with the given properties. By the Galois correspondence between covering spaces and subgroups of the fundamental group, this is equivalent to finding the number of distinct subgroups $H$ of $G$ with the desired properties.\n\nSince $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, it has a unique subgroup of each positive index, generated by an integer $k$. Thus, we can identify $H$ with the subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$ generated by $k$. The condition $\\pi_1(\\hat{X}, \\hat{x_0}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ implies that $H$ is a free abelian group of rank 2. However, this is not possible, as every subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic and thus has rank at most 1.\n\nTherefore, there are no non-isomorphic covering spaces $p': \\hat{X} \\rightarrow X$ with the given properties. The answer is 0."
