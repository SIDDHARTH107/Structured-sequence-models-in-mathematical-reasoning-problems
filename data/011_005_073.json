    "message_1": "How many ways can 4 students be arranged in a line if they have to sit alternately: boy-girl-boy-girl?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the number of boys and girls among the 4 students. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: There are 2 boys and 2 girls.\nIn this case, we can arrange them in the following way: boy-girl-boy-girl or girl-boy-girl-boy. For each arrangement, there are 2! ways to arrange the boys and 2! ways to arrange the girls. So, the total number of ways for this case is 2! * 2! * 2 = 8 ways.\n\nCase 2: There are 3 boys and 1 girl or 1 boy and 3 girls.\nIn this case, it is impossible to arrange them in a line with the given condition (boy-girl-boy-girl), as there will always be two boys or two girls sitting next to each other.\n\nSo, the answer is 8 ways, considering there are 2 boys and 2 girls among the 4 students."
