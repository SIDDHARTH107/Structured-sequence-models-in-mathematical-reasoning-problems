    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of three functions, one for each variable:\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t).$$\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + iX(x)Y''(y)T(t).$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + i\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}.$$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $t$ only and the right-hand side is a function of $x$ and $y$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this constant by $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2.$$\n\nNow, we have two separate ODEs:\n\n$$\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2T(t),$$\n$$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0,$$\n$$Y''(y) - ik^2Y(y) = 0.$$\n\nThe first ODE has the solution:\n\n$$T(t) = e^{-k^2t}.$$\n\nThe second ODE has the solution:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0, y, t) = u(\\pi, y, t) = 0$, we get $B = 0$ and $k = n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus,\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(nx).$$\n\nThe third ODE has the solution:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\sinh(\\frac{k}{2}y) + D\\cosh(\\frac{k}{2}y).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(x, 0, t) = u(x, \\pi, t) = 0$, we get $D = 0$ and $Y_n(y) = C_n\\sinh(\\frac{n}{2}(y - \\pi))$. \n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n e^{-n^2t} \\sin(nx) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n}{2}(y-\\pi)\\right),$$\n\nwhere $a_n = A_nC_n$.\n\nTo find the constants $a_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x, y, 0) = e^{-x^2 - y^2}$. This gives:\n\n$$e^{-x^2 - y^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\sin(nx) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n}{2}(y-\\pi)\\right).$$\n\nWe can find the coefficients $a_n$ by multiplying both sides by $\\sin(mx)$ and integrating from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n\n$$\\int_0^\\pi e^{-x^2 - y^2} \\sin(mx) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(nx) \\sin(mx) dx \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n}{2}(y-\\pi)\\right).$$\n\nThe integral on the right-hand side is non-zero only when $m = n$, and its value is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for $m = n$. Thus,\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi e^{-x^2 - y^2} \\sin(nx) dx.$$\n\nFinally, the solution to the given PDE with the initial and boundary conditions is:\n\n$$u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi e^{-x^2 - y^2} \\sin(nx) dx\\right) e^{-(n^2 + 1/4)t} \\sin(nx) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n}{2}(y-\\pi)\\right).$$"
