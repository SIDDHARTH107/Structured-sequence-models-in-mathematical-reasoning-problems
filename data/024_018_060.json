    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface S at point P, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature K. The surface S is a sphere with radius r = sqrt(10). The Gaussian curvature K of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nK = 1 / r²\n\nIn this case, r = sqrt(10), so:\n\nK = 1 / (sqrt(10)²) = 1 / 10\n\nNow, the sectional curvature is equal to the Gaussian curvature for a sphere. Therefore, the sectional curvature of the surface S at point P is:\n\nSectional curvature = K = 1 / 10"
