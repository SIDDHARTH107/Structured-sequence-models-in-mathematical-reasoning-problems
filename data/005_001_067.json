    "message_1": "A coffee company claims that their coffee machine produces cups of coffee with a mean weight of 200 grams. However, a group of 25 students conducted an experiment and obtained a sample mean weight of 195 grams with a sample standard deviation of 12 grams. Can the students reject the coffee company's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the students can reject the coffee company's claim at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean weight of the coffee is 200 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean weight is not 200 grams.\n\nH0: μ = 200\nH1: μ ≠ 200\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 195 grams\n- Sample standard deviation (s) = 12 grams\n- Sample size (n) = 25 students\n- Significance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = (195 - 200) / (12 / √25)\nt = (-5) / (12 / 5)\nt = (-5) / 2.4\nt = -2.0833\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% level of significance and 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical = ±2.064\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.0833) falls within the critical t-value range (-2.064 to 2.064), we fail to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% level of significance. This means that there is not enough evidence to support the students' claim that the true mean weight of the coffee is different from 200 grams."
