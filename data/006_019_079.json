    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of 50 citizens in a country, at least 10 will vote for a specific political party if historically 40% of citizens have voted for that party in previous elections?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nwhere P(X ≥ k) is the probability of at least k successes (voters for the party), P(X < k) is the probability of fewer than k successes, n is the number of trials (citizens), p is the probability of success (40% or 0.4), and k is the number of successes we are interested in (10).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate P(X < 10), which is the probability of having fewer than 10 voters for the party. We can do this by summing the probabilities for 0 to 9 voters:\n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nThe binomial probability formula for each term is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probabilities for each term and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(50, k) * 0.4^k * 0.6^(50-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of at least 10 voters for the party:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10)\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.0016\n\nSo, the probability of at least 10 voters for the party is:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - 0.0016 ≈ 0.9984\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least 10 out of 50 citizens will vote for the specific political party is approximately 99.84%."
