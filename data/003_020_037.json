    "message_1": "A person standing 20 meters away from the base of a building looks up at an angle of 30 degrees. How tall is the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 30 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the person to the building (20 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(30) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(30)\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\nheight = 20 * 0.577\n\nheight ≈ 11.54 meters\n\nSo, the building is approximately 11.54 meters tall."
