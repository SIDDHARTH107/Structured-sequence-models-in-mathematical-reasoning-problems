    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge dual of α at the point (1,2,3), we first need to define an inner product on the space of differential forms and a volume form on M. Let's assume that M is equipped with a Riemannian metric g and the associated volume form is given by vol_g = √det(g) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, where det(g) is the determinant of the metric tensor g.\n\nNow, let's recall the definition of the Hodge dual. Given a p-form ω, its Hodge dual *ω is a (n-p)-form such that for any p-form η, we have:\n\nω ∧ η = ⟨ω, η⟩ vol_g,\n\nwhere n is the dimension of the manifold (in this case, n = 3), and ⟨ω, η⟩ is the inner product of ω and η induced by the metric g.\n\nIn our case, α is a 2-form, so its Hodge dual *α will be a 1-form. We can write *α = A dx + B dy + C dz for some functions A, B, and C on M. To find these functions, we need to compute the inner product of α with the three 2-forms dx ∧ dy, dx ∧ dz, and dy ∧ dz, and then equate the result with the wedge product of α and the corresponding 1-forms.\n\nLet's compute the inner products:\n\n⟨α, dx ∧ dy⟩ = x * (-z) - y * (-y) - z * x = -xz + y^2 - zx = -2(1) + (2)^2 - (3)(1) = 1.\n\n⟨α, dx ∧ dz⟩ = x * (-z) - y * x - z * (-y) = -xz - xy + zy = -2(1) - (1)(2) + (3)(2) = 4.\n\n⟨α, dy ∧ dz⟩ = x * y - y * (-z) - z * (-x) = xy + yz + zx = (1)(2) + (2)(3) + (3)(1) = 11.\n\nNow, we equate these inner products with the wedge product of α and the 1-forms:\n\nα ∧ (A dx) = A(x dy ∧ dz - y dx ∧ dz - z dx ∧ dy) ∧ dx = -Ayz dx ∧ dy ∧ dz,\nα ∧ (B dy) = B(x dy ∧ dz - y dx ∧ dz - z dx ∧ dy) ∧ dy = Bxz dx ∧ dy ∧ dz,\nα ∧ (C dz) = C(x dy ∧ dz - y dx ∧ dz - z dx ∧ dy) ∧ dz = -Cxy dx ∧ dy ∧ dz.\n\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n\n-Ayz = 1,\nBxz = 4,\n-Cxy = 11.\n\nNow, we evaluate these functions at the point (1,2,3):\n\n-A(2)(3) = 1,\nB(1)(3) = 4,\n-C(1)(2) = 11.\n\nSolving for A, B, and C, we get:\n\nA = -1/6,\nB = 4/3,\nC = -11/2.\n\nThus, the Hodge dual of α at the point (1,2,3) is given by:\n\n*α(1,2,3) = (-1/6) dx + (4/3) dy - (11/2) dz."
