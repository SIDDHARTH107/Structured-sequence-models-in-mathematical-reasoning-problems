    "message_2": "To find the natural frequency and damping ratio of an RLC circuit, we need to use the following formulas:\n\nNatural frequency (ωn) = 1 / √(LC)\nDamping ratio (ζ) = R / (2 * √(L/C))\n\nGiven values:\nResistance (R) = 30 ohms\nInductance (L) = 0.1 Henry\nCapacitance (C) = 0.01 Farad\n\nFirst, let's find the natural frequency (ωn):\n\nωn = 1 / √(0.1 * 0.01)\nωn = 1 / √(0.001)\nωn ≈ 31.62 rad/s\n\nNow, let's find the damping ratio (ζ):\n\nζ = 30 / (2 * √(0.1/0.01))\nζ = 30 / (2 * √(10))\nζ = 30 / (2 * 3.16)\nζ ≈ 4.75\n\nSo, the natural frequency of the RLC circuit is approximately 31.62 rad/s, and the damping ratio is approximately 4.75."
