    "message_1": "A student needs to pack a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 10 pounds. There are five items to choose from, each with a different weight and value:\n\nItem 1: weight = 2 pounds, value = 5\nItem 2: weight = 3 pounds, value = 7\nItem 3: weight = 4 pounds, value = 9\nItem 4: weight = 5 pounds, value = 13\nItem 5: weight = 9 pounds, value = 18\n\nWhat is the maximum value the student can carry in their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value the student can carry in their knapsack, we can use a dynamic programming approach to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a given weight and item.\n\nLet's create a table with rows representing the items (0 to 5) and columns representing the weights (0 to 10). The cell at row i and column w will represent the maximum value that can be obtained using items 1 to i with a total weight not exceeding w.\n\nWe can fill the table using the following rules:\n\n1. If the row is 0 (no items) or the column is 0 (no weight), the maximum value is 0.\n2. If the weight of the current item (item i) is less than or equal to the current weight (w), we have two options: either include the item or not. We choose the option that gives the maximum value:\n   - Including the item: value[i] + table[i-1][w-weight[i]]\n   - Not including the item: table[i-1][w]\n3. If the weight of the current item is greater than the current weight, we cannot include the item, so the maximum value is the same as without the item: table[i-1][w]\n\nAfter filling the table, the maximum value will be in the bottom-right cell (table[5][10]).\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1  0  0  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5\n2  0  0  5  7  7 12 12 12 12 12 12\n3  0  0  5  7  9 12 14 16 16 21 21\n4  0  0  5  7  9 13 15 18 20 22 25\n5  0  0  5  7  9 13 15 18 20 22 25\n```\n\nThe maximum value the student can carry in their knapsack is 25."
