    "message_1": "A student needs to find the probability that a car accident on a particular stretch of road in a year is a rear-end collision. The data shows that out of 500 accidents that occurred on that road in the past year, 200 were rear-end collisions. What is the probability of a rear-end collision on this road in a year? Express the answer as a fraction and percentage.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a rear-end collision, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of rear-end collisions) / (Total number of accidents)\n\nIn this case, there were 200 rear-end collisions out of 500 accidents. So, the probability is:\n\nProbability = 200 / 500\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 100:\n\nProbability = (200 / 100) / (500 / 100) = 2 / 5\n\nSo, the probability of a rear-end collision on this road in a year is 2/5.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can multiply the fraction by 100:\n\nPercentage = (2 / 5) * 100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, the probability of a rear-end collision on this road in a year is 2/5 or 40%."
