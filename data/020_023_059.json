    "message_1": "Suppose you have a total of $100,000 to invest in two stocks, A and B. The average expected annual return for stock A is 8% with a standard deviation of 10%, while the average expected annual return for stock B is 10% with a standard deviation of 15%. The correlation between the two stocks is 0.5. Determine the optimal investment allocation between the two stocks that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk (i.e., standard deviation) of the portfolio.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal investment allocation between the two stocks, we need to find the portfolio weights that maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk (standard deviation). Let's denote the weight of stock A as wA and the weight of stock B as wB. Since we are investing the entire $100,000, we have:\n\nwA + wB = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = wA * RA + wB * RB\n\nwhere RA and RB are the expected returns of stock A and stock B, respectively.\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp^2 = (wA * σA)^2 + (wB * σB)^2 + 2 * wA * wB * σA * σB * ρAB\n\nwhere σA and σB are the standard deviations of stock A and stock B, respectively, and ρAB is the correlation between the two stocks.\n\nOur goal is to maximize Rp while minimizing σp. This can be done using the concept of the efficient frontier, which is a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. To find the optimal weights, we can use the following formula:\n\nwA = (σB^2 - ρAB * σA * σB) / (σA^2 + σB^2 - 2 * ρAB * σA * σB)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nwA = (0.15^2 - 0.5 * 0.1 * 0.15) / (0.1^2 + 0.15^2 - 2 * 0.5 * 0.1 * 0.15)\nwA ≈ 0.5952\n\nSince wA + wB = 1, we can find wB:\n\nwB = 1 - wA\nwB ≈ 0.4048\n\nSo, the optimal investment allocation is approximately 59.52% in stock A and 40.48% in stock B. In terms of the $100,000 investment:\n\nAmount in stock A = $100,000 * 0.5952 ≈ $59,520\nAmount in stock B = $100,000 * 0.4048 ≈ $40,480"
