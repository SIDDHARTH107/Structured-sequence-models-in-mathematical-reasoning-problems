Let's assume that Alice chooses a prime number `p = 11` and a primitive root `g = 2`, and her private key is `a = 4`. Bob chooses the same prime number `p = 11` and primitive root `g = 2`, and his private key is `b = 3`.\n\nWhat is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for secure communication?",

Bob computes his public key (B) using the formula: B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = B^a mod p\n4.
