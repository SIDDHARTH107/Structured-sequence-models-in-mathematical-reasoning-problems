    "message_2": "To solve the given Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, we can use the method of successive approximations. We start by assuming an initial guess for the function $\\phi(x)$, and then iteratively improve the approximation. Let's denote the successive approximations by $\\phi_n(x)$.\n\nWe start with the initial guess $\\phi_0(x) = e^{2x} - 1$, which satisfies the boundary conditions $\\phi_0(0) = 0$ and $\\phi_0(1) = 1$. Now, we can define the successive approximations as follows:\n\n$$\\phi_{n+1}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin(xt)}{\\sqrt{t(1-t)}}\\phi_n(t)dt + e^{2x} - 1$$\n\nWe can now compute the first few approximations:\n\n1. $\\phi_1(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin(xt)}{\\sqrt{t(1-t)}}(e^{2t} - 1)dt + e^{2x} - 1$\n2. $\\phi_2(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin(xt)}{\\sqrt{t(1-t)}}\\phi_1(t)dt + e^{2x} - 1$\n3. $\\phi_3(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\sin(xt)}{\\sqrt{t(1-t)}}\\phi_2(t)dt + e^{2x} - 1$\n\nAnd so on. The solution to the integral equation will be the limit of this sequence of approximations as $n \\to \\infty$:\n\n$$\\phi(x) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\phi_n(x)$$\n\nIn practice, we can compute a few terms of this sequence and check if the approximations converge to a stable solution. If the approximations converge, we can use the last computed approximation as an estimate for the solution of the integral equation."
