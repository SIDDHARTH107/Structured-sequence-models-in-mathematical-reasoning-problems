    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into a triangular form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 1  2  3 |  8 |\n| 2  3  1 | 11 |\n| 3  2  1 | 10 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the 2 in the second row, first column.\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  8  |\n| 0  -1 -5 | -5  |\n| 3  2   1 | 10  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 3 in the third row, first column.\nSubtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  8  |\n| 0  -1 -5 | -5  |\n| 0  -4 -8 | -14 |\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  8  |\n| 0  1   5 |  5  |\n| 0  -4 -8 | -14 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the -4 in the third row, second column.\nAdd 4 times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  8  |\n| 0  1   5 |  5  |\n| 0  0   12|  6  |\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 12 to get a leading coefficient of 1:\n\n| 1  2   3 |  8  |\n| 0  1   5 |  5  |\n| 0  0   1 |  1/2|\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 1/2.\n\nSubstitute z into the second row equation: y + 5(1/2) = 5, which gives y = 5 - 5/2 = 5/2.\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first row equation: x + 2(5/2) + 3(1/2) = 8, which gives x = 8 - 5 - 3/2 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1/2, y = 5/2, and z = 1/2."
