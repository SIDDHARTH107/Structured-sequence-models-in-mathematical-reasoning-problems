    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number.\n\nTo find the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a twin prime, we can start by listing the first few Sophie Germain primes and their corresponding twin primes:\n\n1. p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5 (2 is not a twin prime)\n2. p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7 (3 is a twin prime with 5)\n3. p = 5, 2p + 1 = 11 (5 is not a twin prime)\n4. p = 11, 2p + 1 = 23 (11 is not a twin prime)\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a twin prime is 3."
