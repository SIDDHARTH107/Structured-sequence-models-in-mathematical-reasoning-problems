    "message_1": "A bakery claims that the average weight of their cupcakes is 120 grams. To test this claim, a sample of 20 cupcakes was selected and weighed. The computed average weight of the sample was 118 grams with a standard deviation of 6 grams. Using a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the bakery's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the bakery's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average weight of the cupcakes is 120 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average weight is not 120 grams.\n\nH0: μ = 120 grams\nH1: μ ≠ 120 grams\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 20\nSample mean (x̄) = 118 grams\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 6 grams\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is small (n < 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown, we will use the t-distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nwhere μ is the population mean, x̄ is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (118 - 120) / (6 / √20)\nt = -2 / (6 / 4.47)\nt = -2 / 1.34\nt ≈ -1.49\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 19 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.093.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-1.49) is within the range of the critical t-values (-2.093 to 2.093), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to reject the bakery's claim that the average weight of their cupcakes is 120 grams at a 0.05 significance level."
