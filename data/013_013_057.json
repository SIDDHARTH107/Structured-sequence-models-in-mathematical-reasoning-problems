    "message_1": "Suppose there are 3 bidders participating in a sealed bid first-price auction for a rare piece of art. Bidder 1 values the art at $10,000, bidder 2 values the art at $8,000 and bidder 3 values the art at $12,000. Assuming all bidders bid their true valuations, what will be the winning bid and what is the total revenue generated from the auction?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid first-price auction, each bidder submits a bid without knowing the bids of the other participants, and the highest bidder wins the auction. Assuming all bidders bid their true valuations, the bids will be as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $10,000\nBidder 2: $8,000\nBidder 3: $12,000\n\nThe winning bid is the highest bid, which is $12,000 from bidder 3. The total revenue generated from the auction is equal to the winning bid, which is $12,000."
