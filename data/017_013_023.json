Determine the possible groups using the Sylow theorems.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, there are the following possibilities for the Sylow subgroups:\n\n- A 2-Sylow subgroup of order 2: There is only one group of order 2, which is the cyclic group Z2.\n- A 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9: There are two groups of order 9, which are the cyclic group Z9 and the non-abelian group of order 9, which is the direct product of Z3 and the automorphism group of Z3, i.e., Z3 x Aut(Z3).\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of these Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Z2 x Z9: This is a direct product of two cyclic groups, which results in a cyclic group of order 18, denoted as Z18.\n2. Z2 x (Z3 x Aut(Z3)): This is a direct product of Z2 and the non-abelian group of order 9. This results in a non-abelian group of order 18, denoted as Z6 x Z3.\n\nThus, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z18 and Z6 x Z3."
