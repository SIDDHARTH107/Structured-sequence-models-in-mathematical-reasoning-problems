The distances between the locations are as follows: \n\n- Location A to B: 20 km\n- Location A to C: 15 km\n- Location A to D: 30 km\n- Location B to C: 25 km\n- Location B to D: 18 km\n- Location C to D: 22 km \n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the delivery driver can travel to deliver all packages in one round trip starting and ending at Location A?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we can use the brute force method to list all possible routes and calculate their distances. Since the delivery driver starts and ends at Location A, we only need to consider the order of visiting Locations B, C, and D.\n\nHere are all possible routes and their distances:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A\n   20 + 25 + 22 + 15 = 82 km\n\n2. A → B → D → C → A\n   20 + 18 + 22 + 15 = 75 km\n\n3. A → C → B → D → A\n   15 + 25 + 18 + 30 = 88 km\n\n4. A → C → D → B → A\n   15 + 22 + 18 + 20 = 75 km\n\n5. A → D → B → C → A\n   30 + 18 + 25 + 15 = 88 km\n\n6. A → D → C → B → A\n   30 + 22 + 25 + 20 = 97 km\n\nThe shortest possible distance is 75 km, which can be achieved by following either Route 2 (A → B → D → C → A) or Route 4 (A → C → D → B → A)."
