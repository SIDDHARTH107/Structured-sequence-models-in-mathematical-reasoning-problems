    "message_2": "To find the frequency content, amplitude, and phase angle of each component of the signal, we can rewrite the given signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nEuler's formula: e^(jx) = cos(x) + jsin(x)\n\nThe given signal f(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 3cos(4πt) + 2sin(6πt) can be rewritten as:\n\nf(t) = 5(e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt))/2j + 3(e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt))/2 + 2(e^(j6πt) - e^(-j6πt))/2j\n\nNow, we can see that the signal has three frequency components:\n\n1. Frequency component 1: 2π (first term)\n   Amplitude: 5\n   Phase angle: -π/2 (since it's a sine term)\n\n2. Frequency component 2: 4π (second term)\n   Amplitude: 3\n   Phase angle: 0 (since it's a cosine term)\n\n3. Frequency component 3: 6π (third term)\n   Amplitude: 2\n   Phase angle: -π/2 (since it's a sine term)\n\nSo, the frequency content, amplitude, and phase angle of each component of the signal are:\n\n1. Frequency component 1: 2π, amplitude: 5, phase angle: -π/2\n2. Frequency component 2: 4π, amplitude: 3, phase angle: 0\n3. Frequency component 3: 6π, amplitude: 2, phase angle: -π/2"
