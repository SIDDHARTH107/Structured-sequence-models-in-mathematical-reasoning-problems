    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs, Classic and Modern. Each Classic chair can be sold for $80, and each Modern chair can be sold for $100. Each Classic chair requires 2 hours of labor, and each Modern chair requires 3 hours of labor. The manufacturer has 180 hours of labor available per week. If the production cost of each Classic chair is $40, and the production cost of each Modern chair is $50, how many of each type of chair should the manufacturer produce per week to maximize their profit?\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the manufacturer can make per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Classic chairs and y be the number of Modern chairs produced per week.\n\nThe profit for each Classic chair is $80 - $40 = $40, and the profit for each Modern chair is $100 - $50 = $50.\n\nThe total profit P can be represented as:\nP = 40x + 50y\n\nThe labor constraint is:\n2x + 3y â‰¤ 180\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can use the graphical method by plotting the labor constraint and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the labor constraint equation is an equality:\n2x + 3y = 180\n\nWhen x = 0:\n3y = 180\ny = 60\n\nWhen y = 0:\n2x = 180\nx = 90\n\nSo, we have two points (0, 60) and (90, 0). Plotting these points and the labor constraint line, we find the feasible region is the area below the line, including the line itself.\n\nNow, we'll find the integer points (x, y) in the feasible region that maximize the profit P. We can start by checking the points on the line 2x + 3y = 180:\n\n1. (0, 60): P = 40(0) + 50(60) = $3000\n2. (90, 0): P = 40(90) + 50(0) = $3600\n\nWe can also check the points just below the line:\n\n3. (30, 50): 2(30) + 3(50) = 180; P = 40(30) + 50(50) = $3700\n4. (60, 40): 2(60) + 3(40) = 180; P = 40(60) + 50(40) = $3800\n5. (75, 30): 2(75) + 3(30) = 180; P = 40(75) + 50(30) = $3750\n\nComparing the profits, we find that producing 60 Classic chairs and 40 Modern chairs per week will maximize the profit.\n\nThe maximum profit the manufacturer can make per week is $3800."
