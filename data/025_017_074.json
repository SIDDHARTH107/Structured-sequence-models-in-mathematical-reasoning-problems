How many points do we need to blow up?",
    "message_2": "We will first analyze the singular points of the variety and then proceed to find its minimal resolution.\n\nLet $V$ be the variety defined by the given equations in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The singular points of $V$ are the points where the gradients of the defining polynomials simultaneously vanish. Let $F_1 = x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2$ and $F_2 = x_0x_2 - x_1x_3$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla F_1 &= (2x_0, 2x_1, 2x_2, 2x_3) \\\\\n\\nabla F_2 &= (x_2, -x_3, x_0, -x_1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe gradients simultaneously vanish if and only if $x_0 = x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0$. However, this is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. Thus, $V$ has no singular points.\n\nSince $V$ has no singular points, its minimal resolution is itself, and we do not need to blow up any points."
