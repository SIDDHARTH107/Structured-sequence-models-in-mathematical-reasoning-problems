    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or the Gosper Island fractal, is a continuous fractal curve that can be constructed using a set of substitution rules. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 7.\n\nLet L be the length of the Gosper curve after n iterations. The formula for the length of the curve after n iterations is:\n\nL(n) = L(0) * (sqrt(7))^n\n\nwhere L(0) is the initial length of the curve (1 unit in this case).\n\nWe want to find the length of the curve after 5 iterations, so we'll plug in n = 5:\n\nL(5) = 1 * (sqrt(7))^5\n\nL(5) ≈ 1 * 168.169997\n\nL(5) ≈ 168.169997 units\n\nSo, the length of the Gosper curve after the first 5 iterations is approximately 168.169997 units."
