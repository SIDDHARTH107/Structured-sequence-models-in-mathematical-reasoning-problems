    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36. We will first find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the index of the 3-subgroup, which is 2^2 = 4. So n_3 must divide 4.\n2. n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n3. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the index of the 2-subgroup, which is 3^2 = 9. So n_2 must divide 9.\n4. n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nFor n_3, the only divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. The only one of these that is congruent to 1 modulo 3 is 1. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nFor n_2, the only divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The only one of these that is congruent to 1 modulo 2 is 1. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, let P be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G (by Sylow's theorem). The order of P is 9 and the order of Q is 4. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}.\n\nNow, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 4 / 1 = 36. Since |PQ| = |G|, we have G = PQ. Thus, G is a semi-direct product of P and Q.\n\nNow we consider the three isomorphism types:\n\n1. C36: This is the cyclic group of order 36. It is abelian, so both P and Q are normal in G. The semi-direct product of P and Q is the direct product in this case, so G = P × Q. This is a possible isomorphism type for G.\n\n2. A4 × C3: This is the direct product of the alternating group of degree 4 and the cyclic group of order 3. The order of A4 is 12, which is not divisible by 9, so it cannot contain a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C3.\n\n3. Non-abelian: If G is non-abelian, then the semi-direct product of P and Q is not a direct product. In this case, G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 36 with a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information that G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, the group G must be isomorphic to either C36 or a non-abelian group of order 36."
