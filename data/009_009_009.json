    "message_2": "To write the Schrödinger equation for the system, we first need to express the potential energy V(x) in terms of the position operator x. The potential energy is given by V(x) = 10x² J. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional system is given by:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + V(x) * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) J s), m is the mass of the particle (0.3 kg), ψ(x) is the wave function, and E is the energy of the system.\n\nNow we have:\n\n(-ħ² / 2 * 0.3) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + 10x² * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nTo find the first three energy levels, we need to solve this differential equation for the allowed energy values E. This is a quantum harmonic oscillator problem, and the energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħω\n\nwhere n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...) and ω is the angular frequency of the oscillator. The angular frequency ω is related to the potential energy V(x) by:\n\nω = sqrt(k / m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant, which can be found from the potential energy V(x) = 1/2 * k * x². In this case, k = 20 kg/s². Now we can find ω:\n\nω = sqrt(20 / 0.3) = sqrt(200/3)\n\nNow we can find the first three energy levels (n = 0, 1, 2):\n\nE_0 = (1/2) * ħ * sqrt(200/3)\nE_1 = (3/2) * ħ * sqrt(200/3)\nE_2 = (5/2) * ħ * sqrt(200/3)\n\nThese are the first three energy levels for the given system."
