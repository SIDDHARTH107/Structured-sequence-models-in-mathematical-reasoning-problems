    "message_2": "To find the largest angle, we will use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 20 in this case. Let's denote the sides as a = 10, b = 15, and c = 20, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C respectively. We want to find angle C.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n20^2 = 10^2 + 15^2 - 2 * 10 * 15 * cos(C)\n\nSolving for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (10^2 + 15^2 - 20^2) / (2 * 10 * 15)\ncos(C) = (-50) / 300\ncos(C) = -1/6\n\nNow, we will find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of -1/6:\n\nC = arccos(-1/6)\n\nC ≈ 97.41°\n\nSo, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 97.41°."
