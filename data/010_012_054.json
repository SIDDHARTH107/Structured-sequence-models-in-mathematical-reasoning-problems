    "message_2": "To determine if $f$ is a smooth map, we need to check if all the partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous. Let's compute the first partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\cdot 2x = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\cdot 2y = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$$\n\nBoth of these partial derivatives exist and are continuous everywhere except at the origin $(0,0)$. Now let's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right) = \\frac{(x^2 + y^2) - x^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{y^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right) = \\frac{(x^2 + y^2) - y^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{x^2}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right) = \\frac{-xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right) = \\frac{-xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\nAll of these second partial derivatives exist and are continuous everywhere except at the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nSince all the partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous everywhere except at the origin $(0,0)$, we can conclude that $f$ is a smooth map on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. However, $f$ is not a smooth map on the entire $\\mathbb{R}^2$ due to the singularity at the origin."
