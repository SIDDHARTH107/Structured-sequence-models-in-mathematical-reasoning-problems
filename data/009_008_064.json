    "message_2": "To find the wave equation that describes the motion of the rope, we need to consider the wave speed (v) and the linear density (μ) of the rope. The wave speed can be determined using the formula:\n\nv = √(T/μ)\n\nwhere T is the tension in the rope and μ is the linear density.\n\nGiven the tension T = 50 N and the linear density μ = 0.2 kg/m, we can find the wave speed:\n\nv = √(50/0.2) = √(250) ≈ 15.81 m/s\n\nNow that we have the wave speed, we can write the wave equation that describes the motion of the rope. The general form of the wave equation is:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere y(x, t) represents the displacement of the rope at position x and time t, A is the amplitude of the wave, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase constant.\n\nThe wave number k and angular frequency ω are related to the wave speed v by the following equations:\n\nk = 2π/λ\nω = 2πf\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength and f is the frequency of the wave. Since we are not given any information about the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, or phase constant, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we can still write the wave equation in terms of the wave speed:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nSubstituting the relationship between k, ω, and v:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin((2π/λ)x - (2πf)t + φ)\n\nSince v = λf, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin((2π/v)x - (2π/v)vt + φ)\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin((2π/v)x - 2πt + φ)\n\nGiven the wave speed v ≈ 15.81 m/s, the wave equation that describes the motion of the rope is:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin((2π/15.81)x - 2πt + φ)\n\nThe speed at which the wave travels is approximately 15.81 m/s."
