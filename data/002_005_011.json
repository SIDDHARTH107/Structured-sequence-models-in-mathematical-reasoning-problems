    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. Find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the prism:\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we can plug in the values:\n\nd^2 = (8 cm)^2 + (6 cm)^2 + (10 cm)^2\nd^2 = 64 cm^2 + 36 cm^2 + 100 cm^2\nd^2 = 200 cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the length of the diagonal by taking the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nd = √(200 cm^2)\nd ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm."
