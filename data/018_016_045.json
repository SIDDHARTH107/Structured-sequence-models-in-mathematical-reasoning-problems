    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal:\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nHowever, this does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union. The question is asking to prove that A × B ≠ B × A, which is a different statement.\n\nWe can easily show that A × B ≠ B × A by comparing the two Cartesian products:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as the ordered pairs in each set are different. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
