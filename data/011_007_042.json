    "message_1": "An office has a group of 5 employees. Each employee needs to review 2 documents. If each employee can review any document and no employee can review a document more than once, how many different ways can the documents be reviewed? Use recurrence relation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of ways to distribute n documents among 5 employees as T(n). Each employee needs to review 2 documents, so we need to distribute 2n documents in total.\n\nWe can set up a recurrence relation for T(n) as follows:\n\n1. For the base case, when n = 1 (2 documents in total), there are 5 employees who can review the first document and 4 employees who can review the second document. So, T(1) = 5 * 4 = 20.\n\n2. For n > 1, consider the first document. There are 5 employees who can review it. After one employee reviews it, we are left with a similar problem of distributing 2(n-1) documents among the remaining 4 employees and the one who already reviewed a document. \n\nLet's denote the number of ways to distribute 2(n-1) documents among 4 employees as S(n-1). Then, the recurrence relation for T(n) can be written as:\n\nT(n) = 5 * S(n-1)\n\nNow, we need to find a recurrence relation for S(n-1). We can do this by considering the employee who has already reviewed a document:\n\n1. If this employee reviews another document, we are left with a problem of distributing 2(n-2) documents among the remaining 4 employees. This is equivalent to T(n-2).\n\n2. If this employee does not review another document, we are left with a problem of distributing 2(n-1) documents among the remaining 4 employees, with each employee needing to review 2 documents. This is equivalent to S(n-1).\n\nSo, the recurrence relation for S(n-1) can be written as:\n\nS(n-1) = T(n-2) + S(n-1)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for S(n-1) into the recurrence relation for T(n):\n\nT(n) = 5 * (T(n-2) + S(n-1))\n\nUsing the base case T(1) = 20, we can find the values of T(n) for n > 1:\n\nT(2) = 5 * (T(0) + S(1))\nT(2) = 5 * (20 + S(1))\nT(2) = 100 + 5 * S(1)\n\nTo find S(1), we can use the recurrence relation for S(n-1):\n\nS(1) = T(-1) + S(1)\nS(1) = 0 + S(1)\n\nSo, S(1) = 0, and T(2) = 100.\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nT(3) = 5 * (T(1) + S(2))\nT(3) = 5 * (20 + S(2))\nT(3) = 100 + 5 * S(2)\n\nTo find S(2), we can use the recurrence relation for S(n-1):\n\nS(2) = T(0) + S(2)\nS(2) = 20 + S(2)\n\nSo, S(2) = 20, and T(3) = 200.\n\nFor n = 4:\n\nT(4) = 5 * (T(2) + S(3))\nT(4) = 5 * (100 + S(3))\nT(4) = 500 + 5 * S(3)\n\nTo find S(3), we can use the recurrence relation for S(n-1):\n\nS(3) = T(1) + S(3)\nS(3) = 20 + S(3)\n\nSo, S(3) = 20, and T(4) = 600.\n\nThus, the number of different ways the documents can be reviewed for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 20, 100, 200, and 600, respectively."
