    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B). Show that the results are not equal, hence proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the sets (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B) contain the same elements, which means they are equal:\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = (B x A) U (A x B)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the union of the Cartesian products is commutative, the Cartesian products themselves are not commutative:\n\nA x B â‰  B x A\n\nThis is because the order of the elements in the ordered pairs is different in A x B and B x A. The union operation doesn't take the order of elements into account, which is why the union of the Cartesian products is commutative."
