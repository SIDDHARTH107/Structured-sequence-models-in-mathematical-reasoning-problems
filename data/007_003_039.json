    "message_2": "To find the remainder when a is divided by b using modular arithmetic, we can use the modulo operation, which is denoted by the percentage symbol (%). In this case, we have:\n\na = 25\nb = 14\n\nremainder = a % b\nremainder = 25 % 14\n\nNow, we can perform the modulo operation:\n\n25 divided by 14 equals 1 with a remainder of 11.\n\nSo, the remainder when a is divided by b is 11."
