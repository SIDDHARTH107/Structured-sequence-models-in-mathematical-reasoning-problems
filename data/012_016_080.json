    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutteâ€“Whitney polynomial, is a graph invariant that can be used to study various properties of a graph. It is defined as T_G(x, y), where G is a graph with vertices V and edges E.\n\nTo compute the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we can use the following recursive formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G\\e(x, y) + T_G/e(x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT_G(x, y) = x * T_G\\e(x, y) + y * T_G/e(x, y) if e is a loop,\nT_G(x, y) = T_G\\e(x, y) if e is neither a bridge nor a loop,\nT_G(x, y) = 1 if G is the empty graph.\n\nHere, G\\e denotes the graph obtained by deleting the edge e from G, and G/e denotes the graph obtained by contracting the edge e in G.\n\nNow let's compute the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G with vertices V={a,b,c,d} and edges E={(a,b),(a,c),(b,d),(c,d)}.\n\nFirst, we need to find a bridge or a loop in the graph. In this case, there are no bridges or loops. So, we can choose any edge, say (a, b), and apply the third rule:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G\\e(x, y) = T_{G - (a, b)}(x, y),\n\nwhere G - (a, b) is the graph obtained by deleting the edge (a, b) from G. This graph has vertices V={a,b,c,d} and edges E={(a,c),(b,d),(c,d)}.\n\nNow, we can choose the edge (a, c) and apply the third rule again:\n\nT_{G - (a, b)}(x, y) = T_{G - (a, b) - (a, c)}(x, y) = T_{G - {(a, b), (a, c)}}(x, y),\n\nwhere G - {(a, b), (a, c)} is the graph obtained by deleting the edges (a, b) and (a, c) from G. This graph has vertices V={a,b,c,d} and edges E={(b,d),(c,d)}.\n\nFinally, we can choose the edge (b, d) and apply the third rule one more time:\n\nT_{G - {(a, b), (a, c)}}(x, y) = T_{G - {(a, b), (a, c), (b, d)}}(x, y) = T_{G - {(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)}}(x, y),\n\nwhere G - {(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)} is the empty graph. According to the fourth rule, the Tutte polynomial of the empty graph is 1:\n\nT_{G - {(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)}}(x, y) = 1.\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G is T_G(x, y) = 1."
