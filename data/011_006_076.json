    "message_1": "Suppose that you have 6 different books to place on a shelf. What is the number of ways to arrange those books if three of them are red, two are yellow, and one is green? Use generating functions to find the answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to represent the number of ways to arrange the books of each color. Let R(x) represent the generating function for the red books, Y(x) for the yellow books, and G(x) for the green book.\n\nSince there are 3 red books, the generating function for the red books is R(x) = x^3.\nSimilarly, there are 2 yellow books, so the generating function for the yellow books is Y(x) = x^2.\nThere is only 1 green book, so the generating function for the green book is G(x) = x.\n\nNow, we want to find the generating function for the arrangement of all the books. To do this, we multiply the generating functions for each color:\n\nF(x) = R(x) * Y(x) * G(x) = (x^3) * (x^2) * (x) = x^6\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^6 in the expansion of F(x). Since there is only one term in F(x), which is x^6, the coefficient of x^6 is 1.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that the books are distinct. To do this, we use the multinomial coefficient formula:\n\nNumber of ways = (6!)/(3! * 2! * 1!) = 720 / (6 * 2) = 720 / 12 = 60\n\nSo, there are 60 different ways to arrange the 6 books on the shelf with the given color restrictions."
