    "message_1": "One possible question related to Epistemic logic is:\n\nThere are three mathematicians - Alice, Bob, and Charlie - in a closed room with a single light bulb. At the beginning, the bulb is off. Each mathematician either knows or does not know whether the bulb is on. Moreover, each mathematician knows whether or not every other mathematician knows whether the bulb is on. After some time has passed, Alice says, \"I know whether the bulb is on.\" What can you conclude about the state of the bulb at that moment? \n\nNote: The answer is not uniquely determined; different assumptions about the knowledge and reasoning abilities of the mathematicians can lead to different conclusions.",
    "message_2": "Given the information provided, we can conclude that the light bulb is off.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Initially, the light bulb is off, and all three mathematicians are aware of this fact.\n2. Since each mathematician knows whether or not every other mathematician knows whether the bulb is on, they all know that everyone else also knows that the bulb is off.\n3. When Alice says, \"I know whether the bulb is on,\" she is essentially stating that she knows the bulb is off, as that was the initial state.\n4. Since Alice's statement does not provide any new information to Bob and Charlie, they also continue to know that the bulb is off.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the state of the bulb at that moment is off."
