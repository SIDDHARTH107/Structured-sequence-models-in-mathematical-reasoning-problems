    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has an angle of 60 degrees and a radius of 8 cm, what is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the angle of the sector (in degrees) and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60/360) × 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/6) × 16π\nArc length = 16π/6\nArc length = 8π/3 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the two radii (each 8 cm) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 2(8)\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 16\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (8π/3) + 16 cm."
