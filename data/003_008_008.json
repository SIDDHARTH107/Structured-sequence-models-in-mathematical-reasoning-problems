    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the height (opposite side) of the triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometry to find the height. Since the problem asks to use trigonometry, let's use the sine function.\n\nLet the base (adjacent side) be 'a' = 12 cm, the hypotenuse be 'c' = 20 cm, and the height (opposite side) be 'b'. Let the angle between the base and the hypotenuse be θ.\n\nWe know that:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = b / 20\n\nWe can find the value of sin(θ) using the cosine function:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = a / c\ncos(θ) = 12 / 20\ncos(θ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1 to find sin(θ):\n\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ)\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - (0.6)^2\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - 0.36\nsin^2(θ) = 0.64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nsin(θ) = √0.64\nsin(θ) = 0.8\n\nNow we can find the height (opposite side) 'b':\n\nsin(θ) = b / 20\n0.8 = b / 20\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20:\n\nb = 0.8 * 20\nb = 16 cm\n\nNow that we have the base and height, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 16\nArea = 6 * 16\nArea = 96 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 96 square centimeters."
