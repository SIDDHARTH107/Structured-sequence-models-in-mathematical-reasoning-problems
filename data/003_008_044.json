    "message_2": "To find the area of the right-angled triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nSince it's a right-angled triangle, the angle between the base and the height is 90 degrees. The sine of a 90-degree angle is 1.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10cm * 8cm * sin(90°)\nArea = (1/2) * 10cm * 8cm * 1\nArea = 5 * 8cm²\nArea = 40cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
