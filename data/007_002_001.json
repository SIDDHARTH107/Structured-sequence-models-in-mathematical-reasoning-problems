    "message_2": "Let's denote the number as 5X4, where X is the hundreds digit. The number can be represented as:\n\n100X + 50 + 4 = 100X + 54\n\nSince the number is a multiple of 11, we can write:\n\n100X + 54 = 11Y, where Y is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest value of X that makes Y an integer.\n\nLet's try X = 0:\n\n100(0) + 54 = 54\n\n54 is not a multiple of 11, so let's try X = 1:\n\n100(1) + 54 = 154\n\n154 is not a multiple of 11 either, so let's try X = 2:\n\n100(2) + 54 = 254\n\n254 is not a multiple of 11, so let's try X = 3:\n\n100(3) + 54 = 354\n\nNow, 354 is a multiple of 11 (11 * 32 = 354). So, the smallest multiple of 11 that has 4 as the units digit and 5 as the tens digit is 354."
