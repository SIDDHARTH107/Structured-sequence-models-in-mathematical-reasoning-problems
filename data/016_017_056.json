    "message_2": "The total length of the Heighway dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^n) / sqrt(2)\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the total length after 10 iterations. So, n = 10.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10) / sqrt(2)\nLength = 1 * 1024 / 1.41421356\nLength â‰ˆ 724.077343\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is approximately 724.077 units."
