    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs that are supposed to have a lifespan of 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 25 hours. A manager wants to test if the factory is meeting the lifespan requirements. The manager randomly selects 50 light bulbs and tests them. The sample mean lifespan is 980 hours. Can the manager conclude that the factory is not meeting the requirements at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the factory is not meeting the requirements at a 5% significance level, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The factory is meeting the requirements (μ = 1000 hours)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The factory is not meeting the requirements (μ ≠ 1000 hours)\n\nGiven data:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 1000 hours\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 25 hours\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 980 hours\n\nSince the population standard deviation is known, we can use the z-test. First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n\nSE = 25 / √50\nSE ≈ 3.54\n\nNow, we calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\nz = (980 - 1000) / 3.54\nz ≈ -5.65\n\nAt a 5% significance level, the critical z-scores for a two-tailed test are -1.96 and 1.96. Since our calculated z-score is -5.65, which is less than -1.96, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: The manager can conclude that the factory is not meeting the lifespan requirements at a 5% significance level."
