    "message_2": "To solve the inequality `2x + 5 ≥ 9` graphically, we first need to isolate x:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   `2x ≥ 4`\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   `x ≥ 2`\n\nNow, we can graph the inequality on a number line. Place a closed circle (since the inequality is greater than or equal to) at x = 2, and shade the region to the right of the circle, indicating that all values greater than or equal to 2 are part of the solution.\n\nIn interval notation, the solution is written as `[2, ∞)`, which means that the solution includes all values of x from 2 to infinity, including 2 itself."
