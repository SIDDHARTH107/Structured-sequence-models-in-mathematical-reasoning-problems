    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x + 1 in the interval [-5, 5] using the quasi-Newton method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nLet's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x + 1)/dx = 6x^2 + 6x - 36\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0. Since the quasi-Newton method is an iterative method, we need to start with an initial guess for the value of x. Let's start with x0 = 0 as our initial guess.\n\nThe quasi-Newton method uses the following update formula:\n\nx_(k+1) = x_k - f'(x_k) / f''(x_k)\n\nwhere x_(k+1) is the updated value of x, x_k is the current value of x, f'(x_k) is the derivative of the function evaluated at x_k, and f''(x_k) is the second derivative of the function evaluated at x_k.\n\nLet's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d(6x^2 + 6x - 36)/dx = 12x + 6\n\nNow, we can apply the quasi-Newton method iteratively until we reach a desired level of accuracy. For this example, let's use a tolerance of 1e-6:\n\n1. x0 = 0\n2. x1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0) = 0 - (6(0)^2 + 6(0) - 36) / (12(0) + 6) = 6\n3. x2 = x1 - f'(x1) / f''(x1) = 6 - (6(6)^2 + 6(6) - 36) / (12(6) + 6) ≈ 3.6\n4. x3 = x2 - f'(x2) / f''(x2) ≈ 3.6 - (6(3.6)^2 + 6(3.6) - 36) / (12(3.6) + 6) ≈ 2.84\n5. Continue iterating until the change between successive x values is less than the tolerance.\n\nAfter several iterations, we find that the critical point is approximately x ≈ 2.84. Since this critical point is within the interval [-5, 5], we can evaluate the function f(x) at this point to find the maximum value:\n\nf(2.84) ≈ 2(2.84)^3 + 3(2.84)^2 - 36(2.84) + 1 ≈ 15.72\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x + 1 in the interval [-5, 5] using the quasi-Newton method is approximately 15.72."
