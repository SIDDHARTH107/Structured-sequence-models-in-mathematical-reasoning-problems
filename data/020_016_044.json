    "message_2": "To design a cantilever beam with the lowest possible volume, we need to find the optimal dimensions of the beam's cross-section. We are given the following information:\n\n- Load at the end of the beam (P) = 100 kN\n- Maximum allowable stress (σ_max) = 200 MPa\n- Minimum height (h_min) = 10 mm\n\nFirst, we need to find the moment (M) acting on the beam due to the load. For a cantilever beam, the moment at the fixed end is given by:\n\nM = P * L\n\nwhere L is the length of the beam. However, since we are not given the length of the beam, we cannot find the exact moment value. Instead, we will express the required section modulus (S) in terms of the moment (M) and the maximum allowable stress (σ_max):\n\nS = M / σ_max\n\nNow, let's consider the rectangular cross-section of the beam with height (h) and width (b). The section modulus for a rectangular cross-section is given by:\n\nS = (b * h^2) / 6\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\n(b * h^2) / 6 = M / σ_max\n\nSince we want to minimize the volume of the beam, we need to minimize the product of the cross-sectional area (A = b * h) and the length (L). We can rewrite the equation in terms of the width (b):\n\nb = (6 * M) / (σ_max * h^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal height (h) that minimizes the volume. We are given the minimum height (h_min) as 10 mm. Since the stress in the beam is directly proportional to the height, increasing the height will decrease the stress, allowing for a smaller width. However, increasing the height will also increase the volume. Therefore, we need to find a balance between the height and width to minimize the volume.\n\nLet's start by using the minimum height (h_min) and calculate the corresponding width (b):\n\nb = (6 * M) / (σ_max * h_min^2)\nb = (6 * M) / (200 MPa * (10 mm)^2)\n\nSince we don't have the value of M, we cannot find the exact value of b. However, we can see that the width (b) is inversely proportional to the square of the height (h). This means that as the height increases, the width will decrease, but at a slower rate. Therefore, to minimize the volume, we should use the minimum height (h_min) of 10 mm.\n\nNow, we can express the volume (V) of the beam in terms of the length (L), width (b), and height (h_min):\n\nV = L * b * h_min\n\nSince we don't have the values of L and M, we cannot find the exact volume of the beam. However, we have found the optimal height (h_min) and the relationship between the width (b) and the moment (M) to minimize the volume of the cantilever beam."
