    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need to set up the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 5 (mod 6)\nx ≡ 6 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 7 (mod 8)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 6 * 7 * 8 = 336.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N / 6 = 336 / 6 = 56\nN2 = N / 7 = 336 / 7 = 48\nN3 = N / 8 = 336 / 8 = 42\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod 6) => 56^(-1) ≡ 2 (mod 6)\ny2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod 7) => 48^(-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod 8) => 42^(-1) ≡ 3 (mod 8)\n\nFinally, we can compute the solution:\n\nx = (5 * 56 * 2) + (6 * 48 * 1) + (7 * 42 * 3) = 560 + 288 + 882 = 1730\n\nSince we want the smallest positive integer, we take the result modulo N:\n\nx ≡ 1730 (mod 336) => x ≡ 194 (mod 336)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 194."
