    "message_2": "To calculate the number of possible unique permutations in a 3-round encryption process using a block cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits, we need to consider the number of possible input/output pairs for each round.\n\nFor a block size of 64 bits, there are 2^64 possible input/output pairs. Since each round uses a different subkey generated from the master key, we can assume that each round has 2^64 possible unique permutations.\n\nIn a 3-round encryption process, the number of possible unique permutations is the product of the number of permutations in each round. Therefore, the number of possible unique permutations is:\n\n(2^64) * (2^64) * (2^64) = 2^(64*3) = 2^192\n\nSo, there are 2^192 possible unique permutations in a 3-round encryption process using a block cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits, assuming each round uses a different subkey generated from the master key."
