    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function $f(z) = z^3 + z^2 - 1$, we can first look for any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root, it must be of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is $-1$ and the leading coefficient is $1$. The only factors of $-1$ are $-1$ and $1$, and the only factor of $1$ is $1$. Therefore, the only possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$. \n\nTesting these values, we find that neither $1$ nor $-1$ are roots of the polynomial:\n\n$f(1) = 1^3 + 1^2 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\n$f(-1) = (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \\neq 0$\n\nSince there are no rational roots, we must resort to numerical methods to find the zeros of the function. We can use the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method for finding the roots of a real-valued function. The Newton-Raphson method is given by the formula:\n\n$z_{n+1} = z_n - \\frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}$\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function $f(z)$:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^3 + z^2 - 1) = 3z^2 + 2z$\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method iteratively to find the zeros of the function. We will start with three initial guesses for the zeros: $z_0 = -1.5, 0, 1.5$. These initial guesses are chosen because they are within the region $|z| < 2$ and are likely to converge to different zeros.\n\nFor $z_0 = -1.5$:\n\n1. $z_1 = -1.5 - \\frac{(-1.5)^3 + (-1.5)^2 - 1}{3(-1.5)^2 + 2(-1.5)} \\approx -1.8794$\n2. $z_2 = -1.8794 - \\frac{(-1.8794)^3 + (-1.8794)^2 - 1}{3(-1.8794)^2 + 2(-1.8794)} \\approx -1.7693$\n3. Continuing the iterations, we find that the sequence converges to $z \\approx -1.7693$.\n\nFor $z_0 = 0$:\n\n1. $z_1 = 0 - \\frac{0^3 + 0^2 - 1}{3(0)^2 + 2(0)} = 0 - \\frac{-1}{0}$, which is undefined.\n\nSince the Newton-Raphson method fails for $z_0 = 0$, we can try another initial guess close to $0$, such as $z_0 = 0.1$:\n\n1. $z_1 = 0.1 - \\frac{(0.1)^3 + (0.1)^2 - 1}{3(0.1)^2 + 2(0.1)} \\approx 0.5882$\n2. $z_2 = 0.5882 - \\frac{(0.5882)^3 + (0.5882)^2 - 1}{3(0.5882)^2 + 2(0.5882)} \\approx 0.4450$\n3. Continuing the iterations, we find that the sequence converges to $z \\approx 0.4450$.\n\nFor $z_0 = 1.5$:\n\n1. $z_1 = 1.5 - \\frac{(1.5)^3 + (1.5)^2 - 1}{3(1.5)^2 + 2(1.5)} \\approx 1.3244$\n2. $z_2 = 1.3244 - \\frac{(1.3244)^3 + (1.3244)^2 - 1}{3(1.3244)^2 + 2(1.3244)} \\approx 1.3243$\n3. Continuing the iterations, we find that the sequence converges to $z \\approx 1.3243$.\n\nThus, the zeros of the function $f(z) = z^3 + z^2 - 1$ in the region $|z| < 2$ are approximately $z \\approx -1.7693$, $z \\approx 0.4450$, and $z \\approx 1.3243$."
