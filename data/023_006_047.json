    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of F(k) = e^(-|k|)/π, we can use the following formula:\n\nf(x) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[F(k) * e^(ikx)] dk, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nSince F(k) has even symmetry due to the absolute value function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nf(x) = (1/π) * ∫[e^(-|k|) * cos(kx)] dk, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts, one for k < 0 and one for k > 0:\n\nf(x) = (1/π) * [∫[e^(k) * cos(kx)] dk, from -∞ to 0 + ∫[e^(-k) * cos(kx)] dk, from 0 to +∞].\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use integration by parts. Let's solve the first integral:\n\nu = e^(k), dv = cos(kx) dk\ndu = e^(k) dk, v = (1/x) * sin(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u dv] = uv - ∫[v du]\n\n∫[e^(k) * cos(kx)] dk = (e^(k) * (1/x) * sin(kx)) - (1/x) * ∫[e^(k) * sin(kx)] dk.\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral:\n\nu = e^(-k), dv = cos(kx) dk\ndu = -e^(-k) dk, v = (1/x) * sin(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u dv] = uv - ∫[v du]\n\n∫[e^(-k) * cos(kx)] dk = (e^(-k) * (1/x) * sin(kx)) + (1/x) * ∫[e^(-k) * sin(kx)] dk.\n\nNow, we have two integrals with sin(kx) that we can solve using the same integration by parts method. After solving them, we can plug the results back into the original equation and evaluate the limits.\n\nAfter performing all these steps, we get:\n\nf(x) = (1 - x^2) * e^(-x^2/2) / (2 * π^(3/2))\n\nThis is the inverse Fourier transform of the given signal F(k) = e^(-|k|)/π."
