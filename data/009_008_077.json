Assuming the string has a mass of 2 g and is fixed at both ends, write the wave equation modeling its motion. If the string is plucked to create a sinusoidal wave with an amplitude of 5 mm, frequency of 440 Hz, and initial displacement of 0, find the expression for the wave and determine the speed of the wave on the string.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the linear mass density (µ) of the string. Linear mass density is the mass per unit length of the string. Given the mass of the string is 2 g and the length is 80 cm, we can find µ as follows:\n\nµ = mass / length\nµ = (2 g) / (80 cm)\nµ = 0.025 g/cm\n\nNow, we need to convert the linear mass density to kg/m for SI units:\n\nµ = 0.025 g/cm * (1 kg / 1000 g) * (100 cm / 1 m)\nµ = 0.00025 kg/m\n\nNext, we can find the speed (v) of the wave on the string using the formula:\n\nv = sqrt(T / µ)\n\nwhere T is the tension in the string (100 N) and µ is the linear mass density (0.00025 kg/m).\n\nv = sqrt(100 N / 0.00025 kg/m)\nv = sqrt(400000 m²/s²)\nv = 200 m/s\n\nNow that we have the speed of the wave, we can find the wavelength (λ) using the formula:\n\nv = f * λ\n\nwhere f is the frequency (440 Hz). Solving for λ:\n\nλ = v / f\nλ = (200 m/s) / (440 Hz)\nλ = 0.4545 m\n\nNow we can write the wave equation for the string's motion. Since the initial displacement is 0, the equation will be in the form:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude (5 mm = 0.005 m), k is the wave number (k = 2π / λ), x is the position along the string, ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf), and t is the time.\n\nk = 2π / λ = 2π / 0.4545 m ≈ 13.82 m⁻¹\nω = 2πf = 2π * 440 Hz ≈ 2764.6 s⁻¹\n\nSo the wave equation is:\n\ny(x, t) = 0.005 * sin(13.82x - 2764.6t)\n\nIn summary, the expression for the wave is y(x, t) = 0.005 * sin(13.82x - 2764.6t), and the speed of the wave on the string is 200 m/s."
