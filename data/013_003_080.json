    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A is assigned $50 and is allowed to offer a share of the money to Player B. If Player B accepts the offer, both players keep their respective shares of the money. However, if Player B rejects the offer, both players get nothing. \n\nWhat is the minimum amount that Player A should offer to Player B in order to maximize their likelihood of acceptance? Assume that Player B is a rational player who will only accept offers that are greater than $10.",
    "message_2": "Since Player B is a rational player and will only accept offers greater than $10, Player A should offer Player B just above $10 to maximize their likelihood of acceptance. This way, Player A can keep as much of the $50 as possible while still ensuring that Player B accepts the offer. So, Player A should offer something like $10.01 to Player B."
