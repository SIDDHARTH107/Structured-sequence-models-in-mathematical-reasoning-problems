    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve based on the logistic map and its bifurcation diagram:\n\nThe logistic map is given by the equation xn+1 = r*xn(1 - xn), where xn represents the population at a given time and r is a constant. Assume that xn = 0.5, and that r takes the values 2.7, 3.2, and 3.5. Plot the bifurcation diagram for the logistic map using these values of r. What is the number of stable points for r = 2.7, 3.2, and 3.5?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of stable points for r = 2.7, 3.2, and 3.5, we will iterate the logistic map equation for each value of r and observe the behavior of the population (xn) over time. We will start with an initial population of xn = 0.5.\n\nFor r = 2.7:\n1. xn+1 = 2.7 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.675\n2. xn+1 = 2.7 * 0.675 * (1 - 0.675) ≈ 0.591\n3. xn+1 = 2.7 * 0.591 * (1 - 0.591) ≈ 0.654\n4. xn+1 = 2.7 * 0.654 * (1 - 0.654) ≈ 0.613\n\nAfter several iterations, the population converges to a single stable point, approximately 0.63.\n\nFor r = 3.2:\n1. xn+1 = 3.2 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.8\n2. xn+1 = 3.2 * 0.8 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.512\n3. xn+1 = 3.2 * 0.512 * (1 - 0.512) ≈ 0.799\n4. xn+1 = 3.2 * 0.799 * (1 - 0.799) ≈ 0.514\n\nAfter several iterations, the population oscillates between two stable points, approximately 0.513 and 0.799.\n\nFor r = 3.5:\n1. xn+1 = 3.5 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.875\n2. xn+1 = 3.5 * 0.875 * (1 - 0.875) ≈ 0.382\n3. xn+1 = 3.5 * 0.382 * (1 - 0.382) ≈ 0.826\n4. xn+1 = 3.5 * 0.826 * (1 - 0.826) ≈ 0.500\n\nAfter several iterations, the population oscillates between four stable points, approximately 0.382, 0.500, 0.826, and 0.875.\n\nIn summary, the number of stable points for each value of r is:\n- r = 2.7: 1 stable point\n- r = 3.2: 2 stable points\n- r = 3.5: 4 stable points"
