    "message_2": "To compute the order of the Jacobian J(C) of the elliptic curve C: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 5, we first need to find the number of points on the curve over a finite field. We will use the Hasse-Weil theorem, which states that the number of points N on an elliptic curve over a finite field F_p (where p is a prime number) is approximately equal to p + 1 - a_p, where |a_p| <= 2*sqrt(p).\n\nWe can use the Schoof-Elkies-Atkin (SEA) algorithm to compute the number of points on the curve over a finite field. However, this algorithm is quite complex and requires significant computational resources. Therefore, it is not feasible to provide a step-by-step solution here.\n\nInstead, we can use a software package like SageMath or Magma to compute the order of J(C) directly. For example, using SageMath, you can input the following code:\n\n```\nE = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0, 2, 0, 0, 5])\nN = E.cardinality()\n```\n\nReplace `p` with the desired prime number for the finite field F_p. The output `N` will give you the number of points on the curve, which is equal to the order of the Jacobian J(C).\n\nKeep in mind that the order of J(C) depends on the choice of the finite field F_p. To fully answer the question, you would need to specify the prime number p for the finite field."
