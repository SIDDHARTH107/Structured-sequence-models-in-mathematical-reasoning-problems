    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using Euler's method, we will first implement the equation in Python and then apply the numerical method. We will use the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries for calculations and plotting.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef mackey_glass(x, x_delayed, tau):\n    return (0.2 * x_delayed) / (1 + x_delayed**10) - 0.1 * x\n\ndef euler_method(tau, time_step=0.1, t_end=1000, x0=1):\n    t = np.arange(0, t_end + time_step, time_step)\n    x = np.zeros(len(t))\n    x[0] = x0\n\n    for i in range(1, len(t)):\n        if i < tau:\n            x_delayed = x0\n        else:\n            x_delayed = x[i - tau]\n        \n        x[i] = x[i - 1] + time_step * mackey_glass(x[i - 1], x_delayed, tau)\n\n    return t, x\n\ntau1 = 10\ntau2 = 17\nt1, x1 = euler_method(tau1)\nt2, x2 = euler_method(tau2)\n\nplt.plot(t1, x1, label=f\"tau = {tau1}\")\nplt.plot(t2, x2, label=f\"tau = {tau2}\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Time (t)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"x(t)\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.title(\"Mackey-Glass Equation Solutions\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nRunning this code will generate a plot of the solutions x(t) for tau = 10 and tau = 17 from t = 0 to t = 1000 using Euler's method with a time step of 0.1.\n\nFrom the plot, we can observe that the solution for tau = 10 exhibits a stable oscillatory behavior, while the solution for tau = 17 shows a more complex, chaotic behavior. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the Mackey-Glass equation to the parameter tau, which can lead to different dynamical behaviors depending on its value."
