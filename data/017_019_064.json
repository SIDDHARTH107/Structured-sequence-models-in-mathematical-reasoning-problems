    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36 with exactly one element of order 2. Since the order of G is 36, we can write it as 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, and the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have two possibilities: there is either 1 or 9 of them. If there is only 1, then it is normal in G. If there are 9, then by the Sylow Theorems, there are 9 * 4 = 36 elements of order 2 in G, which contradicts the assumption that G has exactly one element of order 2. Therefore, there must be a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup, say P.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, we have two possibilities: there is either 1 or 4 of them. If there is only 1, then it is normal in G. If there are 4, then by the Sylow Theorems, there are 4 * 9 = 36 elements of order 3 in G, which is impossible since G has order 36 and has an element of order 2. Therefore, there must be a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup, say Q.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, we have that G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Now, we consider the possibilities for P and Q:\n\n1. If P ≅ C4 and Q ≅ C9, then G ≅ C4 × C9, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C36.\n2. If P ≅ C4 and Q ≅ C3 × C3, then G ≅ C4 × (C3 × C3), which is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3.\n3. If P ≅ C2 × C2 and Q ≅ C9, then G ≅ (C2 × C2) × C9, which is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n4. If P ≅ C2 × C2 and Q ≅ C3 × C3, then G ≅ (C2 × C2) × (C3 × C3), which is another one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nIn all cases, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
