    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total Gaussian curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2.\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature K of the sphere is:\n\nK = 2π * 2\n\nK = 4π\n\nTherefore, the total Gaussian curvature of the surface of a sphere with radius 3 is 4π."
