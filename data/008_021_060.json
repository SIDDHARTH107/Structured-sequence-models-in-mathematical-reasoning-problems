    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column vector of variables, and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7  |\n    | 14 |\n\nNow, we can see that the second row of matrix A is just twice the first row. This means that the determinant of A is zero, and A is a singular matrix with no inverse. However, we can still attempt to solve the system using Gaussian elimination or row reduction.\n\nFirst, we'll divide the second row by 2 to simplify the system:\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 2  3 |\n\nB = | 7  |\n    | 7  |\n\nNext, we'll subtract the first row from the second row to eliminate the x term in the second equation:\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 0  0 |\n\nB = | 7  |\n    | 0  |\n\nNow, we have the simplified system of equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n0x + 0y = 0\n\nThe second equation is always true, so it doesn't provide any information about the values of x and y. We can solve the first equation for y in terms of x:\n\n3y = 7 - 2x\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince we don't have a unique solution for x and y, we can express the solution as a parametric equation:\n\nx = x\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nThis means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and they lie along the line y = (7 - 2x) / 3."
