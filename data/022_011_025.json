    "message_2": "To determine the order and type of the function f(z) = (z - 3)^4 / (z + 2)^3, we need to find its zeros and poles.\n\nZeros:\nA zero of a function is a point where the function equals zero. In this case, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator (z - 3)^4 equals zero.\n\n(z - 3)^4 = 0\nz - 3 = 0\nz = 3\n\nSo, the function has a zero at z = 3. The order of the zero is the exponent of the factor (z - 3) in the numerator, which is 4. Therefore, f(z) has a zero of order 4 at z = 3.\n\nPoles:\nA pole of a function is a point where the function goes to infinity. In this case, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator (z + 2)^3 equals zero.\n\n(z + 2)^3 = 0\nz + 2 = 0\nz = -2\n\nSo, the function has a pole at z = -2. The order of the pole is the exponent of the factor (z + 2) in the denominator, which is 3. Therefore, f(z) has a pole of order 3 at z = -2.\n\nIn summary:\n- f(z) has a zero of order 4 at z = 3.\n- f(z) has a pole of order 3 at z = -2."
