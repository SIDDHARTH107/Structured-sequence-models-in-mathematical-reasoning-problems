    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by iterating the Koch curve construction process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nLet's denote the initial side length of the triangle as L0 = 2 units. Since the initial triangle has 3 sides, the total initial length is 3 * L0.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each side is multiplied by 4/3. So, the total length after the first iteration is 3 * (4/3) * L0.\n\nAfter the second iteration, the length of each side is again multiplied by 4/3. So, the total length after the second iteration is 3 * (4/3)^2 * L0.\n\nSimilarly, after the third iteration, the total length is 3 * (4/3)^3 * L0.\n\nFinally, after the fourth iteration, the total length is 3 * (4/3)^4 * L0.\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of L0 and calculate the total length after four iterations:\n\nTotal length = 3 * (4/3)^4 * 2\nTotal length ≈ 3 * 3.16049 * 2\nTotal length ≈ 18.96294 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations is approximately 18.96294 units."
