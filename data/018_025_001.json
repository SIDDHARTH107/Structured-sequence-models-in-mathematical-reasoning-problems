To do this, we need to find the symmetric difference of set B and A, and then find the intersection of set B with this symmetric difference:\n\nB Δ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {2, 4, 7, 9}\nB ∩ (B Δ A) = {2, 4}\n\nSince A ∩ (A Δ B) ≠ B ∩ (B Δ A), the symmetric difference of sets A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection."
