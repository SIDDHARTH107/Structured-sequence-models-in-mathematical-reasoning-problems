The average weight of the sample is found to be 65 kg with a standard deviation of 5 kg. What is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (65 kg)\nZ = Z-score for the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence)\nσ = sample standard deviation (5 kg)\nn = sample size (50)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, we can find the 95% confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = 65 ± 1.3859\n\nLower limit: 65 - 1.3859 ≈ 63.6141 kg\nUpper limit: 65 + 1.3859 ≈ 66.3859 kg\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight is approximately (63.6141 kg, 66.3859 kg)."
