Therefore, the first term goes to 0:\n\nF(ω) = 0 - [(1/(a - jω)) * e^0]\n\nSince e^0 = 1, we get:\n\nF(ω) = -1/(a - jω)\n\nFinally, we can remove the negative sign by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by -1:\n\nF(ω) = 1/(jω - a)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given function f(t) = e^(a*t)*u(t) is F(ω) = 1/(jω - a)."
