    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is a number that can be represented as a square of an integer modulo a prime number. To find the quadratic residues of 17, we need to calculate the squares of integers from 1 to 8 (half of 17 rounded down) modulo 17.\n\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3² ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n4² ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n5² ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n6² ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n7² ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n8² ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues of 17 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16}."
