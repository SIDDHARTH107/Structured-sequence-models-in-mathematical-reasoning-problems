    "message_1": "Consider an auction in which three bidders are interested in buying a painting. Each bidder has a private valuation for the painting, and the valuations are given by $v_1 = 150, v_2 = 100,$ and $v_3 = 80$. The auctioneer is deciding between two different auction mechanisms: the first-price sealed bid auction and the second-price sealed bid auction. \n\nAssuming each bidder bids truthfully, what is the auctioneer's expected revenue under each mechanism? Which mechanism yields a higher expected revenue for the auctioneer?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed bid auction, each bidder submits a bid, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the amount they bid. Assuming each bidder bids truthfully, the bids will be equal to their valuations: $b_1 = 150, b_2 = 100,$ and $b_3 = 80$. In this case, bidder 1 will win the auction, and the auctioneer's revenue will be $150.\n\nIn a second-price sealed bid auction, each bidder submits a bid, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the amount of the second-highest bid. Assuming each bidder bids truthfully, the bids will again be equal to their valuations: $b_1 = 150, b_2 = 100,$ and $b_3 = 80$. In this case, bidder 1 will win the auction, but they will pay the amount of the second-highest bid, which is $100. So, the auctioneer's revenue will be $100.\n\nComparing the two mechanisms, the first-price sealed bid auction yields a higher expected revenue for the auctioneer ($150) than the second-price sealed bid auction ($100)."
