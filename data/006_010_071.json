    "message_2": "To find the number of individuals expected to have the disease, we can multiply the population by the percentage of people with the disease.\n\nPopulation = 500,000\nPercentage with disease = 5% = 0.05\n\nNumber of individuals with disease = Population × Percentage with disease\nNumber of individuals with disease = 500,000 × 0.05\nNumber of individuals with disease = 25,000\n\nSo, 25,000 individuals in the city are expected to have the disease."
