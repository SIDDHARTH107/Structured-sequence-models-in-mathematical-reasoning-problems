    "message_2": "To solve for the value of x, we will first group the terms with x and the terms without x on opposite sides of the equation.\n\n$(2 + 3i)x - (5 - 4i) = (3 - 2i)x + (4 + 7i)$\n\nNow, move the terms with x to the left side of the equation and the terms without x to the right side.\n\n$(2 + 3i)x - (3 - 2i)x = (4 + 7i) + (5 - 4i)$\n\nNow, combine the terms with x and the terms without x.\n\n$[(2 + 3i) - (3 - 2i)]x = (4 + 7i) + (5 - 4i)$\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets and the terms on the right side.\n\n$[(2 + 3i) - 3 + 2i]x = 4 + 7i + 5 - 4i$\n\n$(-1 + 5i)x = 9 + 3i$\n\nNow, to solve for x, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is $(-1 + 5i)$.\n\n$x = \\frac{9 + 3i}{-1 + 5i}$\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we will multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $(-1 - 5i)$.\n\n$x = \\frac{(9 + 3i)(-1 - 5i)}{(-1 + 5i)(-1 - 5i)}$\n\nNow, multiply the numerators and the denominators.\n\n$x = \\frac{(-9 - 3i - 45i - 15i^2)}{(1 + 5i - 5i - 25i^2)}$\n\nSince $i^2 = -1$, we can replace $i^2$ with $-1$.\n\n$x = \\frac{(-9 - 3i - 45i + 15)}{(1 - 25(-1))}$\n\nSimplify the numerator and the denominator.\n\n$x = \\frac{6 - 48i}{26}$\n\nNow, divide both the real and imaginary parts by the denominator.\n\n$x = \\frac{6}{26} - \\frac{48i}{26}$\n\nSimplify the fractions.\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{13} - \\frac{24i}{13}$\n\nSo, the value of x is:\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{13} - \\frac{24i}{13}$"
