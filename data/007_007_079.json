For example, let's try x = 1:\n\n2(1) + 3y = 7\n2 + 3y = 7\n3y = 5\ny = 5/3\n\nSince y is not an integer, this is not a solution. Let's try x = 2:\n\n2(2) + 3y = 7\n4 + 3y = 7\n3y = 3\ny = 1\n\nNow we have a particular solution: (x, y) = (2, 1).\n\nNow let's find the general form of the solutions. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3y = 7 - 2x\n\nSince 3 and 2 are relatively prime, we can use the following general form for the solutions:\n\nx = x0 + 3t\ny = y0 - 2t\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is the particular solution we found, and t is an integer.\n\nSubstituting the particular solution (2, 1) into the general form, we get:\n\nx = 2 + 3t\ny = 1 - 2t\n\nNow we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for t:\n\nt = 0: (x, y) = (2, 1)\nt = 1: (x, y) = (5, -1)\nt = -1: (x, y) = (-1, 3)\nt = 2: (x, y) = (8, -3)\nt = -2: (x, y) = (-4, 5)\n...\n\nSo the integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 2x + 3y = 7 are given by:\n\n(x, y) = (2 + 3t, 1 - 2t) for all integers t."
