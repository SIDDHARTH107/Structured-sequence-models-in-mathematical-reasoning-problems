    "message_1": "A substitution cipher replaces each letter of a message with a different letter of the alphabet. Suppose you intercept the following encrypted message:\n\n\"Qbqr yvxr nyy gur gehax, gur pnpur vf qevira\"\n\nYou suspect this message might have been encrypted using a simple substitution cipher, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions. What is the shift used to encrypt this message?",
    "message_2": "To determine the shift used in this simple substitution cipher, we can look for common words or patterns. In this case, the word \"gur\" appears twice, which could be the encrypted version of the common English word \"the\". If we assume this is the case, we can determine the shift by comparing the letters:\n\ng -> t (shift by 13 positions)\nu -> h (shift by 13 positions)\nr -> e (shift by 13 positions)\n\nAll three letters have been shifted by 13 positions. Therefore, the shift used to encrypt this message is 13 positions."
