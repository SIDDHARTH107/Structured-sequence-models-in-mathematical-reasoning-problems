    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of winning a game of chance is 0.35. A contestant is offered 3 chances to play the game. Use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability that the contestant will win at least one game. Perform 10,000 simulations and report your estimate to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To perform a Monte Carlo simulation, we will generate random numbers to simulate playing the game 10,000 times and count the number of times the contestant wins at least one game. Then, we will divide that count by the total number of simulations (10,000) to estimate the probability.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nnum_simulations = 10000\nnum_wins = 0\n\nfor _ in range(num_simulations):\n    games_played = [random.random() < 0.35 for _ in range(3)]\n    if any(games_played):\n        num_wins += 1\n\nestimated_probability = num_wins / num_simulations\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, we can report the estimated probability to two decimal places:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Estimated probability: {estimated_probability:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThe estimated probability will vary slightly each time the simulation is run, but it should be close to the true probability of winning at least one game, which can be calculated as 1 - P(losing all games) = 1 - (1 - 0.35)^3 â‰ˆ 0.725.\n\nSo, the estimated probability of winning at least one game is approximately 0.73 (or close to that value, depending on the simulation results)."
