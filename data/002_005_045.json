    "message_1": "What is the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism with dimensions of 8 cm by 10 cm by 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, you can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nIn this case, l = 8 cm, w = 10 cm, and h = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 10² + 12²) = √(64 + 100 + 144) = √308 ≈ 17.54 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 17.54 cm."
