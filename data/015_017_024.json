    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx(n+1) = 1 + a * x(n) * cos(t(n)) - y(n) * sin(t(n))\ny(n+1) = a * x(n) * sin(t(n)) + y(n) * cos(t(n))\n\nwhere t(n) = b - 1/x(n)^2.\n\nTo find the period-3 window, we need to find the values of x and y that make the system have a period of 3. This means that after three iterations, the system returns to its initial state:\n\nx(3) = x(0)\ny(3) = y(0)\n\nTo find the period-3 window, we will iterate the Ikeda map three times and set the resulting expressions equal to the initial conditions x(0) and y(0).\n\nLet's denote x(0) = x0 and y(0) = y0.\n\nFirst iteration:\nx(1) = 1 + a * x0 * cos(t0) - y0 * sin(t0)\ny(1) = a * x0 * sin(t0) + y0 * cos(t0)\nwhere t0 = b - 1/x0^2\n\nSecond iteration:\nx(2) = 1 + a * x(1) * cos(t1) - y(1) * sin(t1)\ny(2) = a * x(1) * sin(t1) + y(1) * cos(t1)\nwhere t1 = b - 1/x(1)^2\n\nThird iteration:\nx(3) = 1 + a * x(2) * cos(t2) - y(2) * sin(t2)\ny(3) = a * x(2) * sin(t2) + y(2) * cos(t2)\nwhere t2 = b - 1/x(2)^2\n\nNow we set x(3) = x0 and y(3) = y0:\n\nx0 = 1 + a * x(2) * cos(t2) - y(2) * sin(t2)\ny0 = a * x(2) * sin(t2) + y(2) * cos(t2)\n\nThese are two nonlinear equations with two unknowns (x0 and y0). Solving these equations analytically is difficult, so we typically use numerical methods to find the period-3 window.\n\nFor the given parameter values a = 0.9 and b = 6.0, you can use a numerical solver (e.g., Newton-Raphson method) to find the period-3 window of the Ikeda map."
