    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set {} qualifies as a subset of set A.\n\nTo prove that the empty set is a subset of every set, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A. Since the empty set has no elements, this statement is vacuously true. In other words, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, so the empty set is a subset of set A.\n\nFormally, a set B is a subset of set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if and only if every element of B is also an element of A. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nB ⊆ A if and only if ∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A)\n\nFor the empty set (denoted as ∅), there are no elements x such that x ∈ ∅. Therefore, the implication (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A) is true for all x, and thus ∅ ⊆ A. This holds for any set A, including the one given in the problem (A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5})."
