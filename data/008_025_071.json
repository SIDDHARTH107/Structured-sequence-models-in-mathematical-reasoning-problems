    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of equations by dividing each equation by their greatest common divisor:\n\n```\n2x - 3y + 4z = 12  (divide by 2)\nx - 1.5y + 2z = 6  (Equation 1)\n\n4x - 6y + 8z = 24  (divide by 4)\nx - 1.5y + 2z = 6  (Equation 2)\n\n6x - 9y + 12z = 36  (divide by 6)\nx - 1.5y + 2z = 6  (Equation 3)\n```\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same (Equation 1 = Equation 2 = Equation 3). This means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as they all lie on the same plane in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the other two. For example, we can express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = 1.5y - 2z + 6\n\nThis is the general solution for the system of linear equations, and any values of y and z that satisfy this equation will give a valid solution for x."
