    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the concept of Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer such that any group of R(m, n) people will have either m people who all know each other or n people who are all strangers to each other.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the smallest number of students required to guarantee that at least 3 of them know each other (m = 3) or at least 3 of them are strangers (n = 3). Therefore, we need to find the Ramsey number R(3, 3).\n\nBy definition, R(3, 3) is the smallest integer such that any group of R(3, 3) people will have either 3 people who all know each other or 3 people who are all strangers to each other.\n\nTo find R(3, 3), we can use the following recursive formula for Ramsey numbers:\n\nR(m, n) = R(m - 1, n) + R(m, n - 1) - 1\n\nWe know that R(1, n) = R(m, 1) = 1 for any m and n, so we can use this to find R(3, 3):\n\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) - 1\nR(2, 3) = R(1, 3) + R(2, 2) - 1 = 1 + R(2, 2) - 1\nR(3, 2) = R(2, 2) + R(3, 1) - 1 = R(2, 2) + 1 - 1\n\nNow we need to find R(2, 2):\n\nR(2, 2) = R(1, 2) + R(2, 1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n\nSo, R(2, 3) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1, and R(3, 2) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.\n\nFinally, R(3, 3) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.\n\nHowever, this result is not correct, as it contradicts the definition of Ramsey numbers. The correct value for R(3, 3) is 6. This can be shown by considering a group of 5 people, where it is possible to arrange their relationships such that there are no groups of 3 people who all know each other or are all strangers. However, when a 6th person is added, it is guaranteed that there will be a group of 3 people who either all know each other or are all strangers.\n\nThus, the smallest number of students required in a math club to guarantee that at least 3 of them know each other or at least 3 of them are strangers is 6."
