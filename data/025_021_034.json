    "message_2": "To compute the number of quasimaps in the linear system |3H|, we can use the Gromov-Witten invariants. The Gromov-Witten invariants count the number of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface (in this case, P1) to a Calabi-Yau manifold (in this case, the quintic threefold Y) that satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFor a quasimap of degree d=3 from P1 to the quintic threefold Y, we can use the following formula for the Gromov-Witten invariants:\n\nN_d = (5d-1)! / (d! (4d)!)\n\nHere, N_d is the Gromov-Witten invariant for degree d, and d is the degree of the quasimap. In our case, d = 3.\n\nNow, we can compute N_d:\n\nN_d = (5*3 - 1)! / (3! (4*3)!)\nN_d = (14)! / (3! (12)!)\nN_d = (14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (3 * 2 * 1 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\nN_d = (14 * 13) / (3 * 2)\nN_d = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 quasimaps in the linear system |3H| for a quasimap of degree d=3 from P1 to the quintic threefold Y."
