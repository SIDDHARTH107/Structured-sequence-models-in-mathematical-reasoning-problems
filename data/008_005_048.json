    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system in matrix form:\n\n```\n| 3  5  2 | | x |   | 16 |\n| 2 -1  3 | | y | = |  2 |\n| 1  2  1 | | z |   |  7 |\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Swap the first and third rows:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | | x |   |  7 |\n| 2 -1  3 | | y | = |  2 |\n| 3  5  2 | | z |   | 16 |\n```\n\n2. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | | x |   |  7 |\n| 0 -5  1 | | y | = |-12 |\n| 0 -1 -1 | | z |   | -5 |\n```\n\n3. Multiply the second row by -1/5:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | | x |   |  7 |\n| 0  1 -1/5 | | y | = | 12/5 |\n| 0 -1 -1 | | z |   | -5 |\n```\n\n4. Add the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2   1  | | x |   |  7   |\n| 0  1 -1/5 | | y | = | 12/5 |\n| 0  0 -9/5 | | z |   |  7/5 |\n```\n\n5. Multiply the third row by -5/9:\n\n```\n| 1  2   1  | | x |   |  7   |\n| 0  1 -1/5 | | y | = | 12/5 |\n| 0  0   1  | | z |   | -7/9 |\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\n1. z = -7/9\n2. y = 12/5 + 1/5 * (-7/9) = (12*9 - 7)/45 = 101/45\n3. x = 7 - 2 * (101/45) - (-7/9) = (7*45 - 2*101 + 35)/45 = 4\n\nSo the solution is x = 4, y = 101/45, and z = -7/9."
