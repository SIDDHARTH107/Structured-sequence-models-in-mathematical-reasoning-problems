    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given $10 and must decide how much to send to Player B. Whatever amount is sent is tripled, so if Player A sends $2, Player B receives $6. Player B must then decide how much of that money to send back to Player A. What is the optimal amount for Player A to send in order to maximize their potential earnings? Assume rational self-interest of both players.",
    "message_2": "In the Trust Game, assuming rational self-interest of both players, Player A should consider that Player B will act to maximize their own earnings. Therefore, Player B will likely not send any money back to Player A, as keeping the entire amount would maximize their own earnings.\n\nKnowing this, Player A should send $0 to Player B in order to maximize their potential earnings, as sending any amount would likely result in a loss, given Player B's rational self-interest."
