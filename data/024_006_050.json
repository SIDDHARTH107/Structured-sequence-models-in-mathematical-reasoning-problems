    "message_2": "To calculate the Christoffel symbols of the given metric, we first need to find the inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$. The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is a symmetric matrix, so we can find its inverse by computing the inverse of the matrix:\n\n$g^{ij} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 4 & -6 \\\\ 3 & -6 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1}$\n\nHowever, the given metric tensor is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero), so it does not have an inverse. This means that the given metric tensor does not define a proper Riemannian manifold, and we cannot calculate the Christoffel symbols for it.\n\nIn general, if the metric tensor is non-singular, the Christoffel symbols can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n${{\\Gamma^i}_{jk}} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{il} \\left(\\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial x^k} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lk}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{jk}}{\\partial x^l}\\right)$\n\nBut in this case, since the metric tensor is singular, we cannot proceed with the calculation."
