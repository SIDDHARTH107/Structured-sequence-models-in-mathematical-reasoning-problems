    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 48 that G can be isomorphic to, we will use the Sylow theorems and the structure of groups of order 48.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 48: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will apply the Sylow theorems to find the possible number of Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2:\n1. By Sylow's first theorem, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2^4 = 16.\n2. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow 2-subgroup. So, n_2 must divide 48/16 = 3. The only divisors of 3 are 1 and 3. However, by Sylow's second theorem, n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 = 1 or 3.\n\nFor the prime factor 3:\n1. By Sylow's first theorem, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3^1 = 3.\n2. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow 3-subgroup. So, n_3 must divide 48/3 = 16. The divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. However, by Sylow's second theorem, n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups: G ≅ Z_16 × Z_3 ≅ Z_48.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is an extension of Z_3 by a group of order 16. There are two possibilities for the group of order 16: Z_16 and Z_8 × Z_2. Thus, we have two non-isomorphic groups in this case: the semidirect products Z_3 ⋊ Z_16 and Z_3 ⋊ (Z_8 × Z_2).\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. In this case, G is an extension of Z_16 by a group of order 3. There is only one group of order 3, which is Z_3. Thus, we have one non-isomorphic group in this case: the semidirect product Z_16 ⋊ Z_3.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has no unique Sylow subgroups. In this case, G is an extension of a group of order 16 by a group of order 3. As in case 2, there are two possibilities for the group of order 16: Z_16 and Z_8 × Z_2. Thus, we have two non-isomorphic groups in this case: the semidirect products (Z_8 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3 and Z_16 ⋊ Z_3.\n\nIn total, we have found 6 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 48 that G can be isomorphic to:\n\n1. Z_48\n2. Z_3 ⋊ Z_16\n3. Z_3 ⋊ (Z_8 × Z_2)\n4. Z_16 ⋊ Z_3\n5. (Z_8 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3\n6. Z_16 ⋊ Z_3 (different action from case 4)"
