Calculate the fundamental group, i.e., $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$, for any basepoint $x_0$ in $X$.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental group of the space $X$, we will first visualize the space and then determine the loops and their homotopies.\n\nVisualizing the space $X$:\nImagine two hemispheres, with their equators lying on the same plane. Now, identify their equators in a single point. This space can be thought of as two cones joined at their vertices.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loops in this space and their homotopies.\n\n1. Loops that lie entirely within one of the hemispheres:\nThese loops can be continuously deformed (homotoped) to a point within the hemisphere, without leaving the hemisphere. Therefore, these loops are homotopic to the constant loop at the basepoint $x_0$.\n\n2. Loops that pass through the identified point (the vertex of the cones):\nThese loops can also be continuously deformed to a point. Imagine pushing the loop through the identified point and into the other hemisphere, and then shrinking it to a point within that hemisphere. This shows that these loops are also homotopic to the constant loop at the basepoint $x_0$.\n\nSince all loops in the space $X$ are homotopic to the constant loop at the basepoint $x_0$, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element. In other words, $\\pi_1(X, x_0) = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element."
