Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n   Unvisited: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞}\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited: {2, 3, 4}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 4}\n\n3. Mark node 1 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 4).\n\n   Unvisited: {2, 3}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 4}\n\n4. Update the distances of node 4's neighbors (nodes 2 and 3). However, the new distances (7 for node 2 and 10 for node 3) are greater than the current distances, so no updates are made.\n\n   Unvisited: {2, 3}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 4}\n\n5. Mark node 4 as visited and select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 3).\n\n   Unvisited: {2}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 4}\n\n6. Update the distances of node 3's neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 4). The new distance for node 2 (6) is greater than the current distance, so no updates are made.\n\n   Unvisited: {2}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 4}\n\n7. Mark node 3 as visited. The only remaining unvisited node is node 2.\n\n   Unvisited: {}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 4}\n\n8. All nodes have been visited, and the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 has been found.\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is 1 → 3 → 4 with a total distance of 4."
