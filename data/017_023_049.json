    "message_2": "To find all possible subgroups of a group of order 72, we first need to find all the divisors of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2, so the divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nNow, we will list all the possible subgroups of order 72 based on these divisors:\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element.\n2. Order 2: Subgroups of the form Z_2, where Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2.\n3. Order 3: Subgroups of the form Z_3, where Z_3 is the cyclic group of order 3.\n4. Order 4: Subgroups of the form Z_4 or Z_2 x Z_2, where Z_4 is the cyclic group of order 4 and Z_2 x Z_2 is the Klein four-group.\n5. Order 6: Subgroups of the form Z_6 or Z_3 x Z_2, where Z_6 is the cyclic group of order 6.\n6. Order 8: Subgroups of the form Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n7. Order 9: Subgroups of the form Z_9 or Z_3 x Z_3.\n8. Order 12: Subgroups of the form Z_12, Z_6 x Z_2, Z_4 x Z_3, or Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n9. Order 18: Subgroups of the form Z_18, Z_9 x Z_2, or Z_6 x Z_3.\n10. Order 24: Subgroups of the form Z_24, Z_12 x Z_2, Z_8 x Z_3, Z_6 x Z_4, or Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3.\n11. Order 36: Subgroups of the form Z_36, Z_18 x Z_2, Z_12 x Z_3, Z_9 x Z_4, or Z_6 x Z_6.\n12. Order 72: The entire group G.\n\nTo determine which of these subgroups are normal, we need to consider the index of the subgroup in the group. A subgroup H of G is normal if and only if the index [G:H] is the smallest prime dividing the order of G. In this case, the smallest prime dividing 72 is 2, so we are looking for subgroups of index 2, which means the subgroups of order 36.\n\nThus, the normal subgroups are:\n\n1. Order 36: Subgroups of the form Z_36, Z_18 x Z_2, Z_12 x Z_3, Z_9 x Z_4, or Z_6 x Z_6.\n\nNow, we need to identify which of the three possible isomorphisms the given group must have. The three possible isomorphisms are:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to Z_72, the cyclic group of order 72.\n2. G is isomorphic to Z_36 x Z_2, the direct product of a cyclic group of order 36 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. G is isomorphic to Z_18 x Z_4, the direct product of a cyclic group of order 18 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nTo determine which isomorphism G must have, we need to consider the number of normal subgroups of each type. If G is isomorphic to Z_72, then it has a unique normal subgroup of each order dividing 72. If G is isomorphic to Z_36 x Z_2, then it has more than one normal subgroup of order 36. If G is isomorphic to Z_18 x Z_4, then it has more than one normal subgroup of order 18 and order 4.\n\nSince we found multiple normal subgroups of order 36, G cannot be isomorphic to Z_72. However, we cannot determine whether G is isomorphic to Z_36 x Z_2 or Z_18 x Z_4 based on the information given. We would need more information about the structure of G to make this determination."
