    "message_1": "Suppose you are a buyer of a product and you can choose between two suppliers. Supplier A charges a fixed cost of $500 and an additional variable cost of $10 per unit. Supplier B charges no fixed cost but has a variable cost of $15 per unit. How many units would you need to order to make Supplier A cheaper than Supplier B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units ordered. The total cost for Supplier A is given by the equation:\n\nCost_A = 500 + 10x\n\nThe total cost for Supplier B is given by the equation:\n\nCost_B = 15x\n\nWe want to find the number of units (x) where the cost of Supplier A is less than the cost of Supplier B:\n\nCost_A < Cost_B\n\n500 + 10x < 15x\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\n500 < 5x\n\nx > 100\n\nSo, you would need to order more than 100 units to make Supplier A cheaper than Supplier B."
