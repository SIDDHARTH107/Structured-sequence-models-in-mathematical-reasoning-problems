    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 6 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. Determine its volume in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the radius of the circular cross-section of the torus and major_radius is the distance from the center of the circular cross-section to the center of the torus.\n\nGiven that the major radius is 6 cm and the minor radius is 3 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2 * π * 6)\n\nVolume = (π * 9) * (12 * π)\n\nVolume = 108π^2\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 108π^2 cubic centimeters."
