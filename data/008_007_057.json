    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues λ1 = -2 and λ2 = 5. \n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for λ1 = -2:\n\n(A - λ1 * I) * v1 = 0\n(A - (-2) * I) * v1 = 0\n(A + 2 * I) * v1 = 0\n\nLet A = | a  b |\n        | c  d |\n\nThen, (A + 2 * I) = | a+2  b   |\n                           | c    d+2 |\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n(a+2) * x1 + b * x2 = 0\nc * x1 + (d+2) * x2 = 0\n\nWe can't solve this system directly without knowing the values of a, b, c, and d. However, we can express x2 in terms of x1:\n\nx2 = - (a+2) / b * x1\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for λ2 = 5:\n\n(A - λ2 * I) * v2 = 0\n(A - 5 * I) * v2 = 0\n\n(A - 5 * I) = | a-5  b   |\n                       | c    d-5 |\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n(a-5) * x1 + b * x2 = 0\nc * x1 + (d-5) * x2 = 0\n\nAgain, we can't solve this system directly without knowing the values of a, b, c, and d. However, we can express x2 in terms of x1:\n\nx2 = (5-a) / b * x1\n\nNow we have the eigenvectors v1 and v2 in terms of x1:\n\nv1 = |  x1  | , v2 = |  x1  |\n        | - (a+2) / b * x1 |        | (5-a) / b * x1 |\n\nSince we don't know the values of a, b, c, and d, we cannot find the exact eigenvectors. However, we have expressed them in terms of x1.\n\nNow, let's diagonalize A:\n\nTo diagonalize A, we need to find the matrix P formed by the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nP = | x1  x1  |\n      | - (a+2) / b * x1  (5-a) / b * x1 |\n\nD = | -2  0  |\n      |  0   5  |\n\nNow, we have diagonalized A as A = P * D * P^(-1). However, without knowing the values of a, b, c, and d, we cannot find the exact form of the matrix P and its inverse P^(-1)."
