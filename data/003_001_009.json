    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the values of a and b:\n\nc² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nc² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\nc² = 169 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √(169 cm²)\nc = 13 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 13 cm."
