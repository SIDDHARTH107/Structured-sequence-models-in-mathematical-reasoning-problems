The maximum capacity of each route is shown in the following table:\n\n| Route | Capacity |\n|-------|----------|\n|   1   |    50    |\n|   2   |    30    |\n|   3   |    80    |\n|   4   |    20    |\n|   5   |    60    |\n\nWhat is the minimum number of routes the company must use to transport all 200 units from warehouse A to B without exceeding the maximum capacity of any route?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of routes used, the company should prioritize using the routes with the highest capacity first. \n\n1. Start with Route 3, which has a capacity of 80 units. After using this route, 120 units remain to be transported (200 - 80 = 120).\n2. Next, use Route 5, which has a capacity of 60 units. After using this route, 60 units remain to be transported (120 - 60 = 60).\n3. Finally, use Route 1, which has a capacity of 50 units. After using this route, 10 units remain to be transported (60 - 50 = 10).\n\nAt this point, all routes with a capacity greater than or equal to the remaining 10 units have been used. The company must now use one of the remaining routes:\n\n4. Use Route 2, which has a capacity of 30 units. This route can transport the remaining 10 units without exceeding its maximum capacity.\n\nThe company must use a minimum of 4 routes to transport all 200 units without exceeding the maximum capacity of any route."
