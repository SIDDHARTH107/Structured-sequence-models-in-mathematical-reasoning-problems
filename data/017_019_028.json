    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. Here are examples of each type:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_36\nThis group is generated by a single element of order 36. It has the structure of the additive group of integers modulo 36. For example, the group can be represented as {0, 1, 2, ..., 35} with addition modulo 36 as the group operation.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 × C_4\nThis group is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It can be represented as {(a, b) | a ∈ C_9, b ∈ C_4}, with the group operation being component-wise addition modulo 9 and modulo 4, respectively.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_3 × C_12\nThis group is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It can be represented as {(a, b) | a ∈ C_3, b ∈ C_12}, with the group operation being component-wise addition modulo 3 and modulo 12, respectively.\n\n4. Semidirect product of C_9 and C_4: C_9 ⋊ C_4\nThis group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 (C_9) and a cyclic group of order 4 (C_4). It can be represented as a set of ordered pairs {(a, b) | a ∈ C_9, b ∈ C_4}, with the group operation defined as (a, b) * (c, d) = (a + b^2 * c, b + d) modulo 9 for the first component and modulo 4 for the second component. This group is non-abelian.\n\nThese are the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
