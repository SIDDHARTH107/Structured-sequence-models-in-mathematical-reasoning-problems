The student collects data from 10 students and obtains the following results:\n\n| Number of hours studied | Grade received |\n| ----------------------- | -------------- |\n| 4                       | 73             |\n| 6                       | 81             |\n| 2                       | 60             |\n| 7                       | 89             |\n| 5                       | 75             |\n| 8                       | 92             |\n| 3                       | 64             |\n| 9                       | 96             |\n| 1                       | 50             |\n| 10                      | 100            |\n\nCalculate the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the grade received.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours studied and the grade received, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of x values (hours studied), and ȳ is the mean of y values (grades).\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of x values (hours studied) and y values (grades):\n\nx̄ = (4 + 6 + 2 + 7 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 10) / 10 = 55 / 10 = 5.5\nȳ = (73 + 81 + 60 + 89 + 75 + 92 + 64 + 96 + 50 + 100) / 10 = 780 / 10 = 78\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator:\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = (4-5.5)(73-78) + (6-5.5)(81-78) + (2-5.5)(60-78) + (7-5.5)(89-78) + (5-5.5)(75-78) + (8-5.5)(92-78) + (3-5.5)(64-78) + (9-5.5)(96-78) + (1-5.5)(50-78) + (10-5.5)(100-78)\n= (-1.5)(-5) + (0.5)(3) + (-3.5)(-18) + (1.5)(11) + (-0.5)(-3) + (2.5)(14) + (-2.5)(-14) + (3.5)(18) + (-4.5)(-28) + (4.5)(22)\n= 7.5 + 1.5 + 63 + 16.5 + 1.5 + 35 + 35 + 63 + 126 + 99\n= 448.5\n\nDenominator:\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = (-1.5)² + (0.5)² + (-3.5)² + (1.5)² + (-0.5)² + (2.5)² + (-2.5)² + (3.5)² + (-4.5)² + (4.5)²\n= 2.25 + 0.25 + 12.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 12.25 + 20.25 + 20.25\n= 82.5\n\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = (-5)² + (3)² + (-18)² + (11)² + (-3)² + (14)² + (-14)² + (18)² + (-28)² + (22)²\n= 25 + 9 + 324 + 121 + 9 + 196 + 196 + 324 + 784 + 484\n= 2472\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = 448.5 / √(82.5 * 2472) = 448.5 / √(203940) ≈ 448.5 / 451.6 ≈ 0.993\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the grade received is approximately 0.993, which indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables."
