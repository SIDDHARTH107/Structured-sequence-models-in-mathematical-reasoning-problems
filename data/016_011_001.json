    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal constructed using a square lattice with side length 3, we have:\n\n- N = 5 (since there are 5 smaller squares in the fractal: one in the center and four in the corners)\n- s = 3 (since the side length of the square lattice is 3)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when constructed using a square lattice with side length 3 is approximately 1.465."
