    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 450 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 10 grams, and the sample size (n) is 50.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / √50\nσ_sample_mean ≈ 1.414\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean weight of 445 grams:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (445 - 450) / 1.414\nz ≈ -3.536\n\nNow, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability that the sample mean weight is less than 445 grams. The probability corresponding to a z-score of -3.536 is approximately 0.0002.\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean weight is less than 445 grams is approximately 0.0002 or 0.02%."
