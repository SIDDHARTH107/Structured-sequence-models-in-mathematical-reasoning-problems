    "message_2": "First, let's find the exact values of the first and second derivatives of f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 9.\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 5\nf''(x) = 2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the exact values at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) + 5 = 9\nf''(2) = 2\n\nNext, let's use the forward difference formula with a step size of 0.1 to approximate f'(2) and f''(2).\n\nFor the first derivative approximation, we have:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2.1) - f(2)) / 0.1\n\nNow, let's find f(2.1) and f(2):\n\nf(2.1) = (2.1)^2 + 5(2.1) + 9 ≈ 20.41\nf(2) = (2)^2 + 5(2) + 9 = 21\n\nNow, we can approximate f'(2):\n\nf'(2) ≈ (20.41 - 21) / 0.1 ≈ -0.59 / 0.1 ≈ 8.9\n\nFor the second derivative approximation, we have:\n\nf''(2) ≈ (f'(2 + 0.1) - f'(2)) / 0.1\nf''(2) ≈ (f'(2.1) - f'(2)) / 0.1\n\nNow, let's find f'(2.1) and f'(2):\n\nf'(2.1) = 2(2.1) + 5 ≈ 9.2\nf'(2) = 2(2) + 5 = 9\n\nNow, we can approximate f''(2):\n\nf''(2) ≈ (9.2 - 9) / 0.1 ≈ 0.2 / 0.1 ≈ 2\n\nComparing the approximations to the exact values:\n\nExact f'(2) = 9, Approximated f'(2) = 8.9\nExact f''(2) = 2, Approximated f''(2) = 2\n\nThe forward difference formula with a step size of 0.1 provides a close approximation to the exact values of the first and second derivatives of f at x = 2."
