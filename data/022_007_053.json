    "message_2": "A polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. In this case, the given polynomial equation is of degree 3 (since the highest power of z is 3). Therefore, there are exactly 3 roots for the equation $z^3-2z+2=0$ in the complex plane."
