    "message_1": "A restaurant has 10 different desserts on its menu. If a customer wants to order at least one dessert but can order as many as they like, how many different dessert combinations can the customer choose from?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations with repetition. Since the customer can order as many desserts as they like, we can think of this as selecting items with replacement.\n\nFor each dessert, the customer has two choices: either they order it or they don't. So, there are 2 choices for each of the 10 desserts, which gives us a total of 2^10 = 1024 different ways to order the desserts.\n\nHowever, this includes the case where the customer doesn't order any dessert at all (all 10 desserts are not selected). Since the customer wants to order at least one dessert, we need to subtract this case from the total.\n\nSo, the number of different dessert combinations the customer can choose from is 1024 - 1 = 1023."
