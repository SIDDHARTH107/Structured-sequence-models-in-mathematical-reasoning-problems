    "message_2": "The given velocity function is already in the frequency domain, as it is a linear combination of sinusoidal functions. Therefore, we don't need to apply the Fourier transform. Instead, we can directly identify the amplitude and frequency of each component.\n\nThe function is given by:\n\n$v(x) = 3 \\cos(2\\pi x) - 2 \\sin(4\\pi x)$\n\nHere, we have two components:\n\n1. The first component is a cosine function with amplitude 3 and frequency 2π. In terms of the Fourier series, this corresponds to a coefficient $a_1 = 3$ and angular frequency $\\omega_1 = 2\\pi$.\n\n2. The second component is a sine function with amplitude 2 and frequency 4π. In terms of the Fourier series, this corresponds to a coefficient $b_2 = 2$ and angular frequency $\\omega_2 = 4\\pi$.\n\nSo, the amplitude and frequency of each component are:\n\n- First component: Amplitude = 3, Frequency = 2π\n- Second component: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = 4π"
