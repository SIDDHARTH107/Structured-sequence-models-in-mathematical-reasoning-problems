    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution inside the plate using the Fourier transform method, we need to solve the two-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∇²T(x,y) = 0\n\nwhere T(x,y) is the temperature distribution inside the plate, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator. The boundary conditions are given by:\n\nT(x,0) = T(x,4) = 20x(8-x)\nT(0,y) = T(8,y) = 40y(4-y)\n\nWe can solve the heat equation using the method of separation of variables. Let T(x,y) = X(x)Y(y), then the heat equation becomes:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by X(x)Y(y) to get:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side is a function of x and the right side is a function of y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - λ²Y(y) = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get the general solutions:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(λy) + D*sinh(λy)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nT(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = (A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx))*(C + 0) = 20x(8-x)\nT(x,4) = X(x)Y(4) = (A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx))*(C*cosh(4λ) + D*sinh(4λ)) = 20x(8-x)\n\nSince T(x,0) and T(x,4) are the same, we must have Y(0) = Y(4). This implies that D = 0, and we are left with:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(λy)\n\nNow, we apply the remaining boundary conditions:\n\nT(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = (A + 0)*(C*cosh(λy)) = 40y(4-y)\nT(8,y) = X(8)Y(y) = (A*cos(8λ) + B*sin(8λ))*(C*cosh(λy)) = 40y(4-y)\n\nSince T(0,y) and T(8,y) are the same, we must have X(0) = X(8). This implies that A = 0 and B*sin(8λ) = 1. Thus, the temperature distribution inside the plate is given by:\n\nT(x,y) = Σ [C_n * sin(nπx/8) * cosh(nπy/8)] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nwhere C_n are the Fourier coefficients that can be determined using the boundary conditions. To find C_n, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nC_n = (8/π) * ∫[20x(8-x) * sin(nπx/8)] dx from 0 to 8\n\nBy calculating the Fourier coefficients and summing the series, we can find the temperature distribution inside the plate. Note that this is an infinite series, so we may need to truncate it to a finite number of terms to get an approximate solution."
