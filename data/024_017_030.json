    "message_2": "To compute the parallel transport of the vector V along the curve C, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C. The tangent vector can be found by taking the derivative of the position vector with respect to the parameter t.\n\nThe position vector of the curve C is given by:\n\nR(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k = (3t^2 + 2t)i + (t^3 - t^2 + 1)j + (2t - 1)k\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of R(t) with respect to t:\n\ndR(t)/dt = (6t + 2)i + (3t^2 - 2t)j + 2k\n\nThis is the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of t corresponding to the points (2, 0, 1) and (9, 7, 16). We can do this by solving the equations:\n\n3t^2 + 2t = 2, t^3 - t^2 + 1 = 0, 2t - 1 = 1\n3t^2 + 2t = 9, t^3 - t^2 + 1 = 7, 2t - 1 = 16\n\nFor the first point (2, 0, 1), we have:\n\n3t^2 + 2t = 2 => t^2 + (2/3)t - (2/3) = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get t = 0 as the solution (the other solution is negative, which we discard).\n\nFor the second point (9, 7, 16), we have:\n\n3t^2 + 2t = 9 => t^2 + (2/3)t - 3 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get t = 1 as the solution (the other solution is negative, which we discard).\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vectors T(0) and T(1):\n\nT(0) = (6(0) + 2)i + (3(0)^2 - 2(0))j + 2k = 2i + 2k\nT(1) = (6(1) + 2)i + (3(1)^2 - 2(1))j + 2k = 8i + j + 2k\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector V = 2i + j - k along the curve C from T(0) to T(1). To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nV_parallel = V - (V 路 (T(1) - T(0))) / ||T(1) - T(0)||^2 * (T(1) - T(0))\n\nFirst, let's find T(1) - T(0):\n\nT(1) - T(0) = (8 - 2)i + (1 - 0)j + (2 - 2)k = 6i + j\n\nNow, let's find the dot product V 路 (T(1) - T(0)):\n\nV 路 (T(1) - T(0)) = (2i + j - k) 路 (6i + j) = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nNext, let's find the squared magnitude of T(1) - T(0):\n\n||(T(1) - T(0))||^2 = 6^2 + 1^2 = 36 + 1 = 37\n\nNow, we can find the parallel transport of V:\n\nV_parallel = V - (13/37) * (6i + j) = 2i + j - k - (13/37) * (6i + j)\n           = (2 - 13*6/37)i + (1 - 13/37)j - k\n           = (-4/37)i + (24/37)j - k\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector V along the curve C from the point (2, 0, 1) to the point (9, 7, 16) is:\n\nV_parallel = (-4/37)i + (24/37)j - k"
