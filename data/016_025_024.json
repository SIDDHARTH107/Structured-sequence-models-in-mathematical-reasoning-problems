    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve fractal is formed by recursively removing triangles from an equilateral triangle. The number of black holes (removed triangles) in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of black holes = 3^(iteration - 1)\n\nTo find the total number of black holes after five iterations, we need to sum the number of black holes in each iteration:\n\nIteration 1: 3^(1-1) = 3^0 = 1\nIteration 2: 3^(2-1) = 3^1 = 3\nIteration 3: 3^(3-1) = 3^2 = 9\nIteration 4: 3^(4-1) = 3^3 = 27\nIteration 5: 3^(5-1) = 3^4 = 81\n\nTotal black holes = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121"
