    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a traffic accident occurring on a busy highway with an average of 10 accidents per week, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k accidents in a given time period\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average number of accidents per time period (in this case, 10 accidents per week)\n- k is the number of accidents we want to find the probability for\n\nTo find the probability of a traffic accident occurring on this busy highway, we can calculate the probability of at least one accident occurring in a given time period. To do this, we can find the probability of no accidents occurring and subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of no accidents (k = 0) occurring in a week:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 10^0) / 0!\n          = (e^(-10) * 1) / 1\n          = e^(-10)\n\nNow, let's find the probability of at least one accident occurring in a week:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n          = 1 - e^(-10)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.0000454\n          ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability of a traffic accident occurring on this busy highway in a week is approximately 99.99546%. Keep in mind that this is a simplified model and real-world probabilities may be influenced by various factors not accounted for in this calculation."
