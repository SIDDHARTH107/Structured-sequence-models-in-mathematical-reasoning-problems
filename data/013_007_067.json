    "message_1": "Suppose a fishing community has access to a common lake with 100 fish. Each fisherman can catch up to 10 fish per year without depleting the lake. However, if the total number of fish caught exceeds 50, the lake will be overfished and the fish population will rapidly go extinct. If there are 10 fishermen in the community, each with the choice of either catching 5 or 10 fish per year, what is the optimal strategy for each fisherman to ensure the long-term survival of the lake and maximize their individual yield?",
    "message_2": "To ensure the long-term survival of the lake and maximize their individual yield, each fisherman should catch 5 fish per year. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. If all 10 fishermen catch 10 fish each, the total number of fish caught will be 100, which exceeds the limit of 50 and will lead to the extinction of the fish population.\n\n2. If all 10 fishermen catch 5 fish each, the total number of fish caught will be 50, which is the maximum limit allowed without depleting the lake.\n\nBy choosing to catch 5 fish each, the fishermen can ensure the long-term survival of the lake while maximizing their individual yield. This strategy allows the community to catch the maximum number of fish without overfishing and causing the fish population to go extinct."
