    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, 4 individuals each have an endowment of $10. They can choose to contribute a portion of their endowment towards a public good. The total contribution will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and then equally shared among all 4 individuals. What is the optimal amount each individual should contribute to the public good in order to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the contribution of each individual as x. Since there are 4 individuals, the total contribution towards the public good will be 4x. The total contribution will be multiplied by a factor of 1.5, so the new total will be 1.5 * 4x = 6x.\n\nThis amount will be equally shared among all 4 individuals, so each individual will receive 6x/4 = 1.5x from the public good.\n\nNow, let's calculate the payoff for each individual. The initial endowment is $10, and each individual contributes x. So, the remaining amount after contribution is 10 - x. Adding the amount received from the public good, the total payoff for each individual is (10 - x) + 1.5x.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\nPayoff = 10 - x + 1.5x\nPayoff = 10 + 0.5x\n\nTo maximize the payoff, we need to find the maximum value of the expression. Since the expression is linear and has a positive slope (0.5), the maximum value will be achieved when the individual contributes their entire endowment towards the public good.\n\nSo, the optimal amount each individual should contribute to the public good in order to maximize their own payoff is $10."
