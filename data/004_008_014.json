    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^3 - 2x + 1 at the point (2, 5), we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is y = x^3 - 2x + 1.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\ndy/dx = d(x^3 - 2x + 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and linearity of differentiation, we get:\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\ndy/dx(2) = 3(2)^2 - 2\ndy/dx(2) = 3(4) - 2\ndy/dx(2) = 12 - 2\ndy/dx(2) = 10\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^3 - 2x + 1 at the point (2, 5) is 10."
