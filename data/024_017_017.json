    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, which is given by the derivative of $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ with respect to $t$. \n\nThe derivative of $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is:\n\n$\\mathbf{r}'(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = (2, 6t, 12t^2)$\n\nAt $t=0$, the tangent vector is:\n\n$\\mathbf{r}'(0) = (2, 0, 0)$\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve. The parallel transport of a vector is given by the following equation:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}'(t)} \\mathbf{v} = 0$\n\nWhere $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}'(t)}$ is the covariant derivative along the tangent vector $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$. Since the curve is in Euclidean space, the covariant derivative is the same as the ordinary derivative:\n\n$\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = 0$\n\nThis means that the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ remains constant along the curve. Therefore, the parallel transport of $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is:\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{parallel}} = \\mathbf{v} = (1, 2, -3)$"
