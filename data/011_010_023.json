    "message_1": "Consider a square grid of 5 by 5 cells. How many paths are there for a particle starting at the bottom left corner and moving only up and right to reach the top right corner without crossing the diagonal line that runs from the bottom left corner to the top right corner of the grid? (Hint: The answer is a Catalan number.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)\n\nIn this case, we have a 5x5 grid, so we need to find the 4th Catalan number (since the grid is one less than the dimensions of the square grid).\n\nC_4 = (1/(4+1)) * (2*4 choose 4) = (1/5) * (8! / (4! * 4!))\n\nC_4 = (1/5) * (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC_4 = (1/5) * (1680) = 336\n\nSo, there are 336 paths for a particle starting at the bottom left corner and moving only up and right to reach the top right corner without crossing the diagonal line that runs from the bottom left corner to the top right corner of the 5x5 grid."
