    "message_1": "A train is traveling from Station A to Station B. The train starts at 2:00 PM and arrives at Station B at 5:00 PM. If the train stops at Station C for exactly 15 minutes, what time does it leave Station C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total travel time from Station A to Station B, which is 3 hours (5:00 PM - 2:00 PM). Since the train stops at Station C for 15 minutes, the actual travel time without the stop would be 2 hours and 45 minutes (3 hours - 15 minutes).\n\nNow, let's assume the train travels at a constant speed. Let x be the fraction of the total travel time spent traveling from Station A to Station C. Then, (1-x) would be the fraction of the total travel time spent traveling from Station C to Station B.\n\nSince the travel time from Station A to Station C plus the travel time from Station C to Station B equals the total travel time without the stop (2 hours and 45 minutes), we can write the equation:\n\nx * (2 hours and 45 minutes) + (1-x) * (2 hours and 45 minutes) = 2 hours and 45 minutes\n\nNow, we need more information to determine the exact time the train leaves Station C. If we know the distance between the stations or the train's speed, we can solve for x and find the time the train leaves Station C."
