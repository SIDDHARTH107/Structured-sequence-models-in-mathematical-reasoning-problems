    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain\n2. Define the basis functions\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n5. Apply boundary conditions\n6. Solve the linear system\n7. Compute the numerical solution\n\nStep 1: Discretize the domain\nWe divide the square region [0,1]x[0,1] into a uniform mesh with 10 subdivisions in both x and y directions. This results in a grid with 11 nodes in each direction and a total of 121 nodes. The spacing between the nodes is h = 1/10 = 0.1.\n\nStep 2: Define the basis functions\nWe use bilinear quadrilateral elements as the basis functions. For each element, the basis functions are given by:\n\nN1(x, y) = (1-x)(1-y)/4\nN2(x, y) = (1+x)(1-y)/4\nN3(x, y) = (1+x)(1+y)/4\nN4(x, y) = (1-x)(1+y)/4\n\nStep 3: Formulate the weak form of the PDE\nWe multiply the PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫(u_xx * v + u_yy * v) dxdy = -∫∫(sin(x)sin(y) * v) dxdy\n\nWe then apply the Galerkin approximation, replacing u(x, y) with its finite element approximation:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ Σ U_i * N_i(x, y)\n\nStep 4: Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\nWe compute the element stiffness matrix K_e and load vector F_e for each element, and then assemble them into the global stiffness matrix K and load vector F.\n\nK_e = ∫∫(∇N_i * ∇N_j) dxdy\nF_e = -∫∫(sin(x)sin(y) * N_i) dxdy\n\nStep 5: Apply boundary conditions\nWe apply the given boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,y) = u(1,y) = u(x,0) = u(x,1) = 0\n\nThis results in modifying the global stiffness matrix K and load vector F to account for the boundary conditions.\n\nStep 6: Solve the linear system\nWe solve the linear system KU = F for the unknown nodal values U.\n\nStep 7: Compute the numerical solution\nThe numerical solution of the PDE is given by:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ Σ U_i * N_i(x, y)\n\nwhere U_i are the nodal values obtained from solving the linear system.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the finite element method requires programming and numerical integration techniques. The steps provided here outline the general procedure to solve the given PDE using FEM."
