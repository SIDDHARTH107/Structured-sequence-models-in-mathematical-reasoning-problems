    "message_2": "To show that $E$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of two line bundles over $M$, we will use the following fact:\n\nFact: A rank-2 vector bundle $E$ over a compact topological space $M$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of two line bundles if and only if there exists a global section $s \\in \\Gamma(M, E)$ such that $s(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nProof of the fact: If there exists such a global section $s$, then we can define a map $f: M \\rightarrow E$ by $f(x) = s(x)$. This map is continuous and surjective, and its kernel is a line bundle $L \\subset E$. Then, $E$ is isomorphic to the direct sum $L \\oplus L^\\perp$, where $L^\\perp$ is the orthogonal complement of $L$.\n\nConversely, if $E$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of two line bundles $L_1$ and $L_2$, then we can define a global section $s \\in \\Gamma(M, E)$ by $s(x) = (l_1(x), l_2(x))$, where $l_1 \\in \\Gamma(M, L_1)$ and $l_2 \\in \\Gamma(M, L_2)$ are non-vanishing global sections of $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. This global section $s$ is non-vanishing everywhere on $M$.\n\nNow, let's use this fact to prove the statement. Since $c_1(E) = 0$, there exists a complex line bundle $L$ over $M$ such that $E \\otimes L$ is a trivial bundle. Let $t \\in \\Gamma(M, E \\otimes L)$ be a non-vanishing global section of $E \\otimes L$. Then, we can define a global section $s \\in \\Gamma(M, E)$ by $s(x) = t(x) \\otimes l(x)^{-1}$, where $l \\in \\Gamma(M, L)$ is a non-vanishing global section of $L$. This global section $s$ is non-vanishing everywhere on $M$, so by the fact above, $E$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of two line bundles.\n\nNow, let's find the explicit isomorphism in terms of transition functions if $M$ is the projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$. Let $U_i$ be the standard open cover of $\\mathbb{RP}^2$, and let $g_{ij}: U_i \\cap U_j \\rightarrow GL(2, \\mathbb{C})$ be the transition functions of $E$. Since $c_1(E) = 0$, we can find a line bundle $L$ over $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ with transition functions $h_{ij}: U_i \\cap U_j \\rightarrow GL(1, \\mathbb{C})$ such that $g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} h_{ij} & 0 \\\\ 0 & h_{ij}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nLet $L'$ be the dual line bundle of $L$, with transition functions $h_{ij}^{-1}$. Then, $E$ is isomorphic to the direct sum $L \\oplus L'$, with transition functions $\\begin{pmatrix} h_{ij} & 0 \\\\ 0 & h_{ij}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}$."
