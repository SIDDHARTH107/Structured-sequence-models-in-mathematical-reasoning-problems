The current stock price is $55.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we need to use the following formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS = current stock price\nX = strike price\nT = time to expiration (in years)\nr = risk-free interest rate\nN(d) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nσ = volatility of the stock\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nS = $55\nX = $50\nT = 3 months = 0.25 years\nr = 2% = 0.02\nσ = 30% = 0.3\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\nd1 = (ln(55/50) + (0.02 + (0.3^2)/2) * 0.25) / (0.3 * sqrt(0.25))\nd1 = (0.09531 + (0.02 + 0.045) * 0.25) / (0.3 * 0.5)\nd1 = (0.09531 + 0.01625) / 0.15\nd1 = 0.74107\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = 0.74107 - 0.3 * 0.5\nd2 = 0.74107 - 0.15\nd2 = 0.59107\n\nNow, we need to find N(d1) and N(d2) using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we get:\n\nN(d1) = N(0.74107) ≈ 0.7704\nN(d2) = N(0.59107) ≈ 0.7271\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\nC = 55 * 0.7704 - 50 * e^(-0.02 * 0.25) * 0.7271\nC = 42.372 - 50 * 0.995 * 0.7271\nC = 42.372 - 36.163\nC = $6.209\n\nSo, the price of the European call option is approximately $6.209."
