    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has three resources available for production with the following capacity constraints:\n\n- Resource 1: 100 units\n- Resource 2: 150 units\n- Resource 3: 200 units\n\nThe company produces two products A and B, with the following material requirements and profit margins:\n\n- Product A: requires 2 units of Resource 1, 1 unit of Resource 2, and earns a profit of $10 per unit\n- Product B: requires 1 unit of Resource 1, 3 units of Resource 3, and earns a profit of $12 per unit\n\nThe company wants to determine the optimal production quantity of each product that maximizes the total profit while satisfying the resource constraints. What is the optimal production quantity of each product and the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal Profit = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 100 (Resource 1 constraint)\nx ≤ 150 (Resource 2 constraint)\n3y ≤ 200 (Resource 3 constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints on a graph and finding the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the total profit at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of the constraints:\n\nx = 0, y = 0 (origin)\nx = 150, y = 0 (Resource 2 constraint)\nx = 50, y = 0 (Resource 1 constraint)\nx = 0, y = 66.67 (Resource 3 constraint)\n\nNow, we evaluate the total profit at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): Total Profit = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n2. (150, 0): Total Profit = 10(150) + 12(0) = $1500\n3. (50, 0): Total Profit = 10(50) + 12(0) = $500\n4. (0, 66.67): Total Profit = 10(0) + 12(66.67) = $800.04 (approx.)\n\nThe maximum total profit occurs at vertex (150, 0), with a total profit of $1500. Therefore, the optimal production quantity is 150 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B, with a total profit of $1500."
