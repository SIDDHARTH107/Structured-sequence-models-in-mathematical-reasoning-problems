    "message_1": "A race car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, reaching a speed of 80 m/s in 10 seconds. What is the average acceleration of the car?",
    "message_2": "To find the average acceleration, we can use the formula:\n\naverage acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time\n\nIn this case, the initial velocity is 0 m/s (since the car starts from rest), the final velocity is 80 m/s, and the time is 10 seconds. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\naverage acceleration = (80 m/s - 0 m/s) / 10 s\n\naverage acceleration = 80 m/s / 10 s\n\naverage acceleration = 8 m/sÂ²\n\nSo, the average acceleration of the car is 8 meters per second squared."
