    "message_2": "In linear logic, the proposition P = A ⊗ B ⊸ C can be interpreted as \"if A and B are true, then C is true.\" To find the probability that P is true, we need to consider the cases where A and B are true and C is true.\n\nThe probability that A and B are both true is given by the product of their individual probabilities: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\n\nNow, we need to consider the cases where C is true. Since C is true 80% of the time, the probability that C is false is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.\n\nThe proposition P is true if either A and B are not both true, or if A and B are true and C is true. The probability that A and B are not both true is 1 - P(A and B) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability that P is true using the formula:\n\nP(P) = P(A and B not both true) + P(A and B both true and C true) = P(A and B not both true) + P(A and B) * P(C)\n\nP(P) = 0.76 + 0.24 * 0.8 = 0.76 + 0.192 = 0.952\n\nSo, the probability that the proposition P is true is 95.2%."
