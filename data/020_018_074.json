    "message_1": "An online seller has two products, A and B. The seller expects to make a profit of $5 on product A and $9 on product B. However, the seller can only list one product at a time. If the seller lists product A, the probability that a customer will buy it is 0.4. If the seller lists product B, the probability that a customer will buy it is 0.6. The seller wants to maximize their expected profit. What is the optimal strategy for the seller?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for the seller, we need to calculate the expected profit for each product and compare them.\n\nExpected profit for product A:\nProfit_A = Profit per sale * Probability of sale\nProfit_A = $5 * 0.4\nProfit_A = $2\n\nExpected profit for product B:\nProfit_B = Profit per sale * Probability of sale\nProfit_B = $9 * 0.6\nProfit_B = $5.4\n\nSince the expected profit for product B ($5.4) is higher than the expected profit for product A ($2), the optimal strategy for the seller is to list product B."
