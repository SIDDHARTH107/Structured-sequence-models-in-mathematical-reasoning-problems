    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms, where Firm A is the leader and Firm B is the follower. Firm A can produce at a cost of $100 per unit and Firm B can produce at a cost of $120 per unit. The demand curve for the product is given by Q = 200 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. If Firm A is able to commit to a quantity before Firm B decides its quantity, what is the optimal quantity that Firm A should produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity that Firm A should produce to maximize its profit, we need to first find the reaction function of Firm B. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity that Firm B will produce given the quantity produced by Firm A.\n\nLet qA be the quantity produced by Firm A and qB be the quantity produced by Firm B. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB. From the demand curve, we have P = 200 - Q.\n\nThe profit function for Firm B is given by:\n\nπB = P * qB - C * qB = (200 - Q) * qB - 120 * qB = (200 - qA - qB) * qB - 120 * qB\n\nTo find the optimal quantity for Firm B, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to qB. Taking the first-order derivative with respect to qB and setting it to zero, we get:\n\nd(πB)/dqB = 200 - 2 * qB - qA - 120 = 0\n\nSolving for qB, we get the reaction function for Firm B:\n\nqB = (80 - qA) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal quantity for Firm A, given the reaction function of Firm B. The profit function for Firm A is given by:\n\nπA = P * qA - C * qA = (200 - Q) * qA - 100 * qA = (200 - qA - qB) * qA - 100 * qA\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of Firm B into the profit function of Firm A:\n\nπA = (200 - qA - (80 - qA) / 2) * qA - 100 * qA\n\nSimplifying the profit function, we get:\n\nπA = (120 - (1/2) * qA) * qA - 100 * qA\n\nTo find the optimal quantity for Firm A, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to qA. Taking the first-order derivative with respect to qA and setting it to zero, we get:\n\nd(πA)/dqA = 120 - qA - 100 = 0\n\nSolving for qA, we get the optimal quantity that Firm A should produce to maximize its profit:\n\nqA = 20\n\nSo, Firm A should produce 20 units to maximize its profit in the Stackelberg competition."
