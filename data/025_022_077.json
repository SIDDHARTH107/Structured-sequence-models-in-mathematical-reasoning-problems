    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the derived hom space between X and Y, we first need to understand the structure of the Ext groups. Recall that for coherent sheaves F and G on a smooth projective variety, we have:\n\nExt^i(F, G) = H^i(Hom(F, G)).\n\nIn our case, X is an elliptic curve, which is a smooth projective curve of genus 1, and Y is a quadratic curve, which is a smooth projective curve of genus 0 (since it is isomorphic to the projective line P^1). Let F be a coherent sheaf on X and G be a coherent sheaf on Y.\n\nNow, we want to compute the dimensions of Ext^i(F, G) for i = 0, 1, 2.\n\n1. For i = 0, we have Ext^0(F, G) = Hom(F, G). Since X and Y are different algebraic varieties, there are no non-trivial morphisms between their coherent sheaves. Therefore, dim Ext^0(X, Y) = 0.\n\n2. For i = 1, we have Ext^1(F, G) = H^1(Hom(F, G)). Again, since X and Y are different algebraic varieties, there are no non-trivial morphisms between their coherent sheaves. Therefore, H^1(Hom(F, G)) = 0, and dim Ext^1(X, Y) = 0.\n\n3. For i = 2, we have Ext^2(F, G) = H^2(Hom(F, G)). Since X and Y are both curves, their higher cohomology groups vanish for i â‰¥ 2. Therefore, H^2(Hom(F, G)) = 0, and dim Ext^2(X, Y) = 0.\n\nIn conclusion, we have dim Ext^i(X, Y) = 0 for i = 0, 1, 2."
