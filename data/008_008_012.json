    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products A and B. The production of each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while the production of each unit of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The company has 120 hours of labor and 150 hours of machine time available per week. The profit earned by the sale of each unit of product A is $5 and the profit earned by each unit of product B is $4. Determine how many units of each product the company should produce per week to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per week.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are given by the following inequalities:\n\nLabor: 2x + y ≤ 120\nMachine time: x + 3y ≤ 150\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y, subject to the constraints above.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Solve each inequality for y:\n   Labor: y ≤ -2x + 120\n   Machine time: y ≤ -1/3x + 50\n\n2. Graph the inequalities:\n   The feasible region is the intersection of the two inequalities, which forms a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 50), (60, 0), and (30, 40).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 50) = 5(0) + 4(50) = $200\n3. P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 4(0) = $300\n4. P(30, 40) = 5(30) + 4(40) = $310\n\nThe maximum profit of $310 is achieved when the company produces 30 units of product A and 40 units of product B per week."
