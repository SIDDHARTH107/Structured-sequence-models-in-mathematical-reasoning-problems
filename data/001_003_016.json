    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. In this case, I will make the coefficients of y the same. To do this, I will multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 5:\n\nFirst equation * 4:\n12x + 20y = 76\n\nSecond equation * 5:\n10x - 20y = -60\n\nNow, we can add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(12x + 20y) + (10x - 20y) = 76 + (-60)\n12x + 10x = 16\n22x = 16\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 16 / 22\nx = 8 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. I will use the first equation:\n\n3x + 5y = 19\n3(8/11) + 5y = 19\n\nMultiply both sides by 11 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n33 + 55y = 209\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n55y = 176\ny = 176 / 55\ny = 16 / 5\n\nSo, the values of x and y that make both equations true are x = 8/11 and y = 16/5."
