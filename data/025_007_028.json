    "message_2": "To compute H^1(X, L), we can use the Serre duality theorem. Serre duality states that for a smooth projective curve X of genus g and a line bundle L on X, we have an isomorphism:\n\nH^1(X, L) ≅ H^0(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1))^*,\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X, L^(-1) is the dual of L, and ^* denotes the dual vector space.\n\nFirst, let's compute K_X ⊗ L^(-1). Since X is a smooth projective curve, the canonical bundle K_X is given by the line bundle associated to the divisor of the canonical class, which is (2g - 2) times a point P, where g is the genus of X. So, K_X = 𝒪_X((2g - 2)P).\n\nNow, L has degree 3, so L = 𝒪_X(3P) for some point P. Then, the dual of L is L^(-1) = 𝒪_X(-3P). Thus, K_X ⊗ L^(-1) = 𝒪_X((2g - 2)P) ⊗ 𝒪_X(-3P) = 𝒪_X((2g - 5)P).\n\nWe are given that H^0(X, L) = 0. By Serre duality, we have:\n\nH^1(X, L) ≅ H^0(X, 𝒪_X((2g - 5)P))^*.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\n1) If 2g - 5 > 0, then H^0(X, 𝒪_X((2g - 5)P)) is non-zero, since the degree of the line bundle is positive. In this case, H^1(X, L) is non-zero as well.\n\n2) If 2g - 5 ≤ 0, then H^0(X, 𝒪_X((2g - 5)P)) = 0, since the degree of the line bundle is non-positive. In this case, H^1(X, L) = 0.\n\nIn conclusion, H^1(X, L) is non-zero if 2g - 5 > 0, and H^1(X, L) = 0 if 2g - 5 ≤ 0."
