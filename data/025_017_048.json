    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus 3 defined over the field of complex numbers. If a linear system |D| on X of degree d has no base points, where D is a divisor on X, then according to the Riemann-Roch theorem, the dimension of |D| is given by:\n\ndim |D| = d - 1 + 3 - g\n\nwhere g is the genus of X. \n\nIf |D| is such that dim|D| = 2, find the possible values of d for X.",
    "message_2": "Given that the genus g of the curve X is 3, we can substitute this value into the Riemann-Roch theorem formula:\n\ndim |D| = d - 1 + 3 - 3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ndim |D| = d - 1\n\nNow, we are given that dim |D| = 2. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 = d - 1\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = 2 + 1\nd = 3\n\nThus, the possible value of d for X is 3."
