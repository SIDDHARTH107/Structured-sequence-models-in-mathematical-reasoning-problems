    "message_1": "A factory has two machines, each of which can produce up to 500 units per hour. The first machine produces only Product A, and the second machine produces only Product B. There is a demand for 800 units of Product A per hour and 600 units of Product B per hour. The factory wants to maximize its production while also meeting the demand. What is the maximum number of units that the factory can produce per hour?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of units produced by the first machine as x and the number of units produced by the second machine as y. We know that:\n\nx ≤ 500 (since the first machine can produce up to 500 units per hour)\ny ≤ 500 (since the second machine can produce up to 500 units per hour)\n\nThe factory wants to meet the demand for Product A and Product B, so:\n\nx ≥ 800 (since there is a demand for 800 units of Product A per hour)\ny ≥ 600 (since there is a demand for 600 units of Product B per hour)\n\nSince the first machine can only produce up to 500 units per hour, it cannot meet the demand for Product A on its own. Therefore, the factory will need to use the second machine to produce some units of Product A as well. To do this, the factory can temporarily convert the second machine to produce Product A.\n\nLet's say the second machine produces z units of Product A and (500 - z) units of Product B. Then:\n\nx + z ≥ 800 (since the total production of Product A must meet the demand)\ny + (500 - z) ≥ 600 (since the total production of Product B must meet the demand)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of x + y + z, given the constraints above.\n\nSince x ≤ 500, the maximum value of x is 500. To meet the demand for Product A, we need to produce at least 800 - 500 = 300 more units. Therefore, z = 300.\n\nNow, the second machine is producing 300 units of Product A and 500 - 300 = 200 units of Product B. So, y = 200.\n\nThe maximum number of units the factory can produce per hour is x + y + z = 500 + 200 + 300 = 1000 units."
