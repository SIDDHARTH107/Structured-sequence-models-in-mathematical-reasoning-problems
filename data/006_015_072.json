    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of at least one ransomware attack occurring on a network with 50 devices, we can use the complementary probability method. This means we will first find the probability of no ransomware attack occurring and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single device not being infected by ransomware is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nSince the devices are independent, the probability of all 50 devices not being infected is (0.98)^50 ≈ 0.3642.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one ransomware attack occurring:\n\n1 - 0.3642 ≈ 0.6358.\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network with 50 devices is approximately 63.58%."
