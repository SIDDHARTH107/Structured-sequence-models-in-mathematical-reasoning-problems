Find the function that gives the mass of the radioactive material as a function of time, and determine how long it will take for the material to decay to half of its initial mass.",
    "message_2": "To find the function that gives the mass of the radioactive material as a function of time, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nM(t) = M₀ * (1 - r)^t\n\nwhere M(t) is the mass of the radioactive material at time t, M₀ is the initial mass, r is the decay rate, and t is the time in days.\n\nIn this case, M₀ = 75 grams and r = 0.022 (2.2% expressed as a decimal).\n\nSo the function is:\n\nM(t) = 75 * (1 - 0.022)^t\n\nNow, we want to find how long it will take for the material to decay to half of its initial mass, which is 75/2 = 37.5 grams.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n37.5 = 75 * (1 - 0.022)^t\n\nTo solve for t, we can first divide both sides by 75:\n\n0.5 = (1 - 0.022)^t\n\nNow, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.5) = ln((1 - 0.022)^t)\n\nUsing the power rule for logarithms, we can bring the t down:\n\nln(0.5) = t * ln(1 - 0.022)\n\nNow, we can solve for t by dividing both sides by ln(1 - 0.022):\n\nt = ln(0.5) / ln(1 - 0.022)\n\nt ≈ 31.67 days\n\nSo, it will take approximately 31.67 days for the material to decay to half of its initial mass."
