    "message_2": "Let's consider two cases: using 2 colors and using 3 or more colors.\n\nCase 1: Using 2 colors\nLet's label the colors A and B. There are two ways to color the vertices of a square with these two colors:\n\n1. A B\n   B A\n\n2. B A\n   A B\n\nCase 2: Using 3 or more colors\nWhen using 3 or more colors, we can always find a valid coloring by using only 2 of the colors. For example, if we have colors A, B, and C, we can still use the colorings from Case 1. Adding more colors will not create new valid colorings, as we can always replace one of the colors in the existing valid colorings without changing the pattern.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 different ways to color the vertices of a square so that adjacent vertices have different colors."
