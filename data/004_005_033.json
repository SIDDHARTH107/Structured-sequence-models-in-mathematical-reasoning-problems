    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation dy/dx = x + y with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we first find the integrating factor.\n\nThe standard form of a first-order linear differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x)\n\nComparing this with the given equation, we have P(x) = 1 and Q(x) = x.\n\nThe integrating factor (IF) is given by the exponential of the integral of P(x) with respect to x:\n\nIF = e^(∫P(x)dx) = e^(∫1dx) = e^x\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the given differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^x(dy/dx) + e^x*y = x*e^x\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nd/dx (e^x * y) = x*e^x\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx (e^x * y)) dx = ∫(x*e^x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts for the right side, let u = x and dv = e^x dx, then du = dx and v = e^x. Applying integration by parts formula:\n\n∫(x*e^x) dx = x*e^x - ∫(e^x) dx = x*e^x - e^x + C\n\nNow, we have:\n\ne^x * y = x*e^x - e^x + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = 0 - 1 + C => C = 2\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\ne^x * y = x*e^x - e^x + 2\n\nDivide both sides by e^x:\n\ny(x) = x - 1 + 2*e^(-x)\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1."
