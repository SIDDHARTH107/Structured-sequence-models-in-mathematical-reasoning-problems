    "message_1": "A publishing company wants to print a book. The fixed cost for printing is $1000. The cost of printing each book is $5. The company can sell the book for $10 each. Write a quadratic programming problem to find the number of books the company has to print to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of books the company prints and sells. The cost function, C(x), represents the total cost of printing x books, which includes the fixed cost and the cost of printing each book. The revenue function, R(x), represents the total revenue from selling x books. The profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue and the cost.\n\n1. Cost function: C(x) = 1000 + 5x\n2. Revenue function: R(x) = 10x\n3. Profit function: P(x) = R(x) - C(x)\n\nNow, substitute the cost and revenue functions into the profit function:\n\nP(x) = (10x) - (1000 + 5x)\nP(x) = 10x - 1000 - 5x\nP(x) = 5x - 1000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic function. Since this is a linear function, there is no vertex, and the profit will increase linearly as the number of books printed and sold increases. Therefore, the company should print and sell as many books as possible to maximize their profit."
