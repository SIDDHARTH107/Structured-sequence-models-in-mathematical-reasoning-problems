    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is generated through a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (2 + √2). \n\nTo find the perimeter of the Gosper curve after 6 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Length × (Length Increase Factor) ^ Number of Iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, the length increase factor is (2 + √2), and the number of iterations is 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 1 × (2 + √2) ^ 6\n\nCalculating this expression, we get:\n\nPerimeter ≈ 1 × 138.56 ≈ 138.56 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Gosper curve after 6 iterations is approximately 138.56 units."
