    "message_1": "A population of 5000 cockroaches is introduced to an apartment. Suppose the growth rate of the cockroach population is proportional to the current population, and over the course of one week, the population doubles. Use the differential equation for exponential growth to determine the number of cockroaches after two weeks.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth model, which is represented by the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We know that the population doubles in one week, so:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P0 is the initial population (5000 cockroaches), P(t) is the population at time t, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nAfter one week (t = 1), the population doubles to 10000 cockroaches:\n\n10000 = 5000 * e^(k * 1)\n\nDivide both sides by 5000:\n\n2 = e^k\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = ln(e^k)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can simplify this to:\n\nln(2) = k\n\nNow we have the value of k:\n\nk ≈ 0.6931\n\nNow we can find the population after two weeks (t = 2):\n\nP(2) = P0 * e^(kt)\n\nP(2) = 5000 * e^(0.6931 * 2)\n\nP(2) ≈ 5000 * e^1.3862\n\nP(2) ≈ 5000 * 4\n\nP(2) = 20000\n\nSo, after two weeks, there will be approximately 20,000 cockroaches in the apartment."
