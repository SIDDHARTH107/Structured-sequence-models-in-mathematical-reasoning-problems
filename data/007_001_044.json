    "message_2": "A prime palindrome number is a prime number that reads the same backward as forward. To find the smallest 4-digit prime palindrome number, we can start by listing the 4-digit palindromes and checking if they are prime.\n\nThe smallest 4-digit palindrome is 1001, which is not prime since it is divisible by 7 and 11. The next smallest 4-digit palindrome is 1111, which is also not prime since it is divisible by 11. Continuing this process, we find that the smallest 4-digit prime palindrome number is 10301."
