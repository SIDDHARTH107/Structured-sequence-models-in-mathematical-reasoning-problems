    "message_2": "There are nine non-abelian groups of order 36. They can be classified as follows:\n\n1. G1 = S3 × Z6\n2. G2 = S3 × D6\n3. G3 = Z3 × D12\n4. G4 = Z3 × A4\n5. G5 = Z3 × (Z2 × Z2 × Z3)\n6. G6 = Z3 × (Z2 × Z2 × Z3) (different from G5)\n7. G7 = Z3 × Q8\n8. G8 = Z3 × Q8 (different from G7)\n9. G9 = Z3 × Q8 (different from G7 and G8)\n\nPresenting the multiplication tables for all these groups would be too large for this format. However, I can provide you with the general idea of how to construct the multiplication tables for each group.\n\nFor each group, you can start by listing the elements in a systematic order. For example, for G1 = S3 × Z6, you can list the elements as (s, z), where s ∈ S3 and z ∈ Z6. Then, you can create a 36x36 table with rows and columns labeled by the elements of the group. To fill in the table, use the multiplication rules for each component group.\n\nFor example, in G1, the multiplication rule for S3 is given by the permutation group multiplication, and for Z6, it is given by the addition modulo 6. So, to find the product of two elements (s1, z1) and (s2, z2), you would compute (s1 * s2, z1 + z2) modulo 6.\n\nSimilarly, you can construct the multiplication tables for the other groups by listing their elements and using the appropriate multiplication rules for each component group.\n\nIt's important to note that some of these groups may have different presentations, but they are isomorphic to one of the nine groups listed above. To determine the isomorphism class, you can look at the group structure and properties, such as the number of elements of each order, the center of the group, and the derived subgroup."
