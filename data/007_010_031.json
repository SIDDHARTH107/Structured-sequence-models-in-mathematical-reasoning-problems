    "message_2": "Let the number be x. We are given the following information:\n\n1. When x is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. This can be written as x ≡ 2 (mod 3).\n2. When x is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. This can be written as x ≡ 3 (mod 5).\n\nWe will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. The theorem states that if the moduli are pairwise coprime (which 3 and 5 are), there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli (in this case, modulo 15).\n\nLet's find the solution:\n\n1. First, we find the modular inverses:\n   a. M1 = 5 (the other modulus)\n   b. M2 = 3 (the other modulus)\n   c. Find the inverse of M1 modulo 3: 5 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n      - Trying values for y1, we find that y1 = 2 satisfies the equation (5 * 2 = 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3)).\n   d. Find the inverse of M2 modulo 5: 3 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n      - Trying values for y2, we find that y2 = 2 satisfies the equation (3 * 2 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)).\n\n2. Now, we can find the solution:\n   x ≡ 2 * 5 * 2 + 3 * 3 * 2 (mod 15)\n   x ≡ 20 + 18 (mod 15)\n   x ≡ 38 (mod 15)\n\nThe smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the given conditions is x = 8."
