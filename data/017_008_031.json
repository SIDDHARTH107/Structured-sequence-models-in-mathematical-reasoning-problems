    "message_2": "To determine which group of order 8 is isomorphic to the given presentation, we first need to analyze the relations given in the presentation.\n\n1. a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e: This tells us that a, b, c, and d are all elements of order 2.\n\n2. af = bf = cg = dg = e: This tells us that a, b, c, and d commute with f and g.\n\n3. ag = bh: This implies that a and b are conjugate elements.\n\n4. ah = bg: This implies that a and b are also conjugate elements.\n\n5. fg = gf: This tells us that f and g commute.\n\nNow, let's try to find a group of order 8 that satisfies these properties. The groups of order 8 are:\n\n1. Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8)\n2. Z_4 × Z_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 2)\n3. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2)\n4. D_4 (dihedral group of order 8, also known as the symmetry group of a square)\n\nWe can eliminate Z_8 and Z_4 × Z_2 because they have elements of order 4 and 8, while our presentation only has elements of order 2.\n\nNow let's consider D_4. The elements of D_4 can be represented as {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r is a rotation by 90 degrees and s is a reflection. In this group, r^4 = s^2 = e, and sr = r^(-1)s. We can see that r^2, s, sr, and sr^2 all have order 2, and they commute with sr^3 and r^3. Also, r^2 and s are conjugate elements, and r^2 and sr are conjugate elements. This matches the properties of our presentation.\n\nTherefore, the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_4."
