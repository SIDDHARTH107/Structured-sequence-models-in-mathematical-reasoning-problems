It has 8 hours of machine time daily and can produce 15 units of product A in 1 hour of machine time, and 10 units of product B in 1 hour of machine time. The company needs to produce at least 60 units of product A and 80 units of product B daily. If the profit for each unit of product A is $10 and for each unit of product B is $8, how many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit? What is the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of hours spent producing product A, and y be the number of hours spent producing product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 8 (total machine time)\n2. 15x ≥ 60 (minimum production of product A)\n3. 10y ≥ 80 (minimum production of product B)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P = 10(15x) + 8(10y) = 150x + 80y.\n\nFirst, we solve the constraints for x and y:\n\nConstraint 2: 15x ≥ 60 => x ≥ 4\nConstraint 3: 10y ≥ 80 => y ≥ 8\n\nSince y ≥ 8, but x + y ≤ 8, the only possible solution is x = 4 and y = 4. This means the company should spend 4 hours producing product A and 4 hours producing product B.\n\nNow we can find the number of units produced for each product:\n\nProduct A: 15 units/hour * 4 hours = 60 units\nProduct B: 10 units/hour * 4 hours = 40 units\n\nThe company should produce 60 units of product A and 40 units of product B to maximize profit.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the maximum profit:\n\nMaximum profit = 150x + 80y = 150(4) + 80(4) = 600 + 320 = $920"
