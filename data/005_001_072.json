    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the average length of their product is 12 inches. A sample of 36 products was tested and it was found that the average length was 11.5 inches with a standard deviation of 1.8 inches. Can you reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true average length is 12 inches, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true average length is not 12 inches.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (11.5 - 12) / (1.8 / sqrt(36))\n\nt = (-0.5) / (1.8 / 6)\n\nt = -0.5 / 0.3\n\nt = -1.67\n\nNow, we need to determine the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 35 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately Â±2.03.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-1.67) is within the range of the critical t-values (-2.03 to 2.03), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that the average length of their product is 12 inches at a significance level of 0.05."
