    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) = cos(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we can use the double angle identity for sine:\n\nsin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = cos(x)\n\nWe can divide both sides by cos(x) (assuming cos(x) ≠ 0):\n\n2sin(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nThe solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = π/6 and x = 5π/6\n\nHowever, we divided by cos(x) earlier, so we need to check if cos(x) = 0 for these solutions:\n\ncos(π/6) = √3/2 ≠ 0\ncos(5π/6) = -√3/2 ≠ 0\n\nSince cos(x) ≠ 0 for both solutions, they are valid. Therefore, the solutions for x in the given equation and interval are:\n\nx = π/6 and x = 5π/6"
