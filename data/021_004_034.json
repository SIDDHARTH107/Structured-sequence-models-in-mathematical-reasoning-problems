    "message_2": "To find the numerical derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 at x = 2 using the forward difference formula, we will use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere f'(x) is the derivative of f(x), x is the point at which we want to find the derivative, and h is a small increment (in this case, h = 0.1).\n\nFirst, let's find f(x) and f(x + h):\n\nf(x) = 3(2)^2 - 5 = 3(4) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7\nf(x + h) = 3(2 + 0.1)^2 - 5 = 3(2.1)^2 - 5 = 3(4.41) - 5 = 13.23 - 5 = 8.23\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1 = (8.23 - 7) / 0.1 = 1.23 / 0.1 = 12.3\n\nSo, the numerical derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 at x = 2 using the forward difference formula with h = 0.1 is approximately 12.3."
