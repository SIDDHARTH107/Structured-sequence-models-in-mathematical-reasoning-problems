    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the graph G, we can use the greedy coloring algorithm. We will color the vertices one by one, assigning the smallest available color that is not already assigned to an adjacent vertex.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's connected to vertex 1 with color A).\n3. Color vertex 3 with color A (it's not connected to vertex 1 or 2).\n4. Color vertex 4 with color B (it's connected to vertex 1 with color A).\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (it's not connected to vertex 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n6. Color vertex 6 with color C (it's connected to vertex 1 with color A and vertex 4 with color B).\n7. Color vertex 7 with color C (it's connected to vertex 2 with color B and vertex 3 with color A).\n8. Color vertex 8 with color A (it's connected to vertex 4 with color B and vertex 5 with color A, but not connected to vertex 6 with color C).\n9. Color vertex 9 with color B (it's connected to vertex 3 with color A and vertex 5 with color A).\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors required to color the graph G is 3."
