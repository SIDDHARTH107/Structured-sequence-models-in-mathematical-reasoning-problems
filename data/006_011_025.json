    "message_1": "In a factory, it is estimated that the probability of an accident occurring involving a machine is 0.15. If the factory has 40 machines, what is the probability that at least 5 accidents will occur in a given week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k accidents occurring\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k! * (n-k)!))\n- n is the number of machines (40 in this case)\n- k is the number of accidents (we want at least 5)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring for a single machine (0.15)\n- (1-p) is the probability of an accident not occurring for a single machine (0.85)\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 5 accidents occurring, we need to find the probability of 5, 6, 7, ..., 40 accidents occurring and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 accidents occurring and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, let's find the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 accidents occurring:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(40, 0) * (0.15)^0 * (0.85)^40\nP(X = 1) = C(40, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (0.85)^39\nP(X = 2) = C(40, 2) * (0.15)^2 * (0.85)^38\nP(X = 3) = C(40, 3) * (0.15)^3 * (0.85)^37\nP(X = 4) = C(40, 4) * (0.15)^4 * (0.85)^36\n\nNow, we can calculate these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.000026\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.000343\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.002262\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.009182\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.026065\n\nNext, we sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 4) ≈ 0.000026 + 0.000343 + 0.002262 + 0.009182 + 0.026065 ≈ 0.037878\n\nFinally, we subtract this sum from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 accidents occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) ≈ 1 - 0.037878 ≈ 0.962122\n\nSo, the probability of at least 5 accidents occurring in a given week is approximately 0.962 or 96.21%."
