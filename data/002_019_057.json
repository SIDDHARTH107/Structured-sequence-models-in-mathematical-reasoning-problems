    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (the area of the curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven, radius r = 5 cm and slant height l = 12 cm.\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 12)\nSurface Area = π(5)(17)\nSurface Area = 85π\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 85π square centimeters."
