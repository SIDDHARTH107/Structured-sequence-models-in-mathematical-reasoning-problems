    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = 1 - a * x_n^2 + y_n\ny_n+1 = b * x_n\n\nwhere a and b are parameters. The period of a strange attractor generated by the Hénon map is not something that can be easily calculated analytically, especially for specific parameter values like a = 1.4 and b = 0.3. The period of a strange attractor is typically determined through numerical simulations and can be highly sensitive to the initial conditions.\n\nHowever, it is known that for the classical Hénon map with parameter values a = 1.4 and b = 0.3, the attractor has an approximate period of 6. This is based on numerical simulations and observations of the attractor's behavior. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the actual period may vary depending on the specific initial conditions used in the simulation."
