    "message_1": "Consider the mirror symmetry between two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y with Hodge numbers h(X)=(1,101,1) and h(Y)=(1,1,101). If the mirror map from X to Y is given by x -> 2/3 x^2 + 7/27 x^3, find the image of the class 立_X^2 in H^4(Y;Z).",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the class 立_X^2 in H^4(Y;Z), we need to understand how the mirror map acts on the cohomology classes. The mirror map is given by x -> 2/3 x^2 + 7/27 x^3. \n\nFirst, let's recall some facts about Calabi-Yau manifolds and mirror symmetry. The Hodge diamond of a Calabi-Yau manifold X is given by:\n\nh^0,0(X)  h^1,0(X)  h^2,0(X)  ...  h^n,0(X)\nh^0,1(X)  h^1,1(X)  h^2,1(X)  ...  h^n,1(X)\n...\nh^0,n(X)  h^1,n(X)  h^2,n(X)  ...  h^n,n(X)\n\nwhere n is the complex dimension of X. In our case, n=3, and the Hodge numbers are h(X) = (1,101,1) and h(Y) = (1,1,101). The Hodge diamond for X and Y are:\n\nX:      1\n      101\n        1\n\nY:      1\n        1\n      101\n\nNow, let's consider the action of the mirror map on the cohomology classes. The mirror map exchanges Hodge numbers h^{p,q}(X) and h^{q,p}(Y). In particular, it maps the class 立_X^2, which is a (2,2)-form on X, to a class in H^4(Y;Z) with Hodge type (2,2).\n\nSince the Hodge numbers of Y are h(Y) = (1,1,101), we know that there is only one independent (2,2)-class in H^4(Y;Z). Therefore, the image of the class 立_X^2 under the mirror map is simply the unique (2,2)-class in H^4(Y;Z)."
