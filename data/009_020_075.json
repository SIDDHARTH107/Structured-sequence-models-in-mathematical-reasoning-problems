You want to design a control input u(t) to minimize the cost function:\n\nJ = âˆ«(0 to T) [ 2y^2(t) + u^2(t) ] dt\n\nsubject to the initial condition y(0) = 1 and the final condition y(T) = 0. Find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the value of the cost function J.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we define the Hamiltonian function H as follows:\n\nH(y, u, p) = 2y^2 + u^2 + p(y + u)\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. dH/du = 0, which gives us the optimal control input u(t):\n\ndH/du = 2u + p = 0 => u(t) = -p(t)/2\n\n2. The costate equation:\n\ndp/dt = -dH/dy = -4y - p\n\nNow, we have a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) with the following boundary conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1, y(T) = 0\n\nTo solve the TPBVP, we can use the shooting method. We guess an initial value for p(0) and integrate the state and costate equations forward in time. Then, we adjust the initial value of p(0) until the final condition y(T) = 0 is satisfied.\n\nOnce we find the correct initial value for p(0), we can use the optimal control input equation u(t) = -p(t)/2 to find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J."
