    "message_1": "A researcher wants to analyze the heights of a group of students in their class. However, the data contains some outliers due to errors in measurement. The researcher decides to use the median as a measure of central tendency since it is more robust than the mean. The heights of the 12 students in the class (in inches) are:\n\n{63, 65, 61, 59, 73, 71, 68, 55, 69, 66, 62, 81}\n\nFind the median height of the class, and compare it to the mean height (to illustrate the effect of outliers on measures of central tendency).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n{55, 59, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 68, 69, 71, 73, 81}\n\nSince there are 12 students (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (6th and 7th values):\n\nMedian = (65 + 66) / 2 = 131 / 2 = 65.5 inches\n\nNow, let's calculate the mean height:\n\nMean = (55 + 59 + 61 + 62 + 63 + 65 + 66 + 68 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 81) / 12\nMean = 793 / 12 = 66.0833 inches (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nComparing the median (65.5 inches) and the mean (66.0833 inches), we can see that the median is slightly lower than the mean. This is because the median is less affected by the outliers (55 and 81) in the data, making it a more robust measure of central tendency in this case."
