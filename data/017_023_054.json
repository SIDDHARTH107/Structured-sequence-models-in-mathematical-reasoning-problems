    "message_2": "To find the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 72, we will use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, we need to consider the possible Sylow subgroups of order 2^3 and 3^2.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, there are two possibilities:\n1. One subgroup of order 8 (2^3)\n2. Four subgroups of order 4 (2^2)\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, there are two possibilities:\n1. One subgroup of order 9 (3^2)\n2. Three subgroups of order 3 (3^1)\n\nNow, we consider the combinations of these possibilities:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9:\n   This gives us a group of the form C_8 × C_9, which is isomorphic to C_72.\n\n2. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 and three 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3:\n   This is not possible, as the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\n3. Four 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9:\n   This gives us a group of the form (C_4 × C_4) × C_9, which is isomorphic to C_4 × C_36.\n\n4. Four 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and three 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3:\n   This is not possible, as the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nSo, there are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 72: C_72 and C_4 × C_36."
