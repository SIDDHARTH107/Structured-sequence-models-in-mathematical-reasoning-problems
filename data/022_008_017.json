    "message_2": "Let's consider a general polynomial of degree at most 3:\n\n$p(z) = az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d$\n\nWe are given that $p(0) = 3$, $p'(0) = 2$, and $p(1) = 4$. Let's use these conditions to find the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n1. $p(0) = 3$:\n\n$3 = a(0)^3 + b(0)^2 + c(0) + d$\n\n$3 = d$\n\n2. $p'(z) = 3az^2 + 2bz + c$. Now, $p'(0) = 2$:\n\n$2 = 3a(0)^2 + 2b(0) + c$\n\n$2 = c$\n\n3. $p(1) = 4$:\n\n$4 = a(1)^3 + b(1)^2 + c(1) + d$\n\n$4 = a + b + 2 + 3$\n\n$4 = a + b + 5$\n\n$a + b = -1$\n\nNow we have the system of equations:\n\n$d = 3$\n\n$c = 2$\n\n$a + b = -1$\n\nSince the polynomial has degree at most 3, we can set $a = 0$ and solve for $b$:\n\n$b = -1$\n\nSo, the polynomial is:\n\n$p(z) = 0z^3 - z^2 + 2z + 3$\n\n$p(z) = -z^2 + 2z + 3$"
