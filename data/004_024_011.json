    "message_2": "To find dy/dx at the point (3, 4) using the chain rule, we first differentiate both sides of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 25 with respect to x.\n\nd/dx(x^2) + d/dx(y^2) = d/dx(25)\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx. We can rearrange the equation to isolate dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\n\nNow, we can plug in the point (3, 4) into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = -2(3) / 2(4)\ndy/dx = -6 / 8\ndy/dx = -3/4\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx at the point (3, 4) is -3/4."
