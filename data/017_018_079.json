    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems and the structure of p-groups.\n\nSince the order of G is 32, which is 2^5, G is a 2-group. Now, let's analyze the possibilities for G.\n\n1. G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C32:\nIf G is cyclic, then it has an element of order 32. By the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, there is only one cyclic group of order 32, up to isomorphism. So, if G has an element of order 32, then G is isomorphic to C32.\n\n2. G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16:\nThe dihedral group D16 has order 2 * 16 = 32. However, it is non-abelian, and its structure is different from a cyclic group. If G has the same structure as D16, then G is isomorphic to D16.\n\n3. G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32:\nThese six non-abelian groups are the quaternion group Q32, the semi-dihedral group SD32, and four other groups that can be constructed using the central product of smaller groups. To determine if G is isomorphic to one of these groups, we need to analyze the structure of G and compare it to the structures of these non-abelian groups.\n\nTo determine the structure of G, we can use the Sylow theorems and the properties of p-groups. Since G is a 2-group, it has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, the order of P is 2^5 = 32.\n\nBy the properties of p-groups, the center of P, denoted by Z(P), is non-trivial. This means that Z(P) has order 2^k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 5. We will analyze each case:\n\n- If k = 1, then Z(P) has order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semi-dihedral group SD32.\n- If k = 2, then Z(P) has order 4. In this case, G is isomorphic to one of the four non-abelian groups constructed using the central product of smaller groups.\n- If k = 3, then Z(P) has order 8. In this case, G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q32.\n- If k = 4 or k = 5, then Z(P) has order 16 or 32, respectively. In these cases, G is abelian, so it cannot be isomorphic to any of the non-abelian groups.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C32, D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32, we need to analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems and the properties of p-groups. If G has an element of order 32, then it is isomorphic to C32. If G has the same structure as D16, then it is isomorphic to D16. If G has a structure that matches one of the six non-abelian groups, then G is isomorphic to that group."
