    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, the given function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 is a simple quadratic function, and we can find its minimum value using basic calculus methods. Using WOA for this problem would be an overkill.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2, we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 4\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n6x - 4 = 0\nx = 4/6 = 2/3\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to check if this critical point is a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 6\n\nSince f''(x) is positive, the critical point x = 2/3 is a minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging this value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(2/3) = 3(2/3)^2 - 4(2/3) + 2\nf(2/3) = 3(4/9) - 8/3 + 2\nf(2/3) = 4/3 - 8/3 + 6/3\nf(2/3) = 2/3\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 is 2/3 when x = 2/3."
