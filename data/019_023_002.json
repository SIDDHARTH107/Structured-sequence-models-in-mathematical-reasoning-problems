    "message_2": "Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic series as a and the common difference as d.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (2a + (n - 1)d)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms.\n\nWe are given that the sum of the first 10 terms is 230 and the sum of the next 10 terms is 330.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can write two equations:\n\n1) 230 = (10 * (2a + (10 - 1)d)) / 2\n2) 330 = (10 * (2(a + 10d) + (10 - 1)d)) / 2\n\nSimplifying the equations:\n\n1) 230 = 5 * (2a + 9d)\n2) 330 = 5 * (2a + 29d)\n\nDividing both sides of the equations by 5:\n\n1) 46 = 2a + 9d\n2) 66 = 2a + 29d\n\nNow we can solve this system of linear equations. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(66 - 46) = (2a + 29d) - (2a + 9d)\n20 = 20d\n\nNow, divide both sides by 20:\n\nd = 1\n\nSo, the common difference of the arithmetic series is 1."
