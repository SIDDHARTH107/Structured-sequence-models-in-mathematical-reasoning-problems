    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the velocity waveform, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the given function v(x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined as:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nIn our case, f(x) = v(x) = 5 + 2 cos(4πx) - 3 sin(2πx). We can rewrite the cosine and sine functions using Euler's formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2\nsin(θ) = (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i)\n\nSo, v(x) = 5 + (e^(4πix) + e^(-4πix)) - (e^(2πix) - e^(-2πix))/(2i)\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform of v(x):\n\nF(k) = ∫[5 + (e^(4πix) + e^(-4πix)) - (e^(2πix) - e^(-2πix))/(2i)] * e^(-2πikx) dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nLet's compute the Fourier transform for each term separately:\n\n1. For the constant term 5:\nF1(k) = ∫[5 * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\nF1(k) = 5 * δ(k), where δ(k) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n2. For the term e^(4πix):\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(4πix) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\nF2(k) = δ(k - 2)\n\n3. For the term e^(-4πix):\nF3(k) = ∫[e^(-4πix) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\nF3(k) = δ(k + 2)\n\n4. For the term e^(2πix):\nF4(k) = ∫[(1/(2i)) * e^(2πix) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\nF4(k) = (1/(2i)) * δ(k - 1)\n\n5. For the term e^(-2πix):\nF5(k) = ∫[(-1/(2i)) * e^(-2πix) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\nF5(k) = (-1/(2i)) * δ(k + 1)\n\nNow, we can combine all the Fourier transforms:\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k) + F3(k) + F4(k) + F5(k)\nF(k) = 5δ(k) + δ(k - 2) + δ(k + 2) + (1/(2i)) * δ(k - 1) - (1/(2i)) * δ(k + 1)\n\nThe frequency components of the velocity waveform are k = 0, ±1, and ±2. The amplitudes of these components are 5, ±1/(2i), and 1, respectively.\n\nTo find the frequency of the maximum velocity, we look for the largest amplitude in the Fourier transform. The largest amplitude is 5, which corresponds to the frequency component k = 0. Therefore, the frequency of the maximum velocity is 0 Hz."
