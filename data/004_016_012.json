    "message_2": "Let's denote the position function of the car as s(t), where s is the distance traveled and t is the time in hours. We are given that s(0) = 0 and s(2) = 200.\n\nThe average speed of the car over the 2-hour interval is given by:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0) = (200 - 0) / 2 = 100 km/h.\n\nNow, we apply the Mean Value Theorem, which states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a number c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function on the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we have a = 0, b = 2, and the average rate of change is 100 km/h. Assuming the position function s(t) is continuous and differentiable on the given interval, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem.\n\nLet s'(t) be the speed of the car at time t. We need to find a time c in the interval (0, 2) such that:\n\ns'(c) = 100 km/h.\n\nSince the average speed of the car over the 2-hour interval is 100 km/h, there must be at least one time c in the interval (0, 2) when the car's speed is exactly 100 km/h, according to the Mean Value Theorem. However, without more information about the position function s(t), we cannot determine the exact value of c."
