    "message_2": "The forced van der Pol oscillator equation is given by:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + ω₀²x(t) = F₀cos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, μ is the damping factor, ω₀ is the natural frequency, F₀ is the forcing amplitude, and ω is the forcing frequency.\n\nIn this problem, we have μ = 0.5, F₀ = 1.2, ω₀ = 2, and ω = 4.\n\nTo find the period of oscillation, we need to find the frequency of the response. The frequency of the response is given by the forcing frequency, which is ω = 4 in this case.\n\nNow, we can find the period of oscillation using the formula:\n\nT = 2π / ω\n\nT = 2π / 4\n\nT = π / 2\n\nSo, the period of oscillation for the forced van der Pol oscillator is π / 2."
