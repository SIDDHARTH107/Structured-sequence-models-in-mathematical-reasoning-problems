She chooses her secret key a=5 and sends Bob A=3^5 mod 17. Bob chooses his secret key b=3 and computes B=3^3 mod 17. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for secure communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute A and B:\n\nA = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 6\nB = 3^3 mod 17 = 27 mod 17 = 10\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using A and B:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key as: K = B^a mod p = 10^5 mod 17 = 100000 mod 17 = 3\nBob computes the shared secret key as: K = A^b mod p = 6^3 mod 17 = 216 mod 17 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for secure communication is 3."
