    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression, we can use the product of powers property, which states that $$a^{m} \\cdot a^{n} = a^{m+n}$$. In this case, our base is 3 and we have:\n\n$$3^{x+2} \\cdot 3^{2x-3} = 3^{(x+2) + (2x-3)}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the exponent:\n\n$$(x+2) + (2x-3) = x + 2 + 2x - 3 = 3x - 1$$\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is:\n\n$$3^{3x-1}$$"
