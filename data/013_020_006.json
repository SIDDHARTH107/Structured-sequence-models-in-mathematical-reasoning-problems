The winner of the game will be the player whose selection is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the selections made. \n\nWhat number should each player select to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "In the Beauty Contest Game, players are expected to think about what other players might choose and adjust their own choices accordingly. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be around 50. So, a player might think to choose 2/3 of 50, which is approximately 33.33.\n\n2. However, if all players think this way and choose around 33.33, the new average would be around 33.33. So, a player might think to choose 2/3 of 33.33, which is approximately 22.22.\n\n3. This process can continue iteratively, with players adjusting their choices based on what they think others will choose. As this process continues, the chosen numbers will converge towards 0.\n\nIn a game with rational players, it's reasonable to expect that the players will go through this thought process and choose a number close to 0 to maximize their chances of winning. However, the exact number to choose depends on how many iterations of this thought process the players believe their opponents will go through. In practice, the optimal choice may vary depending on the specific group of players and their thought processes."
