    "message_2": "This sequence is known as the Fibonacci sequence. The first few terms are:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\n\nTo find the 10th term, we can continue the pattern:\n\n1 (1st term)\n1 (2nd term)\n1 + 1 = 2 (3rd term)\n1 + 2 = 3 (4th term)\n2 + 3 = 5 (5th term)\n3 + 5 = 8 (6th term)\n5 + 8 = 13 (7th term)\n8 + 13 = 21 (8th term)\n13 + 21 = 34 (9th term)\n21 + 34 = 55 (10th term)\n\nSo, the 10th term in the sequence is 55."
