    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess for the eigenvector, v0 = [1, 1, 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current eigenvector guess to get the next eigenvector guess: v1 = A * v0.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector v1.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's perform a few iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nv0 = [1, 1, 1]\nv1 = A * v0 = [[4, -1, 1], [2, 1, 6], [1, -2, -1]] * [1, 1, 1] = [4, 9, -2]\nNormalize v1: v1_norm = [4/11, 9/11, -2/11]\n\nIteration 2:\nv1_norm = [4/11, 9/11, -2/11]\nv2 = A * v1_norm = [[4, -1, 1], [2, 1, 6], [1, -2, -1]] * [4/11, 9/11, -2/11] = [2.1818, 4.3636, -0.5455]\nNormalize v2: v2_norm = [2.1818/5.0000, 4.3636/5.0000, -0.5455/5.0000] = [0.4364, 0.8727, -0.1091]\n\nIteration 3:\nv2_norm = [0.4364, 0.8727, -0.1091]\nv3 = A * v2_norm = [[4, -1, 1], [2, 1, 6], [1, -2, -1]] * [0.4364, 0.8727, -0.1091] = [1.9636, 3.9273, -0.4909]\nNormalize v3: v3_norm = [1.9636/4.4000, 3.9273/4.4000, -0.4909/4.4000] = [0.4463, 0.8925, -0.1116]\n\nWe can see that the eigenvector is converging. To get the largest eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ = (v3_norm^T * A * v3_norm) / (v3_norm^T * v3_norm)\n\nλ = ([0.4463, 0.8925, -0.1116] * [[4, -1, 1], [2, 1, 6], [1, -2, -1]] * [0.4463, 0.8925, -0.1116]) / ([0.4463, 0.8925, -0.1116] * [0.4463, 0.8925, -0.1116])\n\nλ ≈ 5.9994\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is approximately 5.9994, and its corresponding eigenvector is approximately [0.4463, 0.8925, -0.1116]."
