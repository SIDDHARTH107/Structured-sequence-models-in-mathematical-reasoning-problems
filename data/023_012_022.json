    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n.\n\nThe function f(x) is an odd function, which means f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, the cosine terms (a_n) will be zero. We only need to compute a_0 and b_n.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(0)) dx from -π to π\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(0) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nNow, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx)) dx from -π to π\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(1 * sin(nx)) dx from -π to 0 + ∫(-1 * sin(nx)) dx from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(sin(nx)) dx from -π to 0 - ∫(sin(nx)) dx from 0 to π]\n\nNow, integrate sin(nx) with respect to x:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(nx)/n from -π to 0 + cos(nx)/n from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(cos(nπ)/n - cos(0)/n) - (cos(nπ)/n - cos(0)/n)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * (1 - cos(nπ))]\n\nNow we have the Fourier coefficients a_0 and b_n. The Fourier series for the given function f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(nx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) = {1 for -π<x<0, -1 for 0<x<π}."
