    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 7 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (7 cm)²\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 49 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 49 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 12.56636 * 49 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 615.752 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the sphere with a radius of 7 cm is approximately 615.752 cm²."
