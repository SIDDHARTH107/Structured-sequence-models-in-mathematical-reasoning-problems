    "message_1": "A signal processing engineer wants to analyze a sound wave signal of duration 4 seconds. The signal is sampled at 1000 Hz. Using Fourier transform, find the frequency domain representation of the signal for the first 10 harmonics.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the signal using Fourier transform, we need to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the sampled signal. Since the signal is sampled at 1000 Hz and has a duration of 4 seconds, there are 4000 samples in total.\n\nThe DFT of a discrete signal x[n] of length N is given by:\n\nX[k] = Σ (x[n] * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N)), where the summation is from n = 0 to N-1, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn this case, N = 4000.\n\nTo find the first 10 harmonics, we need to compute the DFT for k = 1 to 10. The frequency of each harmonic can be found using the formula:\n\nf_k = k * f_s / N, where f_s is the sampling frequency (1000 Hz in this case).\n\nLet's compute the frequencies of the first 10 harmonics:\n\nf_1 = 1 * 1000 / 4000 = 0.25 Hz\nf_2 = 2 * 1000 / 4000 = 0.5 Hz\nf_3 = 3 * 1000 / 4000 = 0.75 Hz\nf_4 = 4 * 1000 / 4000 = 1 Hz\nf_5 = 5 * 1000 / 4000 = 1.25 Hz\nf_6 = 6 * 1000 / 4000 = 1.5 Hz\nf_7 = 7 * 1000 / 4000 = 1.75 Hz\nf_8 = 8 * 1000 / 4000 = 2 Hz\nf_9 = 9 * 1000 / 4000 = 2.25 Hz\nf_10 = 10 * 1000 / 4000 = 2.5 Hz\n\nNow, to find the DFT coefficients for these harmonics, we need the actual signal x[n]. Since the problem statement does not provide the signal, we cannot compute the exact DFT coefficients. However, the process would involve substituting the values of k (1 to 10) and n (0 to 3999) in the DFT formula and summing the results.\n\nIn summary, the first 10 harmonics have frequencies ranging from 0.25 Hz to 2.5 Hz, with a step of 0.25 Hz. To find the frequency domain representation of the signal for these harmonics, we would need the actual signal to compute the DFT coefficients."
