    "message_2": "To find the sine and cosine values of 120 degrees, we first need to convert the angle to radians. \n\n1 degree = π/180 radians\n\nSo, 120 degrees = (120 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the sine and cosine values. \n\n120 degrees is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive and cosine is negative. We can find the reference angle (the angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis) by subtracting 180 degrees from 120 degrees:\n\n180 - 120 = 60 degrees\n\nNow, we can find the sine and cosine values of the reference angle (60 degrees) and use the signs we determined earlier.\n\nFor 60 degrees (π/3 radians), sine and cosine values are:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(π/3) = √3/2\ncos(60°) = cos(π/3) = 1/2\n\nNow, we apply the signs for the second quadrant:\n\nsin(120°) = √3/2 (positive in the second quadrant)\ncos(120°) = -1/2 (negative in the second quadrant)\n\nSo, the sine and cosine values for 120 degrees are:\n\nsin(120°) = √3/2\ncos(120°) = -1/2"
