    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = [[2, 3, -1], [1, -2, 4], [3, -1, 2]], X = [[x], [y], [z]], and B = [[8], [-1], [10]].\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\nWe'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the matrices L and U.\n\nU = [[2, 3, -1], [0, -3.5, 4.5], [0, 0, 3]]\nL = [[1, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0], [1.5, -1, 1]]\n\nStep 2: Solve L * Y = B for Y\nWe have L = [[1, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0], [1.5, -1, 1]] and B = [[8], [-1], [10]].\n\n1 * y1 = 8 => y1 = 8\n0.5 * y1 + 1 * y2 = -1 => y2 = -1 - 0.5 * 8 = -5\n1.5 * y1 - 1 * y2 + 1 * y3 = 10 => y3 = 10 - 1.5 * 8 + 5 = 1\n\nSo, Y = [[8], [-5], [1]].\n\nStep 3: Solve U * X = Y for X\nWe have U = [[2, 3, -1], [0, -3.5, 4.5], [0, 0, 3]] and Y = [[8], [-5], [1]].\n\n2 * x + 3 * y - 1 * z = 8\n-3.5 * y + 4.5 * z = -5\n3 * z = 1\n\nFrom the last equation, z = 1 / 3.\n\nNow, we can substitute z into the second equation:\n\n-3.5 * y + 4.5 * (1 / 3) = -5\n-3.5 * y + 1.5 = -5\n-3.5 * y = -6.5\ny = -6.5 / -3.5 = 13 / 7\n\nFinally, substitute y and z into the first equation:\n\n2 * x + 3 * (13 / 7) - (1 / 3) = 8\n2 * x + 39 / 7 - 1 / 3 = 8\n2 * x = 8 - 39 / 7 + 1 / 3\n2 * x = (56 - 39 + 7 / 21) / 7\n2 * x = 24 / 7\nx = 12 / 7\n\nSo, the solution is x = 12 / 7, y = 13 / 7, and z = 1 / 3."
