B x A ∩ A x B\n\nWe have already found the Cartesian products and their intersection in the previous step:\n\nB x A = {(4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\nA x B = {(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB x A ∩ A x B = ∅ (empty set)\n\nThe intersection is still an empty set.\n\nNow, let's show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection:\n\nA x B ≠ B x A, as shown by the different elements in the Cartesian products:\n\nA x B = {(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nSince A x B ≠ B x A, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
