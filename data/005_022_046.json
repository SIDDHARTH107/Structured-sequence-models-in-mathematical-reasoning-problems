    "message_2": "The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the 3rd quartile (Q3) and the 1st quartile (Q1). Since we are given the median (Q2) and the 3rd quartile (Q3), we can find the IQR by first finding the 1st quartile (Q1).\n\nIn this dataset, the median (Q2) is 14, which means that the middle value of the dataset is 14. Since there are 20 numbers in the dataset, the middle value is the average of the 10th and 11th values. Therefore, there are 10 values below the median and 10 values above the median.\n\nThe 3rd quartile (Q3) is 18, which means that 75% of the data is below 18. Since there are 20 numbers in the dataset, 75% of 20 is 15. So, the 15th value in the dataset is 18.\n\nTo find the 1st quartile (Q1), we need to find the value that separates the bottom 25% of the data. Since there are 20 numbers in the dataset, 25% of 20 is 5. So, the 5th value in the dataset is the 1st quartile (Q1).\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of Q1. However, we can still express the IQR in terms of Q1.\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\nIQR = 18 - Q1\n\nSo, the interquartile range (IQR) of the dataset is 18 - Q1."
