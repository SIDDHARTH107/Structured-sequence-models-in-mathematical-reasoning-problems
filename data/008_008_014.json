    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has 24 hours of labor and 16 hours of machine time available per day. Product A sells for $5 per unit and Product B sells for $7 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize their daily revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are:\n3x + 2y ≤ 24 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 16 (machine constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the revenue is:\nR = 5x + 7y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 24\ny ≤ (24 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 16\ny ≤ (16 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ (4 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these inequalities, including x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (24 - 3x) / 2 and y = (4 - x) / 2:\n(24 - 3x) / 2 = (4 - x) / 2\n24 - 3x = 4 - x\n2x = 20\nx = 10\n\ny = (4 - 10) / 2\ny = -3 (not feasible since y must be greater than or equal to 0)\n\n2. Intersection of y = (24 - 3x) / 2 and x = 0:\ny = (24 - 3 * 0) / 2\ny = 12\n\n3. Intersection of y = (4 - x) / 2 and x = 0:\ny = (4 - 0) / 2\ny = 2\n\n4. Intersection of y = (4 - x) / 2 and y = 0:\n0 = (4 - x) / 2\nx = 4\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 12), (0, 2), and (4, 0).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function R = 5x + 7y at these corner points:\n\n1. R(0, 12) = 5 * 0 + 7 * 12 = 84\n2. R(0, 2) = 5 * 0 + 7 * 2 = 14\n3. R(4, 0) = 5 * 4 + 7 * 0 = 20\n\nThe maximum revenue is $84, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 12 units of product B."
