    "message_2": "To find the heat flux across the plate in the x-direction, we first need to find the temperature gradient in the x-direction, which is the partial derivative of the temperature distribution function f(x, y) with respect to x. \n\nGiven f(x, y) = 100 * cos(2πx/L) * sin(3πy/L), where L = 0.5 m.\n\nLet's find the partial derivative of f(x, y) with respect to x:\n\n∂f/∂x = -100 * (2π/L) * sin(2πx/L) * sin(3πy/L)\n\nNow, we need to find the heat flux. Heat flux (q) is given by Fourier's law:\n\nq = -k * ∇T\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of the material, and ∇T is the temperature gradient. In this case, we are only interested in the x-direction, so we can write:\n\nqx = -k * (∂f/∂x)\n\nSubstitute the expression for ∂f/∂x:\n\nqx = -k * [-100 * (2π/L) * sin(2πx/L) * sin(3πy/L)]\n\nqx = k * [100 * (2π/L) * sin(2πx/L) * sin(3πy/L)]\n\nSince we don't have the value of the thermal conductivity (k), we can't find the exact value of the heat flux. However, we have the expression for the heat flux in the x-direction:\n\nqx(x, y) = k * [100 * (2π/L) * sin(2πx/L) * sin(3πy/L)]"
