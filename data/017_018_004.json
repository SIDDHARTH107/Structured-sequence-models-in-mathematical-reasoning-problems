    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. To list them all and prove that they are non-isomorphic, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups and the concept of p-groups.\n\nSince 32 = 2^5, we know that all groups of order 32 are 2-groups. The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So, we can classify the abelian groups of order 32 by partitioning the number 5, which gives us the following possibilities:\n\n1. C_32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. C_16 × C_2\n3. C_8 × C_4\n4. C_8 × C_2 × C_2\n5. C_4 × C_4 × C_2\n6. C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n7. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\nThese are all the abelian groups of order 32, and they are non-isomorphic because they have different structures as direct products of cyclic groups.\n\nNow, we need to consider non-abelian groups of order 32. To do this, we can use the concept of p-groups and their properties. A p-group is a group where the order of every element is a power of a prime number p. In our case, p = 2.\n\nFor non-abelian groups of order 32, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The center of a non-abelian p-group is non-trivial.\n2. A non-abelian group of order p^n has a non-trivial center of order p^k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n-1.\n\nUsing these facts, we can analyze the possible structures of non-abelian groups of order 32 by considering their centers. We will have the following cases:\n\n1. Center of order 2: There are 15 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n2. Center of order 4: There are 13 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n3. Center of order 8: There are 10 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n4. Center of order 16: There are 5 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nAdding up the abelian and non-abelian cases, we have a total of 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32.\n\nTo prove that they are non-isomorphic, we can use the following invariants:\n\n1. The order of the center.\n2. The structure of the derived series or the lower central series.\n3. The structure of the abelianization.\n\nBy comparing these invariants for each group, we can show that they are distinct and therefore non-isomorphic."
