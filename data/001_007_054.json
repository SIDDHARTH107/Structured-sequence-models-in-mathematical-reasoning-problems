    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 4 > 5x + 2, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality.\n-4 > 2x + 2\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality.\n-6 > 2x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 2.\n-3 > x\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x < -3."
