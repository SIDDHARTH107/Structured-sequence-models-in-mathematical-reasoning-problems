    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function can be determined by looking at the horizontal shift in the argument of the sine function. In this case, the function is y = 4sin(3x + π/4).\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function with a phase shift is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) or y = A*sin(B(x + C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to rewrite the given function in the general form. We can do this by factoring out the 3 from the argument:\n\ny = 4sin(3(x + π/12))\n\nNow, we can see that the function is in the form y = A*sin(B(x + C)), with A = 4, B = 3, and C = -π/12. The phase shift is -π/12 units, which means the function is shifted π/12 units to the right."
