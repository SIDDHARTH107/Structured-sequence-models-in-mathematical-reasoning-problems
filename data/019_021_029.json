    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for each player, we need to look for any dominant strategies or Nash equilibria.\n\nA dominant strategy is a strategy that is always better than any other strategy, regardless of what the other player chooses. Let's check if there are any dominant strategies for both players.\n\nFor Player A:\n- If Player B chooses 1, A gets the highest payoff by choosing 2 (4 > 2 and 4 > 0).\n- If Player B chooses 2, A gets the highest payoff by choosing 3 (4 > 0 and 4 > 3).\n- If Player B chooses 3, A gets the highest payoff by choosing 1 (4 > 0 and 4 > 2).\n\nThere is no single strategy that is always the best for Player A, so there is no dominant strategy for Player A.\n\nFor Player B:\n- If Player A chooses 1, B gets the highest payoff by choosing 3 (4 > 2 and 4 > 0).\n- If Player A chooses 2, B gets the highest payoff by choosing 1 (4 > 0 and 4 > 3).\n- If Player A chooses 3, B gets the highest payoff by choosing 2 (4 > 0 and 4 > 2).\n\nThere is no single strategy that is always the best for Player B, so there is no dominant strategy for Player B.\n\nSince there are no dominant strategies, we need to look for Nash equilibria. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nLet's check each cell in the table to see if it's a Nash equilibrium:\n\n1. (1,1): If A switches to 2, their payoff increases from 2 to 4. If B switches to 3, their payoff increases from 2 to 4. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n2. (1,2): If A switches to 3, their payoff increases from 0 to 4. B has no incentive to switch. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n3. (1,3): If B switches to 1, their payoff increases from 0 to 4. A has no incentive to switch. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n4. (2,1): If B switches to 3, their payoff increases from 0 to 4. A has no incentive to switch. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n5. (2,2): If A switches to 1, their payoff decreases from 3 to 0. If B switches to 1, their payoff decreases from 3 to 0. So, this is a Nash equilibrium.\n6. (2,3): If A switches to 1, their payoff increases from 0 to 4. B has no incentive to switch. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n7. (3,1): If A switches to 2, their payoff increases from 0 to 4. B has no incentive to switch. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n8. (3,2): If B switches to 3, their payoff increases from 0 to 4. A has no incentive to switch. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n9. (3,3): If A switches to 1, their payoff increases from 2 to 4. If B switches to 1, their payoff increases from 2 to 4. So, this is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe only Nash equilibrium is (2,2), where both players choose 2. In this case, the resulting payoff for both players is (3,3). So, the optimal strategy for each player is to choose 2, and the resulting payoff for both players is 3."
