In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 3, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {1, 7}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is commutative.
