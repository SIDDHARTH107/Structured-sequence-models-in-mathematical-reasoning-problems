    "message_1": "A company wants to construct a rectangular garden with an area of 64 square meters. They plan to use a fence for three sides of the garden while their building will serve as the fourth side. What is the dimensions of the rectangular garden if they want to minimize the amount of fencing used?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be x meters and the width be y meters. The area of the garden is given by the product of its length and width:\n\nx * y = 64\n\nSince the building will serve as one side of the garden, we only need to consider the fencing for the other three sides. The total length of the fencing required is given by:\n\nFencing = x + 2y\n\nWe want to minimize the amount of fencing used. To do this, we can use calculus. First, we need to express y in terms of x using the area equation:\n\ny = 64/x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the fencing equation:\n\nFencing = x + 2(64/x)\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the fencing function by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Fencing)/dx = d(x + 2(64/x))/dx = 1 - 128/x^2\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n1 - 128/x^2 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n128/x^2 = 1\nx^2 = 128\nx = √128 = 8√2\n\nNow, substitute this value of x back into the expression for y:\n\ny = 64/(8√2) = 8/√2\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by √2:\n\ny = (8/√2) * (√2/√2) = 8√2/2 = 4√2\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular garden that minimize the amount of fencing used are x = 8√2 meters and y = 4√2 meters."
