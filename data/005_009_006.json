    "message_2": "To find the median of a dataset using the non-parametric method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order.\n2. Determine the middle value(s).\n\nThe given dataset is already arranged in ascending order:\n{10, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, 42, 50}\n\nSince there are 10 values in the dataset, which is an even number, we need to find the average of the two middle values (the 5th and 6th values).\n\nThe 5th value is 22, and the 6th value is 25.\n\nMedian = (22 + 25) / 2 = 47 / 2 = 23.5\n\nSo, the median of the dataset is 23.5 using the non-parametric method."
