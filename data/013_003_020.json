    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, a player proposes how to divide €10 between themselves and another player. The other player can either accept or reject the proposal. If they accept, the money is divided as proposed. If they reject, neither player receives any money. \n\nIf the proposer offers €4 to the other player, what is the minimum amount that the other player would have to accept in order for an equal (50/50) split to occur?",
    "message_2": "In order for an equal (50/50) split to occur, the proposer would have to offer €5 to the other player. This is because €10 divided by 2 equals €5, so each player would receive an equal share of the money."
