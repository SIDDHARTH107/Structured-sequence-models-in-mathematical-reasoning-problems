    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $3^4 \\div 3^2$, we can use the rule of exponents that states: $a^{m} \\div a^{n} = a^{m-n}$. In this case, $a = 3$, $m = 4$, and $n = 2$. \n\nSo, we have:\n\n$3^4 \\div 3^2 = 3^{4-2} = 3^2$\n\n$3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is $9$."
