    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n3x^2 + 6x = 3x(x + 2)\n\nDenominator:\n12x^3 + 36x^2 = 12x^2(x + 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(3x(x + 2)) / (12x^2(x + 3))\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors:\n\n3x/12x^2 = 1/4x\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(1 * (x + 2)) / (4x * (x + 3))\n\nWhich is:\n\n(x + 2) / (4x(x + 3))"
