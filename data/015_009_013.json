    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent, we first need to linearize the system of differential equations around the trajectory. Let $\\vec{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$, and let $\\vec{f}(\\vec{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x - y \\\\ x + 3y \\end{pmatrix}$. Then, the Jacobian matrix of $\\vec{f}$ is\n\n$$J(\\vec{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nNow, let $\\vec{\\xi} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta x \\\\ \\delta y \\end{pmatrix}$ be the difference vector between two nearby trajectories. The linearized system of differential equations for $\\vec{\\xi}$ is\n\n$$\\frac{d\\vec{\\xi}}{dt} = J(\\vec{x}) \\vec{\\xi}.$$\n\nWe can rewrite this system as\n\n$$\\begin{cases} \\frac{d\\delta x}{dt} = 2\\delta x - \\delta y \\\\ \\frac{d\\delta y}{dt} = \\delta x + 3\\delta y \\end{cases}.$$\n\nNow, let's consider the initial conditions $x_0 = 1$ and $y_0 = 2$. The initial difference vector is $\\vec{\\xi}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\epsilon = 0.01$. We can solve the linearized system of differential equations numerically to obtain the difference vector $\\vec{\\xi}_i$ at time $i$.\n\nHowever, calculating the Lyapunov exponent using the given formula requires taking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. In practice, this is not possible, so we can only approximate the Lyapunov exponent by taking a large enough value of $n$. The formula for the Lyapunov exponent becomes\n\n$$\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln \\frac{\\left|\\left|\\frac{d}{d\\epsilon} \\vec{\\xi}_i\\right|\\right|}{\\epsilon}.$$\n\nTo calculate the Lyapunov exponent, we would need to solve the linearized system of differential equations numerically for a large number of time steps and then compute the sum in the formula. This is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response and would require specialized numerical software.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates that the system is chaotic, while a negative exponent indicates that the system is stable."
