    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. \n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [4-λ 7; 2 5-λ]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (4-λ)(5-λ) - (7)(2) = λ^2 - 9λ + 6\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get the eigenvalues λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n(A - 2I)v1 = 0\n[2 7; 2 3]v1 = 0\nWe can see that the second row is a multiple of the first row, so we only need to consider one equation:\n2x + 7y = 0\nLet x = 1, then y = -2/7. So, v1 = [1; -2/7].\n\nFor λ2 = 3:\n(A - 3I)v2 = 0\n[1 7; 2 2]v2 = 0\nThe second row is a multiple of the first row, so we only need to consider one equation:\nx + 7y = 0\nLet y = 1, then x = -7. So, v2 = [-7; 1].\n\n3. Form the matrices P and D:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the matrices P and D.\n\nP = [v1 v2] = [1 -7; -2/7 1]\nD = [λ1 0; 0 λ2] = [2 0; 0 3]\n\n4. Verify A = PDP^-1:\nTo verify the diagonalization, we need to compute PDP^-1 and check if it is equal to A.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of P (P^-1):\nP^-1 = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = (1/(-5)) * [1 -1; 2/7 1] = [-1/5 1/5; -2/35 -1/5]\n\nNow, compute PDP^-1:\nPDP^-1 = [1 -7; -2/7 1] * [2 0; 0 3] * [-1/5 1/5; -2/35 -1/5]\n       = [1 -7; -2/7 1] * [-2/5 2/5; -6/35 -3/5]\n       = [4 7; 2 5]\n\nSince PDP^-1 = A, the matrix A is diagonalized by the matrices P and D."
