    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rainy day) based on historical data\n- n is the total number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 7 (next 7 days)\n- k = 3 (exactly 3 rainy days)\n- p = 0.4 (40% chance of rain based on historical data)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (7C3) * (0.4^3) * (1-0.4)^(7-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 7C3:\n7C3 = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1) = 35\n\nNow we can plug this back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 35 * (0.4^3) * (0.6^4)\n\nP(X = 3) = 35 * 0.064 * 0.1296\n\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.2916\n\nSo, the probability of it raining exactly 3 out of the next 7 days based on historical data is approximately 29.16%."
