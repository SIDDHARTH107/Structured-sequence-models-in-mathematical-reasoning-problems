    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\n\nz = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\n\nz = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\n\nSince the square root of a negative number involves a complex number, we can rewrite √(-36) as 6i (since 6^2 = 36). So, we have:\n\nz = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify by dividing both parts by 2:\n\nz = -2 ± 3i\n\nSo, the two complex solutions for the equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0 are:\n\nz = -2 + 3i and z = -2 - 3i"
