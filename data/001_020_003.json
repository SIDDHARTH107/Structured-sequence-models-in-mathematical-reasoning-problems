    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |x - 3| = 5, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: (x - 3) is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can directly write the equation as:\nx - 3 = 5\n\nNow, solve for x:\nx = 5 + 3\nx = 8\n\nCase 2: (x - 3) is negative\nIn this case, we can write the equation as:\n-(x - 3) = 5\n\nNow, solve for x:\n-x + 3 = 5\n-x = 5 - 3\n-x = 2\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions to the absolute value equation |x - 3| = 5 are x = 8 and x = -2."
