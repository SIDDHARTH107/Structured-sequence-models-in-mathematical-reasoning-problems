    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor ternary set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor ternary set, at each step, the interval is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle third is removed, leaving 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2). The scaling factor is 3, as each remaining piece is 1/3 the size of the original interval (r = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor ternary set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309"
