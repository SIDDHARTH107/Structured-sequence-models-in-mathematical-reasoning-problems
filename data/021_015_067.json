    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. In this case, we are trying to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 within the range of -10 to 10.\n\nTo apply PSO, we need to define a few parameters:\n\n1. Number of particles (n): This is the number of candidate solutions in the search space. Let's choose n = 20.\n2. Number of iterations (t): This is the number of times the particles will update their positions. Let's choose t = 100.\n3. Cognitive and social coefficients (c1, c2): These are the learning factors that control the balance between exploration and exploitation. Let's choose c1 = c2 = 2.\n4. Inertia weight (w): This controls the balance between global and local search. Let's choose w = 0.7.\n\nNow, let's implement the PSO algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (i.e., the value of f(x) for each particle's position).\n3. Update each particle's personal best position (pBest) if its current fitness is better than its previous pBest.\n4. Update the global best position (gBest) if any particle's pBest is better than the current gBest.\n5. Update the particles' velocities and positions using the following equations:\n\n   v_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * rand() * (pBest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * rand() * (gBest - x_i(t))\n   x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n\n   where v_i(t) is the velocity of particle i at iteration t, x_i(t) is the position of particle i at iteration t, and rand() is a random number between 0 and 1.\n\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for t iterations.\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm with the chosen parameters, we will obtain the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 within the range of -10 to 10. Note that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the result may not be the exact global maximum but an approximation."
