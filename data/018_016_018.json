    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A × B and B × A:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and B, denoted as A ∪ B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∪ B) and (A ∪ B):\n\n(A ∪ B) × (A ∪ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) ≠ (A ∪ B) × (A ∪ B), since the two sets have different elements:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(A ∪ B) × (A ∪ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
