    "message_1": "In a school, it is observed that 70% of students who participate in an afterschool program go on to receive a scholarship for higher education. If there are 150 students in the afterschool program, how many students are likely to receive a scholarship for higher education?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students likely to receive a scholarship for higher education, we can multiply the total number of students in the afterschool program by the percentage of students who receive a scholarship.\n\n150 students * 70% = 150 * 0.7 = 105 students\n\nSo, 105 students are likely to receive a scholarship for higher education."
