Prove that f(z) is a polynomial and determine its degree.\n\nHint: You can apply Liouville's theorem and fundamental theorem of algebra to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial and determine its degree, we can use the given hint and apply Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nFirst, let's consider the function g(z) = f(z) - f(0). This function is also entire since it is the difference of two entire functions. Moreover, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z) - f(0)| ≤ |f(z)| + |f(0)| ≤ 3|z|^2 + 1 + |f(0)|.\n\nNow, let's consider the function h(z) = g(z) / z^2. This function is meromorphic with a removable singularity at z = 0. Thus, we can define h(0) = g'(0) / 2, making h(z) entire.\n\nWe can now find an upper bound for |h(z)|:\n\n|h(z)| = |g(z) / z^2| ≤ (3|z|^2 + 1 + |f(0)|) / |z|^2 = 3 + (1 + |f(0)|) / |z|^2.\n\nAs |z| → ∞, the term (1 + |f(0)|) / |z|^2 approaches 0. Therefore, |h(z)| is bounded for all z ∈ ℂ. By Liouville's theorem, h(z) must be a constant function, say h(z) = C.\n\nNow, we have g(z) = Cz^2, and thus f(z) = Cz^2 + f(0). This shows that f(z) is a polynomial of degree 2."
