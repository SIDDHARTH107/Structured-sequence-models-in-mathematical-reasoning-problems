    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 3 on the interval [0, 5], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, we find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 6x + 8) = 0\n3(x - 2)(x - 4) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nNow, we evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) + 3 = 3\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) + 3 = 8 - 36 + 48 + 3 = 23\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) + 3 = 64 - 144 + 96 + 3 = 19\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 9(5)^2 + 24(5) + 3 = 125 - 225 + 120 + 3 = 23\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value is 23, which occurs at x = 2 and x = 5, and the minimum value is 3, which occurs at x = 0."
