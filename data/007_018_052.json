    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 100, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers with a difference of at least 100.\n\nThe smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 100 occurs between the prime numbers 359 and 463. The difference between these two prime numbers is:\n\n463 - 359 = 104\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 100 is 104."
