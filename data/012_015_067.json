    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 7, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nSince the given graph has 10 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (6), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, just because it has enough edges doesn't guarantee that it is connected.\n\nTo be sure, we need to check the maximum number of edges a disconnected graph with 7 vertices can have. Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph is divided into two disconnected subgraphs. Let one subgraph have k vertices and the other have 7 - k vertices. The maximum number of edges in each subgraph can be calculated using the formula for a complete graph: m = (n * (n - 1)) / 2.\n\nFor the first subgraph with k vertices, the maximum number of edges is (k * (k - 1)) / 2. For the second subgraph with 7 - k vertices, the maximum number of edges is ((7 - k) * (6 - k)) / 2. The total number of edges in the disconnected graph would be the sum of the edges in both subgraphs:\n\nTotal_edges = (k * (k - 1)) / 2 + ((7 - k) * (6 - k)) / 2\n\nTo maximize the number of edges, we can try different values of k (from 1 to 6) and find the maximum value of Total_edges:\n\nk = 1: Total_edges = 0 + 15 = 15\nk = 2: Total_edges = 1 + 10 = 11\nk = 3: Total_edges = 3 + 6 = 9\nk = 4: Total_edges = 6 + 3 = 9\nk = 5: Total_edges = 10 + 1 = 11\nk = 6: Total_edges = 15 + 0 = 15\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a disconnected graph with 7 vertices is 9 (when k = 3 or k = 4).\n\nSince the given graph has 10 edges, which is more than the maximum number of edges possible for a disconnected graph with 7 vertices, we can conclude that the graph is connected."
