    "message_2": "Relevance logic is a non-classical logic system that focuses on the relevance of premises in a logical argument. However, to determine the number of elements that are common to both sets X and Y, we can simply use set theory.\n\nTo find the common elements between sets X and Y, we can find the intersection of the two sets:\n\nX ∩ Y = {x | x ∈ X and x ∈ Y}\n\nComparing the elements in both sets:\n\nX = {2, 3, 4, 5}\nY = {3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nWe can see that the elements 3 and 5 are common to both sets. Therefore, the intersection of sets X and Y is:\n\nX ∩ Y = {3, 5}\n\nThere are 2 elements in the intersection of sets X and Y, so the number of elements that are common to both sets is 2."
