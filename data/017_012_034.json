    "message_2": "A cyclic group of order 16 is generated by a single element, say g, and has elements {e, g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^15}, where e is the identity element.\n\nA subgroup of order 2 must have the identity element and one other element, say x, such that x^2 = e. In a cyclic group, the order of an element divides the order of the group. So, we are looking for elements of order 2 in the cyclic group C16.\n\nLet's consider the powers of g:\n\n- g^1 has order 16 (since it generates the whole group)\n- g^2 has order 8 (since (g^2)^8 = g^16 = e)\n- g^3 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 3k is divisible by 16)\n- g^4 has order 4 (since (g^4)^4 = g^16 = e)\n- g^5 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 5k is divisible by 16)\n- g^6 has order 8 (since (g^6)^8 = g^48 = e)\n- g^7 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 7k is divisible by 16)\n- g^8 has order 2 (since (g^8)^2 = g^16 = e)\n- g^9 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 9k is divisible by 16)\n- g^10 has order 8 (since (g^10)^8 = g^80 = e)\n- g^11 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 11k is divisible by 16)\n- g^12 has order 4 (since (g^12)^4 = g^48 = e)\n- g^13 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 13k is divisible by 16)\n- g^14 has order 8 (since (g^14)^8 = g^112 = e)\n- g^15 has order 16 (since it is the smallest power k such that 15k is divisible by 16)\n\nFrom the list above, we see that there is only one element of order 2, which is g^8. Therefore, there is only one subgroup of order 2 in the cyclic group C16, and it is {e, g^8}."
