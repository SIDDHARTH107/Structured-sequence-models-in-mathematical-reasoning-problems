    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of vertices that can form a complete subgraph (clique) in G, we can use the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph:\n\nNumber of edges = n(n-1)/2\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices in the complete graph.\n\nWe want to find the largest n such that the number of edges in the complete graph is less than or equal to 12.\n\nn(n-1)/2 <= 12\n\nn(n-1) <= 24\n\nWe can now test different values of n to find the largest one that satisfies this inequality:\n\nFor n = 2: 2(2-1) = 2 <= 24 (True)\nFor n = 3: 3(3-1) = 6 <= 24 (True)\nFor n = 4: 4(4-1) = 12 <= 24 (True)\nFor n = 5: 5(5-1) = 20 <= 24 (True)\nFor n = 6: 6(6-1) = 30 > 24 (False)\n\nSo, the maximum number of vertices that can form a complete subgraph (clique) in G is 5."
