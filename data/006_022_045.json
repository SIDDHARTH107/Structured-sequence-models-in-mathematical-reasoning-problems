    "message_1": "In a school of 500 students, 60% are in the science stream and 40% are in the arts stream. Out of the science students, 75% attend college, while out of the arts students, only 60% attend college. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from the school attends college and is from the science stream?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many students are in the science stream and how many are in the arts stream.\n\nScience students: 60% of 500 = 0.60 * 500 = 300 students\nArts students: 40% of 500 = 0.40 * 500 = 200 students\n\nNow, let's find out how many students from each stream attend college.\n\nScience students attending college: 75% of 300 = 0.75 * 300 = 225 students\nArts students attending college: 60% of 200 = 0.60 * 200 = 120 students\n\nWe are interested in the probability that a randomly selected student attends college and is from the science stream. There are 225 students who fit this description.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n(Number of science students attending college) / (Total number of students) = 225 / 500 = 0.45 or 45%"
