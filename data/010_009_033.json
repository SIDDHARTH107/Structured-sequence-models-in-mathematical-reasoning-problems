    "message_2": "In a 2D triangulation of a polygon, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn this case, we have 12 vertices (V = 12) and 11 faces (10 triangles + 1 outer face, F = 11). Plugging these values into Euler's formula, we get:\n\n12 - E + 11 = 2\n\nSolving for E, we find:\n\nE = 12 + 11 - 2 = 21\n\nSo the minimum number of edges that this triangulation can have is 21."
