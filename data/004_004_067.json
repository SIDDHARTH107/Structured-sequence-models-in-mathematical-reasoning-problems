    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x² + 1 between x = 2 and x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = x² + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\n∫(x² + 1) dx = (x³/3) + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral at the given limits, x = 2 and x = 5:\n\nArea = [(5³/3) + 5 - (2³/3) - 2]\n\nArea = [(125/3) + 5 - (8/3) - 2]\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nArea = (117/3) + 3\n\nArea = 39 + 3\n\nArea = 42\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x² + 1 between x = 2 and x = 5 is 42 square units."
