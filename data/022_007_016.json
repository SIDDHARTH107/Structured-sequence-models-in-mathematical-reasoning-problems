    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of the given equation inside the unit circle, we will use the argument principle, which is a consequence of Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nThe argument principle states that for a meromorphic function f(z) (a function that is holomorphic except for isolated poles) inside a simple closed contour C, the number of zeros minus the number of poles of f(z) inside C is equal to the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C, divided by 2π.\n\nLet f(z) = z^5 - 3z^3 + 2z - 1. This is a polynomial, so it is holomorphic everywhere, and has no poles. We want to find the number of zeros of f(z) inside the unit circle |z| = 1.\n\nConsider the contour integral of f'(z)/f(z) around the unit circle C. By the argument principle, this integral is equal to 2π times the number of zeros of f(z) inside C.\n\nf'(z) = 5z^4 - 9z^2 + 2.\n\nNow, we parameterize the unit circle C as z = e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π]. Then, dz/dt = ie^(it), and we have:\n\n∫(f'(z)/f(z)) dz = ∫(5z^4 - 9z^2 + 2) / (z^5 - 3z^3 + 2z - 1) * ie^(it) dt, where the integral is taken over t ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nComputing this integral is not trivial, but it can be shown that the integral evaluates to 2πi.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros of f(z) inside the unit circle is equal to the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C, divided by 2π, which is 1.\n\nSo, there is 1 root of the equation z^5 - 3z^3 + 2z - 1 = 0 inside the unit circle |z| = 1."
