The signal is costless and reveals Player 1's type, which is either Strong (S) or Weak (W) with equal probability. \n\nPlayer 2 then chooses either a high effort (H) or a low effort (L), and incurs a cost of 2 for high effort and 1 for low effort. Player 2's payoff is 4 if he chooses the same effort as Player 1's type and 0 otherwise. \n\nCalculate the expected payoff for Player 2 when he chooses high effort.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for Player 2 when he chooses high effort, we need to consider the probabilities of Player 1's type and signal. Since Player 1's type is either Strong (S) or Weak (W) with equal probability, and he chooses either a high signal (H) or a low signal (L) with equal probability, we can create a table to represent the possible outcomes:\n\n| Player 1's Type | Player 1's Signal | Probability |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Strong (S)      | High (H)          | 1/4         |\n| Strong (S)      | Low (L)           | 1/4         |\n| Weak (W)        | High (H)          | 1/4         |\n| Weak (W)        | Low (L)           | 1/4         |\n\nNow, let's calculate the payoff for Player 2 when he chooses high effort (H) for each of these scenarios:\n\n1. Player 1's type is Strong (S) and signal is High (H):\n   - Player 2's payoff: 4 (since he chose the same effort as Player 1's type)\n   - Probability: 1/4\n   - Expected payoff: 4 * (1/4) = 1\n\n2. Player 1's type is Strong (S) and signal is Low (L):\n   - Player 2's payoff: 4 (since he chose the same effort as Player 1's type)\n   - Probability: 1/4\n   - Expected payoff: 4 * (1/4) = 1\n\n3. Player 1's type is Weak (W) and signal is High (H):\n   - Player 2's payoff: 0 (since he chose a different effort than Player 1's type)\n   - Probability: 1/4\n   - Expected payoff: 0 * (1/4) = 0\n\n4. Player 1's type is Weak (W) and signal is Low (L):\n   - Player 2's payoff: 0 (since he chose a different effort than Player 1's type)\n   - Probability: 1/4\n   - Expected payoff: 0 * (1/4) = 0\n\nNow, we can sum up the expected payoffs for each scenario:\n\nTotal expected payoff = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\n\nHowever, we must also consider the cost of choosing high effort, which is 2. Therefore, the net expected payoff for Player 2 when he chooses high effort is:\n\nNet expected payoff = Total expected payoff - Cost = 2 - 2 = 0"
