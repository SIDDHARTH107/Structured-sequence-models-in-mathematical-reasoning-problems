    "message_2": "The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal that is formed by iteratively removing triangles from an initial equilateral triangle. In the sieve method, at each iteration, we remove the middle triangle of each remaining triangle, effectively dividing each triangle into 3 smaller triangles.\n\nThe number of closed triangles (triangles that are not removed) after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nClosed triangles = (3^n - 1) / 2\n\nFor the 8th iteration:\n\nClosed triangles = (3^8 - 1) / 2\nClosed triangles = (6561 - 1) / 2\nClosed triangles = 6560 / 2\nClosed triangles = 3280\n\nSo, after the 8th iteration of constructing the Sierpinski triangle using the sieve method, there will be 3280 closed triangles."
