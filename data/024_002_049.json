    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere with radius 3 units, passing through two polar opposite points, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. Geodesics on a sphere are the shortest paths between two points, and they lie on great circles.\n\nLet's consider a sphere with radius 3 units and two polar opposite points A and B. Since A and B are polar opposite points, the line segment connecting them passes through the center of the sphere, and its length is equal to twice the radius (6 units).\n\nTo find the geodesics passing through A and B, we need to find all the great circles that contain both A and B. Since the plane of a great circle must pass through the center of the sphere, we can think of these great circles as being formed by rotating the plane containing A, B, and the center of the sphere around the line segment connecting A and B.\n\nThere are infinitely many great circles that pass through A and B, as we can rotate the plane in any angle around the line segment connecting A and B. Each of these great circles represents a geodesic on the surface of the sphere passing through the two polar opposite points A and B.\n\nIn summary, there are infinitely many geodesics on the surface of a sphere with radius 3 units, passing through two polar opposite points on its surface. These geodesics are the great circles containing the two points and can be found by rotating the plane containing the points and the center of the sphere around the line segment connecting the points."
