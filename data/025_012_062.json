    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points P(3,5) and Q(6,8), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) of the line. The slope can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the coordinates of points P and Q:\n\nm = (8 - 5) / (6 - 3) = 3 / 3 = 1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point P or Q to find the equation of the line. We'll use point P(3,5):\n\ny - 5 = 1(x - 3)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ny - 5 = x - 3\n\ny = x + 2\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points P(3,5) and Q(6,8) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3 over the field of real numbers is y = x + 2."
