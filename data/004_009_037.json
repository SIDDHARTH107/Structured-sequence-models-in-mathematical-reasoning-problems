    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^3 + 5x) * (x^2 - 3x) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^3 + 5x\nv(x) = x^2 - 3x\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^3 + 5x)/dx = 6x^2 + 5\nv'(x) = d(x^2 - 3x)/dx = 2x - 3\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we can plug in our expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (6x^2 + 5)(x^2 - 3x) + (2x^3 + 5x)(2x - 3)\n\nNow, we can distribute and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^4 - 18x^3 + 5x^2 - 15x + 4x^4 - 6x^3 + 10x^2 - 15x\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 10x^4 - 24x^3 + 15x^2 - 30x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (2x^3 + 5x) * (x^2 - 3x) using the product rule is:\n\nf'(x) = 10x^4 - 24x^3 + 15x^2 - 30x"
