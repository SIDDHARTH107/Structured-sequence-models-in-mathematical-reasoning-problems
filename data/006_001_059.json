    "message_2": "To find the probability of flipping a fair coin three times and getting exactly two heads in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes. There are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT). \n\nNow, let's identify the outcomes with exactly two heads in a row:\n- HHT\n- THH\n\nThere are 2 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads in a row when flipping a fair coin three times is:\n\nP(exactly two heads in a row) = (favorable outcomes) / (total outcomes) = 2/8 = 1/4 or 0.25 (25%)."
