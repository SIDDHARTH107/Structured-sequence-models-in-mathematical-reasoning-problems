    "message_2": "To find the number of points (x, y) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 7 over the finite field of order 29, we will use the following approach:\n\n1. Initialize a counter variable to store the number of points.\n2. Iterate through all possible x values (0 to 28) in the finite field of order 29.\n3. For each x value, calculate the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 3x + 7) modulo 29.\n4. Check if there exists a y value in the finite field such that y^2 is congruent to the calculated value modulo 29. If yes, increment the counter by 2 (since there will be two y values for each valid x value).\n5. After iterating through all x values, add 1 to the counter to account for the point at infinity.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the counter variable: points = 0\n2. Iterate through x values from 0 to 28:\n\nFor x = 0 to 28, calculate the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 3x + 7) modulo 29:\n\nx = 0: (0^3 + 3*0 + 7) % 29 = 7\nx = 1: (1^3 + 3*1 + 7) % 29 = 11\nx = 2: (2^3 + 3*2 + 7) % 29 = 25\n...\nx = 28: (28^3 + 3*28 + 7) % 29 = 24\n\n3. Check for y values:\n\nFor each calculated value, check if there exists a y value in the finite field such that y^2 is congruent to the calculated value modulo 29:\n\nx = 0: 7 -> y = 10, 19 (2 points)\nx = 1: 11 -> y = 5, 24 (2 points)\nx = 2: 25 -> y = 7, 22 (2 points)\n...\nx = 28: 24 -> y = 6, 23 (2 points)\n\n4. Increment the counter:\n\nFor each valid x value, we found 2 y values, so increment the counter by 2:\n\npoints = 0 + 2*(number of valid x values) = 0 + 2*29 = 58\n\n5. Add the point at infinity:\n\npoints = 58 + 1 = 59\n\nSo, there are 59 points (x, y) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 7 over the finite field of order 29."
