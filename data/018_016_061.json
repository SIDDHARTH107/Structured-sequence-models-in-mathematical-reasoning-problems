    "message_2": "1. A × B ∪ B × A\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nA × B ∪ B × A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n2.

This means that the union of the Cartesian products A × B and B × A is commutative, i.e., A × B ∪ B × A = B × A ∪ A × B. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product itself is commutative, as A × B ≠ B × A in general."
