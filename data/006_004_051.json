    "message_1": "A carnival game involves spinning a wheel that is divided into 10 equal sections, with each section numbered from 1 to 10. If you pay $2 to play the game and you win $10 if the wheel lands on 7 or 8, what is the probability of winning?",
    "message_2": "There are 10 equal sections on the wheel, and you win if the wheel lands on either 7 or 8. There are 2 winning sections (7 and 8) out of the 10 total sections. Therefore, the probability of winning is:\n\n2 winning sections / 10 total sections = 1/5 or 0.2\n\nSo, the probability of winning is 0.2 or 20%."
