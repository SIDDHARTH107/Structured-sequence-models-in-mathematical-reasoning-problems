    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation sqrt(2x - 1) - 3 = 0, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nAdd 3 to both sides of the equation:\nsqrt(2x - 1) = 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(sqrt(2x - 1))^2 = 3^2\n2x - 1 = 9\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 1 to both sides of the equation:\n2x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5."
