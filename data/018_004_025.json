    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement of set A is unique according to the principles of set theory. \n\nProof:\n\nLet B and C be two complements of set A in the universal set U. By definition of complement, we have:\n\n1. B ∪ A = U and B ∩ A = Ø\n2. C ∪ A = U and C ∩ A = Ø\n\nNow, we want to show that B = C.\n\nTo prove that two sets are equal, we need to show that B ⊆ C and C ⊆ B.\n\nFirst, let's show that B ⊆ C:\n\nTake any element x ∈ B. Since B ∪ A = U, x must either be in A or not in A. Since x ∈ B and B ∩ A = Ø, x cannot be in A. Therefore, x must be in the complement of A, which is also C (since C ∪ A = U and C ∩ A = Ø). So, x ∈ C. Since x was an arbitrary element of B, we have shown that B ⊆ C.\n\nNow, let's show that C ⊆ B:\n\nTake any element x ∈ C. Since C ∪ A = U, x must either be in A or not in A. Since x ∈ C and C ∩ A = Ø, x cannot be in A. Therefore, x must be in the complement of A, which is also B (since B ∪ A = U and B ∩ A = Ø). So, x ∈ B. Since x was an arbitrary element of C, we have shown that C ⊆ B.\n\nSince B ⊆ C and C ⊆ B, we can conclude that B = C. This proves that the complement of set A is unique."
