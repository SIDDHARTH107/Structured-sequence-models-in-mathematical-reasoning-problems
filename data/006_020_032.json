    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nIn this case, let A be the event of a household having a cat, and B be the event of a household having a dog. We are given that P(A) = 0.4 and P(A ∩ B) = 0.15. We want to find P(neither A nor B), which is equal to 1 - P(A ∪ B).\n\nFirst, we need to find P(B). We know that there are 200 households, and 40% of them have cats, which means 80 households have cats (0.4 * 200 = 80). Since 15% of the households have both a cat and a dog, there are 30 households with both (0.15 * 200 = 30). Therefore, there are 50 households with only cats (80 - 30 = 50).\n\nSince each household has either a cat or a dog or both, the remaining households must have dogs. There are 200 - 80 = 120 households with dogs. Out of these, 30 households have both a cat and a dog, so there are 90 households with only dogs (120 - 30 = 90).\n\nNow we can find P(B), which is the probability of a household having a dog:\n\nP(B) = (number of households with only dogs + number of households with both a cat and a dog) / total number of households\nP(B) = (90 + 30) / 200 = 120 / 200 = 0.6\n\nNow we can find P(A ∪ B):\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.4 + 0.6 - 0.15 = 0.85\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of a household having neither a cat nor a dog:\n\nP(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A ∪ B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected household has neither a cat nor a dog is 0.15 or 15%."
