    "message_1": "A paraconsistent logic system called LP allows for the existence of both true and false contradictions. \n\nSuppose we have two propositions, p and q, such that p is both true and false, and q is both true and false in a LP system. Determine whether the following proposition is true, false or paradoxical: \n\n(p AND NOT p) OR (q AND NOT q)",
    "message_2": "In the LP system, we have two propositions p and q, both of which are true and false. Let's analyze the given proposition step by step:\n\n1. (p AND NOT p): Since p is both true and false, NOT p is also both true and false. Therefore, this part of the proposition is a contradiction, as it is both true and false.\n\n2. (q AND NOT q): Similarly, since q is both true and false, NOT q is also both true and false. This part of the proposition is also a contradiction, as it is both true and false.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(Contradiction) OR (Contradiction)\n\nIn the LP system, when we have an OR operation, the resulting proposition is true if at least one of the propositions is true. In this case, both contradictions are true (and false), so the overall proposition is true (and false).\n\nTherefore, the given proposition is paradoxical, as it is both true and false in the LP system."
