    "message_2": "To find the decision tree complexity of the given Boolean function, we need to find the minimum number of nodes in a decision tree that can compute the function. The decision tree complexity is the minimum number of nodes in the tree.\n\nBoolean function: f(x1, x2, x3) = (x1 and x2) or (not x2 and x3)\n\nWe can construct a decision tree for this function as follows:\n\n1. Start with the root node, which will be a decision node for x2.\n2. If x2 is True, we need to check x1. Create a decision node for x1.\n   a. If x1 is True, the function evaluates to True. Create a leaf node with value True.\n   b. If x1 is False, the function evaluates to False. Create a leaf node with value False.\n3. If x2 is False, we need to check x3. Create a decision node for x3.\n   a. If x3 is True, the function evaluates to True. Create a leaf node with value True.\n   b. If x3 is False, the function evaluates to False. Create a leaf node with value False.\n\nThe decision tree looks like this:\n\n       x2\n      /  \\\n    x1    x3\n   /  \\  /  \\\n  T  F  T  F\n\nThe decision tree complexity is the number of nodes in the tree, which is 7 in this case."
