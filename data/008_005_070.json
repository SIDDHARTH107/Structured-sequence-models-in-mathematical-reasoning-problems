    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 2 -4  3 | -7 |\n| 1  1  2 |  4 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to have a 1 in the top-left corner.\n\n| 1  1  2 |  4 |\n| 2 -4  3 | -7 |\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n| 1  1  2 |  4 |\n| 0 -6 -1 | -15 |\n| 0 -1 -7 | -7 |\n\nStep 3: Swap Row 2 and Row 3 to have a non-zero value in the second row and second column.\n\n| 1  1  2 |  4 |\n| 0 -1 -7 | -7 |\n| 0 -6 -1 | -15 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the -6 in the second column below the -1.\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 6 * Row 2\n\n| 1  1  2 |  4 |\n| 0 -1 -7 | -7 |\n| 0  0 -43 | -57 |\n\nStep 5: Normalize the third row.\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 / -43\n\n| 1  1  2 |  4 |\n| 0 -1 -7 | -7 |\n| 0  0  1 |  4/3 |\n\nStep 6: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom Row 3: z = 4/3\n\nSubstitute z into Row 2:\n-1 * y - 7 * (4/3) = -7\ny = 1\n\nSubstitute y and z into Row 1:\nx + 1 + 2 * (4/3) = 4\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1, y = 1, and z = 4/3."
