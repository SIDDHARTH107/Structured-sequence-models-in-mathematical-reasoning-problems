    "message_2": "To find the minimum weight of the beam that can support a load of 5000 N in the vertical direction, we first need to determine the stress the beam will experience. The stress (σ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ = F/A\n\nwhere F is the force (5000 N) and A is the cross-sectional area of the beam. The cross-sectional area of the beam is:\n\nA = width × height = 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm² = 0.005 m² (converted to meters)\n\nNow we can calculate the stress:\n\nσ = 5000 N / 0.005 m² = 1,000,000 N/m² = 1 MPa (MegaPascal)\n\nNext, we need to consider the material properties of steel. The yield strength of steel is typically around 250 MPa. This means that the stress experienced by the beam should not exceed this value. Since the calculated stress (1 MPa) is well below the yield strength of steel, the beam can support the load without any issues.\n\nNow, let's find the weight of the beam. The volume of the beam can be calculated as:\n\nVolume = width × height × length = 10 cm × 5 cm × 100 cm = 5000 cm³ = 0.005 m³ (converted to meters)\n\nThe density of steel is approximately 7850 kg/m³. The mass of the beam can be calculated as:\n\nMass = density × volume = 7850 kg/m³ × 0.005 m³ = 39.25 kg\n\nFinally, we can calculate the weight of the beam using the gravitational force:\n\nWeight = mass × gravity = 39.25 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 384.8025 N\n\nSo, the minimum weight of the beam is approximately 384.8 N.\n\nAs for the topological optimization, it is a complex computational process that requires specialized software to determine the optimal distribution of material within the beam. The goal of topological optimization is to minimize the weight of the structure while maintaining its structural integrity and performance. The result would be a beam with a more efficient distribution of material, potentially reducing the weight further. However, providing a specific optimized design is beyond the scope of this response."
