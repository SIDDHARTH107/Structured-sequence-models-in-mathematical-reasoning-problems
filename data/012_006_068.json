    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once. To determine if there is a Hamiltonian path in the given graph, we can try to construct a path that visits each vertex once.\n\nLet's start with vertex A. We can follow the path A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> I -> J -> K -> L -> M -> N -> O -> P -> Q -> R -> S -> T -> U -> V -> W -> X -> Y -> Z.\n\nSo, yes, it is possible to find a Hamiltonian path in this graph. The sequence of vertices visited is:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z."
