    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we need to eliminate one of the variables by adding or subtracting the equations. In this case, we will eliminate the y variable.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 2. This will give us:\n\n4(x - 2y) = 4(4)\n2(3x + 4y) = 2(7)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4x - 8y = 16\n6x + 8y = 14\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x - 8y) + (6x + 8y) = 16 + 14\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n10x = 30\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 10:\n\nx = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n3 - 2y = 4\n\nNow, we'll isolate y:\n\n-2y = 1\n\nNext, we'll divide by -2:\n\ny = -0.5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3 and y = -0.5."
