    "message_2": "Let P(t) represent the proposition \"a can of soda is dispensed at time t.\" We want to express that every 2 minutes (120 seconds), 6 cans of soda are dispensed. We can write this using temporal logic as follows:\n\n∀t : (t mod 120 = 0) → (P(t) ∧ P(t+20) ∧ P(t+40) ∧ P(t+60) ∧ P(t+80) ∧ P(t+100))"
