    "message_2": "To find the sum of all complex roots of the polynomial, we can use Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form:\n\n$az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d = 0$\n\nThe sum of the roots is given by:\n\n$-\\frac{b}{a}$\n\nIn this case, the polynomial is:\n\n$f(z) = z^3 + z^2 + 2z + 1$\n\nSo, $a = 1$ and $b = 1$. Therefore, the sum of all complex roots is:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{1} = -1$"
