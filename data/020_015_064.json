    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular field be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 40 meters of fencing material, we can write the equation as:\n\n40 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for W:\n\nW = (40 - 2L) / 2\nW = 20 - L\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for W from above:\n\nArea = L * (20 - L)\n\nNow, we have the area as a function of L:\n\nArea(L) = 20L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area function with respect to L and setting it to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 20 - 2L\n\nSetting the derivative to 0:\n\n0 = 20 - 2L\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 20\nL = 10\n\nNow, we can find the width W using the expression we found earlier:\n\nW = 20 - L\nW = 20 - 10\nW = 10\n\nSo, the dimensions of the field that has the maximum area are 10 meters by 10 meters."
