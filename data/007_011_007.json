    "message_2": "Given that a^2 ≡ 1 (mod p), we can write a^2 - 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). Now, we can factor the left side of the equation as (a + 1)(a - 1) ≡ 0 (mod p).\n\nSince p is a prime number and does not divide a, it also does not divide (a - 1) or (a + 1). According to the definition of prime numbers, if p divides a product of two integers, then it must divide at least one of the factors. In this case, we have p dividing the product (a + 1)(a - 1).\n\nThus, we can conclude that either p divides (a - 1) or p divides (a + 1). In other words, either a ≡ 1 (mod p) or a ≡ -1 (mod p)."
