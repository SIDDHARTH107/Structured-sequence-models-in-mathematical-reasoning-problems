    "message_2": "To find the steady-state error of the system under a unit step input using Fourier transform, we first need to find the transfer function of the system. The given differential equation is:\n\ny'' + 4y' + 4y = u(t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\n\n(jω)^2 Y(jω) + 4(jω) Y(jω) + 4 Y(jω) = U(jω)\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(jω) by dividing Y(jω) by U(jω):\n\nH(jω) = Y(jω) / U(jω) = 1 / [(jω)^2 + 4(jω) + 4]\n\nThe unit step input in the time domain is u(t) = 1 for t ≥ 0. Its Fourier transform is:\n\nU(jω) = 1 / (jω) + πδ(ω)\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can find the output Y(jω) in the frequency domain by multiplying the transfer function H(jω) with the input U(jω):\n\nY(jω) = H(jω) * U(jω) = (1 / [(jω)^2 + 4(jω) + 4]) * (1 / (jω) + πδ(ω))\n\nTo find the steady-state error, we need to find the steady-state output y_ss(t) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω):\n\ny_ss(t) = F^(-1)[Y(jω)]\n\nThe steady-state error e_ss(t) is the difference between the unit step input and the steady-state output:\n\ne_ss(t) = u(t) - y_ss(t)\n\nSince we are interested in the steady-state error, we need to find the value of e_ss(t) as t → ∞. In this case, the steady-state error will be the difference between the final value of the unit step input (which is 1) and the final value of the steady-state output y_ss(t):\n\ne_ss = lim (t → ∞) [1 - y_ss(t)]\n\nUnfortunately, finding the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω) analytically is quite challenging. However, we can use numerical methods (e.g., MATLAB or Python) to compute the inverse Fourier transform and find the steady-state error."
