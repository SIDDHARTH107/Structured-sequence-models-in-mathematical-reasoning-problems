    "message_2": "To find the transfer function, we first take the Laplace transform of the given equation of motion. The Laplace transform of the second derivative is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}\\} = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)$$\n\nThe Laplace transform of the first derivative is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\} = sY(s) - y(0)$$\n\nThe Laplace transform of the input function $u(t)$ is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\{2u(t)\\} = 2U(s)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these Laplace transforms into the equation of motion:\n\n$$(s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)) + 4(sY(s) - y(0)) + 3Y(s) = 2U(s)$$\n\nAssuming zero initial conditions, i.e., $y(0) = y'(0) = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$$(s^2 + 4s + 3)Y(s) = 2U(s)$$\n\nNow we can find the transfer function, which is the ratio of the output $Y(s)$ to the input $U(s)$:\n\n$$H(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4s + 3}$$\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function. The poles are the roots of the denominator:\n\n$$s^2 + 4s + 3 = 0$$\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n$$(s + 3)(s + 1) = 0$$\n\nThe poles are $s = -3$ and $s = -1$. Since both poles have negative real parts, the system is stable.\n\nNow, let's find the response of the system to the input signal $u(t) = \\sin(2t) + \\cos(3t)$. We first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal:\n\n$$U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(2t) + \\cos(3t)\\} = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4} + \\frac{s}{s^2 + 9}$$\n\nNow, we can find the output $Y(s)$ by multiplying the transfer function $H(s)$ with the input $U(s)$:\n\n$$Y(s) = H(s)U(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2 + 4s + 3}\\left(\\frac{2}{s^2 + 4} + \\frac{s}{s^2 + 9}\\right)$$\n\nTo find the output in the time domain, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. However, this is a complex calculation and is not necessary to determine the stability of the system. Since we have already determined that the system is stable based on the poles of the transfer function, we can conclude that the system will remain stable for the given input signal $u(t) = \\sin(2t) + \\cos(3t)$."
