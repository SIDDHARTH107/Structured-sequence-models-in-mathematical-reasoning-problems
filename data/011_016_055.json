    "message_1": "A teacher wants to divide their class of 20 students into groups of 4 for a project. How many different ways can the teacher form these groups using a combinatorial design?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (20 in this case), k is the number of students in each group (4 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to form the first group of 4 students:\n\nC(20, 4) = 20! / (4!(20-4)!) = 20! / (4!16!) = 4845\n\nNow, we have 16 students left. We need to find the number of ways to form the second group of 4 students:\n\nC(16, 4) = 16! / (4!(16-4)!) = 16! / (4!12!) = 1820\n\nNow, we have 12 students left. We need to find the number of ways to form the third group of 4 students:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!) = 12! / (4!8!) = 495\n\nNow, we have 8 students left. We need to find the number of ways to form the fourth group of 4 students:\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 8! / (4!4!) = 70\n\nNow, we have 4 students left, and they will form the last group.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form all the groups, we need to multiply the number of ways for each group:\n\nTotal ways = 4845 × 1820 × 495 × 70 = 12,367,965,900\n\nHowever, since the order of the groups does not matter, we need to divide the total ways by the number of ways to arrange the 5 groups, which is 5!:\n\nFinal answer = 12,367,965,900 / 5! = 12,367,965,900 / 120 = 103,066,383"
