    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the closed disk {|z| ≤ 2}, we first rewrite f(z) in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then,\n\nf(z) = (x + yi)^2 - 2(x + yi) + 2\n     = (x^2 - 2x + 2) + (2xy - 2y)i\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = √((x^2 - 2x + 2)^2 + (2xy - 2y)^2)\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum value of |f(z)| on a closed, bounded region in the complex plane occurs on the boundary of the region. In this case, the boundary is the circle |z| = 2.\n\nOn the boundary, we have |z| = 2, so x^2 + y^2 = 4. We can use this equation to eliminate one of the variables in the expression for |f(z)|. Let's eliminate y:\n\ny^2 = 4 - x^2\n\nSubstitute this into the expression for |f(z)|:\n\n|f(z)| = √((x^2 - 2x + 2)^2 + (2x(2 - x) - 2(2 - x))^2)\n\nNow, we can find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| by finding the critical points of this expression with respect to x. To do this, we can take the derivative of |f(z)| with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd|f(z)|/dx = 0\n\nHowever, taking the derivative of the square root function can be quite complicated. Instead, we can consider the square of the magnitude, |f(z)|^2, which will have the same critical points as |f(z)|:\n\n|f(z)|^2 = (x^2 - 2x + 2)^2 + (2x(2 - x) - 2(2 - x))^2\n\nNow, we can take the derivative of |f(z)|^2 with respect to x:\n\nd|f(z)|^2/dx = 0\n\nSolving this equation for x will give us the critical points of |f(z)|^2, and hence |f(z)|, on the boundary of the region. Once we have these critical points, we can plug them back into the expression for |f(z)| to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the closed disk {|z| ≤ 2} in the complex plane."
