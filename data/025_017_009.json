    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the given elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need to perform a series of transformations to remove any rational 2-torsion and 3-torsion points, and then scale the coefficients to make them integers with no common factors.\n\nFirst, let's check for rational 2-torsion points. These are points where $y = 0$. In this case, we have:\n\n$0 = x^3 + 3x + 1 \\Rightarrow x^3 = -3x - 1$\n\nSince the cubic polynomial on the right-hand side has no rational roots (by the Rational Root Theorem), there are no rational 2-torsion points. Therefore, no transformation is needed for 2-torsion points.\n\nNext, let's check for rational 3-torsion points. These are points where the derivative of the right-hand side of the equation with respect to $x$ is zero:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + 3x + 1) = 3x^2 + 3$\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$3x^2 + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = -1$\n\nSince there are no rational solutions to this equation, there are no rational 3-torsion points. Therefore, no transformation is needed for 3-torsion points.\n\nSince no transformations are needed for 2-torsion or 3-torsion points, the given elliptic curve is already a minimal model:\n\n$E_{min}: y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$"
