    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series expansion of the given function, we first need to compute the coefficients a0, a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, and b3 using the following formulas:\n\na0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) dx] over one period (from 0 to 2π)\nan = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx) dx] over one period (from 0 to 2π) for n = 1, 2, 3\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx) dx] over one period (from 0 to 2π) for n = 1, 2, 3\n\nwhere T = 2π is the period of the function, ω = 2π/T = 1, and n is the harmonic number.\n\nLet's compute the coefficients:\n\na0 = (1/2π) * [∫(2 dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 dx) from π to 2π]\na0 = (1/2π) * [2π - π] = 1/2\n\nFor an, we have:\nan = (1/π) * [∫(2 * cos(nx) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * cos(nx) dx) from π to 2π]\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3:\na1 = (1/π) * [∫(2 * cos(x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * cos(x) dx) from π to 2π]\na1 = (1/π) * [2 * sin(x)| from 0 to π - sin(x)| from π to 2π] = 0\n\na2 = (1/π) * [∫(2 * cos(2x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * cos(2x) dx) from π to 2π]\na2 = (1/π) * [sin(2x)| from 0 to π - (1/2) * sin(2x)| from π to 2π] = 0\n\na3 = (1/π) * [∫(2 * cos(3x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * cos(3x) dx) from π to 2π]\na3 = (1/π) * [2/3 * sin(3x)| from 0 to π - 1/3 * sin(3x)| from π to 2π] = 0\n\nFor bn, we have:\nbn = (1/π) * [∫(2 * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * sin(nx) dx) from π to 2π]\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3:\nb1 = (1/π) * [∫(2 * sin(x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * sin(x) dx) from π to 2π]\nb1 = (1/π) * [-2 * cos(x)| from 0 to π + cos(x)| from π to 2π] = 4/π\n\nb2 = (1/π) * [∫(2 * sin(2x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * sin(2x) dx) from π to 2π]\nb2 = (1/π) * [-cos(2x)| from 0 to π + (1/2) * cos(2x)| from π to 2π] = 0\n\nb3 = (1/π) * [∫(2 * sin(3x) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 * sin(3x) dx) from π to 2π]\nb3 = (1/π) * [-2/3 * cos(3x)| from 0 to π + 1/3 * cos(3x)| from π to 2π] = 2/π\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series expansion up to the third harmonic as:\n\nf(x) ≈ a0 + Σ[an * cos(nx) + bn * sin(nx)] for n = 1, 2, 3\nf(x) ≈ 1/2 + 0 * cos(x) + 4/π * sin(x) + 0 * cos(2x) + 0 * sin(2x) + 0 * cos(3x) + 2/π * sin(3x)\n\nSo, the Fourier series expansion up to the third harmonic is:\n\nf(x) ≈ 1/2 + (4/π) * sin(x) + (2/π) * sin(3x)"
