    "message_2": "A function f: X → Y is continuous if for every open set V in Y, the preimage f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X.\n\nSince Y has the trivial topology, the only open sets in Y are the empty set Ø and Y itself. Let's consider the preimages of these open sets under the function f.\n\n1. f^(-1)(Ø) = Ø, which is an open set in X (as the empty set is open in any topology).\n\n2. f^(-1)(Y) = {x ∈ X | f(x) ∈ Y}. Since f(x) = k for all x in X, f^(-1)(Y) will be equal to X if k is an element of Y, and it will be the empty set Ø otherwise. In either case, f^(-1)(Y) is an open set in X, as X is open in the discrete topology and we already established that Ø is open.\n\nTherefore, f is continuous for any value of k that is an element of Y. If k is not an element of Y, f is not well-defined as a function from X to Y."
