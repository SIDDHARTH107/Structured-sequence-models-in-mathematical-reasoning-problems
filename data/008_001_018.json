    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 1 -1  4 |  4 ]\n[ 5  2 -3 |  1 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 2:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  4 |  4 ]\n[ 2  3 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 5  2 -3 |  1 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace row 2 with (-2 * row 1) + row 2 and row 3 with (-5 * row 1) + row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  4 |  4 ]\n[ 0  5 -9 | -1 ]\n[ 0  7 -23 | -19 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide row 2 by 5:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  4 |  4 ]\n[ 0  1 -1.8 | -0.2 ]\n[ 0  7 -23 | -19 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace row 3 with (-7 * row 2) + row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  4 |  4 ]\n[ 0  1 -1.8 | -0.2 ]\n[ 0  0  2.6 | -18.6 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide row 3 by 2.6:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  4 |  4 ]\n[ 0  1 -1.8 | -0.2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | -7.15384615 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. Let's perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = -7.15384615\n\n2. y = -1.8z - 0.2 = -1.8(-7.15384615) - 0.2 = 12.87692308\n\n3. x = -y + 4z + 4 = -12.87692308 + 4(-7.15384615) + 4 = -1.00000001\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ -1\ny ≈ 12.88\nz ≈ -7.15"
