    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of modular exponentiation. We want to find the remainder of 7^24 when divided by 13, which can be written as:\n\n7^24 ≡ x (mod 13)\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 7 modulo 13:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n7^3 ≡ 7 * 10 ≡ 70 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n7^4 ≡ 10 * 3 ≡ 30 ≡ 4 (mod 13)\n7^5 ≡ 7 * 4 ≡ 28 ≡ 2 (mod 13)\n7^6 ≡ 10 * 2 ≡ 20 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n\nNotice that 7^6 ≡ 7 (mod 13), which means the powers of 7 modulo 13 repeat every 6 powers. Therefore, we can rewrite 7^24 as:\n\n7^24 ≡ (7^6)^4 (mod 13)\n\nSince 7^6 ≡ 7 (mod 13), we have:\n\n(7^6)^4 ≡ 7^4 (mod 13)\n\nFrom our previous calculations, we know that 7^4 ≡ 4 (mod 13). So, the remainder when 7^24 is divided by 13 is 4."
