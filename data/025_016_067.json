    "message_2": "To find a birational map from $C_1$ to $C_2$, we can look for a transformation that sends points on $C_1$ to points on $C_2$. Let's consider the following transformation:\n$$\\phi: (x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, y, z - xz).$$\n\nNow, let's check if this transformation sends points on $C_1$ to points on $C_2$. If $(x, y, z)$ is a point on $C_1$, then we have:\n$$x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0.$$\n\nApplying the transformation $\\phi$, we get the point $(x, y, z - xz)$ on $C_2$. We need to check if this point satisfies the equation of $C_2$:\n$$x^2 + y^2 - (z - xz)^2 - x(z - xz)^2 = 0.$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n$$x^2 + y^2 - z^2 + 2x^2z - x^3z^2 - xz^2 + x^3z^3 = 0.$$\n\nSince $(x, y, z)$ is a point on $C_1$, we know that $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$. Thus, the equation above simplifies to:\n$$2x^2z - x^3z^2 - xz^2 + x^3z^3 = 0.$$\n\nFactoring out $x$, we get:\n$$x(2z - xz^2 - z^2 + x^2z^3) = 0.$$\n\nSince we are working in the projective plane, we can ignore the factor of $x$ (as it corresponds to the point at infinity). Thus, we have shown that the transformation $\\phi$ sends points on $C_1$ to points on $C_2$.\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of this transformation. Let $\\phi^{-1}: (x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, y, z + xz)$. We can check that this is indeed the inverse by applying both transformations one after the other:\n\n$$\\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x, y, z)) = \\phi^{-1}(x, y, z - xz) = (x, y, (z - xz) + x(z - xz)) = (x, y, z).$$\n\nThus, the birational map from $C_1$ to $C_2$ is given by the transformation $\\phi: (x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, y, z - xz)$, and its inverse is given by the transformation $\\phi^{-1}: (x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, y, z + xz)$."
