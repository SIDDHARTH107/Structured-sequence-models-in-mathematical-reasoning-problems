Each edge has a weight assigned to it which represents the distance between the two nodes it connects.\n\n  ![Graph](https://i.imgur.com/PO1XsVl.png)\n\nWhat is the shortest path from node A to node F in the graph?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node F, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (A) to 0 and the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances of its neighbors (B and C) by adding the weight of the edge connecting the current node (A) to the neighbor. If the new distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (F) is visited.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞, E: ∞, F: ∞, G: ∞}\n\n2. Select A (smallest distance), mark it visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E, F, G}\n\n3. Update neighbors of A:\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 2, C: 4, D: ∞, E: ∞, F: ∞, G: ∞}\n\n4. Select B (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark it visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {C, D, E, F, G}\n\n5. Update neighbors of B:\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 2, C: 4, D: 5, E: ∞, F: ∞, G: ∞}\n\n6. Select C (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark it visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, E, F, G}\n\n7. Update neighbors of C:\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 2, C: 4, D: 5, E: 6, F: ∞, G: ∞}\n\n8. Select D (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark it visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {E, F, G}\n\n9. Update neighbors of D:\n   Distances: {A: 0, B: 2, C: 4, D: 5, E: 6, F: 9, G: ∞}\n\n10. Select E (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark it visited.\n    Unvisited nodes: {F, G}\n\n11. Update neighbors of E:\n    Distances: {A: 0, B: 2, C: 4, D: 5, E: 6, F: 8, G: 9}\n\n12. Select F (smallest distance among unvisited nodes), mark it visited.\n    Unvisited nodes: {G}\n\nSince we have visited the target node F, we can stop the algorithm. The shortest path from A to F is 8. To find the actual path, we can backtrack from F:\n\nF (8) <- E (6) <- C (4) <- A (0)\n\nSo, the shortest path from node A to node F is A -> C -> E -> F with a total distance of 8."
