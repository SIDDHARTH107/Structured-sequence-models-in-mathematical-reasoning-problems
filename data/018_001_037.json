    "message_2": "To show that φ is a subset of A and B, we need to prove that every element in φ is also an element of A and B. Since φ is the empty set, it has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in φ that are not in A or B. By definition, this means that φ is a subset of A and B.\n\nUsing the subset notation, we can write this as:\n\nA ⊇ φ and B ⊇ φ\n\nThis shows that the empty set φ is a subset of both A and B."
