    "message_1": "Let's consider the following statement: \"Every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or has a unique factorization into primes.\" Rewrite this statement as a predicate logic formula and use it to prove that 15 has a unique factorization into primes.",
    "message_2": "First, let's define our predicates:\n\nP(x): x is a prime number\nF(x, y): x has a unique factorization into primes y\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given statement as a predicate logic formula:\n\n∀x [(x > 1) → (P(x) ∨ F(x, y))]\n\nNow, let's prove that 15 has a unique factorization into primes:\n\nWe know that 15 = 3 * 5, where 3 and 5 are prime numbers. So, we have a factorization of 15 into primes. Now, we need to show that this factorization is unique.\n\nAssume there is another factorization of 15 into primes, say 15 = p * q, where p and q are prime numbers.\n\nSince 15 is odd, both p and q must be odd. Also, p and q must be greater than 1, as they are prime numbers. The only odd prime numbers less than 15 are 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nIf p = 3, then q = 15 / 3 = 5, which is the same as our original factorization. If p = 5, then q = 15 / 5 = 3, which is just a rearrangement of our original factorization.\n\nIf p = 7, then q = 15 / 7 ≈ 2.14, which is not a prime number. If p = 11, then q = 15 / 11 ≈ 1.36, which is not a prime number either.\n\nThus, there is no other factorization of 15 into primes, and the factorization 15 = 3 * 5 is unique.\n\nTherefore, using our predicate logic formula, we have shown that F(15, (3, 5)) is true, and 15 has a unique factorization into primes."
