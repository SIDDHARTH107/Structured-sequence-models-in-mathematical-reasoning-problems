    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subtopic Radioactive decay and half-life equations:\n\nThe half-life of a substance is 10 days, and initially, there were 500 grams of the substance. Write an equation to represent the amount of the substance remaining after \"t\" days if its decay follows an exponential function. Use this equation to find how much of the substance will be left after 30 days.",
    "message_2": "To represent the amount of the substance remaining after \"t\" days, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nA(t) = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/h)\n\nwhere:\nA(t) = the amount of the substance remaining after t days\nA₀ = the initial amount of the substance (500 grams)\nt = time in days\nh = half-life of the substance (10 days)\n\nSo, the equation for this problem is:\n\nA(t) = 500 * (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nNow, we need to find how much of the substance will be left after 30 days. Plug t = 30 into the equation:\n\nA(30) = 500 * (1/2)^(30/10)\n\nA(30) = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nA(30) = 500 * (1/8)\n\nA(30) = 62.5\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be 62.5 grams of the substance remaining."
