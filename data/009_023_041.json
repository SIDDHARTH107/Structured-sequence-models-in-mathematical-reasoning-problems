    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem, we can use the inverse scattering transform (IST) method, which is a powerful technique for solving nonlinear partial differential equations like the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation.\n\nHowever, the IST method is quite involved and requires a deep understanding of the spectral theory of linear operators and the Riemann-Hilbert problem. Due to the complexity of the method, it is not feasible to provide a full solution here.\n\nInstead, we can provide an outline of the steps involved in the IST method:\n\n1. Define the associated linear eigenvalue problem (also known as the Zakharov-Shabat system) for the given Nonlinear Schrödinger equation.\n2. Analyze the spectral properties of the linear eigenvalue problem, which involves finding the scattering data (eigenvalues, reflection coefficients, and norming constants) associated with the initial condition.\n3. Evolve the scattering data in time using the time-dependent linear eigenvalue problem.\n4. Use the inverse scattering transform to reconstruct the solution $u(x,t)$ from the evolved scattering data.\n\nFor the given initial condition, the IST method can be applied to find the solution $u(x,t)$ analytically. However, due to the complexity of the method, it is more common to use numerical methods to solve the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation for specific initial conditions and time intervals.\n\nNumerical methods like the split-step Fourier method, finite difference methods, or spectral methods can be used to approximate the solution $u(x,t)$ over the domain $-10 \\leq x \\leq 10$ and for the time interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 5$. These methods involve discretizing the spatial and temporal domains and iteratively updating the solution using the given equation and initial condition.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible to solve the given initial value problem analytically using the inverse scattering transform method, it is more practical to use numerical methods to approximate the solution $u(x,t)$ over the specified domain and time interval."
