    "message_1": "A square has a side-length of 4 units. In topology, we can subdivide the square into two triangles by connecting opposite corners. Using only two straight cuts, how many triangles can you form from the square?",
    "message_2": "Using only two straight cuts, you can form a maximum of 4 triangles from the square. \n\nHere's how:\n\n1. Make the first cut from one corner of the square to the midpoint of the opposite side. This will create two triangles.\n2. Make the second cut from the corner adjacent to the first corner (clockwise or counterclockwise) to the midpoint of the opposite side. This will create two more triangles, for a total of 4 triangles."
