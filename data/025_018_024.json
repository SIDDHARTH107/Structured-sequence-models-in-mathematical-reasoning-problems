    "message_2": "1. To find all integer solutions (x, y) to the equation x^3 + y^3 - 9xy = 0, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^3 + y^3 = 9xy\n\nNow, consider the cases when x or y are equal to 0:\n\nIf x = 0, then y^3 = 0, which implies y = 0. So, (0, 0) is a solution.\n\nIf y = 0, then x^3 = 0, which implies x = 0. This case leads to the same solution (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's assume that x and y are both non-zero integers. We can divide both sides of the equation by xy:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 9\n\nSince x and y are integers, x^2 and y^2 are non-negative integers. The only possible integer solutions for x^2 and y^2 that satisfy the equation are:\n\n(x^2, y^2) = (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 5), (5, 4)\n\nThese correspond to the integer solutions (x, y) = (±1, ±2), (±2, ±1), (±2, ±2).\n\nSo, the integer solutions to the equation are:\n\n(0, 0), (±1, ±2), (±2, ±1), (±2, ±2)\n\n2. To show that the curve defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 - 9xy = 0 in the real plane has at least two connected components, we can analyze the behavior of the curve for large values of x and y.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation as:\n\ny^3 - 9xy + x^3 = 0\n\nNow, consider the case when |x| >> |y|. In this case, the x^3 term dominates, and the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 ≈ 0\n\nThis implies that x ≈ 0, which is a contradiction since we assumed |x| >> |y|. Therefore, there cannot be a connected component of the curve that extends to large values of x.\n\nSimilarly, consider the case when |y| >> |x|. In this case, the y^3 term dominates, and the equation becomes:\n\ny^3 ≈ 0\n\nThis implies that y ≈ 0, which is a contradiction since we assumed |y| >> |x|. Therefore, there cannot be a connected component of the curve that extends to large values of y.\n\nSince the curve cannot extend to large values of x or y, it must have at least two connected components.\n\n3. To show that the curve C defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 - 9xy = 0 in the complex projective plane is smooth, we need to show that the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y do not vanish simultaneously at any point on the curve.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n∂/∂x = 3x^2 - 9y\n∂/∂y = 3y^2 - 9x\n\nAt a point (x, y) on the curve, we have:\n\nx^3 + y^3 = 9xy\n\nIf both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, we have:\n\n3x^2 - 9y = 0\n3y^2 - 9x = 0\n\nDividing the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -3, we get:\n\nx^2 = 3y\ny^2 = -3x\n\nMultiplying these two equations, we get:\n\nx^2y^2 = -9xy\n\nBut since x^3 + y^3 = 9xy, we have:\n\nx^3y^3 = 729x^2y^2\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\nxy = 27xy\n\nThis implies that x = 0 or y = 0, which is a contradiction since we assumed that x and y are non-zero. Therefore, the curve C is smooth.\n\nTo find the genus of the curve, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree d:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nIn this case, the degree of the polynomial is d = 3, so the genus is:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 1\n\nThus, the genus of the curve C is 1."
