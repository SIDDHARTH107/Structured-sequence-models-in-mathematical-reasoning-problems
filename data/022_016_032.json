    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic map $f: D \\to U$, we can use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. The Schwarz-Christoffel formula states that a conformal map from the unit disk to a polygon can be given by an integral of the form:\n\n$$f(z) = A + C \\int_0^z (\\omega - \\alpha_1)^{-\\beta_1} \\cdots (\\omega - \\alpha_n)^{-\\beta_n} d\\omega$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $C$ are constants, $\\alpha_i$ are the prevertices (the points in the unit disk that are mapped to the vertices of the polygon), and $\\beta_i$ are the angles of the polygon at the vertices.\n\nIn our case, we want to map the unit disk to the upper half plane. We can think of the upper half plane as a polygon with vertices at $0$, $1$, and $\\infty$. The angles at these vertices are $\\pi$, $\\pi$, and $0$, respectively. Thus, we have $\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = 1$ and $\\beta_3 = 0$.\n\nLet $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ be the prevertices corresponding to $0$ and $1$, respectively. Since we want to map $0$ to $i$, we can set $\\alpha_1 = 0$. We can also set $\\alpha_2 = 1$ without loss of generality. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = A + C \\int_0^z (\\omega - 0)^{-1} (\\omega - 1)^{-1} d\\omega$$\n\nNow, we can compute the integral:\n\n$$f(z) = A + C \\int_0^z \\frac{1}{\\omega(\\omega - 1)} d\\omega$$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\omega(\\omega - 1)} = \\frac{A}{\\omega} + \\frac{B}{\\omega - 1}$$\n\nSolving for $A$ and $B$, we get $A = -1$ and $B = 1$. Thus, the integral becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = A + C \\int_0^z \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\omega} + \\frac{1}{\\omega - 1}\\right) d\\omega$$\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = A - C \\left[\\ln(\\omega) - \\ln(\\omega - 1)\\right]_0^z$$\n\n$$f(z) = A - C \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z - 1}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{0}{-1}\\right)\\right]$$\n\n$$f(z) = A - C \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z - 1}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to determine the constants $A$ and $C$. Since we want to map $0$ to $i$, we have:\n\n$$i = A - C \\ln\\left(\\frac{0}{-1}\\right)$$\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is not defined, we can instead consider the limit as $z$ approaches $0$:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} f(z) = A - C \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z - 1}\\right) = i$$\n\nThe limit evaluates to $\\ln(1) = 0$, so we have $A = i$. Now, we need to find $C$. Since we want the map to be biholomorphic, it must map the boundary of the unit disk to the boundary of the upper half plane. The boundary of the unit disk is given by $|z| = 1$. We can consider the point $z = 1$:\n\n$$f(1) = i - C \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 1}\\right)$$\n\nAgain, the logarithm is not defined, so we consider the limit as $z$ approaches $1$:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 1} f(z) = i - C \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z - 1}\\right)$$\n\nThe limit evaluates to $\\ln(1) = 0$, so we have $f(1) = i$. Since $f(1)$ is on the boundary of the upper half plane, we can conclude that $C = 1$.\n\nThus, the biholomorphic map $f: D \\to U$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = i - \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z - 1}\\right)$$"
