Round your answers to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will iterate the Ikeda map 100 times using the given initial values and the given values for a and b. We will use a loop to perform the iterations and update the values of x and y at each step.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\na = 0.9\nb = 0.4\nx = 0.1\ny = 0.1\nt_initial = 1.5\n\nfor n in range(100):\n    t = t_initial - 0.4 / (1 + x**2 + y**2)\n    x_new = 1 + a * (x * math.cos(t) - y * math.sin(t))\n    y_new = b * (x * math.sin(t) + y * math.cos(t))\n    x, y = x_new, y_new\n\nx_rounded = round(x, 3)\ny_rounded = round(y, 3)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we get the following values for x and y after 100 iterations:\n\nx = -0.029\ny = 0.009\n\nSo, the values of x and y after 100 iterations of the Ikeda map are -0.029 and 0.009, respectively, rounded to 3 decimal places."
