    "message_2": "A graph with 7 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3 is a 3-regular graph. The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G satisfies:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the graph. In this case, Δ(G) = 3.\n\nSince the graph has an odd number of vertices (7) and each vertex has an odd degree (3), the graph must have an odd number of edges. The total number of edges in the graph can be calculated as:\n\nE = (7 * 3) / 2 = 10.5\n\nSince the number of edges must be an integer, this graph cannot exist. However, if we assume that the problem statement is correct and there is a graph with 7 vertices and each vertex has degree 3, we can proceed with the calculation.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n3 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 4\n\nTo determine whether the chromatic index is 3 or 4, we can try to color the edges of the graph using 3 colors. If we can do this without any adjacent edges having the same color, then the chromatic index is 3. Otherwise, it is 4.\n\nSince the graph is 3-regular, it is not possible to color the edges using only 3 colors without having adjacent edges with the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph G is 4."
