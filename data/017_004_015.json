    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we can apply the Sylow Theorems. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that n_3 divides the order of G and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Let's call this subgroup H.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G and has order 3, it is cyclic (as 3 is prime). Let a be a generator of H, so H = {e, a, a^2}, where e is the identity element in G. Now, consider the quotient group G/H. It has order 9/3 = 3, which is prime, so G/H is also cyclic. Let bH be a generator of G/H, where b is an element in G.\n\nNow, consider the element b in G. Since bH generates G/H, the order of bH in G/H is 3. This means that (bH)^3 = b^3H = H, so b^3 is in H. Since H is generated by a, we can write b^3 = a^k for some integer k, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2.\n\nIf k = 0, then b^3 = e, and the order of b in G is 3. In this case, G is generated by the elements a and b, so G is a cyclic group of order 9.\n\nIf k ≠ 0, then without loss of generality, let k = 1 (if k = 2, we can replace a with a^2). So, b^3 = a. Now, consider the elements ab and ba in G. We have (ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = a^3a = a^4 = a, and (ba)^3 = b^3a^3 = aa^3 = a^4 = a. Since a has order 3 in G, this means that ab and ba both have order 3 in G.\n\nNow, we claim that G = {e, a, a^2, b, b^2, ab, ab^2, ba, ba^2}. To show this, we just need to show that these elements are distinct. Suppose that b^i * a^j = b^k * a^l for some 0 ≤ i, j, k, l ≤ 2. Then, b^(i-k) * a^(j-l) = e. Since b^3 = a, we can rewrite this as a^(3(i-k) + (j-l)) = e. Since a has order 3, this implies that 3 divides (3(i-k) + (j-l)), which means that 3 divides (j-l). Thus, j = l. It follows that b^(i-k) = e, and since b has order 3, we must have i = k. Therefore, the elements are distinct, and G has 9 elements.\n\nFinally, we can show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. Define a homomorphism φ: G → C_3 × C_3, where C_3 is a cyclic group of order 3, by φ(g) = (a^i, a^j) if g = b^i * a^j. It is easy to verify that φ is a homomorphism, and since G has 9 elements, φ is an isomorphism. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3."
