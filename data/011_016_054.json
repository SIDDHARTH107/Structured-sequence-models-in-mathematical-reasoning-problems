    "message_1": "A company wants to distribute gifts to its 10 employees. They have 4 types of gifts to choose from. However, they cannot give the same gift to more than 4 employees. How many ways can they distribute the gifts?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using combinatorics. Let's represent the gifts as A, B, C, and D. We need to find the number of ways to distribute these gifts to 10 employees with the constraint that no gift can be given to more than 4 employees.\n\nWe can break this problem down into cases:\n\nCase 1: 4 gifts of one type, 4 gifts of another type, and 2 gifts of a third type.\nExample: 4 A's, 4 B's, and 2 C's.\n\nThere are 4 ways to choose the first gift type (A, B, C, or D), 3 ways to choose the second gift type (excluding the first type), and 2 ways to choose the third gift type (excluding the first two types). So, there are 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 ways to choose the gift types.\n\nNow, we need to distribute these gifts among the 10 employees. There are 10 employees to choose from for the first gift type, so there are C(10,4) ways to distribute the first gift type. Then, there are 6 employees left for the second gift type, so there are C(6,4) ways to distribute the second gift type. Finally, there are 2 employees left for the third gift type, so there are C(2,2) ways to distribute the third gift type.\n\nUsing the combination formula, C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!), we get:\n\nC(10,4) = 10!/(4!6!) = 210\nC(6,4) = 6!/(4!2!) = 15\nC(2,2) = 2!/(2!0!) = 1\n\nSo, there are 210 x 15 x 1 = 3150 ways to distribute the gifts in this case.\n\nCase 2: 4 gifts of one type, 3 gifts of another type, 2 gifts of a third type, and 1 gift of a fourth type.\nExample: 4 A's, 3 B's, 2 C's, and 1 D.\n\nThere are 4 ways to choose the first gift type, 3 ways to choose the second gift type, 2 ways to choose the third gift type, and 1 way to choose the fourth gift type. So, there are 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ways to choose the gift types.\n\nNow, we need to distribute these gifts among the 10 employees. There are C(10,4) ways to distribute the first gift type, C(6,3) ways to distribute the second gift type, C(3,2) ways to distribute the third gift type, and C(1,1) ways to distribute the fourth gift type.\n\nUsing the combination formula, we get:\n\nC(10,4) = 210 (as calculated before)\nC(6,3) = 6!/(3!3!) = 20\nC(3,2) = 3!/(2!1!) = 3\nC(1,1) = 1!/(1!0!) = 1\n\nSo, there are 210 x 20 x 3 x 1 = 12600 ways to distribute the gifts in this case.\n\nTotal ways to distribute the gifts = Case 1 + Case 2 = 3150 + 12600 = 15,750 ways."
