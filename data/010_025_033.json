    "message_1": "Suppose we have a two-dimensional grid consisting of a square lattice with side length $n$, where every vertex is colored black or white. We define a \"region\" to be a connected set of black vertices that are adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically. Let $f_n$ be the number of distinct regions that can be formed on this grid.\n\nWhat is $f_n$ for $n = 4$?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct regions that can be formed on a 4x4 grid, we can consider the number of black vertices in each region. We will count the number of ways to form regions with a given number of black vertices and sum them up.\n\n1. One black vertex: There are 16 cells in the grid, and any of them can be a single black vertex. So, there is only 1 way to form a region with one black vertex.\n   Number of ways = 16\n\n2. Two black vertices: There are two possible configurations for two adjacent black vertices: horizontal or vertical. For the horizontal configuration, there are 3 columns and 4 rows, giving 12 possible positions. For the vertical configuration, there are 4 columns and 3 rows, giving 12 possible positions.\n   Number of ways = 12 + 12 = 24\n\n3. Three black vertices: There are two possible configurations for three adjacent black vertices: horizontal or vertical. For the horizontal configuration, there are 2 columns and 4 rows, giving 8 possible positions. For the vertical configuration, there are 4 columns and 2 rows, giving 8 possible positions.\n   Number of ways = 8 + 8 = 16\n\n4. Four black vertices: There are two possible configurations for four adjacent black vertices: horizontal or vertical. For the horizontal configuration, there is 1 column and 4 rows, giving 4 possible positions. For the vertical configuration, there are 4 columns and 1 row, giving 4 possible positions.\n   Number of ways = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nNow, we need to consider the cases where the black vertices form an L-shape, T-shape, or a square.\n\n5. L-shape: There are 4 possible orientations for the L-shape. For each orientation, there are 2 columns and 3 rows, giving 6 possible positions.\n   Number of ways = 4 * 6 = 24\n\n6. T-shape: There are 4 possible orientations for the T-shape. For each orientation, there are 2 columns and 2 rows, giving 4 possible positions.\n   Number of ways = 4 * 4 = 16\n\n7. Square: There is only one configuration for a square, and there are 3 columns and 3 rows, giving 9 possible positions.\n   Number of ways = 9\n\nNow, we sum up the number of ways for each case to get the total number of distinct regions for a 4x4 grid:\n\n$f_4$ = 16 + 24 + 16 + 8 + 24 + 16 + 9 = 113\n\nSo, there are 113 distinct regions that can be formed on a 4x4 grid."
