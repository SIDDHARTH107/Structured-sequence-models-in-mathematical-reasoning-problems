    "message_1": "A game of chance involves spinning a wheel with six equally sized sections, numbered 1 to 6. If you bet on the number 3, what is the probability of winning the game if you get only one spin?",
    "message_2": "Since there are six equally sized sections on the wheel and you are betting on one specific number (3), the probability of winning the game with one spin is 1 out of 6, or 1/6."
