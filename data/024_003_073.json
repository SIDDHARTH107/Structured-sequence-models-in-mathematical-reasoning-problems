    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1,5), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the coordinates (x, y). Then, the position vector of a point on the surface is given by:\n\nr(x, y) = xi + yj + (2x^2 + 3y^2)k\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives of r with respect to x and y:\n\nr_x = ∂r/∂x = i + 4xk\nr_y = ∂r/∂y = j + 6yk\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_xx = ∂²r/∂x² = 4k\nr_yy = ∂²r/∂y² = 6k\nr_xy = ∂²r/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, N):\n\nE = r_x • r_x = 1 + 16x^2\nF = r_x • r_y = 0\nG = r_y • r_y = 1 + 36y^2\n\nL = r_xx • N = 4\nM = r_xy • N = 0\nN = r_yy • N = 6\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface. Now, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,5), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 16(1)^2 = 17\nF = 0\nG = 1 + 36(1)^2 = 37\n\nL = 4\nM = 0\nN = 6\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nK = (4*6 - 0^2) / (17*37 - 0^2) = 24 / 629\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1,5) is K = 24/629."
