    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to wave propagation and wave equations:\n\nA wave is described by the equation y(x,t) = 0.02sin(5t - 0.1x) where y is the displacement at point x at time t. Determine the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, wave speed and the equation for the wave in terms of wavelength for this wave.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the different components of the wave equation and use them to find the required values.\n\nThe given wave equation is y(x, t) = 0.02sin(5t - 0.1x).\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. In the given equation, the amplitude is the coefficient of the sine function, which is 0.02. So, A = 0.02.\n\n2. Wavelength (λ): To find the wavelength, we need to look at the coefficient of x inside the sine function. The general form of the wave equation is y(x, t) = Asin(ωt - kx) where k is the wave number and is related to the wavelength by the formula k = 2π/λ. In our equation, k = 0.1. So, λ = 2π/0.1 = 20π.\n\n3. Frequency (f): The frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time. It is related to the angular frequency (ω) by the formula ω = 2πf. In our equation, ω = 5. So, f = 5/(2π) = 5/6.283 ≈ 0.796 Hz.\n\n4. Wave speed (v): The wave speed is the speed at which the wave propagates through the medium. It is related to the wavelength and frequency by the formula v = λf. So, v = 20π * 0.796 ≈ 50 m/s.\n\n5. Equation in terms of wavelength: To express the equation in terms of wavelength, we can replace k with 2π/λ and ω with 2πf. So, the equation becomes:\n\ny(x, t) = 0.02sin((2πf)t - (2π/λ)x) = 0.02sin((2π(0.796))t - (2π/(20π))x) = 0.02sin(5t - 0.1x).\n\nThe given equation is already in terms of wavelength, so the final equation is y(x, t) = 0.02sin(5t - 0.1x).\n\nIn summary:\nAmplitude (A) = 0.02\nWavelength (λ) = 20π\nFrequency (f) = 0.796 Hz\nWave speed (v) = 50 m/s\nEquation in terms of wavelength: y(x, t) = 0.02sin(5t - 0.1x)"
