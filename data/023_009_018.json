    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series expansion of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we will use the formulas for the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx (for n = 0, 1, 2, ...)\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx (for n = 1, 2, ...)\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 is an even function, all the sine terms will be zero, i.e., b_n = 0 for all n. Now, let's compute the a_n coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx (for n = 1, 2, ...)\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^3/3] |(-π, π)\na_0 = (1/π) * [(π^3 - (-π)^3)/3]\na_0 = (2π^2)/3\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\na_n = (2/π) * [(-x^2 * sin(nx))/(n) + (2x * cos(nx))/(n^2) - (2 * sin(nx))/(n^3)] |(-π, π)\n\na_n = (4/πn^3) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, the Fourier series expansion of f(x) = x^2 is:\n\nf(x) = (2π^2)/3 + Σ[(4/πn^3) * (-1)^n * cos(nx)]\n\nNow, let's solve the boundary value problem u''(x) + u(x) = f(x), with u(-π) = 0 and u(π) = 0.\n\nWe will assume the solution u(x) has the form:\n\nu(x) = Σ[b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nTaking the second derivative, we get:\n\nu''(x) = Σ[-n^2 * b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, substituting u(x) and u''(x) into the given differential equation:\n\nΣ[-n^2 * b_n * sin(nx)] + Σ[b_n * sin(nx)] = x^2\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(nx) on both sides, we get:\n\nb_n * (1 - n^2) = (4/πn^3) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, we can find b_n:\n\nb_n = (4/πn^3) * (-1)^n / (1 - n^2)\n\nFinally, the Fourier sine series of the boundary value problem is:\n\nu(x) = Σ[((4/πn^3) * (-1)^n / (1 - n^2)) * sin(nx)]"
