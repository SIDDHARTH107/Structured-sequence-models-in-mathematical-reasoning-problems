Bob also claims that he knows a number between 1 and 100. However, they don't know each other's number. Later, Alice claims that she doesn't know Bob's number. If Alice is telling the truth, what is the probability that Bob's number is odd?\"",
    "message_2": "Since Alice claims that she doesn't know Bob's number, there is no additional information provided about Bob's number. Therefore, the probability that Bob's number is odd remains the same as it would be for any randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.\n\nThere are 50 odd numbers between 1 and 100 (1, 3, 5, ..., 99). There are a total of 100 numbers between 1 and 100. So, the probability that Bob's number is odd is:\n\nP(Bob's number is odd) = (Number of odd numbers) / (Total numbers) = 50 / 100 = 1/2 or 50%."
