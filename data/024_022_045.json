    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points. In this case, we are looking for transformations that preserve the metric $ds^2 = 4(dx^2 + dy^2)$. Let $(x', y')$ be the transformed coordinates, and let $(x, y)$ be the original coordinates. The isometries we are looking for are those that satisfy:\n\n$4(dx'^2 + dy'^2) = 4(dx^2 + dy^2)$.\n\nThere are four types of isometries in the Euclidean plane: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. We will consider each type and check if they preserve the given metric.\n\n1. Translations: Let $(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Then, $dx' = dx$ and $dy' = dy$. The metric is clearly preserved, so translations are isometries of the given metric.\n\n2. Rotations: Let $(x', y') = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of rotation. Then, $dx' = (\\cos\\theta\\, dx - \\sin\\theta\\, dy)$ and $dy' = (\\sin\\theta\\, dx + \\cos\\theta\\, dy)$. Thus,\n\n$dx'^2 + dy'^2 = (\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta)(dx^2 + dy^2) = dx^2 + dy^2$.\n\nThe metric is preserved, so rotations are isometries of the given metric.\n\n3. Reflections: Let $(x', y') = (x, -y)$ for a reflection about the x-axis. Then, $dx' = dx$ and $dy' = -dy$. The metric is preserved, so reflections are isometries of the given metric. Similarly, reflections about the y-axis and any other line can be shown to preserve the metric.\n\n4. Glide reflections: A glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation. Since both translations and reflections preserve the metric, glide reflections also preserve the metric.\n\nNow, we need to show that these isometries form a group. A group is a set of elements with a binary operation that satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: The composition of any two isometries is an isometry.\n2. Associativity: The composition of isometries is associative.\n3. Identity: There exists an identity isometry that leaves all points unchanged.\n4. Inverses: Every isometry has an inverse isometry.\n\nThe set of isometries of the Euclidean plane is known to form a group called the Euclidean group, denoted by $E(2)$. Since the given metric is a scaled version of the Euclidean metric, the isometries that preserve the given metric are the same as those that preserve the Euclidean metric. Therefore, the isometries of the given metric form a group, which is isomorphic to the Euclidean group $E(2)$."
