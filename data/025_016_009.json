    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve given by the equation $y^2=x^3-2x+5$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $P=(1,2)$ and $Q=(-1,2)$ be two points on the curve. Find the equation of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ and show that it intersects the curve at another point $R$. Then, find the coordinates of the point $R$.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through points $P=(1,2)$ and $Q=(-1,2)$, we first find the slope of the line. Since the y-coordinates of both points are the same, the slope is 0. Therefore, the line is horizontal and its equation is given by:\n\n$y = 2$\n\nNow, we want to find the point $R$ where this line intersects the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 5$. Since we know that $y=2$, we can substitute this value into the equation of the curve:\n\n$(2)^2 = x^3 - 2x + 5$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$4 = x^3 - 2x + 5$\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\n$x^3 - 2x + 1 = 0$\n\nWe know that $x=1$ and $x=-1$ are solutions to this equation since they correspond to the points $P$ and $Q$. To find the third solution, we can use synthetic division or factor the polynomial. Factoring, we get:\n\n$(x-1)(x+1)(x-1) = 0$\n\nSo, the third solution is $x=1$. Substituting this value back into the equation of the line, we find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\n$y = 2$\n\nThus, the third point of intersection is $R=(1,2)$. However, in the context of elliptic curves, we should take the \"sum\" of the points $P$ and $Q$ as the negative of the third intersection point. Since $R=(1,2)$, the negative of this point is given by $-R=(1,-2)$. Therefore, the \"sum\" of the points $P$ and $Q$ on the elliptic curve is:\n\n$P + Q = -R = (1,-2)$."
