The data collected is as follows:\n\n| Years of Experience | Salary (in thousands) |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1 | 30 |\n| 2 | 40 |\n| 3 | 50 |\n| 4 | 60 |\n| 5 | 70 |\n\nUsing linear regression analysis, find the equation of the line of best fit for this data set. What is the predicted salary for an employee with 7 years of experience?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line of best fit using linear regression, we need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line y = mx + b.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the years of experience (x) and the mean of the salaries (y):\n\nMean of years of experience (x̄):\n(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3\n\nMean of salaries (ȳ):\n(30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70) / 5 = 250 / 5 = 50\n\nNow, let's calculate the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nFor each data point, we need to calculate (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) and (xi - x̄)^2:\n\n| Years of Experience (xi) | Salary (yi) | (xi - x̄) | (yi - ȳ) | (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) | (xi - x̄)^2 |\n|---------------------------|-------------|----------|----------|------------------|------------|\n| 1                         | 30          | -2       | -20      | 40               | 4          |\n| 2                         | 40          | -1       | -10      | 10               | 1          |\n| 3                         | 50          | 0        | 0        | 0                | 0          |\n| 4                         | 60          | 1        | 10       | 10               | 1          |\n| 5                         | 70          | 2        | 20       | 40               | 4          |\n\nNow, let's sum up the last two columns:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) = 40 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 40 = 100\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = 100 / 10 = 10\n\nNext, let's find the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\n\nb = 50 - 10 * 3 = 50 - 30 = 20\n\nNow we have the equation of the line of best fit:\n\ny = 10x + 20\n\nTo predict the salary for an employee with 7 years of experience, we can plug in x = 7:\n\ny = 10 * 7 + 20 = 70 + 20 = 90\n\nThe predicted salary for an employee with 7 years of experience is 90,000."
