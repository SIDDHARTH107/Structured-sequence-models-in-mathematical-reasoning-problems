    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces three types of machines: type A, type B, and type C. The percentage of machines produced daily is as follows: 60% of type A, 30% of type B, and 10% of type C. The probability of a type A machine breaking down on any given day is 0.05, for a type B machine it is 0.08, and for a type C machine it is 0.10. If a machine has broken down, what is the probability that it is a type A machine?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that a machine is type A given that it has broken down (P(A|B)). We know the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.60 (probability of a machine being type A)\nP(B) = 0.30 (probability of a machine being type B)\nP(C) = 0.10 (probability of a machine being type C)\n\nP(B|A) = 0.05 (probability of a type A machine breaking down)\nP(B|B) = 0.08 (probability of a type B machine breaking down)\nP(B|C) = 0.10 (probability of a type C machine breaking down)\n\nWe need to find P(B), the probability of a machine breaking down. We can do this by using the law of total probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|B) * P(B) + P(B|C) * P(C)\n\nP(B) = (0.05 * 0.60) + (0.08 * 0.30) + (0.10 * 0.10)\nP(B) = 0.03 + 0.024 + 0.01\nP(B) = 0.064\n\nNow we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nP(A|B) = (0.05 * 0.60) / 0.064\n\nP(A|B) = 0.03 / 0.064\n\nP(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46875\n\nSo, the probability that a machine is type A given that it has broken down is approximately 46.88%."
