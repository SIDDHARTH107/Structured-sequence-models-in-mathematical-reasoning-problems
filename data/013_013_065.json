    "message_1": "Consider an auction where there are five bidders and one item for sale. The true values of the item to each bidder are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $100 \nBidder 2: $80 \nBidder 3: $60 \nBidder 4: $40 \nBidder 5: $20\n\nSuppose this is a sealed-bid second-price auction (also known as a Vickrey auction), where the highest bidder wins the item and pays the second-highest bid. If each bidder makes their bid, what will the final sale price of the item be and which bidder will win the auction?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, each bidder submits their bid without knowing the bids of the other bidders. The highest bidder wins the item and pays the second-highest bid.\n\nIn this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $100\nBidder 2: $80\nBidder 3: $60\nBidder 4: $40\nBidder 5: $20\n\nBidder 1 has the highest bid at $100, so they will win the auction. The second-highest bid is $80 from Bidder 2. Therefore, the final sale price of the item will be $80."
