    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The size of the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A.\n\nIn this case, A has 5 distinct elements, so the size of the power set of A is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A to the size of A itself. The size of A is 5, and the size of the power set of A is 32. Since 32 > 5, the size of the power set of A is indeed greater than the size of A itself."
