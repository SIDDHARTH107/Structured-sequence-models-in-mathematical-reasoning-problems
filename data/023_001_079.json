    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = x on the interval -π < x < π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -L to L (where L = π)\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)]dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx from -L to L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x]dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2/2] from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * (π^2/2 - (-π^2/2))\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * π * x / π)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * π * x / π)]dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sin(nx)dx. Then, du = dx and v = -cos(nx)/n.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-x * cos(nx)/n] from -π to π - (1/π) * ∫[-cos(nx)/n]dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * [0] - (1/π) * [-sin(nx)/n^2] from -π to π\nb_n = (1/n^2) * [sin(n * π) - sin(-n * π)]\n\nSince sin(n * π) and sin(-n * π) are both zero for all integer values of n, b_n = 0.\n\nThus, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval -π < x < π is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[b_n * sin(n * x)] from n = 1 to infinity\nSince all the coefficients a_n and b_n are zero, the Fourier series is identically zero. However, this is not the correct representation of the function f(x) = x. The issue here is that the function f(x) = x is not continuous at the endpoints of the interval, which leads to the Gibbs phenomenon.\n\nTo obtain a more accurate representation of the function, we can use the sine series representation:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2*(-1)^((n-1)/2))/(n * π) * sin(n * x)] from n = 1, 3, 5, ... to infinity\n\nThis series converges to the function f(x) = x on the interval -π < x < π."
