    "message_2": "The question seems to be asking for the maximum number of edges that can be present in a connected graph with 6 vertices. A disconnected graph is one where at least one pair of vertices is not connected by any path.\n\nA complete graph is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In a complete graph with n vertices, the number of edges is given by the formula:\n\nnumber of edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor a graph with 6 vertices, the maximum number of edges in a complete graph would be:\n\nnumber of edges = 6 * (6 - 1) / 2 = 6 * 5 / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges that can be present in a connected graph with 6 vertices is 15. If you remove any edge from the complete graph, it will still remain connected."
