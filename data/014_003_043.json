    "message_1": "Okay, here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have a plaintext message of \"HELLO\" that needs to be encrypted using the ElGamal public key cryptosystem. The public key is given as (p=17, α=3, β=11), where p is a prime number, α is a primitive root modulo p, and β is a value computed by the sender. Your goal is to encrypt the plaintext using the ElGamal system and provide the resulting ciphertext.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo encrypt \"HELLO\" using the ElGamal public key (p=17, α=3, β=11), we first need to represent each letter as a number using its ASCII code. \n\nASCII codes for H, E, L, and O are 72, 69, 76, and 79 respectively. So the plaintext message \"HELLO\" can be represented as a sequence of numbers: (72, 69, 76, 76, 79).\n\nNext, we need to choose a random integer k, where 1 < k < p-1. Let's choose k=4.\n\nUsing this value of k, we can generate the ElGamal ciphertext as follows:\n\nciphertext = (α^k mod p, M * β^k mod p)\n\nwhere M is the message to be encrypted, expressed as a number.\n\nSo, for each letter in \"HELLO\", we obtain:\n\nciphertext for H: (α^k mod p, 72 * β^k mod p) = (3^4 mod 17, 72 * 11^4 mod 17) = (13, 6)\nciphertext for E: (α^k mod p, 69 * β^k mod p) = (3^4 mod 17, 69 * 11^4 mod 17) = (13, 1)\nciphertext for L: (α^k mod p, 76 * β^k mod p) = (3^4 mod 17, 76 * 11^4 mod 17) = (13, 5)\nciphertext for L: (α^k mod p, 76 * β^k mod p) = (3^4 mod 17, 76 * 11^4 mod 17) = (13, 5)\nciphertext for O: (α^k mod p, 79 * β^k mod p) = (3^4 mod 17, 79 * 11^4 mod 17) = (13, 11)\n\nSo the resulting ciphertext for \"HELLO\" is: (13, 6), (13, 1), (13, 5), (13, 5), (13, 11).\n\nTherefore, the final encrypted message is: (13, 6), (13, 1), (13, 5), (13, 5), (13, 11).",
    "message_2": "It appears that you have provided the solution to the problem already. The ElGamal encryption of the plaintext message \"HELLO\" using the public key (p=17, α=3, β=11) and the chosen random integer k=4 results in the ciphertext: (13, 6), (13, 1), (13, 5), (13, 5), (13, 11)."
