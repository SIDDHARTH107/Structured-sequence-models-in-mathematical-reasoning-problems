    "message_2": "A Vigenere cipher key of length 6 consists of 6 lower case English letters. There are 26 lower case English letters. Each position in the key can be any of the 26 letters. Therefore, the number of possible keys can be calculated as follows:\n\n26 options for the first position * 26 options for the second position * 26 options for the third position * 26 options for the fourth position * 26 options for the fifth position * 26 options for the sixth position\n\n26^6 = 308,915,776\n\nSo, there are 308,915,776 possible keys that can be formed."
