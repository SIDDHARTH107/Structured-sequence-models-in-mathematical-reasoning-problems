    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The system of equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants (20, 41, 62).\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nPerforming LU decomposition on A:\n\nL = | 1   0   0 |\n    | 2.5 1   0 |\n    | 4   3   1 |\n\nU = | 2  3   4  |\n    | 0 -1.5 -3 |\n    | 0  0  -1  |\n\nNow we can solve the system in two steps. First, we solve the equation L * Y = B for Y:\n\nL * Y = | 1   0   0 | | y1 |   | 20 |\n        | 2.5 1   0 | | y2 | = | 41 |\n        | 4   3   1 | | y3 |   | 62 |\n\nSolving for Y, we get:\n\nY = | 20  |\n    | -9  |\n    | -1  |\n\nNext, we solve the equation U * X = Y for X:\n\nU * X = | 2  3   4  | | x |   | 20 |\n        | 0 -1.5 -3 | | y | = | -9 |\n        | 0  0  -1  | | z |   | -1 |\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
