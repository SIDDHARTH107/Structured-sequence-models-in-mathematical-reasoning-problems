    "message_1": "A widget producing factory has 10 machines that can each produce a widget in 2 hours. What is the probability that at least 8 widgets will be produced in the next 3 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, producing a widget) in n trials (number of machines)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (producing a widget) in a single trial (machine)\n- n is the number of trials (machines)\n- k is the number of successes (widgets produced)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a single machine producing a widget in 3 hours. Since a machine can produce a widget in 2 hours, the probability of producing a widget in 3 hours is 1.5 times the rate, which is:\n\np = 1.5 / 2 = 0.75\n\nNow we want to find the probability of at least 8 widgets being produced in the next 3 hours. This means we need to find the probability of 8, 9, or 10 widgets being produced. We can calculate this by finding the probability of each case and summing them up:\n\nP(X >= 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nWe will now calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\n1. P(X = 8):\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.75)^8 * (1 - 0.75)^2 ≈ 0.2816\n\n2. P(X = 9):\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.75)^9 * (1 - 0.75)^1 ≈ 0.1877\n\n3. P(X = 10):\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.75)^10 * (1 - 0.75)^0 ≈ 0.0563\n\nNow, we can sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.2816 + 0.1877 + 0.0563 ≈ 0.5256\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 widgets will be produced in the next 3 hours is approximately 52.56%."
