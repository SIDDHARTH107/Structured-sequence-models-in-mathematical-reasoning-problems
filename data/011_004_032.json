    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of ways to form a committee of five without any restrictions. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people and k is the number of people to be chosen.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and k = 5. So, the total number of ways to form a committee of five without any restrictions is:\n\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!(7-5)!) = 7! / (5!2!) = (7*6) / (2) = 21\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to form a committee with the two people who cannot be together. If they are both on the committee, there are 3 spots left to fill, and 5 remaining people to choose from. The number of ways to form this committee is:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4) / (2) = 10\n\nFinally, to find the number of ways to form a committee without the two people being together, we subtract the number of ways they can be together from the total number of ways without any restrictions:\n\n21 - 10 = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 ways to form a committee of five with the condition that the two people cannot be on the committee together."
