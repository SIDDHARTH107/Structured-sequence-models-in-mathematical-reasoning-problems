    "message_1": "A metal box with a square base and no top is to be constructed with a volume of 128 cubic inches. If the cost of the metal used for the bottom is $0.03 per square inch, and the cost of the metal used for the sides is $0.01 per square inch, what are the dimensions of the box so that the cost of materials are minimized?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and y be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * y = 128 cubic inches\n\nWe need to find the cost function and minimize it. The cost of the bottom is:\n\nC_bottom = 0.03 * x^2\n\nThe cost of the sides is:\n\nC_sides = 4 * 0.01 * x * y\n\nThe total cost is:\n\nC_total = C_bottom + C_sides = 0.03 * x^2 + 0.04 * x * y\n\nWe need to express y in terms of x using the volume equation:\n\ny = 128 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the cost function:\n\nC_total = 0.03 * x^2 + 0.04 * x * (128 / x^2)\n\nC_total = 0.03 * x^2 + 5.12 / x\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nd(C_total) / dx = 0\n\nd(0.03 * x^2 + 5.12 / x) / dx = 0\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n\n0.06 * x - 5.12 / x^2 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n0.06 * x^3 - 5.12 = 0\n\nx^3 = 5.12 / 0.06\n\nx^3 = 85.3333\n\nx = (85.3333)^(1/3)\n\nx ≈ 4.4 inches\n\nNow we can find the height y using the expression we found earlier:\n\ny = 128 / x^2\n\ny = 128 / (4.4^2)\n\ny ≈ 6.6 inches\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the cost of materials are approximately 4.4 inches for the side length of the square base and 6.6 inches for the height."
