    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a systematic way of testing all possible combinations of variables and levels with a reduced number of experiments. In this case, we have 5 variables, each with 3 levels. To determine the appropriate orthogonal array, we need to find the smallest value of n such that:\n\nL^n >= k^t\n\nwhere L is the number of levels, n is the number of experiments, k is the number of variables, and t is the strength of the array (usually set to 2 for pairwise interactions).\n\nIn this case, we have L = 3, k = 5, and t = 2. So we need to find the smallest n such that:\n\n3^n >= 5^2\n\n3^n >= 25\n\nBy testing different values of n, we find that n = 3 is too small (3^3 = 27 < 25), but n = 4 is large enough (3^4 = 81 >= 25). Therefore, we need an orthogonal array with 4 experiments to test all possible combinations of the 5 variables with 3 levels each. This specific orthogonal array is called L27(3^5)."
