    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 3, then there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNext, let's find the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3. Since their orders are coprime, the group is the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is an abelian group. So, this case does not give us any non-abelian groups.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. The group is a semi-direct product of P_2 and one of the Sylow 3-subgroups P_3. There are two possible semi-direct products in this case, giving us two non-abelian groups.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3. The group is a semi-direct product of one of the Sylow 2-subgroups P_2 and P_3. There are three possible semi-direct products in this case, giving us three non-abelian groups.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this case does not give us any non-abelian groups since there is no normal subgroup.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 3 = 5 distinct non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nThe list of these groups is as follows:\n\n1. The semi-direct product of QD16 (Quaternion Dihedral group of order 16) and Z3 (Cyclic group of order 3).\n2. The semi-direct product of D16 (Dihedral group of order 16) and Z3 (Cyclic group of order 3).\n3. The semi-direct product of Z4 x Z4 (Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4) and Z3 (Cyclic group of order 3).\n4. The semi-direct product of Z2 x D8 (Direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a dihedral group of order 8) and Z3 (Cyclic group of order 3).\n5. The semi-direct product of Z8 x Z2 (Direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2) and Z3 (Cyclic group of order 3)."
