    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve on mixed-integer programming:\n\nA company produces three different products, and the production plan for next week calls for at least 500 units of product 1, 300 units of product 2, and 700 units of product 3. The company has 5 machines that can be used for production. Each machine can produce any of the products, but not all products are compatible with every machine. The following table shows the maximum number of units that each machine can produce for each product:\n\n|         | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 | Machine 5 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product 1 | 150       | 100       | 180       | 90        | 140       |\n| Product 2 | 90        | 80        | 140       | 200       | 110       |\n| Product 3 | 120       | 90        | 110       | 100       | 140       |\n\nEach machine can run for at most 8 hours per day. The company wants to minimize the total number of hours used for production.\n\nFormulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming problem and solve for the optimal production plan to meet the next week's requirement while minimizing the number of machine hours used.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this problem as a mixed-integer programming problem, we need to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet x_ij be the number of hours machine i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) works on product j (j = 1, 2, 3).\n\nObjective function: Minimize the total number of hours used for production.\nMinimize Z = x_11 + x_12 + x_13 + x_21 + x_22 + x_23 + x_31 + x_32 + x_33 + x_41 + x_42 + x_43 + x_51 + x_52 + x_53\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Production requirements:\n(150 * x_11) + (100 * x_21) + (180 * x_31) + (90 * x_41) + (140 * x_51) >= 500 (Product 1)\n(90 * x_12) + (80 * x_22) + (140 * x_32) + (200 * x_42) + (110 * x_52) >= 300 (Product 2)\n(120 * x_13) + (90 * x_23) + (110 * x_33) + (100 * x_43) + (140 * x_53) >= 700 (Product 3)\n\n2. Machine hour constraints:\nx_11 + x_12 + x_13 <= 8 (Machine 1)\nx_21 + x_22 + x_23 <= 8 (Machine 2)\nx_31 + x_32 + x_33 <= 8 (Machine 3)\nx_41 + x_42 + x_43 <= 8 (Machine 4)\nx_51 + x_52 + x_53 <= 8 (Machine 5)\n\n3. Non-negativity constraints:\nx_ij >= 0 for all i, j\n\nNow, we can solve this mixed-integer programming problem using an optimization solver like Gurobi, CPLEX, or GLPK. The optimal solution will give us the number of hours each machine should work on each product to meet the production requirements while minimizing the total number of machine hours used."
