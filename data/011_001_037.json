    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to select a team of 4 students from a group of 10, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (10 in this case) and k is the number of students we want to select (4 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes a factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways to select a team of 4 students from a group of 10."
