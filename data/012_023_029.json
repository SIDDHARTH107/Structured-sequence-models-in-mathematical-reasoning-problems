    "message_2": "A complete subgraph (clique) is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. In order to determine the maximum size of a complete subgraph in a graph G with seven vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nThe Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes and m > n pigeons, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the pigeonholes represent the vertices in the subgraph, and the pigeons represent the edges connecting the vertices.\n\nSince each vertex in G has a degree of 3, there are a total of (7 * 3) / 2 = 10.5 edges in the graph. However, since the number of edges must be an integer, we can conclude that the graph G is not a simple graph (i.e., it contains loops or multiple edges between vertices).\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum size of a complete subgraph in G. If the maximum size of a complete subgraph is k, then the number of edges in this subgraph is k * (k - 1) / 2.\n\nLet's test different values of k:\n\n1. For k = 3 (a triangle), the number of edges is 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3 edges. This is possible in G since each vertex has a degree of 3.\n\n2. For k = 4 (a complete graph with 4 vertices), the number of edges is 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6 edges. This is also possible in G since each vertex has a degree of 3, and we can have at most 3 * 7 / 2 = 10.5 edges in G.\n\n3. For k = 5 (a complete graph with 5 vertices), the number of edges is 5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10 edges. This is not possible in G since each vertex has a degree of 3, and we can have at most 3 * 7 / 2 = 10.5 edges in G. Moreover, if we try to form a complete graph with 5 vertices, at least one vertex will have a degree greater than 3, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nTherefore, the maximum size of a complete subgraph (clique) that can be found in this graph G is 4."
