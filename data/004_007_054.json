    "message_2": "To find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) using the chain rule, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) first.\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x - 7)^3.\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\nf'(x) = d/dx[(3x^2 + 5x - 7)^3] = 3(3x^2 + 5x - 7)^2 * d/dx(3x^2 + 5x - 7)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function, 3x^2 + 5x - 7:\nd/dx(3x^2 + 5x - 7) = 6x + 5\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for f'(x):\nf'(x) = 3(3x^2 + 5x - 7)^2 * (6x + 5)\n\nNext, let's find the derivative of g(x) = 2x - 1:\ng'(x) = d/dx(2x - 1) = 2\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) using the chain rule:\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for f'(x) and g'(x) that we found earlier:\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = 3(3(2x - 1)^2 + 5(2x - 1) - 7)^2 * (6(2x - 1) + 5) * 2\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = 3(12x^2 - 4x + 1 + 10x - 5 - 7)^2 * (12x - 6 + 5) * 2\n\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = 3(12x^2 + 6x - 11)^2 * (12x - 1) * 2\n\nThis is the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) using the chain rule."
