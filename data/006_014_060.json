    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of exactly 3 failures occurring in the system over a period of 10 days, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 10 days)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 3 failures)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the failure rate of 0.05)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate \"n choose k\", which is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time:\n\nn choose k = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nFor our problem:\n\nn choose k = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n           = 10! / (3!7!)\n           = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(7*6*5*4*3*2*1))\n           = (10*9*8) / (3*2*1)\n           = 120\n\nNow we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 120 * (0.05)^3 * (1-0.05)^(10-3)\n        = 120 * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^7\n        â‰ˆ 0.1398\n\nSo the probability of exactly 3 failures occurring in the system over a period of 10 days is approximately 0.1398 or 13.98%."
