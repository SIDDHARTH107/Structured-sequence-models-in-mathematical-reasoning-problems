    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products - A and B. The production of A requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor time while the production of B requires 3 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time. The factory has 80 hours of machine time and 100 hours of labor time available every day. Product A earns a profit of $10 per unit while product B earns a profit of $15 per unit. Determine the number of units of product A and B the factory should produce every day to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are given by the available machine time and labor time:\n\nMachine time: 2x + 3y ≤ 80\nLabor time: 4x + 3y ≤ 100\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\ny ≤ (80 - 2x) / 3 (from the machine time constraint)\ny ≤ (100 - 4x) / 3 (from the labor time constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequalities as equalities and solving for x and y:\n\n1) x = 0, y = (80 - 2x) / 3 => y = 80 / 3\n2) x = 0, y = (100 - 4x) / 3 => y = 100 / 3\n3) y = 0, x = (80 - 3y) / 2 => x = 80 / 2\n4) y = 0, x = (100 - 3y) / 4 => x = 100 / 4\n\nCorner points:\n(0, 80/3), (0, 100/3), (80/2, 0), (100/4, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\n1) Profit(0, 80/3) = 10(0) + 15(80/3) = 400\n2) Profit(0, 100/3) = 10(0) + 15(100/3) = 500\n3) Profit(80/2, 0) = 10(80/2) + 15(0) = 400\n4) Profit(100/4, 0) = 10(100/4) + 15(0) = 250\n\nThe maximum profit is $500, which occurs when the factory produces 0 units of product A and 100/3 (approximately 33.33) units of product B. However, since the factory cannot produce a fraction of a unit, it should produce 0 units of product A and 33 units of product B to maximize its profit."
