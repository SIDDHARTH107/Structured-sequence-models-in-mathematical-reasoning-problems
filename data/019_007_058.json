    "message_1": "Consider the following non-monotonic logic rule:\n \n- If the sky is blue, then the grass is green, unless it is winter.\n \nLet P be the proposition \"the sky is blue\" and Q be the proposition \"the grass is green\". Given that it is winter and Q is false, what can we deduce about P?",
    "message_2": "Given that it is winter and Q (the grass is green) is false, we cannot make a definitive deduction about P (the sky is blue) based on the non-monotonic logic rule. \n\nThe rule states that if the sky is blue (P), then the grass is green (Q), unless it is winter. Since it is winter, the rule's exception applies, and the relationship between P and Q is no longer guaranteed. Therefore, the sky could be blue (P is true) or not blue (P is false), and we cannot deduce a specific truth value for P based on the given information."
