    "message_2": "In linear logic, the linear implication $A \\multimap B$ is defined as the set of pairs $(x, y)$ such that for every pair $(a, b) \\in A$, there exists a pair $(b, c) \\in B$ with $x = a$ and $y = c$. In other words, we want to find all pairs $(x, y)$ such that if $x$ is related to some element in $A$, then $y$ is related to the corresponding element in $B$.\n\nLet's examine the given sets $A$ and $B$:\n\n$A = \\{(1, 5), (2, 3)\\}$\n\n$B = \\{(5, 7), (1, 2), (2, 4)\\}$\n\nNow, let's find the linear implication $A \\multimap B$:\n\n1. For the pair $(1, 5) \\in A$, we have $(5, 7) \\in B$. Thus, we can form the pair $(1, 7)$ for the linear implication.\n2. For the pair $(2, 3) \\in A$, we have $(3, c) \\notin B$ for any $c$. Therefore, we cannot form any new pairs for the linear implication based on this pair.\n\nSo, the linear implication $A \\multimap B$ is:\n\n$A \\multimap B = \\{(1, 7)\\}$"
