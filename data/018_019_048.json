    "message_2": "First, let's find (A Δ B) Δ C.\n\nRecall that the symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nA Δ B = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9})\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - {5}\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's find (A Δ B) Δ C:\n\n(A Δ B) Δ C = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} ∪ {2, 3, 5, 8}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} ∩ {2, 3, 5, 8})\n(A Δ B) Δ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - {2, 3, 8}\n(A Δ B) Δ C = {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative.
