    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to sell a car worth $10,000. The principal and the agent each have a private valuation of the car. The principal values the car at $10,000, while the agent values it at $8,000. The agent's effort level affects the probability of selling the car, and the sale price obtained from the sale. If the agent puts in high effort, there is a 75% chance that the car will sell for the full $10,000, and a 25% chance that it will sell for $8,000. If the agent puts in low effort, there is a 50% chance the car will sell for $10,000 and a 50% chance it will not be sold at all. What is the optimal effort level for the agent, and what is the expected payment to the agent by the principal?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal effort level for the agent, we need to compare the expected outcomes for both high effort and low effort.\n\nHigh effort:\nExpected sale price = 0.75 * $10,000 + 0.25 * $8,000 = $7,500 + $2,000 = $9,500\n\nLow effort:\nExpected sale price = 0.5 * $10,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $5,000 + $0 = $5,000\n\nThe optimal effort level for the agent is high effort, as it results in a higher expected sale price ($9,500) compared to low effort ($5,000).\n\nNow, let's determine the expected payment to the agent by the principal. We assume that the principal will pay the agent a percentage of the sale price as a commission. Let's denote this percentage as x.\n\nExpected payment for high effort = x * $9,500\nExpected payment for low effort = x * $5,000\n\nSince the agent values the car at $8,000, they will prefer high effort if the expected payment for high effort is greater than the expected payment for low effort plus the difference in their valuation of the car.\n\nx * $9,500 > x * $5,000 + ($10,000 - $8,000)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx > 2,000 / 4,500\nx > 4/9\n\nSo, the principal should pay the agent a commission rate greater than 4/9 (approximately 44.44%) of the sale price to incentivize the agent to put in high effort. The expected payment to the agent by the principal would then be:\n\nExpected payment = x * $9,500, where x > 4/9"
