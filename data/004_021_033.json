    "message_2": "First, we need to find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12)\n\nUsing the power rule again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 48(2) + 12\n\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 96 + 12\n\nf''(2) = 144 - 96 + 12\n\nf''(2) = 60\n\nSo, the value of the second derivative of the function f(x) at x = 2 is 60."
