    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between three mutually tangent circles with new circles that are tangent to the original three. In this problem, we are given the radii of the first three circles as 1, 1, and 2.\n\nTo find the radius of the 100th circle, we can use Descartes' Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures of four mutually tangent circles. The curvature of a circle is defined as the reciprocal of its radius (k = 1/r). Let k1, k2, and k3 be the curvatures of the first three circles, and let k4 be the curvature of the fourth circle (the first circle in the gasket). Descartes' Circle Theorem states that:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2 * (k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nWe know the radii of the first three circles, so we can find their curvatures:\n\nk1 = 1/1 = 1\nk2 = 1/1 = 1\nk3 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nNow we can solve for k4:\n\n(1 + 1 + 0.5 + k4)^2 = 2 * (1^2 + 1^2 + 0.5^2 + k4^2)\n\nSimplifying and solving for k4:\n\n(2.5 + k4)^2 = 2 * (2 + 0.25 + k4^2)\n6.25 + 5k4 + k4^2 = 4.5 + 2k4^2\n1.75 = k4^2 - 5k4 + 2k4^2\n0 = 2k4^2 - 5k4 - 1.75\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for k4:\n\nk4 = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nk4 = (5 ± √(25 + 14)) / 4\nk4 ≈ 1.75 or k4 ≈ -0.5\n\nSince the curvature cannot be negative, we choose the positive value:\n\nk4 ≈ 1.75\n\nNow we can find the radius of the fourth circle:\n\nr4 = 1/k4 ≈ 1/1.75 ≈ 0.5714\n\nTo find the radius of the 100th circle, we need to perform this process repeatedly. However, the Apollonian gasket construction is not a simple linear process, and finding the 100th circle's radius directly is not possible without knowing the specific arrangement of circles in the gasket.\n\nIn conclusion, we can find the radius of the fourth circle (the first circle in the gasket) using Descartes' Circle Theorem, but we cannot directly find the radius of the 100th circle without more information about the specific arrangement of circles in the Apollonian gasket."
