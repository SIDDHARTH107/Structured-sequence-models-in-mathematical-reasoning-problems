    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of x^4 in the power series expansion of (1+x+x^2)^6, we can use the multinomial theorem. The multinomial theorem states that for any positive integer n and any real numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, the expansion of (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k)^n is given by:\n\n(n! / (n_1! * n_2! * ... * n_k!)) * (a_1^n_1) * (a_2^n_2) * ... * (a_k^n_k)\n\nwhere n_1, n_2, ..., n_k are non-negative integers such that n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k = n.\n\nIn our case, we have k = 3 (since we have three terms: 1, x, and x^2) and n = 6. We want to find the coefficient of x^4, so we need to find the terms in the expansion that result in x^4.\n\nThere are three possible ways to get x^4 in the expansion:\n\n1. Two x^2 terms: (x^2)^2 = x^4. In this case, n_1 = 4 (four 1's), n_2 = 0 (no x's), and n_3 = 2 (two x^2's). Using the multinomial theorem, the coefficient is:\n\n(6! / (4! * 0! * 2!)) = (720 / (24 * 1 * 2)) = 15\n\n2. Four x terms: (x)^4 = x^4. In this case, n_1 = 2 (two 1's), n_2 = 4 (four x's), and n_3 = 0 (no x^2's). Using the multinomial theorem, the coefficient is:\n\n(6! / (2! * 4! * 0!)) = (720 / (2 * 24 * 1)) = 15\n\n3. One 1 term, one x term, and one x^2 term: 1 * x * x^2 = x^3. However, this combination does not result in x^4, so we can ignore it.\n\nAdding the coefficients from cases 1 and 2, we get the total coefficient of x^4 in the expansion:\n\n15 + 15 = 30\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^4 in the power series expansion of (1+x+x^2)^6 is 30."
