    "message_1": "Alice and Bob want to establish a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice's public key is 7 and her private key is 9. Bob's public key is 11 and his private key is 10. Using this information, what is the shared secret key that they will use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes the shared secret key as (Bob's public key)^Alice's private key, which is 11^9.\n2. Bob computes the shared secret key as (Alice's public key)^Bob's private key, which is 7^10.\n\nSince the Diffie-Hellman key exchange ensures that both of these calculations result in the same shared secret key, we only need to compute one of them. Let's compute Alice's calculation:\n\n11^9 = 2357947691\n\nSo, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their communication is 2357947691."
