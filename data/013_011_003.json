Station A chooses to sell gasoline for $2 a gallon, while Station B chooses to sell gasoline for $1.50 a gallon.\n\nWhat is the most profitable decision for Station A if it assumes that Station B will continue to sell gasoline for $1.50 a gallon?\n\nAssume that demand for gasoline in the town is given by the inverse demand function P = 3 - Q, where P is the price per gallon and Q is the total quantity demanded by customers at both stations.",
    "message_2": "To find the most profitable decision for Station A, we need to first find the demand for gasoline at both stations given their prices and the inverse demand function.\n\nThe inverse demand function is P = 3 - Q. Since Station B is selling gasoline at $1.50 a gallon, we can find the quantity demanded for Station B as follows:\n\n1.50 = 3 - Q_B\nQ_B = 3 - 1.50\nQ_B = 1.50\n\nNow, let's find the quantity demanded for Station A when it sells gasoline at $2 a gallon:\n\n2 = 3 - Q_A\nQ_A = 3 - 2\nQ_A = 1\n\nNow we have the quantity demanded for both stations: Q_A = 1 and Q_B = 1.50. The total quantity demanded in the town is Q = Q_A + Q_B = 1 + 1.50 = 2.50.\n\nNext, we need to find the profit for Station A. Profit is given by the formula:\n\nProfit = (Price - Cost) * Quantity\n\nFor Station A, the price is $2 a gallon, and the cost is $1 a gallon. So the profit for Station A is:\n\nProfit_A = (2 - 1) * 1\nProfit_A = 1 * 1\nProfit_A = $1\n\nNow, let's consider the possible options for Station A to increase its profit. It can either increase its price or decrease it to attract more customers. Let's analyze both options:\n\n1. If Station A increases its price, it will lose customers to Station B, which has a lower price. This will result in a decrease in quantity demanded for Station A and a decrease in profit.\n\n2. If Station A decreases its price, it can potentially attract more customers from Station B. Let's assume Station A lowers its price to $1.75 a gallon. Now we need to find the new quantity demanded for both stations:\n\n1.75 = 3 - Q_A\nQ_A = 3 - 1.75\nQ_A = 1.25\n\nFor Station B, the price remains the same, so the quantity demanded is still 1.50. The total quantity demanded in the town is now Q = Q_A + Q_B = 1.25 + 1.50 = 2.75.\n\nNow let's calculate the new profit for Station A:\n\nProfit_A = (1.75 - 1) * 1.25\nProfit_A = 0.75 * 1.25\nProfit_A = $0.9375\n\nBy lowering its price to $1.75 a gallon, Station A increases its profit from $1 to $0.9375. However, this is still lower than the initial profit. Therefore, the most profitable decision for Station A, assuming that Station B continues to sell gasoline at $1.50 a gallon, is to maintain its current price of $2 a gallon."
