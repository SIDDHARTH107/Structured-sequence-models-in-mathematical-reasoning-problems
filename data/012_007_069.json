Find the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from city A to city E if the flow capacity of each road is as follows:\n\n- From city A to city B: 8 units\n- From city A to city C: 12 units\n- From city B to city C: 4 units\n- From city B to city D: 10 units\n- From city C to city D: 9 units\n- From city C to city E: 14 units\n- From city D to city E: 12 units\n\nAssume that the flow of goods is unidirectional and cannot be redirected once it starts flowing through a particular road.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow of goods from city A to city E, we need to analyze the flow capacities of the roads and determine the bottleneck capacity in the network. We can do this by looking at the different paths from city A to city E and their capacities.\n\nThere are three possible paths from city A to city E:\n\n1. A -> B -> D -> E\n2. A -> C -> D -> E\n3. A -> C -> E\n\nLet's analyze the flow capacities of each path:\n\n1. A -> B -> D -> E\n   Flow capacities: 8 (A to B), 10 (B to D), 12 (D to E)\n   Bottleneck capacity: 8 units (minimum capacity in the path)\n\n2. A -> C -> D -> E\n   Flow capacities: 12 (A to C), 9 (C to D), 12 (D to E)\n   Bottleneck capacity: 9 units (minimum capacity in the path)\n\n3. A -> C -> E\n   Flow capacities: 12 (A to C), 14 (C to E)\n   Bottleneck capacity: 12 units (minimum capacity in the path)\n\nNow, let's add up the bottleneck capacities of each path:\n\n8 units (path 1) + 9 units (path 2) + 12 units (path 3) = 29 units\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the flow capacities from city A to city B and city A to city C are limited. The total flow capacity from city A is 20 units (8 units to city B and 12 units to city C). Therefore, the maximum flow of goods from city A to city E cannot exceed 20 units.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from city A to city E is 20 units."
