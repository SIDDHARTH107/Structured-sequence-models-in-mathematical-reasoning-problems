    "message_2": "In symplectic geometry, the volume of a solid torus can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a torus in Euclidean geometry. The volume of a torus is given by:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In this case, R = 3 and r = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 3 * 2^2\nV = 2 * π^2 * 3 * 4\nV = 24 * π^2\n\nSo, the volume of the solid torus with major radius 3 and minor radius 2 in symplectic geometry is 24π^2 cubic units."
