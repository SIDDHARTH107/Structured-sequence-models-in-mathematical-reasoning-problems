    "message_2": "Since f(z) is analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nGiven u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2, we can compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x and ∂u/∂y = -2y\n\nNow we need to find v(x, y) such that it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂v/∂y = 2x and -∂v/∂x = -2y\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to y, we get:\n\nv(x, y) = 2xy + g(x)\n\nwhere g(x) is an arbitrary function of x.\n\nNow, differentiating v(x, y) with respect to x, we get:\n\n∂v/∂x = 2y + g'(x)\n\nFrom the second Cauchy-Riemann equation, we have:\n\n-2y = -2y + g'(x)\n\nThis implies that g'(x) = 0, which means g(x) is a constant. Let's call this constant C.\n\nSo, v(x, y) = 2xy + C\n\nNow, we are given that f(1+i) = 2. Plugging x = 1 and y = 1 into the expressions for u(x, y) and v(x, y), we get:\n\nu(1, 1) = 1^2 - 1^2 = 0\nv(1, 1) = 2(1)(1) + C = 2 + C\n\nSince f(1+i) = 2, we have 0 + i(2+C) = 2, which implies that C = 0.\n\nThus, v(x, y) = 2xy.\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of v(1, i):\n\nv(1, i) = 2(1)(i) = 2i"
