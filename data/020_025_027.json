The distances (in miles) between the five locations are as follows:\n\n- Location 1 to Location 2: 3 miles\n- Location 1 to Location 3: 5 miles\n- Location 1 to Location 4: 2 miles\n- Location 1 to Location 5: 4 miles\n- Location 2 to Location 3: 4 miles\n- Location 2 to Location 4: 5 miles\n- Location 2 to Location 5: 6 miles\n- Location 3 to Location 4: 3 miles\n- Location 3 to Location 5: 7 miles\n- Location 4 to Location 5: 4 miles\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery company to take to minimize the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm. Starting from Location 1, we will visit the nearest unvisited location until all locations have been visited. \n\n1. From Location 1, the nearest location is Location 4 (2 miles).\n2. From Location 4, the nearest unvisited location is Location 2 (5 miles).\n3. From Location 2, the nearest unvisited location is Location 3 (4 miles).\n4. From Location 3, the nearest unvisited location is Location 5 (7 miles).\n\nSo, the optimal route is: Location 1 → Location 4 → Location 2 → Location 3 → Location 5.\n\nThe total distance traveled is: 2 miles (1 to 4) + 5 miles (4 to 2) + 4 miles (2 to 3) + 7 miles (3 to 5) = 18 miles."
