    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 fishermen who share a lake with a maximum capacity of 100 fish. Each fisherman chooses how much effort to put in fishing, with the effort level ranging from 0 to 10. If the total effort level of all fishermen is less than or equal to 50, then each fisherman earns $10 per fish caught. However, if the total effort level exceeds 50, the fish population becomes overexploited and each fisherman earns only $5 per fish caught. Find the Nash equilibrium of this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to determine the best response of each fisherman to the strategies of the other fishermen, such that no fisherman has an incentive to change their strategy.\n\nLet e_i be the effort level of fisherman i, and let E be the total effort level of all fishermen. The payoff for fisherman i is given by:\n\nPayoff_i = (e_i / E) * (number of fish caught) * (price per fish)\n\nIf E <= 50, the price per fish is $10, and if E > 50, the price per fish is $5. We will analyze these two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: E <= 50\nIn this case, the payoff for fisherman i is:\n\nPayoff_i = (e_i / E) * 100 * 10 = 1000 * (e_i / E)\n\nEach fisherman wants to maximize their payoff. If a fisherman increases their effort level, their payoff will increase as long as the total effort level remains below or equal to 50. Therefore, in equilibrium, each fisherman will choose an effort level of 10, resulting in a total effort level of 50. The Nash equilibrium in this case is (10, 10, 10, 10, 10).\n\nCase 2: E > 50\nIn this case, the payoff for fisherman i is:\n\nPayoff_i = (e_i / E) * 100 * 5 = 500 * (e_i / E)\n\nIf a fisherman increases their effort level, their payoff will decrease due to overexploitation of the fish population. Therefore, no fisherman has an incentive to increase their effort level beyond 10. However, if a fisherman decreases their effort level, their payoff will increase as long as the total effort level remains above 50. This means that there is no stable Nash equilibrium in this case, as each fisherman has an incentive to decrease their effort level.\n\nIn conclusion, the Nash equilibrium of this game is when each fisherman chooses an effort level of 10, resulting in a total effort level of 50 and a payoff of 200 for each fisherman. The Nash equilibrium is (10, 10, 10, 10, 10)."
