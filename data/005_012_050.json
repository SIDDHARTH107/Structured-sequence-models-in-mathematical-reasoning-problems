    "message_1": "What is the minimum sample size required to estimate the mean height of students in a university, with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 2 cm, given that the population standard deviation is known to be 5 cm?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum sample size required, we can use the formula for the sample size in a single proportion estimation:\n\nn = (Z^2 * σ^2) / E^2\n\nwhere n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the population standard deviation, and E is the margin of error.\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard normal distribution table). The population standard deviation (σ) is given as 5 cm, and the margin of error (E) is given as 2 cm.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 5^2) / 2^2\nn = (3.8416 * 25) / 4\nn = 96.04 / 4\nn = 24.01\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person in the sample, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size required is 25 students."
