    "message_2": "Let's consider the 2 people who insist on sitting next to each other as a single unit. Now, we have 3 units to arrange: the pair and the other 2 individuals.\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these 3 units, which is equal to 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, within the pair, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the 2 people, which is equal to 2 × 1 = 2 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to seat the 4 people with the condition that the 2 people sit next to each other is:\n\n3! × 2! = 6 × 2 = 12 ways."
