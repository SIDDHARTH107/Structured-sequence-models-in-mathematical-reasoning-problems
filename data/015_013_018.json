We will find the first 5 terms of the sequence x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄ rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\nx₀ = 0.5 (given)\n\nx₁ = 4 * x₀ * (1 - x₀) = 4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 4 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 1.0000\n\nx₂ = 4 * x₁ * (1 - x₁) = 4 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 4 * 1 * 0 = 0.0000\n\nx₃ = 4 * x₂ * (1 - x₂) = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 4 * 0 * 1 = 0.0000\n\nx₄ = 4 * x₃ * (1 - x₃) = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 4 * 0 * 1 = 0.0000\n\nSo, the first 5 terms of the sequence are x₀ = 0.5000, x₁ = 1.0000, x₂ = 0.0000, x₃ = 0.0000, and x₄ = 0.0000."
