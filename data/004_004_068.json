    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 3x - 1, bounded by the x-axis and the two vertical lines x=2 and x=5, we will use the definite integral. The definite integral of a function over an interval [a, b] represents the signed area between the curve and the x-axis over that interval.\n\nThe definite integral of y = x^2 + 3x - 1 from x = 2 to x = 5 is given by:\n\n∫(x^2 + 3x - 1) dx from 2 to 5\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n∫(x^2 + 3x - 1) dx = (1/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds x = 5 and x = 2:\n\n[(1/3)(5)^3 + (3/2)(5)^2 - (5)] - [(1/3)(2)^3 + (3/2)(2)^2 - (2)]\n\n= [(1/3)(125) + (3/2)(25) - 5] - [(1/3)(8) + (3/2)(4) - 2]\n\n= [41.67 + 37.5 - 5] - [2.67 + 6 - 2]\n\n= [74.17] - [6.67]\n\n= 67.5\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 3x - 1, bounded by the x-axis and the two vertical lines x=2 and x=5, is 67.5 square units."
