    "message_1": "Suppose we have a surface given by the equation:\n\nz = x^2 - 2y^2\n\nFind the principal curvatures and their corresponding directions at the point (1, -1, -1).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and their corresponding directions at the point (1, -1, -1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - 2v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -4v)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -4)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = -8uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 16v^2\n\nAt the point (1, -1, -1), we have:\n\nE = 5\nF = 8\nG = 17\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = r_uu • N = 2N_z\nf = r_uv • N = 0\ng = r_vv • N = -4N_z\n\nWe need to find the normal vector N at the point (1, -1, -1). To do this, we compute the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (8v, -4u, 1)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, -1), we have:\n\nN = (8, 4, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients e, f, and g:\n\ne = 2N_z = 2\nf = 0\ng = -4N_z = -4\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures using the formula:\n\nk_1, k_2 = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2) ± sqrt(((eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2))^2 - (eG - 2fF + gE) / (EG - F^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk_1, k_2 = (-8 / 41) ± sqrt(((-8 / 41)^2 - (2 * 17 - 4 * 8) / 41))\n\nk_1, k_2 = -8/41 ± sqrt(64/1681 + 8/41)\n\nk_1 ≈ -0.195\nk_2 ≈ -2.049\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding directions by solving the following eigenvalue problem:\n\n((E - k_i) * e - F * f) * x + (F * e - F * (G - k_i)) * y = 0\n(F * (E - k_i) - F * f) * x + ((G - k_i) * g - F^2) * y = 0\n\nFor k_1 ≈ -0.195:\n\n(5 + 0.195) * x - 8 * y = 0\n8 * x + (17 + 0.195) * y = 0\n\nThe corresponding direction for k_1 is given by the eigenvector (1, 1).\n\nFor k_2 ≈ -2.049:\n\n(5 + 2.049) * x - 8 * y = 0\n8 * x + (17 + 2.049) * y = 0\n\nThe corresponding direction for k_2 is given by the eigenvector (1, -1).\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, -1) are k_1 ≈ -0.195 and k_2 ≈ -2.049, with corresponding directions (1, 1) and (1, -1), respectively."
