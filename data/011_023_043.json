    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, we need to consider the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. The maximum degree (Δ) is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we have a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, each vertex has a degree of 6 (since there are 7 vertices in total). According to the greedy coloring algorithm, we can color a graph with Δ + 1 colors, where Δ is the maximum degree of the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, is 6 + 1 = 7 colors."
