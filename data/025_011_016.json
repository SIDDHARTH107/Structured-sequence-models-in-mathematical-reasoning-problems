    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (-1, 5) and (2, 1), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of the two points:\n\nm = (1 - 5) / (2 - (-1)) = (-4) / (3) = -4/3\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (-1, 5) and the slope -4/3:\n\ny - 5 = -4/3(x - (-1))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = -4/3(x + 1)\n\nNow, distribute -4/3:\n\ny - 5 = -4/3x - 4/3\n\nAdd 5 to both sides to isolate y:\n\ny = -4/3x - 4/3 + 5\n\nTo make it easier to read, let's convert 5 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\ny = -4/3x - 4/3 + 15/3\n\nCombine the constants:\n\ny = -4/3x + 11/3\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (-1, 5) and (2, 1) is:\n\ny = -4/3x + 11/3"
