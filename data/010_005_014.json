    "message_2": "Yes, S is a connected set, and it is also path-connected.\n\nS is the set of all points (x, y) in the plane such that x and y are rational numbers and x² + y² < 5. Geometrically, this set represents the interior of a circle with radius sqrt(5) centered at the origin, but only including points with rational coordinates.\n\nTo show that S is connected, we need to show that it cannot be separated into two disjoint nonempty open sets. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that S can be separated into two disjoint nonempty open sets U and V. Then, there must exist points (x1, y1) ∈ U and (x2, y2) ∈ V such that x1, y1, x2, and y2 are all rational numbers. Since U and V are open sets, there exist open balls B1 and B2 centered at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively, with rational radii r1 and r2, such that B1 ⊆ U and B2 ⊆ V.\n\nNow, consider the line segment L connecting (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Since x1, y1, x2, and y2 are all rational numbers, there must exist a point (x, y) ∈ L such that x and y are irrational numbers. This is because the line segment L contains infinitely many points, and only countably many of them can have rational coordinates.\n\nSince (x, y) is an irrational point on L, it cannot belong to either B1 or B2, as both of these balls contain only points with rational coordinates. However, (x, y) must belong to the interior of the circle defined by x² + y² < 5, as L is entirely contained within this circle. This contradicts our assumption that S can be separated into two disjoint nonempty open sets U and V, as we have found a point in S that belongs to neither U nor V.\n\nTherefore, S is a connected set.\n\nTo show that S is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in S, there exists a continuous path in S connecting them. Let's consider the straight line segment L connecting (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Since S is connected, we know that L must be entirely contained within S. Moreover, L is a continuous path, as it is a straight line segment.\n\nThus, for any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in S, there exists a continuous path in S connecting them, and S is path-connected."
