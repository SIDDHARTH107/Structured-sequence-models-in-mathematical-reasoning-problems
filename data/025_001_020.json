According to Bezout's theorem, what is the degree of the intersection?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of points of intersection of C1 and C2 in the complex projective plane, we can use Bezout's theorem. Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves in the complex projective plane is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the given curves:\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0\nThe degree of C1 is the highest degree of any term in the equation, which is 2 (from x^2 and y^2 terms).\n\nC2: x^3 - y = 0\nThe degree of C2 is the highest degree of any term in the equation, which is 3 (from the x^3 term).\n\nNow, we can use Bezout's theorem to find the number of intersection points:\n\nNumber of intersection points = (degree of C1) * (degree of C2) = 2 * 3 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 points of intersection of C1 and C2 in the complex projective plane. The degree of the intersection is 6."
