    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 120 are there?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: There are 2^2 * 2 * 2 = 16 possible abelian groups of order 120.\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of groups of each prime power order. In this case, we have:\n\n   - 2^3: There are 5 groups of order 8 (Dihedral, Quaternion, and three abelian groups).\n   - 3: There is 1 group of order 3 (cyclic group).\n   - 5: There is 1 group of order 5 (cyclic group).\n\n   So, there are 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 possible non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups: 5 - 16 = -11\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of groups, there must be an error in our calculation. Let's re-examine the steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 (correct)\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: There are 2^2 * 2 * 2 = 16 possible abelian groups of order 120 (correct).\n\nThe error must be in step 3. We made an assumption that there are 5 groups of order 8, but this is incorrect. There are actually only 4 groups of order 8 (Dihedral, Quaternion, and two abelian groups). So, the correct calculation for the number of non-abelian groups of order 120 is:\n\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: 4 * 1 * 1 = 4 possible non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nNow, we can correctly subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups:\n\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups: 4 - 16 = -12\n\nAgain, we cannot have a negative number of groups. The issue is that we are double-counting some groups that are both abelian and non-abelian. To correct this, we need to add back the number of groups that are both abelian and non-abelian:\n\n5. Add back the number of groups that are both abelian and non-abelian: Since all abelian groups are also non-abelian, we need to add back the 16 abelian groups that we subtracted in step 4: -12 + 16 = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
