    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of a graph, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's list the adjacency of each vertex in the graph G:\n\nA: {B, C, E}\nB: {A, C, D}\nC: {A, B, D}\nD: {B, C, E, F}\nE: {A, D, F}\nF: {D, E, G}\nG: {F}\n\nNow, let's try to color the graph using the minimum number of colors:\n\n1. Color vertex A with color 1.\n2. Color vertex B with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A).\n3. Color vertex C with color 3 (since it's adjacent to both A and B).\n4. Color vertex D with color 1 (since it's not adjacent to A, but it's adjacent to B and C).\n5. Color vertex E with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A and D).\n6. Color vertex F with color 3 (since it's adjacent to D and E).\n7. Color vertex G with color 1 (since it's only adjacent to F).\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors, and no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph G is 3."
