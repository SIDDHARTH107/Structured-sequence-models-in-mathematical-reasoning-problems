Each unit of A requires 3 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y, while each unit of B requires 2 units of resource X and 6 units of resource Y. Suppose that the company has 300 units of resource X and 360 units of resource Y available for production. If the profit per unit of product A is $6 and $8 for product B, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
