    "message_1": "A company needs to allocate its resources to two product lines - Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A generates a profit of $80 and requires 2 hours of labor while each unit of Product B generates a profit of $120 and requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a total of 600 labor hours and wants to maximize its profits. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) can be expressed as:\nP(x, y) = 80x + 120y\n\nThe constraint on labor hours can be expressed as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 600\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraint and give the maximum value for the profit function.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint for y:\ny ≤ (600 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by taking the partial derivatives of the profit function with respect to x and y:\n\n∂P/∂x = 80\n∂P/∂y = 120\n\nSince the partial derivatives are constants, the profit function is linear, and the maximum value will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region defined by the constraint.\n\nWe can find the vertices by setting x and y to their minimum and maximum values within the constraint:\n\n1. x = 0, y = (600 - 2*0) / 3 = 200\n2. y = 0, x = (600 - 3*0) / 2 = 300\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit for each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 200) = 80*0 + 120*200 = $24,000\n2. P(300, 0) = 80*300 + 120*0 = $24,000\n\nSince both vertices give the same maximum profit, there are multiple solutions to this problem. The company can produce any combination of Product A and Product B units that satisfy the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 600 and lie on the line segment between the points (0, 200) and (300, 0)."
