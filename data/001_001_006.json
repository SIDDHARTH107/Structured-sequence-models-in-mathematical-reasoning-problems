    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n   4x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5\n   4x = 12\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n   4x / 4 = 12 / 4\n   x = 3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 3."
