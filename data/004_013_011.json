The height of the ball above the ground in meters at any time t in seconds is given by the function h(t) = -4.9t² + 30t + 50. \n\nWhat is the maximum height reached by the ball? \n\nAt what time does the ball hit the ground? \n\nWhat is the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height reached by the ball, we need to find the vertex of the parabolic function h(t) = -4.9t² + 30t + 50. The vertex of a parabola in the form of f(t) = at² + bt + c is given by the formula t_vertex = -b / 2a. In this case, a = -4.9 and b = 30.\n\nt_vertex = -30 / (2 * -4.9) = 30 / 9.8 ≈ 3.061\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height by plugging t_vertex into the height function:\n\nh(3.061) = -4.9(3.061)² + 30(3.061) + 50 ≈ 94.6\n\nThe maximum height reached by the ball is approximately 94.6 meters.\n\nTo find the time when the ball hits the ground, we need to find the time when h(t) = 0:\n\n0 = -4.9t² + 30t + 50\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nt = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nt = (-30 ± √(30² - 4(-4.9)(50))) / (2 * -4.9)\n\nt = (-30 ± √(900 + 980)) / -9.8\n\nt = (-30 ± √1880) / -9.8\n\nThere are two possible solutions for t:\n\nt1 = (-30 + √1880) / -9.8 ≈ -1.106 (This solution is not valid since time cannot be negative)\n\nt2 = (-30 - √1880) / -9.8 ≈ 6.171\n\nThe ball hits the ground at approximately t = 6.171 seconds.\n\nTo find the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground, we need to find the derivative of the height function with respect to time, which represents the velocity function:\n\nv(t) = dh/dt = -9.8t + 30\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at t = 6.171:\n\nv(6.171) = -9.8(6.171) + 30 ≈ -30.5\n\nThe velocity of the ball when it hits the ground is approximately -30.5 meters per second (negative sign indicates the downward direction)."
