    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Set initial solution x0, tabu list size, maximum number of iterations, and other parameters.\n2. Evaluation: Calculate the objective function value f(x) for the current solution.\n3. Neighborhood search: Generate a set of neighboring solutions from the current solution.\n4. Selection: Choose the best solution from the neighboring solutions that is not in the tabu list.\n5. Update: Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list exceeds the specified size.\n6. Termination: If the maximum number of iterations is reached, stop and return the best solution found. Otherwise, go back to step 2.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the tabu search algorithm for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 3 * x**2 + 2 * x + 1\n\ndef generate_neighbors(x, step_size=0.1, lower_bound=-0.5, upper_bound=1.5):\n    neighbors = [x - step_size, x + step_size]\n    return [max(min(neighbor, upper_bound), lower_bound) for neighbor in neighbors]\n\ndef tabu_search(iterations=100, tabu_list_size=10, step_size=0.1):\n    x = random.uniform(-0.5, 1.5)\n    best_solution = x\n    best_value = f(x)\n    tabu_list = []\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        neighbors = generate_neighbors(x, step_size)\n        next_x = None\n        next_value = float('inf')\n\n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            if neighbor not in tabu_list and f(neighbor) < next_value:\n                next_x = neighbor\n                next_value = f(neighbor)\n\n        if next_value < best_value:\n            best_solution = next_x\n            best_value = next_value\n\n        x = next_x\n        tabu_list.append(x)\n\n        if len(tabu_list) > tabu_list_size:\n            tabu_list.pop(0)\n\n    return best_solution, best_value\n\noptimal_x, optimal_value = tabu_search()\nprint(\"Optimal x:\", optimal_x)\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x):\", optimal_value)\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a random initial solution and a fixed step size for generating neighboring solutions. The algorithm iterates 100 times and maintains a tabu list of size 10. The optimal value of x and the corresponding minimum value of f(x) are returned at the end of the search. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random initial solution and the nature of the tabu search algorithm."
