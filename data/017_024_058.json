    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 96 are there, and can you provide an example of one such group?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find the number of all groups of order 96 and then subtract the number of abelian groups of order 96.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 96 = (p(5) - 1) * (p(1) - 1) = (7 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 6\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 96. The number of abelian groups of a given order is equal to the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. In this case, we have the exponents 5 and 1. The partitions of 5 are:\n\n5\n4 + 1\n3 + 2\n3 + 1 + 1\n2 + 2 + 1\n2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nSince the exponent of 3 is 1, there is only one partition for it: 1.\n\nSo, the number of abelian groups of order 96 is the product of the number of partitions of the exponents, which is 7 * 1 = 7.\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups of order 96 = Total number of groups - Number of abelian groups = 6 - 7 = -1\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect, as there cannot be a negative number of groups. The error comes from the formula used to calculate the total number of groups of order 96, which is not applicable in this case. Instead, we can use the fact that there are 7 abelian groups of order 96 and that there are 15 groups of order 96 in total (as per the classification of finite groups). Therefore:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups of order 96 = Total number of groups - Number of abelian groups = 15 - 7 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nAn example of a non-abelian group of order 96 is the semidirect product of Z_32 and Z_3, denoted as Z_32 ⋊ Z_3, where Z_n represents the cyclic group of order n."
