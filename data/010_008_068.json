    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of triangular faces as T. We can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs to solve this problem. The formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn our case, the simplicial complex has 6 vertices (V = 6) and 10 edges (E = 10). Since there are no higher-dimensional faces, each face is either a triangle or the outer face. Let's denote the number of triangular faces as T and the outer face as F_out. Then, the total number of faces is F = T + 1 (including the outer face).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Euler's formula:\n\n6 - 10 + (T + 1) = 2\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT + 1 = 6\nT = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 triangular faces in this simplicial complex."
