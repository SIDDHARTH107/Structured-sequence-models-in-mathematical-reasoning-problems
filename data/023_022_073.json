Assume that the underlying asset's stock price follows a lognormal process with a drift rate of 5% and a volatility of 20%, the strike price is $100, the risk-free interest rate is 3%, and the time to maturity is 1 year.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2xe^(-x). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x)e^(-2πikx)]dx\n\nFor f(x) = 2xe^(-x), the Fourier transform F(k) is:\n\nF(k) = ∫[2xe^(-x)e^(-2πikx)]dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 2x and dv = e^(-x - 2πikx)dx. Then, du = 2dx and v = -e^(-x - 2πikx)/(1 + 2πik).\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nF(k) = -2x * e^(-x - 2πikx)/(1 + 2πik) | from 0 to ∞ - ∫[-2e^(-x - 2πikx)/(1 + 2πik)]dx\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as x goes to infinity. The second term becomes:\n\nF(k) = 2/(1 + 2πik) * ∫[e^(-x - 2πikx)]dx\n\nNow, integrate with respect to x:\n\nF(k) = 2/(1 + 2πik) * [-e^(-x - 2πikx)/(1 + 2πik)] | from 0 to ∞\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\nF(k) = 2/(1 + 2πik) * [1/(1 + 2πik)]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(x) = 2xe^(-x) is:\n\nF(k) = 2/(1 + 2πik)^2\n\nNow, let's use this Fourier transform to calculate the option price of a European call option. We can use the characteristic function of the lognormal process and the risk-neutral pricing formula.\n\nLet S be the stock price, K be the strike price, r be the risk-free interest rate, σ be the volatility, and T be the time to maturity. In our case, S follows a lognormal process with drift rate 5% and volatility 20%, K = $100, r = 3%, and T = 1 year.\n\nThe characteristic function of the lognormal process is given by:\n\nΦ(u) = exp(iu(log(S) + (r - 0.5σ^2)T) - 0.5u^2σ^2T)\n\nUsing the risk-neutral pricing formula, the call option price C can be calculated as:\n\nC = e^(-rT) * (1/π) * ∫[Re{e^(-iu(log(K))Φ(-u)F(u)}]du\n\nWe can plug in the values for S, K, r, σ, and T, and use the Fourier transform F(k) we found earlier to compute the integral numerically. This will give us the option price of the European call option."
