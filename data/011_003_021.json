    "message_2": "Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which the first and last number in each row is 1, and each of the other numbers is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first seven rows of Pascal's Triangle are:\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1  1\nRow 3: 1  2  1\nRow 4: 1  3  3  1\nRow 5: 1  4  6  4  1\nRow 6: 1  5 10 10  5  1\nRow 7: 1  6 15 20 15  6  1\n\nTo find the sum of the first seven rows, we add up all the numbers in each row:\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1 + 1 = 2\nRow 3: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\nRow 4: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8\nRow 5: 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16\nRow 6: 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 32\nRow 7: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\nNow, we add up the sums of each row:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127\n\nSo, the sum of the first seven rows of Pascal's Triangle is 127."
