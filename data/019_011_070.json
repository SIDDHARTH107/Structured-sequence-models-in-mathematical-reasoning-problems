    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of R(2) → Q(2), we need to know the truth values of R(2) and Q(2). However, the given information does not provide any details about the truth values of R(x) and Q(x) for any x in the domain. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of R(2) → Q(2) based on the given information."
