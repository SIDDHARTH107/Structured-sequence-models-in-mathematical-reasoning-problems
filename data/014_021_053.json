    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted an encrypted message that was encrypted using the Hill cipher with a key matrix of: \n\n```\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 5  7 ]\n```\n\nYou know that the message was encrypted in blocks of 2 letters (i.e., digraphs), and the two letters \"XW\" in the encrypted message correspond to the digraph \"IL\" in the original message.\n\nWhat is the original message if the encrypted message is \"FBBOOQPQVNCQ\"? (Hint: recall that the Hill cipher operates modulo 26).",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26. The key matrix is:\n\n```\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 5  7 ]\n```\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (2 * 7) - (3 * 5) = 14 - 15 = -1. Since we are working modulo 26, the determinant is equivalent to 25. Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of the determinant modulo 26. The multiplicative inverse of 25 is 25 itself, as 25 * 25 = 625 â‰¡ 1 (mod 26).\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of the key matrix by swapping the positions of the elements in the main diagonal, negating the off-diagonal elements, and multiplying the result by the multiplicative inverse of the determinant:\n\n```\n[  7 -3 ]\n[ -5  2 ]\n```\n\nMultiply by 25:\n\n```\n[ 175 -75 ]\n[ -125  50 ]\n```\n\nNow, reduce each element modulo 26:\n\n```\n[ 7  23 ]\n[ 1  24 ]\n```\n\nThis is the inverse key matrix. Now, we can use it to decrypt the encrypted message \"FBBOOQPQVNCQ\". First, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nF = 5, B = 1, O = 14, Q = 16, V = 21, N = 13, C = 2\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message in digraphs:\n\nFB -> [ 5  1 ]\nOO -> [14 14 ]\nQP -> [16 15 ]\nQV -> [16 21 ]\nNC -> [13  2 ]\n\nNow, multiply each digraph by the inverse key matrix:\n\n[ 7  23 ] [ 5  1 ] = [ 8  0 ]\n[ 1  24 ] [14 14 ] = [ 0  19 ]\n[ 7  23 ] [16 15 ] = [ 4  17 ]\n[ 1  24 ] [16 21 ] = [ 4  4 ]\n[ 7  23 ] [13  2 ] = [ 18  8 ]\n\nReduce each element modulo 26:\n\n[ 8  0 ]\n[ 0  19 ]\n[ 4  17 ]\n[ 4  4 ]\n[ 18  8 ]\n\nNow, convert the numerical values back to letters:\n\nI  A  E  R  E  E  S  H\n\nSo, the original message is \"IAEREESH\"."
