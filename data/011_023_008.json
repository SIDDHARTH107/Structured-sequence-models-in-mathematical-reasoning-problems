    "message_1": "Suppose you have a graph with 8 vertices, and each vertex can be colored either red or blue. What is the maximum number of edges that can be present in the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of edges without having two adjacent vertices with the same color, we can create a bipartite graph. A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to a vertex in V.\n\nIn this case, we can divide the 8 vertices into two sets of 4 vertices each. Let's say set U has 4 red vertices and set V has 4 blue vertices. Now, we can connect each vertex in set U to every vertex in set V.\n\nSince there are 4 vertices in each set, there will be a total of 4 * 4 = 16 edges in the graph. This is the maximum number of edges that can be present in the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color."
