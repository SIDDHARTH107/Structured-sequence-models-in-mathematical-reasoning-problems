    "message_2": "To find the angles of the triangle with side lengths 6, 8, and 10, we can use the Law of Cosines first to find one angle, and then use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles.\n\nLet's denote the sides and angles of the triangle as follows:\n- Side a = 6, opposite angle A\n- Side b = 8, opposite angle B\n- Side c = 10, opposite angle C\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find angle C:\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\ncos(C) = (6^2 + 8^2 - 10^2) / (2 * 6 * 8)\ncos(C) = (36 + 64 - 100) / 96\ncos(C) = 0\n\nSince cos(C) = 0, angle C is 90 degrees (a right angle).\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the other angles:\nsin(A) / a = sin(B) / b = sin(C) / c\n\nWe can find angle A using:\nsin(A) / 6 = sin(90) / 10\nsin(A) = (6 * 1) / 10\nsin(A) = 0.6\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle A by taking the inverse sine of 0.6:\nA = arcsin(0.6) ≈ 36.87 degrees\n\nFinally, we can find angle B using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\nB = 180 - A - C\nB = 180 - 36.87 - 90\nB ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nSo, the measures of the angles in the triangle are approximately:\n- Angle A ≈ 36.87 degrees\n- Angle B ≈ 53.13 degrees\n- Angle C = 90 degrees"
