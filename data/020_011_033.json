    "message_1": "Consider a bakery that sells two types of cakes: chocolate cake and vanilla cake. The bakery has 15 pounds of chocolate and 20 pounds of vanilla frosting. Each chocolate cake requires 1.5 pounds of chocolate frosting and 2 pounds of vanilla frosting. Each vanilla cake requires 2 pounds of chocolate frosting and 1.5 pounds of vanilla frosting. If the bakery wants to maximize the total weight of cake it can produce, what is the optimal combination of chocolate and vanilla cakes to make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes.\n\nThe constraints for the frosting are:\n\n1.5x + 2y ≤ 15 (chocolate frosting constraint)\n2x + 1.5y ≤ 20 (vanilla frosting constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the total weight of the cakes, which is the sum of the weight of chocolate and vanilla frosting used:\n\nWeight = 1.5x + 2y (chocolate frosting) + 2x + 1.5y (vanilla frosting)\nWeight = 3.5x + 3.5y\n\nTo find the optimal combination of chocolate and vanilla cakes, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies both constraints and then find the maximum value of the weight function.\n\nFirst, let's find the boundary points of the feasible region:\n\n1.5x + 2y = 15\n2x + 1.5y = 20\n\nWe can solve these equations for y:\n\ny = (15 - 1.5x) / 2\ny = (20 - 2x) / 1.5\n\nNow we can find the intersection points of these two equations:\n\n(15 - 1.5x) / 2 = (20 - 2x) / 1.5\n15 - 1.5x = 20 - 2x\n0.5x = 5\nx = 10\n\nNow we can plug this value of x back into either equation to find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = (15 - 1.5 * 10) / 2\ny = (15 - 15) / 2\ny = 0\n\nSo the intersection point is (10, 0). This means that the bakery can make 10 chocolate cakes and 0 vanilla cakes to use up all the chocolate frosting. However, we need to check if this is the optimal solution.\n\nLet's find the value of the weight function at this point:\n\nWeight = 3.5x + 3.5y\nWeight = 3.5 * 10 + 3.5 * 0\nWeight = 35\n\nNow let's check the other corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1) x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\nWeight = 3.5 * 0 + 3.5 * 0 = 0\n\n2) x = 0, y = (20 - 2 * 0) / 1.5 = 20 / 1.5 = 40 / 3\nWeight = 3.5 * 0 + 3.5 * (40 / 3) = 140 / 3 ≈ 46.67\n\n3) x = 10, y = 0 (intersection point)\nWeight = 35 (already calculated)\n\n4) x = 15 / 1.5 = 10, y = 0\nWeight = 3.5 * 10 + 3.5 * 0 = 35 (already calculated)\n\nComparing the weight values, we can see that the maximum weight is achieved when the bakery makes 0 chocolate cakes and 40/3 ≈ 13.33 vanilla cakes. However, since the bakery can only make whole cakes, they should make 13 vanilla cakes, which will give a total weight of approximately 45.5 pounds."
