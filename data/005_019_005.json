    "message_1": "Suppose a mobile phone company has two types of tariffs: \"light user\" and \"heavy user\". A light user has a 70% chance of remaining a light user next month, while a heavy user has a 60% chance of remaining a heavy user. If 80% of the company's users are light users this month, what percentage of users will be light users in two months?",
    "message_2": "Let's use a transition matrix to represent the probabilities of users switching between light and heavy user categories. The matrix will be:\n\n```\n| 0.7  0.4 |\n| 0.3  0.6 |\n```\n\nWhere the first row represents the probabilities of a light user remaining a light user (0.7) and switching to a heavy user (0.3), and the second row represents the probabilities of a heavy user switching to a light user (0.4) and remaining a heavy user (0.6).\n\nNow, let's represent the current distribution of users as a vector:\n\n```\n| 0.8 |\n| 0.2 |\n```\n\nWhere 0.8 represents the percentage of light users and 0.2 represents the percentage of heavy users.\n\nTo find the distribution of users in one month, we multiply the transition matrix by the current distribution vector:\n\n```\n| 0.7  0.4 |   | 0.8 |   | 0.7*0.8 + 0.4*0.2 |   | 0.56 + 0.08 |   | 0.64 |\n| 0.3  0.6 | * | 0.2 | = | 0.3*0.8 + 0.6*0.2 | = | 0.24 + 0.12 | = | 0.36 |\n```\n\nSo, in one month, 64% of users will be light users and 36% will be heavy users.\n\nTo find the distribution in two months, we multiply the transition matrix by the distribution vector from one month:\n\n```\n| 0.7  0.4 |   | 0.64 |   | 0.7*0.64 + 0.4*0.36 |   | 0.448 + 0.144 |   | 0.592 |\n| 0.3  0.6 | * | 0.36 | = | 0.3*0.64 + 0.6*0.36 | = | 0.192 + 0.216 | = | 0.408 |\n```\n\nSo, in two months, 59.2% of users will be light users and 40.8% will be heavy users."
