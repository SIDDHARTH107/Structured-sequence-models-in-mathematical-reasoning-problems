    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFor graph G, we can color the vertices as follows:\n\n1. Color 1: Vertex 1\n2. Color 2: Vertices 2 and 3\n3. Color 3: Vertices 4 and 5\n\nThis coloring satisfies the condition that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Since we used 3 colors, the chromatic number of graph G is 3."
