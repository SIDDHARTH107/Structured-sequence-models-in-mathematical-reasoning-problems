    "message_2": "The given wave equation is y(x,t) = 10sin(πx/2)cos(2πt).\n\nThis equation represents a wave with both spatial and temporal components. The general form of such a wave equation is y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nIn our case, the equation is in the form y(x,t) = A sin(kx)cos(ωt), which is a product of two sinusoidal functions, one for the spatial component and one for the temporal component.\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude of the wave is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. In our equation, the amplitude is represented by the coefficient of the sinusoidal function, which is 10. So, the amplitude of the wave is A = 10 units.\n\n2. Wavelength:\nThe wave number k is related to the wavelength λ by the equation k = 2π/λ. In our equation, the wave number k is given by the coefficient of x in the spatial sinusoidal function, which is (π/2). So, we have:\n\n(π/2) = 2π/λ\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 4 units.\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is 4 units.\n\n3. Frequency:\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by the equation ω = 2πf. In our equation, the angular frequency ω is given by the coefficient of t in the temporal sinusoidal function, which is 2π. So, we have:\n\n2π = 2πf\n\nSolving for f, we get:\n\nf = 1 Hz.\n\nSo, the frequency of the wave is 1 Hz.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of the wave is 10 units, the wavelength is 4 units, and the frequency is 1 Hz."
