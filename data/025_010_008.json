    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the linear space $L(D)$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the linear space $L(D)$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nSince $\\deg(D) \\geq 2g - 1$, we have:\n\n$\\deg(K_C - D) = \\deg(K_C) - \\deg(D) \\leq \\deg(K_C) - (2g - 1)$\n\nRecall that for a smooth curve of genus $g$, the degree of the canonical divisor is $\\deg(K_C) = 2g - 2$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\deg(K_C - D) \\leq (2g - 2) - (2g - 1) = -1$\n\nSince the degree of $K_C - D$ is negative, we know that $l(K_C - D) = 0$. This is because there are no non-zero rational functions with negative degree poles.\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to find the dimension of $L(D)$:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\n$l(D) - 0 = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\n$l(D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nSince $\\deg(D) \\geq 2g - 1$, we have:\n\n$l(D) \\geq (2g - 1) + 1 - g = g + 1$\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the linear space $L(D)$ of rational functions with a pole of order at most 1 at each point of $D$ is at least $g + 1$."
