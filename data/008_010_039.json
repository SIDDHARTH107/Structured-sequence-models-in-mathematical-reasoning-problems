    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 16\n| 4  5  6 | 28\n| 6  7  8 | 40\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we will subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 2  3   4  | 16\n| 0 -1  -2  | -4\n| 6  7   8  | 40\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we will subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 2  3   4  | 16\n| 0 -1  -2  | -4\n| 0 -2  -4  | -8\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we will subtract 2 times the second row from the third row:\n\n| 2  3   4  | 16\n| 0 -1  -2  | -4\n| 0  0   0  |  0\n\nNow we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n| 2  3   4  | 16\n| 0 -1  -2  | -4\n| 0  0   0  |  0\n\nStep 3: Solve the system.\n\nSince the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, it does not provide any information about the variables. We are left with a system of two equations and three variables:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 16\n-y - 2z = -4\n\nWe can express y in terms of z:\n\ny = 2z - 4\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(2z - 4) + 4z = 16\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x + 6z - 12 + 4z = 16\n2x + 10z = 28\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx + 5z = 14\n\nNow we can express x in terms of z:\n\nx = 14 - 5z\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is given by:\n\nx = 14 - 5z\ny = 2z - 4\nz = z\n\nSince there is one free variable (z), the system has infinitely many solutions."
