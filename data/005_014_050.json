    "message_1": "A researcher conducted a factor analysis on a set of data and found that 4 factors have eigenvalues greater than 1. The factors accounted for 60%, 20%, 10%, and 5% of the total variance, respectively. If the researcher wants to select the top two factors, what percentage of the total variance will be accounted for by these factors?",
    "message_2": "If the researcher wants to select the top two factors, they would choose the factors that account for 60% and 20% of the total variance. To find the combined percentage of the total variance accounted for by these two factors, simply add their individual percentages:\n\n60% + 20% = 80%\n\nSo, the top two factors account for 80% of the total variance."
