    "message_2": "To find the probability of the Markov chain being in state 2 after two steps, we need to compute the square of the transition probability matrix P and then look at the entry in the first row and second column.\n\nFirst, let's compute the square of the matrix P:\n\nP^2 = P * P = [0.8 0.2] * [0.4 0.6]\n                 [0.4 0.6]\n\nTo compute the product of two matrices, we multiply the elements of each row of the first matrix by the elements of each column of the second matrix and sum the results:\n\nP^2 = [0.8*0.4 + 0.2*0.4, 0.8*0.2 + 0.2*0.6]\n          [0.4*0.4 + 0.6*0.4, 0.4*0.2 + 0.6*0.6]\n\nP^2 = [0.32 + 0.08, 0.16 + 0.12]\n          [0.16 + 0.24, 0.08 + 0.36]\n\nP^2 = [0.4, 0.28]\n          [0.4, 0.44]\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of being in state 2 after two steps given that we started in state 1. This corresponds to the entry in the first row and second column of the matrix P^2:\n\nP(X2 = 2 | X0 = 1) = 0.28\n\nSo, the probability of being in state 2 after two steps given that we started in state 1 is 0.28 or 28%."
