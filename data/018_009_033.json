We need to show that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C).\n\nConsider an arbitrary element in (A × B) × C, say ((a, b), c), where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C. We can rewrite this element as (a, (b, c)), which is an element in A × (B × C).\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary element in A × (B × C), say (a, (b, c)), where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C. We can rewrite this element as ((a, b), c), which is an element in (A × B) × C.\n\nSince we can rewrite elements from (A × B) × C as elements in A × (B × C) and vice versa, we can conclude that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C), and the Cartesian product of two sets is associative."
