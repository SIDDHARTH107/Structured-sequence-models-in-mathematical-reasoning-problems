    "message_1": "Consider the temporal logic formula X(A \\/ B), where A and B are propositions. Let X be the \"next\" operator that refers to the next state in a sequence of states. If A is true in the current state and B is true in the next state, what is the truth value of X(A \\/ B) in the current state?",
    "message_2": "In the given formula X(A \\/ B), the \"next\" operator X refers to the next state in a sequence of states. Since A is true in the current state and B is true in the next state, we can evaluate the formula as follows:\n\nA \\/ B is true in the current state because A is true (A \\/ B is true if either A or B or both are true).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate X(A \\/ B). Since B is true in the next state, X(A \\/ B) is also true in the current state, as it refers to the truth value of (A \\/ B) in the next state.\n\nSo, the truth value of X(A \\/ B) in the current state is true."
