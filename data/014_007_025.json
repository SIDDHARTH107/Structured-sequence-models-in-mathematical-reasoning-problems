    "message_2": "A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. The maximum possible key length for a stream cipher using an LFSR depends on the length of the LFSR and the number of bits in the key.\n\nIn this case, the LFSR has a length of 128 bits, and the key is 64 bits long. The maximum possible key length for a stream cipher using this LFSR and key is determined by the maximum length sequence (MLS) that can be generated by the LFSR. The MLS is the longest sequence of bits that can be generated by the LFSR before it repeats.\n\nFor an LFSR of length n, the maximum length sequence is 2^n - 1. In this case, n = 128, so the maximum length sequence is 2^128 - 1.\n\nHowever, since the key is only 64 bits long, the maximum possible key length for the stream cipher is limited by the key size. Therefore, the maximum possible key length for this stream cipher is 2^64 - 1, which is the maximum number of unique keys that can be generated from a 64-bit key."
