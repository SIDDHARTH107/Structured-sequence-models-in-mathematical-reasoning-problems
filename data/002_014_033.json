    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, width of 8 cm and height of 9 cm. What is the surface area of this rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 square cm\n2. Length x Height: 6 cm x 9 cm = 54 square cm\n3. Width x Height: 8 cm x 9 cm = 72 square cm\n\nNow, we add the areas of each type of face together, and multiply by 2 since there are 2 of each type of face:\n\n(48 + 54 + 72) x 2 = 174 x 2 = 348 square cm\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 348 square cm."
