    "message_2": "To determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we need to analyze the graph's structure. However, since the graph is not provided, we cannot give an exact number of cut vertices and bridges. The number of cut vertices and bridges depends on the specific arrangement of the edges and vertices.\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn general, for a graph with n vertices and m edges, the number of cut vertices and bridges can vary depending on the graph's structure. For example, a tree with n vertices will have n-1 edges and no cycles, and every non-leaf vertex can be a cut vertex, while every edge is a bridge. On the other hand, a complete graph with n vertices will have n(n-1)/2 edges, and there will be no cut vertices or bridges.\n\nIn the given problem, we have a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges. Without more information about the graph's structure, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges."
