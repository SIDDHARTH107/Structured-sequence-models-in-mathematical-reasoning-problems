    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using a hash set to store the sums of all possible pairs of integers in the set. Then, we can iterate through the set and check if any integer is present in the hash set. If we find one, it means there exist x, y, and z such that x + y = z.\n\nHere's the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize an empty hash set called 'sums'.\n2. Iterate through the set of integers with two nested loops, for each pair of integers (x, y):\n   a. Calculate the sum x + y.\n   b. Add the sum to the 'sums' hash set.\n3. Iterate through the set of integers again, for each integer z:\n   a. Check if z is present in the 'sums' hash set.\n   b. If z is present, return True (x, y, and z exist such that x + y = z).\n4. If the algorithm reaches this point, return False (no such x, y, and z exist).\n\nNow let's analyze the time complexity of this algorithm:\n\n- Step 1 takes O(1) time.\n- Step 2 takes O(n^2) time, as we have two nested loops iterating through the set of integers.\n- Step 3 takes O(n) time, as we iterate through the set of integers once.\n- Step 4 takes O(1) time.\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2) + O(n) + O(1) = O(n^2)."
