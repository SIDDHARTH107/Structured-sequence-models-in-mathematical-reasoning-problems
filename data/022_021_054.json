    "message_2": "To calculate the Laplace transform of f(t), we can use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nF(s) = L{f(t)} = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nSince f(t) is a piecewise function, we can break the integral into two parts, one for the interval where f(t) = 1 and another for the interval where f(t) = 0.\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt = ∫(e^(-st) * 1) dt for 0 < t < 1 + ∫(e^(-st) * 0) dt for t > 1\n\nThe second integral is 0 since f(t) = 0 for t > 1. So, we only need to calculate the first integral:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st)) dt for 0 < t < 1\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to t:\n\nF(s) = [-1/s * e^(-st)] evaluated from 0 to 1\n\nF(s) = (-1/s * e^(-s)) - (-1/s * e^(-0))\n\nF(s) = (-1/s * e^(-s)) + (1/s)\n\nThis is the Laplace transform of the given function f(t):\n\nF(s) = (1/s) - (1/s * e^(-s))"
