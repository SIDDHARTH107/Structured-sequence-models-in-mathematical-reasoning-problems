The company's quality control team has determined that a widget with a rating of at least 6 is considered \"good\". Use fuzzy logic to determine the degree of membership for a widget with a quality rating of 8.5 to the set of \"good\" widgets.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership for a widget with a quality rating of 8.5 to the set of \"good\" widgets using fuzzy logic, we need to define a membership function. A common membership function used in fuzzy logic is the linear function.\n\nLet's define the membership function as follows:\n\n- If the quality rating is less than or equal to 5, the degree of membership is 0 (not a member of the \"good\" set).\n- If the quality rating is greater than or equal to 6, the degree of membership is linearly increasing from 0 to 1, reaching 1 at a quality rating of 10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the degree of membership for a widget with a quality rating of 8.5:\n\nDegree of membership = (Quality rating - 6) / (10 - 6)\n\nDegree of membership = (8.5 - 6) / (10 - 6)\n\nDegree of membership = 2.5 / 4\n\nDegree of membership = 0.625\n\nSo, the degree of membership for a widget with a quality rating of 8.5 to the set of \"good\" widgets is 0.625."
