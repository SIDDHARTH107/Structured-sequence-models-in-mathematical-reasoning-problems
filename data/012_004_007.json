    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex not in the tree. We continue this process until all vertices are included in the tree.\n\n1. Start with vertex 1. The edges connected to vertex 1 are (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). The edge with the smallest weight is (1,4) with a weight of 3. Add this edge to the tree.\n\n2. Now we have vertices 1 and 4 in the tree. The edges connected to these vertices are (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (4,5), (4,6), and (4,7). The edge with the smallest weight is (3,4) with a weight of 1. Add this edge to the tree.\n\n3. Now we have vertices 1, 3, and 4 in the tree. The edges connected to these vertices are (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), and (4,7). The edge with the smallest weight is (2,5) with a weight of 2. Add this edge to the tree.\n\n4. Now we have vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the tree. The edges connected to these vertices are (2,4), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), and (4,7). The edge with the smallest weight is (3,6) with a weight of 4. Add this edge to the tree.\n\n5. Now we have vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in the tree. The edges connected to these vertices are (2,4), (4,5), (4,7), and (6,7). The edge with the smallest weight is (5,7) with a weight of 3. Add this edge to the tree.\n\n6. Now all vertices are included in the tree. The minimum spanning tree consists of the edges (1,4), (3,4), (2,5), (3,6), and (5,7).\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 13."
