    "message_1": "In a Stag Hunt game, Player 1 can either choose to hunt stag for a payoff of 5 or hunt hare for a payoff of 2. Player 2 can also either choose to hunt stag for a payoff of 5, or hunt hare for a payoff of 2. If both players hunt stag, they both get a payoff of 10. If one hunts stag and the other hunts hare, the stag hunter gets a payoff of 0 and the hare hunter gets a payoff of 4. \n\nCalculate the Nash equilibrium of the Stag Hunt game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate, given the other player's strategy. Let's denote the strategies as follows: S for hunting stag and H for hunting hare.\n\nWe can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          S   H\n        +-----+-----+\nPlayer 1 | 10,10| 0,4 |\n  S      +-----+-----+\n        | 4,0  | 2,2 |\n  H      +-----+-----+\n```\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for each player:\n\n1. If Player 1 hunts stag (S), Player 2's best response is to hunt stag (S) as well, since 10 > 4.\n2. If Player 1 hunts hare (H), Player 2's best response is to hunt hare (H) as well, since 2 > 0.\n3. If Player 2 hunts stag (S), Player 1's best response is to hunt stag (S) as well, since 10 > 4.\n4. If Player 2 hunts hare (H), Player 1's best response is to hunt hare (H) as well, since 2 > 0.\n\nFrom these best responses, we can identify two Nash equilibria:\n\n1. Both players hunt stag (S): (S, S) with payoffs (10, 10).\n2. Both players hunt hare (H): (H, H) with payoffs (2, 2).\n\nSo, the Stag Hunt game has two Nash equilibria: (S, S) and (H, H)."
