    "message_2": "To graph the equation y = 2x - 3 on a coordinate plane, we can start by finding two points on the line and then connecting them.\n\n1. Let x = 0:\ny = 2(0) - 3\ny = -3\nSo, the point (0, -3) is on the line.\n\n2. Let x = 1:\ny = 2(1) - 3\ny = -1\nSo, the point (1, -1) is on the line.\n\nNow, plot these two points (0, -3) and (1, -1) on the coordinate plane and draw a line connecting them. This line represents the graph of the equation y = 2x - 3.\n\nThe y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. In this case, it is the point (0, -3).\n\nThe slope of the line is the coefficient of x in the equation, which is 2. So, the slope is 2.\n\nIn summary, the graph of the equation y = 2x - 3 is a straight line with a y-intercept of (0, -3) and a slope of 2."
