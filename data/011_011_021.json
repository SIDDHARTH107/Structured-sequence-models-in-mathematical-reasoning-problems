    "message_2": "Let's denote the three distinct positive integers as a, b, and c, with a < b < c. We need to find all possible combinations of a, b, and c such that a + b + c = 14.\n\nWe can start by finding the smallest possible value for a, which is 1. Then, we can find the possible values for b and c:\n\n1. a = 1, b = 2, c = 11\n2. a = 1, b = 3, c = 10\n3. a = 1, b = 4, c = 9\n4. a = 1, b = 5, c = 8\n\nWe can't have a = 1 and b = 6, because then c would also be 7, and b and c would not be distinct.\n\nNext, let's try a = 2:\n\n5. a = 2, b = 3, c = 9\n6. a = 2, b = 4, c = 8\n7. a = 2, b = 5, c = 7\n\nWe can't have a = 2 and b = 6, because then c would also be 6, and b and c would not be distinct.\n\nFinally, let's try a = 3:\n\n8. a = 3, b = 4, c = 7\n\nWe can't have a = 3 and b = 5, because then c would also be 6, and b and c would not be distinct.\n\nThere are no more possible values for a, as a = 4 would require b to be at least 5, and then the sum would be greater than 14.\n\nSo, there are 8 different ways the student can select 3 distinct positive integers whose sum is equal to 14."
