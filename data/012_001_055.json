    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the graph you are referring to. However, I can explain the steps to solve the problem using Dijkstra's algorithm. Once you provide the graph, I can help you with the specific calculations.\n\nHere are the general steps for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (Node A) as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (initially Node A) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighboring unvisited nodes by adding the distance from the current node to the neighbor. If the new distance is less than the current distance, update the distance.\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until all nodes are visited or the target node (Node F) is visited.\n\n4. To find the shortest path, start at the target node (Node F) and follow the path with the minimum distance back to the starting node (Node A).\n\nPlease provide the graph, and I will be happy to help you with the specific calculations and path."
