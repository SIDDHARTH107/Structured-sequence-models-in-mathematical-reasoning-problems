    "message_1": "A group of researchers want to test the effectiveness of a new pain relief medication. They decide to conduct a randomized controlled trial with 200 participants. They randomly assign 100 participants to receive the new medication and 100 participants to receive a placebo. At the end of the study, they record the number of participants in each group who report a reduction in pain levels. The results show that 70% of participants who received the new medication reported a reduction in pain levels, while only 40% of those who received the placebo reported a reduction. What is the difference in the percentage of participants reporting a reduction in pain levels between the two groups?",
    "message_2": "To find the difference in the percentage of participants reporting a reduction in pain levels between the two groups, we need to subtract the percentage of participants in the placebo group from the percentage of participants in the new medication group.\n\n70% (new medication group) - 40% (placebo group) = 30%\n\nSo, there is a 30% difference in the percentage of participants reporting a reduction in pain levels between the two groups."
