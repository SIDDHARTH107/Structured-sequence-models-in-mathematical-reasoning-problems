    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over all real values of t, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nIn this case, f(t) = e^(-2t)u(t). The Heaviside step function u(t) is equal to 0 for t < 0 and 1 for t ≥ 0. Therefore, we only need to consider the integral for t ≥ 0:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over t from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t - jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over t from 0 to infinity.\n\nLet's denote -2 - jω as k:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(kt)] dt, where the integral is taken over t from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, integrate with respect to t:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/k) * e^(kt) | evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/k) * [e^(k * infinity) - e^(k * 0)], where k = -2 - jω.\n\nSince k has a real part of -2, e^(k * infinity) goes to 0:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/k) * [0 - e^(k * 0)] = (-1/k) * [0 - 1].\n\nFinally, substitute k back in:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/(-2 - jω)) = 1/(2 + jω).\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(t) = e^(-2t)u(t) is F(ω) = 1/(2 + jω)."
