    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nIn the Trust Game, Player A has $100 and can choose to send any amount between $0 and $100 to Player B. The amount sent will triple during transmission, so Player B will receive three times the amount sent by Player A. Player B can then choose to send any amount they like back to Player A. The amount sent by Player B is not tripled during transmission. If Player B sends back $X, how much money will Player A end up with?\n\nHint: Remember that Player B has the option to not send any money back to Player A!",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of money Player A sends to Player B as $Y$. Since the amount triples during transmission, Player B will receive $3Y$. After receiving the money, Player B decides to send back $X$ to Player A.\n\nPlayer A initially had $100 and sent $Y$ to Player B, so Player A has $100 - Y$ left. After receiving $X$ back from Player B, Player A's total amount of money will be:\n\n$100 - Y + X$\n\nSince Player B can choose to send any amount back, including $0, the final amount of money Player A ends up with can range from $100 - Y$ (if Player B sends nothing back) to $100 - Y + 3Y$ (if Player B sends everything back)."
