The table below shows the distances (in miles) between the warehouses and the stores.\n\n| - | Store A | Store B | Store C |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Warehouse X | 12 | 9 | 6 |\n| Warehouse Y | 5 | 8 | 11 |\n| Warehouse Z | 8 | 5 | 9 |\n\nAssuming the company wants to minimize the total distance traveled by their trucks, what is the optimal allocation of goods from the warehouses to the stores?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks, we need to find the shortest distance from each warehouse to a store, while making sure that each store is supplied by only one warehouse. We can use the Hungarian Algorithm to solve this problem.\n\nStep 1: Find the smallest value in each row and subtract it from all the values in that row.\n\n| - | Store A | Store B | Store C |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Warehouse X | 6 | 3 | 0 |\n| Warehouse Y | 0 | 3 | 6 |\n| Warehouse Z | 3 | 0 | 4 |\n\nStep 2: Find the smallest value in each column and subtract it from all the values in that column.\n\n| - | Store A | Store B | Store C |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Warehouse X | 6 | 3 | 0 |\n| Warehouse Y | 0 | 3 | 6 |\n| Warehouse Z | 3 | 0 | 4 |\n\nIn this case, there are no changes after step 2.\n\nStep 3: Cover all the zeros with the minimum number of lines.\n\nWe can cover all the zeros with 3 lines:\n\n- One horizontal line through Warehouse X\n- One horizontal line through Warehouse Y\n- One vertical line through Store B\n\nSince the number of lines (3) equals the number of rows (3), we can proceed to step 4.\n\nStep 4: Find the optimal allocation.\n\nWe can see that the optimal allocation is:\n\n- Warehouse X to Store C (6 miles)\n- Warehouse Y to Store A (5 miles)\n- Warehouse Z to Store B (5 miles)\n\nThe total distance traveled by the trucks is 6 + 5 + 5 = 16 miles."
