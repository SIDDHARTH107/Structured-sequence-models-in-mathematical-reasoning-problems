    "message_2": "A block cipher algorithm with a key size of 128 bits means that there are 2^128 possible keys. This is because each bit can be either a 0 or a 1, and there are 128 bits in the key. So, the total number of possible keys is:\n\n2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456"
