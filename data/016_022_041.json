    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller tetrahedra from the larger one. Each level of the pyramid has a specific number of smaller triangles.\n\nIn the first level, there is 1 large triangle (tetrahedron).\nIn the second level, 4 smaller triangles (tetrahedra) are formed.\nIn the third level, each of the 4 smaller triangles from the second level forms 4 more triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nFor the fourth level, each of the 16 triangles from the third level forms 4 more triangles, resulting in 16 * 4 = 64 triangles."
