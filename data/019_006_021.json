    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem related to deontic logic as deontic logic is a branch of logic which deals with obligation, permission, and related concepts that cannot be quantified. It is concerned with logical interactions between propositions containing normative expressions, such as \"ought\", \"may\", and \"must\". However, you may ask a question that involves the application of deontic logic principles or theory to a particular scenario or situation.",
    "message_2": "You are correct that deontic logic deals with obligation, permission, and related concepts. However, if you have any other mathematical problem or question, feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with that."
