    "message_2": "To find the values of $f(-i)$ and $f(i)$, we first need to recall the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are necessary conditions for a function to be analytic. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nLet's check if the given functions satisfy these equations.\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$. Thus, the first equation is satisfied.\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -6xy$ and $-\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -6xy$. Thus, the second equation is also satisfied.\n\nSince the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, the function $f(z)$ is analytic. Now, we can find the values of $f(-i)$ and $f(i)$.\n\n1. $f(-i) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ where $z = -i = 0 - i$. So, $x = 0$ and $y = -1$. Then, $u(0, -1) = 0^3 - 3(0)(-1)^2 = 0$ and $v(0, -1) = 3(0)^2(-1) - (-1)^3 = -1$. Therefore, $f(-i) = 0 - i$.\n\n2. $f(i) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ where $z = i = 0 + i$. So, $x = 0$ and $y = 1$. Then, $u(0, 1) = 0^3 - 3(0)(1)^2 = 0$ and $v(0, 1) = 3(0)^2(1) - (1)^3 = -1$. Therefore, $f(i) = 0 - i$.\n\nSo, the values of $f(-i)$ and $f(i)$ are both $0 - i$."
