    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\nα = 30° = π/6 radians\nβ = 40° = 2π/9 radians\nγ = 110° = 11π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = π - (π/6 + 2π/9 + 11π/18)\nArea = π - (3π/18 + 4π/18 + 11π/18)\nArea = π - (18π/18)\nArea = π - π\nArea = 0\n\nThe area of this hyperbolic triangle is 0."
