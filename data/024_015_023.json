    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$ and then sum them up. Recall that the exterior derivative of a differential form is given by taking the partial derivative with respect to each coordinate and then wedging it with the corresponding differential.\n\nFirst, let's find the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$:\n\n1. For the term $x dy \\wedge dz$:\n$$\nd(x dy \\wedge dz) = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\n2. For the term $y dz \\wedge dx$:\n$$\nd(y dz \\wedge dx) = dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx\n$$\n\n3. For the term $z dx \\wedge dy$:\n$$\nd(z dx \\wedge dy) = dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nNow, we sum up these exterior derivatives:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = d(x dy \\wedge dz) + d(y dz \\wedge dx) + d(z dx \\wedge dy) \\\\\n= (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) + (dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx) + (dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\n\nHowever, we need to take into account the antisymmetry of the wedge product. We have:\n\n$$\ndy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = - dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz \\\\\ndz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = - dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx\n$$\n\nSo, we can rewrite $d\\omega$ as:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) - (dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dz) - (dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx)\n$$\n\nNow, we can factor out the $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ term:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = (1 - 1 - 1) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = - dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nTherefore, the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ is:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = - dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$"
