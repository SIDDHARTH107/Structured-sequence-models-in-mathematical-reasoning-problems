    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. \n\nLet Y(k) be the Fourier transform of y(x), then the Fourier transform of y''(x) is (-k^2)Y(k) and the Fourier transform of y(x) is Y(k). The Fourier transform of x is given by the formula:\n\nF[x] = √(2/π) ∫[x * sin(kx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given differential equation in terms of the Fourier transform:\n\n(-k^2)Y(k) + Y(k) = F[x]\n\nY(k) = F[x] / (1 - k^2)\n\nNow we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(k) to get y(x):\n\ny(x) = √(2/π) ∫[Y(k) * sin(kx) dk] from 0 to ∞\n\nWe know that Y(k) = F[x] / (1 - k^2), so we can substitute this into the integral:\n\ny(x) = √(2/π) ∫[(F[x] / (1 - k^2)) * sin(kx) dk] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow we need to find F[x] and substitute it into the integral. The Fourier transform of x is:\n\nF[x] = √(2/π) ∫[x * sin(kx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nTo find this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(kx) dx\nThen du = dx and v = (-1/k)cos(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, ∫[u dv] = uv - ∫[v du]:\n\nF[x] = √(2/π) [(x * (-1/k)cos(kx)) - ∫[(-1/k)cos(kx) dx]] from 0 to π\n\nF[x] = √(2/π) [(-x/k)cos(kx) + (1/k^2)sin(kx)] from 0 to π\n\nF[x] = √(2/π) [(π/k)cos(kπ) - (1/k^2)sin(kπ)]\n\nNow substitute F[x] into the integral for y(x):\n\ny(x) = √(2/π) ∫[((π/k)cos(kπ) - (1/k^2)sin(kπ)) / (1 - k^2) * sin(kx) dk] from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral is quite difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the solution y(x) for the given boundary value problem."
