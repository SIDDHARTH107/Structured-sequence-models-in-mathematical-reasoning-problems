    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is its surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to find the area of its base (a circle) and the area of its lateral surface (a curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Surface Area\nSurface Area = πr² + πrL\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and L is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (L) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the radius, height, and slant height:\n\nL² = r² + h²\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm:\n\nL² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nL² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\nL² = 169 cm²\nL = √169 cm\nL = 13 cm\n\nNow that we have the slant height, we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(5 cm)² + π(5 cm)(13 cm)\nSurface Area = 25π cm² + 65π cm²\nSurface Area = 90π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 282.74 cm² (rounded to two decimal places)."
