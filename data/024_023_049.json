    "message_2": "The given equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$ does not represent a 2-dimensional torus. A 2-dimensional torus is typically represented by the equation $(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)^2+z^2=r^2$, where $R$ is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube, and $r$ is the radius of the tube.\n\nAssuming the equation for the torus is $(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)^2+z^2=r^2$, we can determine the symmetries of the torus. The symmetries of the torus can be found by considering the transformations that preserve the shape of the torus.\n\n1. Rotation around the z-axis: This is an orientation-preserving symmetry. There are infinitely many rotations around the z-axis that preserve the torus's shape.\n\n2. Rotation around the x-axis or y-axis by 180 degrees: These are orientation-reversing symmetries. There are two such rotations (one around the x-axis and one around the y-axis).\n\n3. Reflection through the xy-plane, xz-plane, or yz-plane: These are orientation-reversing symmetries. There are three such reflections (one through each plane).\n\nIn total, there are infinitely many orientation-preserving symmetries (rotations around the z-axis) and five orientation-reversing symmetries (two rotations around the x-axis or y-axis by 180 degrees and three reflections through the planes)."
