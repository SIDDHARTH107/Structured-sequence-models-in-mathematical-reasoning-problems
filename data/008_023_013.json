    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces 3 different products: A, B, and C. In a particular period, they produced a total of 350 units of these products. The company sold 200 units of product A for $7 each, 50 units of product B for $10 each, and 20 units of product C for $12 each. However, due to some error in the billing system, the total revenue generated was $1870, which is $90 less than the actual revenue. \n\nUsing linear algebra, find the actual number of units sold for each product, and the actual price of each unit.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the actual number of units sold for each product as a, b, and c for products A, B, and C, respectively. Also, let's denote the actual price of each unit as x, y, and z for products A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe have the following information:\n\n1. The total number of units produced is 350: a + b + c = 350\n2. The total revenue generated was $1870, which is $90 less than the actual revenue: 200x + 50y + 20z = 1870 + 90 = 1960\n3. The company sold 200 units of product A for $7 each, 50 units of product B for $10 each, and 20 units of product C for $12 each: 200x = 200*7, 50y = 50*10, 20z = 20*12\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations:\n\na + b + c = 350\n200x + 50y + 20z = 1960\n200x = 1400\n50y = 500\n20z = 240\n\nFrom the last three equations, we can find the actual price of each unit:\n\nx = 1400/200 = 7\ny = 500/50 = 10\nz = 240/20 = 12\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the second equation:\n\n200(7) + 50(10) + 20(12) = 1960\n1400 + 500 + 240 = 1960\n2140 = 1960\n\nThis result contradicts the information given in the problem. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given information is inconsistent. It is not possible to find the actual number of units sold for each product and the actual price of each unit using the given information."
