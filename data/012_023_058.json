    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nIn the given graph G, the vertices and edges are as follows:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nEdges: {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,6}, {6,1}, {2,4}, {4,6}\n\nTo find the largest clique, we can analyze the connections between vertices:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 6, but 2 and 6 are not connected, so there is no 3-clique containing vertex 1.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4. Vertices 3 and 4 are also connected, so there is a 3-clique containing vertex 2: {2, 3, 4}.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2 and 4, which are part of the 3-clique {2, 3, 4}.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, 5, and 6. Vertices 5 and 6 are not connected, so there is no 4-clique containing vertex 4.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 4 and 6, but 4 and 6 are not connected, so there is no 3-clique containing vertex 5.\n6. Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 5, but 1 and 5 are not connected, so there is no 3-clique containing vertex 6.\n\nThe largest clique found is {2, 3, 4}, which is a 3-clique. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
