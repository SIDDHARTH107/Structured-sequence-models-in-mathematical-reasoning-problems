    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products; Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A generates a profit of $4 and requires 3kg of raw material. Each unit of Product B generates a profit of $6 but requires 4kg of raw material. The company has 300kg of raw material available for production. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe profit function can be represented as P(x, y) = 4x + 6y.\n\nThe constraint for the raw material is 3x + 4y ≤ 300.\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the maximum value of P(x, y) subject to the constraint 3x + 4y ≤ 300.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region for the production of Product A and Product B. We can rewrite the constraint as y ≤ (300 - 3x) / 4.\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (we can't produce a negative number of products), the feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\ny ≤ (300 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (300 - 3x) / 4: (0, 75)\n3. Intersection of y = 0 and y = (300 - 3x) / 4: (100, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 4(0) + 6(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 75) = 4(0) + 6(75) = 450\n3. P(100, 0) = 4(100) + 6(0) = 400\n\nThe maximum profit is $450, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 75 units of Product B."
