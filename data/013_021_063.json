    "message_1": "In a Centipede Game, two players take turns choosing between two options: \"continue\" or \"stop\". If both players choose \"continue\" on each turn, the game continues for a total of 10 turns and each player earns 1 point per turn. However, if one player chooses \"stop\", that player earns 10 points and the game ends immediately. What is the optimal strategy for a player to maximize their total points earned in a Centipede Game?",
    "message_2": "In the Centipede Game, the optimal strategy for a player to maximize their total points earned is to choose \"stop\" on their first turn. This is because if both players continue for all 10 turns, they will each earn 10 points. However, by choosing \"stop\" on the first turn, a player can earn 10 points immediately and end the game, ensuring they have the maximum possible points.\n\nTo understand this, consider the game from the perspective of the last turn. If the game reaches the last turn, the second player will choose \"stop\" to earn 10 points instead of continuing and earning only 1 point. Knowing this, the first player will choose \"stop\" on the second-to-last turn to earn 10 points and prevent the second player from earning any points. This logic continues backward through the turns, leading to the conclusion that the optimal strategy is to choose \"stop\" on the first turn."
