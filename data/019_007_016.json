    "message_1": "An agent believes that all birds have wings. The agent observes a penguin, which cannot fly, but has wings. What conclusion can the agent draw using non-monotonic logic?\n\nUsing non-monotonic logic, the agent can conclude that the belief that all birds have wings is not necessarily true in all cases.",
    "message_2": "However, in this specific case, the agent can still maintain the belief that all birds have wings, since the penguin, despite not being able to fly, does have wings. The agent may need to revise their belief to account for the fact that not all birds with wings can fly."
