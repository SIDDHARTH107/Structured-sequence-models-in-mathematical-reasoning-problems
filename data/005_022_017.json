    "message_1": "To test a new prototype of a car, the manufacturer measured the fuel efficiency (in km/L) of the car during four test drives: 25, 30, 30, and 500 km per liter. Calculate the median and the interquartile range (IQR) of the fuel efficiency. Is the median or the mean a better measure of center for this dataset? Why?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order: 25, 30, 30, 500.\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value(s) of the dataset. Since there are four values, we take the average of the two middle values: (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5. So, the median is 27.5 km/L.\n\nTo find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nQ1: The lower half of the data is 25 and 30, so the median is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5.\nQ3: The upper half of the data is 30 and 500, so the median is (30 + 500) / 2 = 265.\n\nNow, we can calculate the IQR: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 265 - 27.5 = 237.5.\n\nIn this dataset, the median is a better measure of center than the mean because the value of 500 km/L is an outlier, which would significantly skew the mean. The median is less sensitive to outliers and provides a more accurate representation of the central tendency of the dataset."
