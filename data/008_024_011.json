    "message_1": "Consider the system of equations:\n\n2x + y = 5\n\n4x + 2y = 10\n\nWhat is the solution to this system of equations?",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, these two equations are not independent, and they represent the same line. In this case, there is an infinite number of solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system of equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\ny = 5 - 2x\n\nSo the solution to this system of equations is given by the set of all points (x, y) such that y = 5 - 2x."
