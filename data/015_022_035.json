    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we'll first need to define the function for the equation and then implement the Runge-Kutta method. The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation, so we need to handle the delay term x(t-17) properly.\n\nLet's denote the function as:\n\nf(x, t) = 0.2 * x(t-17) / (1 + x(t-17)^10) - 0.1 * x(t)\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n1. Initialize the variables:\n   - x0 = 1.5 (initial value)\n   - t0 = 0 (initial time)\n   - Δt = 0.01 (time step size)\n   - t_end = 50 (end time)\n\n2. Create a function for the Mackey-Glass equation:\n\n```python\ndef mackey_glass(x, t, x_delayed):\n    return 0.2 * x_delayed / (1 + x_delayed**10) - 0.1 * x\n```\n\n3. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta(x0, t0, t_end, dt):\n    x = [x0]\n    t = [t0]\n    delay = 17\n    while t[-1] < t_end:\n        if t[-1] < delay:\n            x_delayed = x0\n        else:\n            x_delayed = x[-int(delay/dt)]\n        \n        k1 = dt * mackey_glass(x[-1], t[-1], x_delayed)\n        k2 = dt * mackey_glass(x[-1] + k1/2, t[-1] + dt/2, x_delayed)\n        k3 = dt * mackey_glass(x[-1] + k2/2, t[-1] + dt/2, x_delayed)\n        k4 = dt * mackey_glass(x[-1] + k3, t[-1] + dt, x_delayed)\n        \n        x_new = x[-1] + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n        x.append(x_new)\n        t.append(t[-1] + dt)\n    return x, t\n```\n\n4. Call the `runge_kutta` function to find the value of x(t) at t=50:\n\n```python\nx, t = runge_kutta(x0=1.5, t0=0, t_end=50, dt=0.01)\n```\n\n5. Get the value of x(t) at t=50:\n\n```python\nx_50 = x[-1]\n```\n\nThe value of x(t) at t=50 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is approximately x_50. Note that the actual value may vary slightly depending on the implementation and numerical precision."
