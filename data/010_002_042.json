    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (1/n) converges to 0 in the topology induced by the standard metric on R, we need to show that for any given ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the distance between 1/n and 0 is less than ε. In other words, we need to show that:\n\n|1/n - 0| < ε for all n > N\n\nSince the standard metric on R is the absolute value of the difference between two real numbers, we have:\n\n|1/n| < ε\n\nNow, let's find a suitable N for a given ε > 0. Since 1/n > 0 for all n ∈ N, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n1/n < ε\n\nNow, we need to find an N such that the inequality holds for all n > N. We can do this by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the inequality:\n\nn > 1/ε\n\nSince n is a natural number, we can take the smallest integer greater than 1/ε as our N:\n\nN = ⌈1/ε⌉\n\nNow, for all n > N, we have:\n\nn > ⌈1/ε⌉ ≥ 1/ε\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\n1/n ≤ ε\n\nThus, |1/n - 0| = 1/n < ε for all n > N, and the sequence (1/n) converges to 0 in the topology induced by the standard metric on R."
