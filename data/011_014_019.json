    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with 7 vertices and each vertex having a degree of at least 2, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet's denote the degree of each vertex as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7. Since each vertex has a degree of at least 2, we can start with the minimum degree for each vertex:\n\nd1 = 2, d2 = 2, d3 = 2, d4 = 2, d5 = 2, d6 = 2, d7 = 2\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the degrees:\n\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\n14 = 2 * number of edges\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 7\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that the graph must have is 7."
