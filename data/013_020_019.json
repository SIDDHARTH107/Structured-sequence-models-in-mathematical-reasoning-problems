The winner is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen. What number should a player choose to maximize their chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. \n\n1. First, we need to find the average of all numbers chosen. Since there are 100 players and each player chooses a number between 0 and 100, inclusive, the sum of all numbers chosen can range from 0 (if all players choose 0) to 10000 (if all players choose 100). \n\n2. To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of players, which is 100. So, the average can range from 0/100 = 0 to 10000/100 = 100.\n\n3. Now, we need to find 2/3 of the average. Since the average can range from 0 to 100, 2/3 of the average can range from 0 to 2/3 * 100 = 200/3 ≈ 66.67.\n\n4. To maximize the chance of winning, a player should choose a number closest to 2/3 of the average. However, we need to consider that other players are also trying to maximize their chances of winning. So, we should assume that other players will also choose numbers close to 2/3 of the average.\n\n5. If all players choose numbers close to 2/3 of the average (which is around 66.67), the new average will be close to 66.67. Then, 2/3 of this new average will be 2/3 * 66.67 ≈ 44.44.\n\n6. Following this logic, if all players choose numbers close to 44.44, the new average will be close to 44.44, and 2/3 of this new average will be 2/3 * 44.44 ≈ 29.63.\n\n7. This process will continue iteratively, converging to a value close to 0. However, since players can only choose whole numbers, we can't keep iterating indefinitely. \n\n8. Based on the iterations above, we can see that the optimal number to choose is decreasing. To maximize the chance of winning, a player should choose a number close to the result of the last iteration, which is 29.63. Since players can only choose whole numbers, a player should choose either 29 or 30 to maximize their chance of winning."
