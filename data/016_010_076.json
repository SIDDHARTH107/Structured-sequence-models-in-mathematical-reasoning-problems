    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by starting with three mutually tangent circles and recursively filling in the interstices with new circles that are tangent to the existing ones. The curvature of a circle is defined as k = 1/r, where r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn the case of an Apollonian gasket, the curvatures of the circles satisfy Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, the following equation holds:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nIf the initial three circles have rational curvatures, then the curvature of the fourth circle will also be rational, as it can be derived from the above equation. However, when adding more circles, there is no guarantee that their curvatures will be rational.\n\nIn general, there is no maximum number of circles that can be added to the initial three circles in the construction of the Apollonian gasket so that the curvature of all circles is a rational number. The number of circles with rational curvature depends on the specific configuration of the initial three circles and the recursive process used to generate the gasket.\n\nHowever, it is known that there exist some special cases of Apollonian gaskets, called \"integral Apollonian gaskets,\" where all circles have integer curvatures. In these cases, an infinite number of circles with rational curvatures can be added to the initial three circles."
