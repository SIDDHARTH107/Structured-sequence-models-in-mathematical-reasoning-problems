    "message_2": "The maximum number of elements that the intersection of A and B can have is equal to the number of elements in the smaller set. In this case, set A has 50 elements, which is smaller than set B with 70 elements. Therefore, the maximum number of elements that the intersection of A and B can have is 50."
