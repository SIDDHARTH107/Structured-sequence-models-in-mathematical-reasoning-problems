    "message_1": "Let A be any set. Prove that the empty set (represented by the symbol Ø) is a subset of A by showing that the statement \"For all x, if x is an element of Ø, then x is also an element of A\" is true.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set Ø is a subset of any set A, we need to show that for all x, if x is an element of Ø, then x is also an element of A. This can be written as:\n\n∀x (x ∈ Ø → x ∈ A)\n\nSince the empty set Ø has no elements, there are no elements x that belong to Ø. Therefore, the statement \"x is an element of Ø\" is always false. In logic, when the premise (in this case, \"x is an element of Ø\") is false, the implication (x ∈ Ø → x ∈ A) is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion (in this case, \"x is an element of A\").\n\nSo, for all x, the statement \"if x is an element of Ø, then x is also an element of A\" is true, because the premise \"x is an element of Ø\" is always false. This means that the empty set Ø is a subset of any set A, as we wanted to prove."
