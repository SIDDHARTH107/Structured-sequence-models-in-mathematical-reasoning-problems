    "message_1": "If a pizza restaurant has 8 toppings available and a customer can choose any 4 toppings, how many different pizza combinations can be made?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different pizza combinations, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of toppings available (8) and k is the number of toppings to choose (4).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 different pizza combinations that can be made with 4 toppings out of 8 available toppings."
