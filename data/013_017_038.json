    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nA company sells two types of insurance policies to its customers- a high-risk policy and a low-risk policy. The probability of a customer making a claim on the high-risk policy is 0.4 while the probability of a customer making a claim on the low-risk policy is 0.2. The company charges $500 for the high-risk policy and $200 for the low-risk policy. In order to prevent adverse selection, the company offers a discount to customers who purchase both policies. The discount for purchasing both policies is set such that the customer will only purchase both policies if the expected payout from the policies (i.e. the probability of the customer making a claim multiplied by the payout amount) is less than the cost of purchasing both policies. What is the highest discount percentage the company can offer while still preventing adverse selection?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the expected payout for each policy. \n\nFor the high-risk policy, the expected payout is the probability of making a claim (0.4) multiplied by the payout amount ($500). \n\nExpected payout (high-risk) = 0.4 * $500 = $200\n\nFor the low-risk policy, the expected payout is the probability of making a claim (0.2) multiplied by the payout amount ($200).\n\nExpected payout (low-risk) = 0.2 * $200 = $40\n\nNow, let's denote the discount percentage as x. The cost of purchasing both policies with the discount is:\n\nCost (both policies) = ($500 + $200) * (1 - x)\n\nTo prevent adverse selection, the cost of purchasing both policies should be greater than the sum of the expected payouts:\n\nCost (both policies) > Expected payout (high-risk) + Expected payout (low-risk)\n\n($500 + $200) * (1 - x) > $200 + $40\n\n$700 * (1 - x) > $240\n\n1 - x > $240 / $700\n\n1 - x > 0.342857\n\nx < 1 - 0.342857\n\nx < 0.657143\n\nThe highest discount percentage the company can offer while still preventing adverse selection is approximately 65.71%."
