    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 2 tails when flipping a fair coin 5 times, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, 2 tails)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting tails, which is 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of getting heads, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = (5C2) * (0.5^2) * (0.5^(5-2))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5C2:\n\n5C2 = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n= (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n= (120) / (2 * 6)\n= 10\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (0.5^2) * (0.5^3)\n= 10 * 0.25 * 0.125\n= 10 * 0.03125\n= 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 2 tails when flipping a fair coin 5 times is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
