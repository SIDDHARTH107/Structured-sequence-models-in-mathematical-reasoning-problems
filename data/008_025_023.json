    "message_2": "To determine if this system of linear equations has no solutions, we can first check if the equations are parallel by comparing their slopes. If the slopes are the same but the y-intercepts are different, then the lines are parallel and there are no solutions.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\nEquation 1: 2x + 3y = 7\nDivide both sides by 3:\ny = -\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{7}{3}\n\nEquation 2: 4x + 6y = 12\nDivide both sides by 6:\ny = -\\frac{4}{6}x + \\frac{12}{6}\n\nSimplify Equation 2:\ny = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2\n\nNow we can compare the two equations:\n\nEquation 1: y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{7}{3}\nEquation 2: y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2\n\nThe slopes are the same (-2/3), but the y-intercepts are different (7/3 and 2). Therefore, the lines are parallel and there are no solutions to this system of linear equations."
