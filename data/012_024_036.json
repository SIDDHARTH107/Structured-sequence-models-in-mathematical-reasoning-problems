    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles needed on a surface to draw the graph without any edge crossings. For a complete graph K_n, the genus g can be found using the formula:\n\ng = (n - 3)(n - 4)/2\n\nFor K7, we have n = 7. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\ng = (7 - 3)(7 - 4)/2 = (4)(3)/2 = 6\n\nSo, the genus of the complete graph K7 is 6."
