    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 11y = 29, we first find a particular solution and then use the general form of Diophantine solutions to find all possible integer solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find a particular solution\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers but also their Bézout's coefficients, which are the integer solutions to the equation ax + by = gcd(a, b).\n\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to 7 and 11:\n11 = 1 * 7 + 4\n7 = 1 * 4 + 3\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 3 * 1\n\nNow, we work our way back up:\n1 = 4 - 1 * 3\n1 = 4 - 1 * (7 - 1 * 4)\n1 = 2 * 4 - 1 * 7\n1 = 2 * (11 - 1 * 7) - 1 * 7\n1 = 2 * 11 - 3 * 7\n\nSince the GCD of 7 and 11 is 1, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 29:\n29 = 58 * 11 - 87 * 7\n\nSo, a particular solution is x₀ = -87 and y₀ = 58.\n\nStep 2: Find the general form of the solutions\nThe general form of the solutions to the Diophantine equation ax + by = c is given by:\nx = x₀ + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y₀ - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nIn our case, a = 7, b = 11, c = 29, gcd(a, b) = 1, x₀ = -87, and y₀ = 58. Plugging in these values, we get:\nx = -87 + 11k\ny = 58 - 7k\n\nNow, we can find all possible integer solutions for x and y by plugging in different integer values for k."
