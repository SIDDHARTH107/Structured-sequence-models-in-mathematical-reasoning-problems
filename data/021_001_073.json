    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 6 |\n| 2 -1  1 | 1 |\n| 3  1 -1 | 7 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\n| 1  1  1 |  6 |\n| 0 -3 -1 | -11|\n| 0 -2 -4 | -11|\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\nR2 = R2 / -3\n\n| 1  1  1 |  6 |\n| 0  1  1/3 | 11/3|\n| 0 -2 -4 | -11|\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 + 2*R2\n\n| 1  1   1  |  6  |\n| 0  1  1/3 | 11/3|\n| 0  0 -10/3| -5/3|\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -10/3 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 / (-10/3)\n\n| 1  1   1  |  6  |\n| 0  1  1/3 | 11/3|\n| 0  0   1  |  1  |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 1.\n\nSubstitute z into the second row:\n\ny + 1/3(1) = 11/3\ny = 11/3 - 1/3\ny = 10/3\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first row:\n\nx + 10/3 + 1 = 6\nx = 6 - 10/3 - 1\nx = 18/3 - 10/3 - 3/3\nx = 5/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5/3, y = 10/3, and z = 1."
