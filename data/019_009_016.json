    "message_2": "To show that the implication \"Not not P implies P\" is true, we will create a truth table for the statement. In classical logic, a statement can be either true (T) or false (F). In intuitionistic logic, the law of excluded middle (P ∨ ¬P) does not hold, but since we are asked to use a truth table, we will work within classical logic.\n\nLet's create a truth table for the given statement:\n\nP | ¬P | ¬¬P | (¬¬P) → P\n-----------------------\nT |  F |  T  |    T\nF |  T |  F  |    T\n\nHere's an explanation of the table:\n\n1. First column (P): We list all possible truth values for P (True and False).\n2. Second column (¬P): We negate the values of P.\n3. Third column (¬¬P): We negate the values of ¬P, which gives us the double negation of P.\n4. Fourth column ((¬¬P) → P): We check if the implication holds for each row. If ¬¬P is true, then P must also be true for the implication to be true.\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the implication \"Not not P implies P\" is true for both possible values of P (True and False). Therefore, the implication is true."
