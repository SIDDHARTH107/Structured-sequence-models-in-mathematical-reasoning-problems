    "message_2": "To show that there exists an element of G which has order 8 or order 16, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Recall that the Sylow Theorems state that:\n\n1. For any prime p and any positive integer n, if p^n divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^n.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, satisfies n_p ≡ 1 (mod p) and n_p divides the index of the Sylow p-subgroup in G.\n\nNow, let's apply these theorems to our problem. Since the order of G is 16, we have that |G| = 2^4. Thus, by the first Sylow theorem, G has a subgroup of order 2^4 = 16. Let's call this subgroup H.\n\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of H. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of H, denoted by n_2, satisfies n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and n_2 divides the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup in H, which is [H : H_2] = |H| / |H_2| = 16 / 8 = 2. Since n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and n_2 divides 2, we have that n_2 = 1.\n\nThis means that there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of H, which we will call K. Since K is a subgroup of H and H is a subgroup of G, we have that K is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since K is a Sylow 2-subgroup of H, we have that |K| = 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, let x be an element of K such that x ≠ e (the identity element), where e is the identity element of G. Since K is a subgroup of G, we have that the order of x divides the order of G, which is 16. Thus, the order of x is either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. Since x ≠ e, the order of x cannot be 1. Moreover, since x is an element of K and |K| = 8, the order of x cannot be 16 (otherwise, K would be the entire group G). Therefore, the order of x is either 2, 4, or 8.\n\nIf the order of x is 8, then we are done, as we have found an element of G with order 8. If the order of x is 2 or 4, then consider the element x^2. The order of x^2 divides the order of x, so the order of x^2 is either 1, 2, or 4. Since x ≠ e, we have that x^2 ≠ e, so the order of x^2 cannot be 1. Thus, the order of x^2 is either 2 or 4.\n\nIf the order of x^2 is 4, then we are done, as we have found an element of G with order 8 (since (x^2)^2 = x^4 has order 2). If the order of x^2 is 2, then consider the element x^4. The order of x^4 divides the order of x^2, so the order of x^4 is either 1 or 2. Since x ≠ e, we have that x^4 ≠ e, so the order of x^4 cannot be 1. Thus, the order of x^4 is 2.\n\nNow, we have that x^8 = (x^4)^2 = e, so x has order 8. Thus, we have found an element of G with order 8, as desired.\n\nIn conclusion, there exists an element of G which has order 8 or order 16."
