    "message_1": "A company needs to schedule production of two products - Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 4 hours of work and yields a profit of $50, while the production of Product B requires 3 hours of work and yields a profit of $40. The company has a maximum of 30 hours of work available for production. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 40y, subject to the constraint that 4x + 3y ≤ 30.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequality for y:\n\n3y ≤ 30 - 4x\ny ≤ (30 - 4x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the integer solutions (x, y) that satisfy this inequality, as the number of units produced must be a whole number:\n\nFor x = 0: y ≤ 10, so y can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 10.\nFor x = 1: y ≤ 8.67, so y can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 8.\nFor x = 2: y ≤ 7.33, so y can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 7.\nFor x = 3: y ≤ 6, so y can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 6.\nFor x = 4: y ≤ 4.67, so y can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 4.\nFor x = 5: y ≤ 3.33, so y can be 0, 1, 2, 3.\nFor x = 6: y ≤ 2, so y can be 0, 1, 2.\nFor x = 7: y ≤ 0.67, so y can be 0, 1.\n\nNow, we will calculate the profit for each feasible solution:\n\n(0, 0): P(0, 0) = 0\n(0, 1): P(0, 1) = 40\n(0, 2): P(0, 2) = 80\n...\n(7, 0): P(7, 0) = 350\n(7, 1): P(7, 1) = 390\n\nComparing the profits, we find that the maximum profit is $390, which is achieved when the company produces 7 units of Product A and 1 unit of Product B."
