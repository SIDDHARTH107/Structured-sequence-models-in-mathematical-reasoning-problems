    "message_2": "To find the image of the half-disk under the conformal mapping w = f(z), we first need to parameterize the boundary of the half-disk. The boundary consists of two parts: the semicircle and the line segment on the real axis.\n\n1. The semicircle: |z| = 1, Re(z) > 0\nWe can parameterize this semicircle using polar coordinates: z = e^(iθ), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.\n\nNow, let's find the image of this semicircle under the mapping w = f(z):\nw = f(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^2 - 3e^(iθ) + 2\nw = e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2\n\n2. The line segment: 0 ≤ Re(z) ≤ 1, Im(z) = 0\nWe can parameterize this line segment as z = x, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nNow, let's find the image of this line segment under the mapping w = f(z):\nw = f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the region enclosed by these two curves in the w-plane.\n\nFor the semicircle:\nThe function w = e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2 represents a curve in the complex plane. It's difficult to find an explicit region for this curve, but we can analyze its behavior as θ varies from 0 to π.\n\nWhen θ = 0, w = 0.\nWhen θ = π, w = 4.\n\nAs θ varies from 0 to π, the curve will smoothly connect these two points in the w-plane.\n\nFor the line segment:\nThe function w = x^2 - 3x + 2 is a parabola in the real axis. As x varies from 0 to 1, the parabola will start at w = 2, reach a minimum at x = 1.5 (w = -0.25), and then go back to w = 0.\n\nCombining these two curves, the image of the half-disk under the conformal mapping w = f(z) will be a region enclosed by the curve w = e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2 (0 ≤ θ ≤ π) and the parabola w = x^2 - 3x + 2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in the w-plane."
