    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the given Diophantine equation by dividing both sides by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3. This gives us:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for x and y. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3y = 11 - 2x\n\nNext, we can find a particular solution by trying different integer values for x until we find a value that makes 11 - 2x divisible by 3. Let's try x = 1:\n\n11 - 2(1) = 9\n\nSince 9 is divisible by 3, we have found a particular solution:\n\n3y = 9\ny = 3\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (1, 3).\n\nNow, we need to find the general solution. We can do this by expressing the equation in terms of one variable and then finding a pattern. Let's express y in terms of x:\n\ny = (11 - 2x) / 3\n\nWe can see that for every increase of 3 in x, the value of 2x increases by 6, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the general solution can be found by adding multiples of 3 to the x value of our particular solution:\n\nx = 1 + 3k\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (11 - 2(1 + 3k)) / 3\ny = (11 - 2 - 6k) / 3\ny = (9 - 6k) / 3\ny = 3 - 2k\n\nSo, the general solution for the Diophantine equation is:\n\nx = 1 + 3k\ny = 3 - 2k\n\nwhere k is an integer."
