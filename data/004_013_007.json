    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2 in the interval [-2, 3], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2) = 3x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, let's set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\nx(3x - 6) = 0\nx = 0 or x = 2\n\nSo we have two critical points, x = 0 and x = 2. Now we need to check the values of the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval, x = -2 and x = 3.\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 + 2 = -8 - 12 + 2 = -18\nf(0) = 0^3 - 3(0)^2 + 2 = 2\nf(2) = 2^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2 = 8 - 12 + 2 = -2\nf(3) = 3^3 - 3(3)^2 + 2 = 27 - 27 + 2 = 2\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 2, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 3, and the minimum value is -18, which occurs at x = -2."
