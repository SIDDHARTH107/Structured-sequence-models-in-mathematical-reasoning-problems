    "message_1": "A car rental company has 4 cars available for rent, and there are 6 customers who want to rent a car. Each customer has a different rental period, ranging from 1 day to 6 days. The rental company wants to maximize their profit. The rental price per day for each customer is as follows:\n\n| Customer | Rental price per day ($) |\n| -------- | ------------------------ |\n| 1        | 50                       |\n| 2        | 70                       |\n| 3        | 80                       |\n| 4        | 90                       |\n| 5        | 100                      |\n| 6        | 120                      |\n\nHowever, each car is only available for up to 3 consecutive days. Write an integer programming problem to determine how the cars should be rented out to maximize the company's profit, and what is the maximum profit they can make?",
    "message_2": "Let's use binary variables to represent whether a customer rents a car or not. Let x_i be a binary variable, where x_i = 1 if customer i rents a car, and x_i = 0 otherwise.\n\nWe want to maximize the profit, which can be represented as the objective function:\n\nMaximize: P = 50x_1 + 70x_2 + 80x_3 + 90x_4 + 100x_5 + 120x_6\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Each car can be rented to at most one customer:\n\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 <= 4\n\n2. Each car can be rented for up to 3 consecutive days:\n\nx_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 3x_4 + 3x_5 + 3x_6 <= 12\n\n3. Binary constraints:\n\nx_i âˆˆ {0, 1} for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nNow, we can solve this integer programming problem using an optimization solver or by trying all possible combinations of renting cars to customers.\n\nBy solving the problem, we find that the optimal solution is:\n\nx_1 = 0, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1, x_4 = 1, x_5 = 1, x_6 = 0\n\nThis means that customers 2, 3, 4, and 5 should rent the cars, and the maximum profit the company can make is:\n\nP = 50(0) + 70(1) + 80(1) + 90(1) + 100(1) + 120(0) = $340"
