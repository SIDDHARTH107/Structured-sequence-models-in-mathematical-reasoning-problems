    "message_2": "First, let's compute A and B:\n\nA = g^a mod p = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\nB = g^b mod p = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow, Alice and Bob compute the shared secret key using A and B:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key as: K_A = B^a mod p = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\nBob computes the shared secret key as: K_B = A^b mod p = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key is 2."
