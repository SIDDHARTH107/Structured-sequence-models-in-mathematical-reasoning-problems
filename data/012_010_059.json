    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The smallest vertex cover is the one with the minimum number of vertices.\n\nIn the given graph, we can observe that vertex 1 is connected to all other vertices. Therefore, by including vertex 1 in the vertex cover, we can cover all the edges connected to it. Now, we need to cover the remaining edges.\n\nAfter covering the edges connected to vertex 1, we are left with the following edges to cover: (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5). We can cover these edges by including vertices 3 and 4 in the vertex cover.\n\nSo, the smallest vertex cover for the given graph is {1, 3, 4}."
