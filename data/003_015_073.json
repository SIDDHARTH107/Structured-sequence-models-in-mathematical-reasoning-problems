    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the function g(x) = -3 cos(2x), we need to analyze the coefficients and the argument of the cosine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sinusoidal function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine or cosine term. In this case, the coefficient of the cosine term is -3. The amplitude is the absolute value of -3, which is 3.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sinusoidal function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine or cosine function. In this case, the coefficient of x is 2. To find the period, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |coefficient of x|\n\nIn this case, the coefficient of x is 2, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function g(x) = -3 cos(2x) is 3, and the period is π."
