If the temperature at the ends of the rod is kept constant at 20°C and 100°C respectively, find the temperature distribution T(x,t) in the rod for 0 ≤ x ≤ 10 cm and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1000 s. Also, determine the maximum temperature in the rod and the time it takes to reach it.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution in the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and t are the spatial and temporal coordinates, respectively.\n\nSince the ends of the rod are kept at constant temperatures, we have the following boundary conditions:\n\nT(0,t) = 20°C\nT(10,t) = 100°C\n\nWe also need an initial condition for the temperature distribution in the rod. Let's assume that at t = 0, the temperature is uniform throughout the rod:\n\nT(x,0) = 20°C\n\nNow, we will solve the heat conduction equation using the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as the product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on t:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat conduction equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = αT(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nThe general solution for the first equation is:\n\nT(t) = A exp(-αλ²t)\n\nThe general solution for the second equation is:\n\nX(x) = B cos(λx) + C sin(λx)\n\nNow, we will apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A, B, and C. First, let's apply the boundary conditions for x:\n\nX(0) = B cos(0) + C sin(0) = 20\nX(10) = B cos(10λ) + C sin(10λ) = 100\n\nSince sin(0) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, we have B = 20. Now, we need to find λ and C such that:\n\n20 cos(10λ) + C sin(10λ) = 100\n\nWe can find the values of λ and C by using the Fourier series method. The Fourier series representation of the temperature distribution is:\n\nT(x,t) = 20 + ∑[A_n exp(-αλ_n²t) sin(λ_nx)]\n\nwhere A_n and λ_n are the Fourier coefficients and eigenvalues, respectively. The Fourier coefficients can be found using the following formula:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[f(x) sin(λ_nx) dx]\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (10 cm) and f(x) is the function representing the temperature distribution at t = 0 (20°C). In this case, f(x) = 100 - 20 = 80.\n\nA_n = (2/10) ∫[80 sin(λ_nx) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nWe can solve this integral to find the Fourier coefficients:\n\nA_n = (8/λ_n)[1 - cos(10λ_n)]\n\nNow, we can substitute the Fourier coefficients back into the Fourier series representation of the temperature distribution:\n\nT(x,t) = 20 + ∑[(8/λ_n)[1 - cos(10λ_n)] exp(-αλ_n²t) sin(λ_nx)]\n\nTo find the maximum temperature in the rod and the time it takes to reach it, we can analyze the behavior of the temperature distribution as a function of x and t. The maximum temperature will occur when the exponential term exp(-αλ_n²t) is at its maximum value, which is 1. This happens at t = 0. Therefore, the maximum temperature in the rod is:\n\nT_max = 20 + ∑[(8/λ_n)[1 - cos(10λ_n)] sin(λ_nx)]\n\nThe time it takes to reach the maximum temperature is 0 seconds since the maximum temperature occurs at t = 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the temperature distribution in the rod is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = 20 + ∑[(8/λ_n)[1 - cos(10λ_n)] exp(-αλ_n²t) sin(λ_nx)]\n\nThe maximum temperature in the rod and the time it takes to reach it are:\n\nT_max = 20 + ∑[(8/λ_n)[1 - cos(10λ_n)] sin(λ_nx)]\nt_max = 0 seconds"
