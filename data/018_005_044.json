    "message_2": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Let U be the universal set containing A, and let A' be the complement of A with respect to U. By definition, A' contains all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of A and A', denoted as A ∩ A'. By definition, the intersection of two sets contains all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nSince A' contains all elements in U that are not in A, there are no elements that are common to both A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nIn set theory notation, we can write this as:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis demonstrates that the intersection of a set and its complement is always the empty set, using set theory concepts."
