    "message_1": "Suppose you are running a manufacturing firm that produces two products: product A and product B. The firm has 4 workers, and each worker is only able to work 40 hours per week. Each unit of product A requires 8 hours of work from a worker, while each unit of product B needs 10 hours of work. The profit from one unit of product A is $20, while that of product B is $30. Determine the number of units of product A and B that the firm should produce weekly in order to maximize profit, using matrix methods.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y, subject to the constraint that the total number of hours worked is 40 hours per worker per week, with 4 workers, which is 160 hours.\n\nThe constraint can be written as:\n\n8x + 10y â‰¤ 160\n\nWe can use the simplex method to solve this linear programming problem. First, we need to convert the inequality constraint into an equation by introducing a slack variable, s:\n\n8x + 10y + s = 160\n\nNow, we can write the problem in matrix form:\n\n```\n[  8  10  1 | 160 ]\n[ 20  30  0 |  P  ]\n```\n\nWe want to maximize P, so we will use the simplex method to find the optimal values of x and y. First, we need to find the pivot element. In this case, it is the 8 in the first row and first column. We will divide the first row by 8:\n\n```\n[  1  1.25  0.125 | 20 ]\n[ 20  30    0    |  P  ]\n```\n\nNow, we will use the pivot element to eliminate the 20 in the second row. We will subtract 20 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[  1  1.25  0.125 |  20 ]\n[  0  5    -2.5   | -P+400 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will divide the second row by 5:\n\n```\n[  1  1.25  0.125 |  20 ]\n[  0  1    -0.5   | -P/5+80 ]\n```\n\nFinally, we will use the pivot element in the second row to eliminate the 1.25 in the first row. We will subtract 1.25 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n[  1  0    0.75  |  P/5+20 ]\n[  0  1   -0.5   | -P/5+80 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the optimal solution in the matrix:\n\n```\n[  1  0    0.75  |  P/5+20 ]\n[  0  1   -0.5   | -P/5+80 ]\n```\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nP/5 + 20 = 0.75x\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-P/5 + 80 = -0.5y\n\nSolving for x and y, we get:\n\nx = 20\ny = 8\n\nSo, the firm should produce 20 units of product A and 8 units of product B weekly to maximize profit. The maximum profit can be calculated by plugging these values into the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 20x + 30y = 20(20) + 30(8) = 400 + 240 = $640."
