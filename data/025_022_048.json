    "message_2": "The algebraic variety given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ is known as the Fermat cubic surface. It is a non-singular cubic surface in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^3$. \n\nThe dimension of the derived category of coherent sheaves on an algebraic variety is given by the Grothendieck group of the variety. For a smooth projective variety, the Grothendieck group is isomorphic to the Chow group, which is the group of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence.\n\nIn the case of the Fermat cubic surface, the Chow group is known to be isomorphic to the Picard group, which is the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on the variety. The Picard group of the Fermat cubic surface is isomorphic to the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $X$ is the Fermat cubic surface.\n\nThe second cohomology group of the Fermat cubic surface is known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^7$. This can be shown using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the fact that the Fermat cubic surface is a complete intersection of three quadrics in $\\mathbb{P}^5$. Therefore, the dimension of the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Fermat cubic surface is 7."
