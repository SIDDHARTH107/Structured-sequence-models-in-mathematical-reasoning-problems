    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $20 and must make a fair offer to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, both players keep the money. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. What is the minimum offer that Player 1 must make for Player 2 to accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum offer that Player 1 must make for Player 2 to accept the offer depends on Player 2's preferences and their perception of fairness. However, in a purely rational scenario, Player 2 should accept any offer greater than $0, as receiving any amount of money is better than receiving nothing. So, the minimum offer that Player 1 must make for Player 2 to accept the offer would be $0.01 (1 cent), assuming both players are acting rationally."
