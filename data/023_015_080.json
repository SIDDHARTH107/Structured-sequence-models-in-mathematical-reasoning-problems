    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked and produces a wave with a frequency of 440 Hz. If the length of the guitar string is 0.6 meters and the wave's speed is 320 m/s, what is the fundamental frequency of the string? Use the Fourier transform to solve the wave propagation problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the string, we can use the formula for the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string:\n\nf1 = (v / 2L)\n\nwhere f1 is the fundamental frequency, v is the wave's speed, and L is the length of the string.\n\nGiven the wave's speed (v) is 320 m/s and the length of the guitar string (L) is 0.6 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf1 = (320 m/s) / (2 * 0.6 m)\n\nf1 = 320 m/s / 1.2 m\n\nf1 = 266.67 Hz\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the string is approximately 266.67 Hz.\n\nNote: The Fourier transform is not necessary to solve this problem, as the fundamental frequency can be directly calculated using the formula mentioned above. The Fourier transform is used to analyze the frequency components of a signal, but in this case, we are only interested in the fundamental frequency."
