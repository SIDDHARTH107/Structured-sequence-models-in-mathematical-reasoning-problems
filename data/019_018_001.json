    "message_2": "To prove that if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R using natural deduction, we will use the rules of implication elimination (→E) and implication introduction (→I). Here's the proof:\n\n1. (P → Q) (Assumption)\n2. (Q → R) (Assumption)\n3. P (Assumption)\n4. Q (1, 3, →E) (From P → Q and P, we can deduce Q)\n5. R (2, 4, →E) (From Q → R and Q, we can deduce R)\n6. (P → R) (3-5, →I) (From the assumption P, we deduced R, so we can introduce the implication P → R)\n\nSo, we have shown that if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R using natural deduction."
