    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 5 volunteers are asked to clean up a park. Each volunteer must contribute a certain amount of time to complete the task. The volunteers will receive a reward only if the task is completed within the deadline, and the reward will be divided equally among the volunteers. The cost of not completing the task within the deadline is high, and each volunteer must pay a share of the penalty.\n\nGiven the following table representing the number of hours each volunteer can contribute to complete the task, what is the minimum number of hours required from each volunteer to ensure that the task is completed within the deadline and no penalty is incurred?\n\n| Volunteer | Hours |\n|-----------|-------|\n| 1         | 8     |\n| 2         | 6     |\n| 3         | 4     |\n| 4         | 3     |\n| 5         | 2     |",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of hours required from each volunteer to ensure that the task is completed within the deadline and no penalty is incurred, we need to determine the total number of hours needed to complete the task. Let's assume that the total number of hours required to complete the task is H.\n\nSince the volunteers have different capacities, we need to find the maximum number of hours they can collectively contribute without exceeding their individual limits. We can do this by adding the maximum hours each volunteer can contribute:\n\nTotal hours = 8 (Volunteer 1) + 6 (Volunteer 2) + 4 (Volunteer 3) + 3 (Volunteer 4) + 2 (Volunteer 5)\nTotal hours = 23\n\nNow, we need to divide the total hours (H) by the number of volunteers (5) to find the minimum number of hours required from each volunteer:\n\nMinimum hours per volunteer = H / 5\n\nSince the total number of hours available is 23, we can find the minimum number of hours required from each volunteer:\n\nMinimum hours per volunteer = 23 / 5 = 4.6\n\nHowever, since the volunteers can only contribute whole hours, we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number:\n\nMinimum hours per volunteer = 5\n\nSo, each volunteer needs to contribute a minimum of 5 hours to ensure that the task is completed within the deadline and no penalty is incurred. Note that this may require some volunteers to contribute more hours than they initially could, so it's important to ensure that the volunteers can adjust their schedules accordingly."
