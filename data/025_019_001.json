    "message_2": "A smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is given by a homogeneous equation of degree 2:\n\nQ(x, y, z, w) = ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dw^2 + 2exy + 2fyz + 2gzw + 2hxz + 2ixw + 2jzw = 0\n\nThe degree of a projective variety is defined as the number of intersection points with a generic hyperplane, counted with multiplicities. In this case, the hyperplane can be represented by a linear equation:\n\nH(x, y, z, w) = px + qy + rz + sw = 0\n\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\nQ(x, y, z, w) = 0\nH(x, y, z, w) = 0\n\nSince Q is a quadratic equation and H is a linear equation, the intersection will generally consist of 2 points (counted with multiplicities). Therefore, the degree of a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is 2."
