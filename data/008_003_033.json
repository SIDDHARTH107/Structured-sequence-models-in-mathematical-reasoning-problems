    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the matrix A, we need to find the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by row reducing the matrix to its row echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -6 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there are two non-zero rows, which means the rank of the matrix A is 2."
