    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 18, which can be factored as 2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say P, of order 9. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, we have that n_3 divides 18/9 = 2 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 must be equal to 1. This implies that P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G/P| = |G|/|P| = 18/9 = 2, G/P is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, C2. By the correspondence theorem, there exists a subgroup H of G such that H is isomorphic to G/P. In particular, H is a subgroup of G of order 2.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, i.e., G is isomorphic to P × H. Since P is isomorphic to C9 (the cyclic group of order 9) and H is isomorphic to C2, G is isomorphic to C9 × C2, which is isomorphic to C18 (the cyclic group of order 18).\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIn this case, we claim that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and H. To see this, note that since P is normal in G, the action of G on P by conjugation induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P). Since P is isomorphic to C9, Aut(P) is isomorphic to C6 (the cyclic group of order 6). Thus, we have a homomorphism f: G → C6.\n\nNow, consider the restriction of f to H. Since H is of order 2, the image of H under f must be either the identity or an element of order 2 in C6. If the image of H is the identity, then H is contained in the kernel of f, which would imply that G is abelian, contradicting our assumption. Therefore, the image of H must be an element of order 2 in C6.\n\nThus, we have a non-trivial action of H on P, which gives us a non-abelian semidirect product of P and H. Since |P| = 9 and |H| = 2, the order of this semidirect product is 9 * 2 = 18. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C18 (the cyclic group of order 18) or the non-abelian group of order 18, depending on whether G is abelian or non-abelian."
