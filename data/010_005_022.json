    "message_2": "A topological space (X, T) is said to be connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, there are no two non-empty open sets A and B such that A ∪ B = X and A ∩ B = ∅.\n\nLet's examine the given topology T: {∅,{a},{c,d},{a,c,d},{a,b,c,d}}.\n\nWe can see that there are two non-empty open sets {a} and {c,d} such that their union is X:\n\n{a} ∪ {c,d} = {a, c, d} ≠ X\n\nHowever, this union does not cover the entire space X, as the element b is missing. Therefore, we cannot find two disjoint non-empty open sets whose union is X.\n\nThus, the topological space (X, T) is connected."
