    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x² + y² - xy, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - y\n∂f/∂y = 2y - x\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n2x - y = 0\n2y - x = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nx = 2y\n2y - (2y) = 0\n\nThus, y can be any value, and x = 2y. The critical point is a line given by x = 2y.\n\nNow, let's classify the critical points as local maxima or minima using the second derivative test. We need to compute the second partial derivatives and the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂y² = 2\n∂²f/∂x∂y = -1\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n\nH = | 2  -1 |\n    | -1  2 |\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix is:\n\ndet(H) = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3\n\nSince det(H) > 0 and ∂²f/∂x² > 0, the critical point is a local minimum. However, since the critical point is a line, there is not a unique local minimum, but rather a continuous set of local minima along the line x = 2y.\n\nMorse Theory states that the number of critical points of a function is equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of the level sets of the function. However, Morse Theory is not directly applicable in this case, as the critical points form a line rather than isolated points. Nevertheless, we have found that there is a continuous set of local minima along the line x = 2y, which is the only critical point of the function f(x, y) = x² + y² - xy."
