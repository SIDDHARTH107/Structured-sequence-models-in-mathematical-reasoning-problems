    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3 using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the positions of the wolves (x1, x2, x3, x4) and calculate their fitness values (f(x)).\n2. Identify the three best wolves (alpha, beta, gamma) based on their fitness values.\n3. Update the positions of the wolves using the GWO algorithm equations.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's start with the initial positions of the wolves:\n\nx1 = -1, x2 = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 2\n\nCalculate the fitness values:\n\nf(x1) = 2(-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 7(-1) - 3 = -13\nf(x2) = 2(0)^3 - 5(0)^2 + 7(0) - 3 = -3\nf(x3) = 2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 7(1) - 3 = 1\nf(x4) = 2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 + 7(2) - 3 = 3\n\nNow, identify the three best wolves (lowest fitness values):\n\nAlpha: x1 = -1, f(x1) = -13\nBeta: x2 = 0, f(x2) = -3\nGamma: x3 = 1, f(x3) = 1\n\nUpdate the positions of the wolves using the GWO algorithm equations:\n\nx_new = x_alpha - A * D_alpha + x_beta - A * D_beta + x_gamma - A * D_gamma\n\nwhere A and D are random coefficients.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume A = 0.5 and D = 1:\n\nx_new = (-1 - 0.5 * 1) + (0 - 0.5 * 1) + (1 - 0.5 * 1) = -1.5 + (-0.5) + 0.5 = -1.5\n\nNow, we can repeat steps 2 and 3 with the new positions of the wolves until a stopping criterion is met. In practice, you would run the GWO algorithm for a predetermined number of iterations or until the fitness values converge.\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm for several iterations, you should find that the minimum value of the function f(x) is approximately -13, which occurs at x = -1. Note that the GWO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, so the results may vary depending on the initial positions of the wolves and the random coefficients used."
