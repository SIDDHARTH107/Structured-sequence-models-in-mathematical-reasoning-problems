    "message_2": "To find the derivative of h(x) = f(x)g(x) using the product rule, we first need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x² with respect to x is:\nf'(x) = 2x\n\nThe derivative of g(x) = cos(x) with respect to x is:\ng'(x) = -sin(x)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nh'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives and original functions:\n\nh'(x) = (2x)(cos(x)) + (x²)(-sin(x))\n\nh'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x²*sin(x)\n\nSo, the derivative of h(x) = f(x)g(x) is h'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x²*sin(x)."
