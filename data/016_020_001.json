    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by iteratively removing smaller tetrahedra from a larger one. In each stage of the construction, the number of smaller tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the first stage (n=0), there is only 1 tetrahedron (the original one).\nIn the second stage (n=1), 4 smaller tetrahedra are formed.\nIn the third stage (n=2), 4^2 = 16 smaller tetrahedra are formed.\nIn the fourth stage (n=3), 4^3 = 64 smaller tetrahedra are formed.\n\nSo, in the fifth stage (n=4), there will be 4^4 = 256 smaller tetrahedra present in the construction of the Sierpinski tetrahedron."
