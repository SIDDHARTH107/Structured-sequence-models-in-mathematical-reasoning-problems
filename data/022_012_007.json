    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole at z=0, we first need to determine the multiplicity of the zero of the denominator at z=0. The denominator is given by (z^2 + 1)^2. Since z=0 is not a root of z^2 + 1, it follows that z=0 is not a pole of f(z). Therefore, the order of the pole at z=0 is 0.\n\nNow, let's find the residue at z=0. Since z=0 is not a pole, the residue is simply 0. In general, the residue of a meromorphic function at a point that is not a pole is always 0.\n\nSo, the order of the pole at z=0 is 0, and the residue at z=0 is 0."
