    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, there are N = 8 self-similar pieces (since 1/9 of the carpet is removed at each step, leaving 8/9), and the scaling factor is s = 3 (since each side of the carpet is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Sierpinski carpet is:\n\nD = log(8) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet is approximately 1.8928, regardless of the initial side length."
