    "message_2": "To prove that the given algebraic curve is birationally equivalent to a rational curve using Mori theory, we will first find a birational map that transforms the curve to a rational curve. Then, we will provide a step-by-step proof for the equivalence.\n\nStep 1: Simplify the curve equation\nThe given curve equation is:\n$x^4 + 2x^3y - 4x^2y^2 - 4xy^3 + y^4 = 0$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n$(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2x^2y^2 - 4x^3y - 4xy^3 = 0$\n\nStep 2: Find a birational map\nLet's introduce a new variable $z$ and consider the map:\n$\\phi: (x, y) \\mapsto (x, y, z)$, where $z = xy$\n\nThe inverse map is given by:\n$\\phi^{-1}: (x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, y)$, where $x = \\frac{z}{y}$ and $y = \\frac{z}{x}$\n\nNow, let's substitute $z = xy$ in the simplified curve equation:\n$(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2z^2 - 4z^2(x + y) = 0$\n\nStep 3: Homogenize the equation\nTo homogenize the equation, we introduce a new variable $w$ and multiply each term by the appropriate power of $w$ to make all terms have the same total degree. The homogenized equation is:\n$(x^2w^2 + y^2w^2)^2 - 2z^2w^4 - 4z^2w^2(xw + yw) = 0$\n\nStep 4: Simplify the homogenized equation\nThe homogenized equation can be simplified as:\n$w^4(x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4) - 2z^2w^4 - 4z^2w^2(x^3 + x^2y + xy^2 + y^3) = 0$\n\nStep 5: Prove the equivalence\nNow, we need to show that the homogenized equation represents a rational curve. To do this, we can use the projection from a point not on the curve to the plane $w = 1$. Let's choose the point $(0, 0, 1, 0)$ and project from this point to the plane $w = 1$. The projection map is given by:\n$\\pi: (x, y, z, w) \\mapsto (x, y, z)$, where $w = 1$\n\nThe inverse projection map is given by:\n$\\pi^{-1}: (x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, y, z, 1)$\n\nNow, we can see that the composition of the maps $\\phi$, $\\pi$, and their inverses gives a birational equivalence between the given curve and a rational curve in the plane $w = 1$. Therefore, the given algebraic curve is birationally equivalent to a rational curve.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found a birational map that transforms the given curve to a rational curve and provided a step-by-step proof for the equivalence using Mori theory."
