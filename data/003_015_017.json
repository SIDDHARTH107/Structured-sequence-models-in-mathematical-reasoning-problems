    "message_2": "The given equation is y = 3sin(2x - π/6). This is a sine function of the form y = Asin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn this case, A = 3, B = 2, and C = π/6.\n\nThe amplitude of the wave is the absolute value of A, which is |3| = 3.\n\nTo find the period of the wave, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |B|\n\nIn this case, B = 2, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |2| = 2π / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the wave is 3, and the period is π."
