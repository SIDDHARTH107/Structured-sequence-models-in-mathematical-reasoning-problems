    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 30, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 30 = 2 × 3 × 5\n2. Determine the possible group structures using the Sylow theorems.\n\nFor a group of order 30, we have the following Sylow subgroups:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: These have order 2, and there is only one group of order 2, which is the cyclic group Z2.\n- Sylow 3-subgroups: These have order 3, and there is only one group of order 3, which is the cyclic group Z3.\n- Sylow 5-subgroups: These have order 5, and there is only one group of order 5, which is the cyclic group Z5.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of each type of Sylow subgroup in the group:\n\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 15 (30/2) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 and 15.\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 10 (30/3) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are 1 and 10.\n- The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 6 (30/5) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is 1.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible group structures:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is cyclic and isomorphic to Z30.\n2. If there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, then the group is a semidirect product of Z5 and Z6, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nThus, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 30: Z30 and D15."
