    "message_2": "(a) The number of poles of f(z) inside the unit circle:\n\nTo find the poles of f(z), we need to find the zeros of the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic equation:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = 0\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n(z + 1)^2 = 0\n\nSo, there is one pole at z = -1, which is inside the unit circle.\n\n(b) The order of any pole of f(z) inside the unit circle:\n\nSince the pole at z = -1 is a double root of the denominator, the order of the pole is 2.\n\n(c) The number of zeros of f(z) inside the unit circle:\n\nTo find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the zeros of the numerator:\n\nz^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - 6 = 0\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. By testing these values, we find that z = 1 and z = 2 are zeros of the numerator. Factoring the polynomial, we get:\n\n(z - 1)(z - 2)z = 0\n\nSo, there are three zeros: z = 0, z = 1, and z = 2. Only z = 0 is inside the unit circle. Therefore, there is 1 zero of f(z) inside the unit circle."
