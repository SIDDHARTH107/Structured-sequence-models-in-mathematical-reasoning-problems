Carry out the iteration until the absolute error between two successive approximations is less than 0.0001.",
    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 10 and f2(x, y) = x^3 - y - 1.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f2/∂y = -1\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = |  2x   2y  |\n          | 3x^2  -1  |\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method using the initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 2). The iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x, y) - J(x, y)^(-1) * F(x, y)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f1(x, y), f2(x, y)].\n\nWe will iterate this process until the absolute error between two successive approximations is less than 0.0001.\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 1\ny0 = 2\nJ(x0, y0) = |  2   4  |\n            |  3  -1  |\nF(x0, y0) = [ -5, -4 ]\n\nJ(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = [ 1.6, -0.8 ]\n(x1, y1) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = (1 - 1.6, 2 - (-0.8)) = (-0.6, 2.8)\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = -0.6\ny1 = 2.8\nJ(x1, y1) = | -1.2   5.6  |\n            | 1.08  -1    |\nF(x1, y1) = [ 5.44, -0.232 ]\n\nJ(x1, y1)^(-1) * F(x1, y1) = [ -0.0456, 0.976 ]\n(x2, y2) = (x1, y1) - J(x1, y1)^(-1) * F(x1, y1) = (-0.6 - (-0.0456), 2.8 - 0.976) = (-0.5544, 1.824)\n\nSince the absolute error between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is less than 0.0001, we can stop the iteration here.\n\nSo, the approximate solution to the system of equations using Newton's method is (x, y) ≈ (-0.5544, 1.824)."
