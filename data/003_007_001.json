    "message_2": "We are given a triangle with sides of length a = 6, b = 8, and c = 10. We want to find the measure of the angle B opposite the side of length 8. We can use the Law of Cosines to solve this problem.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we want to find angle B, so we will rearrange the formula to solve for cos(B):\n\ncos(B) = (a² + c² - b²) / (2ac)\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths:\n\ncos(B) = (6² + 10² - 8²) / (2 * 6 * 10)\ncos(B) = (36 + 100 - 64) / 120\ncos(B) = (72) / 120\ncos(B) = 0.6\n\nNow, we need to find the angle B whose cosine is 0.6. We can use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos) to do this:\n\nB = arccos(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nB ≈ 53.13°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side of length 8 is approximately 53.13°."
