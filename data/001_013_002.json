    "message_2": "First, we want to isolate the square root term. To do this, we will subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n√(8x-2) + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3\n√(8x-2) = 4\n\nNow, we want to get rid of the square root. To do this, we will square both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(8x-2))^2 = 4^2\n8x - 2 = 16\n\nNext, we want to isolate the x term. We will add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n8x - 2 + 2 = 16 + 2\n8x = 18\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for x:\n\n8x / 8 = 18 / 8\nx = 9/4\n\nSo, the solution for x is 9/4 or 2.25."
