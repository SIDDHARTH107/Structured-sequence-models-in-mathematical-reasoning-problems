    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p\n\nGiven the values p=23, g=5, a=6, and b=15, let's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\n2. Bob computes B = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n3. Alice computes K_A = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\n4. Bob computes K_B = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the shared secret key as K = 2."
