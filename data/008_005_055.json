    "message_2": "To solve this non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrices. We will use the method of substitution in this case.\n\nFirst, we can solve the third equation for x:\n\nx = 5 - y - z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the first two equations:\n\n3(5 - y - z) + 2y - 4z = 11\n2(5 - y - z) - 3y + z = -1\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n15 - 3y - 3z + 2y - 4z = 11\n10 - 2y - 2z - 3y + z = -1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-1y - 7z = -4\n-5y - z = -11\n\nNow, solve the second equation for z:\n\nz = -11 + 5y\n\nSubstitute this expression for z into the first equation:\n\n-1y - 7(-11 + 5y) = -4\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n-1y + 77 - 35y = -4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-36y = -81\n\nNow, divide by -36 to solve for y:\n\ny = 81/36 = 9/4\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the expression for z:\n\nz = -11 + 5(9/4)\nz = -11 + 45/4\nz = (-44 + 45) / 4\nz = 1/4\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 5 - (9/4) - (1/4)\nx = (20 - 9 - 1) / 4\nx = 10/4\nx = 5/2\n\nSo, the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 5/2\ny = 9/4\nz = 1/4"
