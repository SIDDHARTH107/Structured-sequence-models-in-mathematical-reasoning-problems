    "message_1": "A curve is given by the equation y = sqrt(2x + 1). Find the length of the curve from x = 1 to x = 5.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we need to use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = sqrt(2x + 1) with respect to x:\n\ny = (2x + 1)^(1/2)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\ndy/dx = (1/2)(2x + 1)^(-1/2) * 2 = 1 / sqrt(2x + 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the square of the derivative:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (1 / (2x + 1))\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 5] sqrt(1 + (1 / (2x + 1))) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can first simplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n1 + (1 / (2x + 1)) = (2x + 1 + 1) / (2x + 1) = (2x + 2) / (2x + 1)\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nL = ∫[1, 5] sqrt((2x + 2) / (2x + 1)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 2x + 1 => du = 2 dx => dx = du/2\n\nWhen x = 1, u = 2(1) + 1 = 3\nWhen x = 5, u = 2(5) + 1 = 11\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = (1/2) ∫[3, 11] sqrt((u + 1) / u) du\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n(u + 1) / u = 1 + 1/u\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nL = (1/2) ∫[3, 11] sqrt(1 + 1/u) du\n\nNow, we can use the substitution method again. Let:\n\nv = 1 + 1/u => dv = -1/u^2 du => du = -u^2 dv\n\nWhen u = 3, v = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3\nWhen u = 11, v = 1 + 1/11 = 12/11\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of v:\n\nL = (1/2) ∫[4/3, 12/11] sqrt(v) * (-u^2) dv\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (1/2) * (-1/3) * [2/3 * v^(3/2)] | [4/3, 12/11]\n\nL = (-1/3) * [2/3 * (12/11)^(3/2) - 2/3 * (4/3)^(3/2)]\n\nL = (-2/9) * [(12/11)^(3/2) - (4/3)^(3/2)]\n\nNow, we can plug this into a calculator to get the approximate length of the curve:\n\nL ≈ (-2/9) * (1.8515 - 1.5874) ≈ 0.2937\n\nSo, the length of the curve from x = 1 to x = 5 is approximately 0.2937 units."
