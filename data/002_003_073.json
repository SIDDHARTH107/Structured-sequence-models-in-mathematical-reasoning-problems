    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 3 cm. What is its surface area in cm²?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of a cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself. In this case, the side length is 3 cm. So, the area of one face is:\n\nArea = side × side = 3 cm × 3 cm = 9 cm²\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube:\n\nSurface Area = 6 × 9 cm² = 54 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 54 cm²."
