    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations for this PDE are:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1$, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 3i$, and $\\frac{du}{dt} = 0$.\n\nSolving the first two equations, we get:\n\n$x(t) = t + x_0$ and $y(t) = 3it + y_0$.\n\nNow, we can eliminate the parameter $t$:\n\n$t = x - x_0$, so $y = 3i(x - x_0) + y_0$.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$y - 3ix = y_0 - 3ix_0$.\n\nSince $u(x,0) = \\sin(x)$, we have $u(x_0, y_0) = \\sin(x_0)$. Therefore, the solution to the PDE is given by:\n\n$u(x,y) = \\sin(x_0) = \\sin(x - 3i(y - 3ix))$.\n\nThis is the solution to the given partial differential equation."
