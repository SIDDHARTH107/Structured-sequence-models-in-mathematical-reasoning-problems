    "message_1": "A company is planning to launch a new product and wants to communicate its quality level to consumers. The company can either honestly reveal the quality level, or they can lie about it. If they lie, there is a chance consumers will discover the true quality level and the company will lose credibility. Based on previous consumer data, the company estimates that if they tell the truth the product will sell for $100,000, but if they lie and consumers find out, the product will only sell for $80,000. However, if they lie and consumers do not find out, the product will sell for $120,000. If the company chooses to lie, what is the probability that they will get away with it (i.e. consumers will not find out) in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of getting away with lying as p. Then, the probability of being caught lying is (1-p).\n\nTo maximize profit, the expected profit from lying should be greater than or equal to the profit from telling the truth. The expected profit from lying can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected profit from lying = (probability of getting away with lying * profit if not caught) + (probability of being caught * profit if caught)\n= (p * $120,000) + ((1-p) * $80,000)\n\nSince the profit from telling the truth is $100,000, we can set up the inequality:\n\n(p * $120,000) + ((1-p) * $80,000) >= $100,000\n\nNow, we can solve for p:\n\n$120,000p + $80,000 - $80,000p >= $100,000\n40,000p >= $20,000\np >= 0.5\n\nSo, the company needs to have a probability of at least 0.5 (50%) of getting away with lying in order to maximize their profit."
