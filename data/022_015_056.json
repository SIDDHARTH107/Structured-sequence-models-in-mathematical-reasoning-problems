    "message_2": "To find the image of the unit disc $|z|<1$ under the function $f(z)=\\frac{1}{z}+z-1$, we first need to find the image of the unit circle $|z|=1$ under the function $f(z)$. \n\nLet $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of $z$ on the unit circle. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{e^{i\\theta}} + e^{i\\theta} - 1$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function using Euler's formula:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{-i\\theta} + e^{i\\theta} - 1$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$ and $\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we can rewrite the function in terms of trigonometric functions:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = (\\cos(\\theta) - i\\sin(\\theta)) + (\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)) - 1$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = 2\\cos(\\theta) - 1$$\n\nNow, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the image of the unit disc $|z|<1$. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a domain and maps a boundary of the domain to a straight line, then the function maps the interior of the domain to one side of the line and the exterior of the domain to the other side of the line.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic in the unit disc $|z|<1$, and the image of the unit circle $|z|=1$ is the real line $2\\cos(\\theta) - 1$, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the image of the unit disc $|z|<1$.\n\nThe image of the unit disc $|z|<1$ under the function $f(z)$ is the region on one side of the line $2\\cos(\\theta) - 1$. To determine which side of the line the image lies on, we can evaluate $f(z)$ at a point inside the unit disc, such as $z=0$:\n\n$$f(0) = \\frac{1}{0} + 0 - 1 = \\infty$$\n\nSince $f(0)$ is infinite, the image of the unit disc $|z|<1$ under the function $f(z)$ is the region on the side of the line $2\\cos(\\theta) - 1$ that does not contain the origin. This region is given by:\n\n$$\\text{Im}(f(z)) > 2\\cos(\\theta) - 1$$"
