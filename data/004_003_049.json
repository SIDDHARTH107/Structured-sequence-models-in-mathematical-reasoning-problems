    "message_1": "A rectangular box with an open top is to be constructed from a thin metal sheet. The length of the box is twice the width. The box must have a volume of 1200 cubic centimeters. What should the dimensions of the box be in order to minimize the amount of metal used in its construction? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let the width of the box be x cm, and the length be 2x cm. Let the height of the box be h cm. We are given that the volume of the box is 1200 cubic centimeters. So,\n\nx(2x)(h) = 1200\n2x^2h = 1200\n\nNow, we need to minimize the surface area of the box. The surface area (SA) of the open-top box can be expressed as:\n\nSA = x(2x) + 2(xh) + 2(2xh)\nSA = 2x^2 + 2xh + 4xh\nSA = 2x^2 + 6xh\n\nWe need to eliminate h from the equation. We can do this by solving for h in the volume equation:\n\nh = 1200 / (2x^2)\nh = 600 / x^2\n\nNow substitute this expression for h in the surface area equation:\n\nSA = 2x^2 + 6x(600 / x^2)\nSA = 2x^2 + 3600 / x\n\nNow we need to find the critical points of this function to determine the minimum surface area. To do this, we'll take the derivative of the surface area function with respect to x:\n\nd(SA)/dx = 4x - 3600 / x^2\n\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to 0:\n\n4x - 3600 / x^2 = 0\n\nNow, multiply both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n4x^3 - 3600 = 0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx^3 = 900\n\nNow, take the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 9\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length and height:\n\nLength = 2x = 2(9) = 18 cm\nHeight = 600 / x^2 = 600 / (9^2) = 600 / 81 = 20/3 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of metal used in its construction are width = 9 cm, length = 18 cm, and height = 20/3 cm."
