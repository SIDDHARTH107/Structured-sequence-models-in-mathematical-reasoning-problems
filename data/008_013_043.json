    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 5  (1)\n4x + 4y + 2z = 22  (2)\n-2x + 2y + 4z = 8  (3)\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = |  2   3  -1 |\n    |  4   4   2 |\n    | -2   2   4 |\n\nB = |  5  |\n    | 22  |\n    |  8  |\n\nNow, let's find the LU decomposition of A:\n\nStep 1: Initialize L and U matrices:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 0  1  0 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nU = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 + R1\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    |-1  0  1 |\n\nU = |  2   3  -1 |\n    |  0  -2   4 |\n    |  0   5   3 |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 + 2.5 * R2\n\nL = |  1    0   0 |\n    |  2    1   0 |\n    | -1  2.5   1 |\n\nU = |  2   3  -1 |\n    |  0  -2   4 |\n    |  0   0   8 |\n\nNow we have the LU decomposition of A: A = LU\n\nNext, we'll solve the system of linear equations using forward and backward substitution.\n\nStep 4: Forward substitution (solve LY = B for Y):\n\nY1 = 5 / 1 = 5\nY2 = (22 - 2 * Y1) / 1 = 12\nY3 = (8 + Y1 - 2.5 * Y2) / 1 = 1\n\nY = |  5  |\n    | 12  |\n    |  1  |\n\nStep 5: Backward substitution (solve UX = Y for X):\n\nX3 = Y3 / 8 = 1 / 8\nX2 = (Y2 - 4 * X3) / (-2) = (12 - 4 * (1/8)) / (-2) = 1\nX1 = (Y1 - 3 * X2 + X3) / 2 = (5 - 3 * 1 + (1/8)) / 2 = 1\n\nX = |  1  |\n    |  1  |\n    | 1/8 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1\ny = 1\nz = 1/8"
