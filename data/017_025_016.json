    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 120: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the possible group structures using the Sylow theorems.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p dividing the order of a group must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo p. For the prime factors of 120, we have:\n\n- For 2: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n- For 3: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 or 10.\n- For 5: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible numbers of Sylow 5-subgroups are 1 or 6.\n\n3. Analyze the possible group structures and count the non-isomorphic groups.\n\n- If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is cyclic, and there is only one such group, which is isomorphic to Z_120.\n- If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the unique Sylow 3-subgroup times the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (Z_8 and D_4), so there are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup. Thus, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n- If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the unique Sylow 2-subgroup times the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. There is only one group of order 3 (Z_3), so there is only 1 non-isomorphic group in this case.\n- If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, then the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 5-subgroup and the unique Sylow 2-subgroup times the unique Sylow 3-subgroup. There is only one group of order 5 (Z_5), so there is only 1 non-isomorphic group in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
