    "message_2": "To find the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's denote the height as 'a', the base as 'b', and the hypotenuse as 'c'.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nGiven the height (a) is 12 cm and the base (b) is 16 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n(12)^2 + (16)^2 = c^2\n144 + 256 = c^2\n400 = c^2\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = âˆš400\nc = 20 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle is 20 cm."
