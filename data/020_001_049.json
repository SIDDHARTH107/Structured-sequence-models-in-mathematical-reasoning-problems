    "message_1": "A factory manufactures two products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 1 hour of assembly time and 2 hours of finishing time, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of finishing time. The factory has 50 hours of available assembly time and 45 hours of available finishing time each day. Product A yields a profit of $10 per unit, and Product B yields a profit of $12 per unit. How many units of each product should the factory produce daily to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for assembly time and finishing time are as follows:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 50 (assembly time constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 45 (finishing time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints for x and y:\n\nFor the assembly time constraint:\nx + 2y ≤ 50\nx = 50 - 2y\n\nFor the finishing time constraint:\n2x + y ≤ 45\ny = 45 - 2x\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the equations equal to each other:\n\n50 - 2y = 45 - 2x\n2x - 2y = -5\nx - y = -2.5\n\nSolving for x:\nx = y - 2.5\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for y:\ny = 45 - 2(y - 2.5)\ny = 45 - 2y + 5\n3y = 50\ny = 50/3 ≈ 16.67\n\nNow, we will find the corresponding x value:\nx = 16.67 - 2.5\nx ≈ 14.17\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, we will consider the integer values around these numbers. We will check (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), and (15, 17) to see which combination maximizes the profit.\n\nFor (14, 16):\nP = 10(14) + 12(16) = 140 + 192 = $332\n\nFor (14, 17):\nP = 10(14) + 12(17) = 140 + 204 = $344\n\nFor (15, 16):\nP = 10(15) + 12(16) = 150 + 192 = $342\n\nFor (15, 17):\nP = 10(15) + 12(17) = 150 + 204 = $354\n\nThe maximum profit of $354 is achieved when the factory produces 15 units of Product A and 17 units of Product B daily."
