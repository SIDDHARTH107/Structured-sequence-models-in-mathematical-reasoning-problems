    "message_1": "A square metal plate of side length 10 cm is heated uniformly to 100°C. The plate is then allowed to cool in an environment at 25°C. \n\nUsing Fourier transform techniques, find the temperature distribution in the plate at time t = 0.1 seconds. Assume that the thermal diffusivity of the metal plate is 0.5 cm^2/s. Given that the initial temperature of the plate was 100°C, what is the temperature at the center of the plate after cooling for 0.1 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the 2D heat equation with Fourier transform techniques. The 2D heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α (∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution in the plate, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and y are the spatial coordinates.\n\nThe initial condition is T(x, y, 0) = 100°C for 0 < x < 10 cm and 0 < y < 10 cm. The boundary conditions are T(0, y, t) = T(10, y, t) = T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 10, t) = 25°C for t > 0.\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve the heat equation. Let T(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation and dividing by XT, we get:\n\n(1/T)(dT/dt) = α [(1/X)(d²X/dx²) + (1/Y)(d²Y/dy²)]\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1/T)(dT/dt) = -αλ²\n(1/X)(d²X/dx²) + (1/Y)(d²Y/dy²) = -λ²\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n\nT(t) = e^(-αλ²t)\nX(x) = A cos(λx) + B sin(λx)\nY(y) = C cos(λy) + D sin(λy)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = A = 25\nX(10) = 25 cos(λ10) + B sin(λ10) = 25\nY(0) = C = 25\nY(10) = 25 cos(λ10) + D sin(λ10) = 25\n\nFrom the boundary conditions, we can determine that B = D = 0. Thus, the temperature distribution is given by:\n\nT(x, y, t) = 25 + 75 e^(-αλ²t) cos(λx) cos(λy)\n\nTo find the temperature at the center of the plate (x = 5, y = 5) after cooling for 0.1 seconds, we can plug in the values:\n\nT(5, 5, 0.1) = 25 + 75 e^(-0.5 * λ² * 0.1) cos(λ * 5) cos(λ * 5)\n\nTo find the value of λ, we can use the fact that the plate has a side length of 10 cm, so the fundamental frequency is given by:\n\nλ = (n * π) / 10\n\nwhere n is an integer. For the fundamental mode (n = 1), λ = π / 10. Substituting this value into the temperature equation, we get:\n\nT(5, 5, 0.1) = 25 + 75 e^(-0.5 * (π/10)² * 0.1) cos(π/2) cos(π/2)\n\nT(5, 5, 0.1) ≈ 25 + 75 e^(-0.0493) ≈ 25 + 75 * 0.951 ≈ 25 + 71.3 ≈ 96.3°C\n\nSo, the temperature at the center of the plate after cooling for 0.1 seconds is approximately 96.3°C."
