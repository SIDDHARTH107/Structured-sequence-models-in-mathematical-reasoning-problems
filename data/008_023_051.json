    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with noisy data, we will first solve the system without considering the noise (standard deviation) and then discuss the impact of the noise on the solution.\n\n1. Solve the system without considering the noise:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 5.5\n2x - y + z = 2.8\nx + 3y + z = 7.1\n\nWe can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n2*(x + 2y - 3z) - (2x - y + z) = 2*5.5 - 2.8\n4y - 5z = 8.2\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n\n(x + 3y + z) - (x + 2y - 3z) = 7.1 - 5.5\ny + 4z = 1.6\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n4y - 5z = 8.2\ny + 4z = 1.6\n\nMultiply the second equation by 4 and add it to the first equation:\n\n4*(y + 4z) + (4y - 5z) = 4*1.6 + 8.2\n20y = 14.6\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = 14.6 / 20\ny = 0.73\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the second equation to find z:\n\n0.73 + 4z = 1.6\n4z = 0.87\nz = 0.2175\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find x:\n\nx + 2*0.73 - 3*0.2175 = 5.5\nx = 5.5 - 1.46 + 0.6525\nx = 4.6925\n\nSo, the solution without considering the noise is:\nx = 4.6925, y = 0.73, z = 0.2175\n\n2. Impact of noise on the solution:\n\nThe given system of equations has noisy data, which means that the measurements have some uncertainty. The standard deviations represent the uncertainty in the measurements. To account for this uncertainty, we can consider the range of possible values for each equation:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 5.5 ± 0.2\n2x - y + z = 2.8 ± 0.1\nx + 3y + z = 7.1 ± 0.3\n\nThis means that the true values of the coefficients could be within the range of the given values plus or minus the standard deviation. The presence of noise in the data will affect the accuracy of the solution, and the true solution could be within a range around the calculated values (x = 4.6925, y = 0.73, z = 0.2175).\n\nTo find the exact impact of the noise on the solution, one would need to perform a more advanced analysis, such as a Monte Carlo simulation or a sensitivity analysis. This would involve solving the system multiple times with different values within the range of uncertainty and analyzing the distribution of the results."
