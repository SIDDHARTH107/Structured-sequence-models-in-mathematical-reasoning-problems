    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform Y(f) of the given signal y(t), we can use the following formula:\n\nY(f) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nHowever, since the given signal y(t) consists of sinusoidal functions, we can directly use the properties of the Fourier transform for these functions. The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF{cos(2πft)} = (1/2)[δ(f - f0) + δ(f + f0)],\n\nand the Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF{sin(2πft)} = (-j/2)[δ(f - f0) - δ(f + f0)],\n\nwhere δ(f) is the Dirac delta function, and f0 is the frequency of the sinusoidal function.\n\nNow, let's apply these properties to the given signal y(t):\n\nY(f) = F{2cos(50πt) + 3sin(100πt) + cos(200πt)}\n\nY(f) = 2F{cos(50πt)} + 3F{sin(100πt)} + F{cos(200πt)}\n\nUsing the properties mentioned above, we get:\n\nY(f) = 2[(1/2)(δ(f - 25) + δ(f + 25))] - 3j[(1/2)(δ(f - 50) - δ(f + 50))] + [(1/2)(δ(f - 100) + δ(f + 100))]\n\nY(f) = δ(f - 25) + δ(f + 25) - 3j[δ(f - 50) - δ(f + 50)] + δ(f - 100) + δ(f + 100)\n\nThe frequency components present in the signal can be determined by the Dirac delta functions in Y(f):\n\n1. f = ±25 Hz (from the first cosine term)\n2. f = ±50 Hz (from the sine term)\n3. f = ±100 Hz (from the second cosine term)\n\nSo, the frequency components present in the signal are 25 Hz, 50 Hz, and 100 Hz, along with their negative counterparts."
