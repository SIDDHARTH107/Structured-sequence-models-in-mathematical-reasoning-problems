    "message_2": "We will use the power iteration method to find the eigenvector and eigenvalue of the matrix A corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm that can be used to find the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of a matrix. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Choose an initial guess for the eigenvector, x0.\n2. Compute the matrix-vector product Ax.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's follow the algorithm using the given matrix A and initial guess x0:\n\nMatrix A = [3 1; 1 3]\nInitial guess x0 = [1; 1]\n\nStep 1: Compute Ax0\nAx0 = [3 1; 1 3] * [1; 1] = [4; 4]\n\nStep 2: Normalize Ax0\n||Ax0|| = sqrt(4^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(32)\nx1 = Ax0 / ||Ax0|| = [4/sqrt(32); 4/sqrt(32)] = [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nNow we will iterate until the eigenvalue estimate converges to within 0.01:\n\nStep 3: Compute Ax1\nAx1 = [3 1; 1 3] * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)] = [2*sqrt(2); 2*sqrt(2)]\n\nStep 4: Normalize Ax1\n||Ax1|| = sqrt((2*sqrt(2))^2 + (2*sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(16) = 4\nx2 = Ax1 / ||Ax1|| = [2*sqrt(2)/4; 2*sqrt(2)/4] = [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nSince x2 is the same as x1, we have reached convergence. Now, we can find the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector x2:\n\nEigenvalue 位 = (x2' * A * x2) / (x2' * x2)\n\n位 = ([1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2)] * [3 1; 1 3] * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)]) / ([1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2)] * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)])\n\n位 = (4) / (1) = 4\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is x2 = [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)], and the largest eigenvalue is 位 = 4."
