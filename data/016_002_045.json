    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by iteratively replacing each line segment with a smaller equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4/3, and the length of each segment decreases by a factor of 1/3.\n\nAfter four iterations, the number of segments is (4/3)^4 times the original number of segments, and the length of each segment is (1/3)^4 times the original length.\n\nThe original equilateral triangle has 3 sides, so the number of segments after four iterations is:\n\n(4/3)^4 * 3 = 256\n\nThe length of each segment after four iterations is:\n\n(1/3)^4 * 3 cm = 1/81 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations is the product of the number of segments and the length of each segment:\n\n256 * (1/81) cm = 256/81 cm â‰ˆ 3.1605 cm"
