    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between height and weight, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere x represents height, y represents weight, x̄ is the mean height, and ȳ is the mean weight.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean height (x̄) and mean weight (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (65 + 68 + 72 + 64 + 69 + 67 + 70 + 66 + 68 + 71 + 63 + 65 + 72 + 67 + 69 + 65 + 70 + 64 + 68 + 71 + 66 + 69 + 73 + 66 + 68) / 25 = 1690 / 25 = 67.6 inches\n\nȳ = (120 + 140 + 160 + 110 + 155 + 125 + 150 + 130 + 135 + 155 + 115 + 120 + 170 + 135 + 155 + 125 + 160 + 115 + 130 + 165 + 135 + 150 + 180 + 120 + 140) / 25 = 3475 / 25 = 139 pounds\n\nNow, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator: Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)]\nDenominator: √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nFor each student, we will calculate (x - x̄), (y - ȳ), (x - x̄)(y - ȳ), (x - x̄)², and (y - ȳ)². Then, we will sum up the results for each column.\n\nAfter calculating these values, we get:\n\nNumerator: 1160.4\nDenominator: 1273.84\n\nNow, we can find the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = 1160.4 / 1273.84 = 0.9109 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nThe correlation coefficient between height and weight of the 25 students is approximately 0.9109."
