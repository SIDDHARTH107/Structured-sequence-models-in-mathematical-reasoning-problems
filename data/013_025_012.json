    "message_1": "In a game of Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers are offered to declare a number between 0 and 100. If both declare the same number, they each receive that amount of money. However, if one declares a number smaller than the other's, the smaller number is multiplied by 2, and both travelers receive that amount of money.\n\nA math student must determine the optimal number to declare to maximize the amount of money they will receive assuming their opponent also uses an optimal strategy. What number should they declare?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, the optimal strategy is for both players to declare the smallest possible number, which in this case is 0. This is because if a player chooses any number higher than 0, the other player can choose a number just one less than that, causing the smaller number to be doubled and both players to receive less money than if they had both chosen the same number.\n\nFor example, if one player chooses 100, the other player can choose 99, resulting in both players receiving 2 * 99 = 198, which is less than the 200 they would have received if both had chosen 100. This logic applies to any number chosen, so the optimal strategy is for both players to choose 0, ensuring they both receive the highest possible amount of money."
