    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3sin(x), we will use the chain rule. The derivative of sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x). So, the derivative of 3sin(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 3cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = 3cos(π/4)\n\nRecall that cos(π/4) = √2/2. Therefore,\n\nf'(π/4) = 3(√2/2) = (3√2)/2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3sin(x) at the point x = π/4 is (3√2)/2."
