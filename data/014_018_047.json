    "message_2": "To find the key for a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, we need to determine the shift value for each letter. Let's analyze the given substitutions:\n\n1. G -> D: The shift value is -3 (G is the 7th letter, and D is the 4th letter in the alphabet).\n2. X -> Y: The shift value is +1 (X is the 24th letter, and Y is the 25th letter in the alphabet).\n3. Q -> A: The shift value is -16 (Q is the 17th letter, and A is the 1st letter in the alphabet).\n\nSince the cipher is monoalphabetic, the shift value should be the same for all letters. However, the given substitutions have different shift values, which indicates that the provided substitutions are not consistent with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to determine the key for a monoalphabetic substitution cipher based on the given information."
