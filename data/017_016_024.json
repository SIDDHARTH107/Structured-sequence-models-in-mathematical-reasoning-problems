Show that either [G,G] is a normal subgroup of G and G/[G,G] is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or [G,G] = G and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.",
    "message_2": "First, note that the commutator subgroup [G,G] is always a normal subgroup of G. This is because, for any x, y, z in G, we have:\n\nz[x,y]z^(-1) = z(xy^(-1)x^(-1)y)z^(-1) = (zxz^(-1))(zyz^(-1))(zxz^(-1))^(-1)(zyz^(-1))^(-1) = [zx,zy],\n\nwhich shows that the commutator subgroup is invariant under conjugation.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. Since the order of G is 27, which is a power of a prime (3^3), G is a p-group. By the Fundamental Theorem of p-groups, G has a non-trivial center Z(G) (i.e., Z(G) ≠ {e}). The order of Z(G) must divide the order of G, so |Z(G)| can be 1, 3, 9, or 27. Since Z(G) ≠ {e}, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 3 or 9.\n\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 9 or 3, both of which are powers of a prime. Thus, G/Z(G) is cyclic, say G/Z(G) ≅ C_k, where k = 3 or 9. Now, consider the quotient group G/[G,G]. We have the following series of inclusions:\n\n{e} ⊆ [G,G] ⊆ Z(G) ⊆ G.\n\nSince [G,G] ⊆ Z(G), it follows that G/[G,G] is isomorphic to a quotient of G/Z(G). In particular, G/[G,G] is cyclic, say G/[G,G] ≅ C_n, where n divides k. Thus, in this case, G/[G,G] is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, as desired.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 27.\n\nIn this case, G is abelian, and so [G,G] = {e}. Thus, G/[G,G] ≅ G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that either G/[G,G] is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, or [G,G] = G and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
