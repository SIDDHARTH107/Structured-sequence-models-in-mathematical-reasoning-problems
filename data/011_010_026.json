    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to arrange a sequence of 8 pairs of properly matched and nested parentheses, we can use the Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nIn this case, we want to find the 8th Catalan number, so we have:\n\nC(8) = (1/(8+1)) * (2*8! / (8! * 8!))\n\nC(8) = (1/9) * (16! / (8! * 8!))\n\nC(8) = (1/9) * (20922789888000 / (40320 * 40320))\n\nC(8) = (1/9) * 12870\n\nC(8) = 1430\n\nSo there are 1430 ways to arrange a sequence of 8 pairs of properly matched and nested parentheses."
