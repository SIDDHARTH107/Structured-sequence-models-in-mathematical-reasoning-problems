    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius (r) is 10 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 10²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 100\n\nArea of sector = 100π/6\n\nArea of sector = 50π/3\n\nThe area of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees is approximately 50π/3 square centimeters or approximately 52.36 square centimeters."
