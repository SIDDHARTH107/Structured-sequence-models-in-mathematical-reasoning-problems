    "message_2": "A 2-dimensional simplex is a triangle formed by three points in the simplicial complex. In this case, we have 4 points: A, B, C, and D. We can form triangles by choosing any 3 of these 4 points.\n\nThere are 4 choose 3 ways to do this, which can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4! / (3!1!) = (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(1)) = 4\n\nSo there are 4 different 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) in this complex:\n\n1. Triangle ABC\n2. Triangle ABD\n3. Triangle ACD\n4. Triangle BCD"
