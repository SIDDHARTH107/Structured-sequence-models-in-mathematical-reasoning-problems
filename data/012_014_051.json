Provide a detailed explanation and/or a visual representation to support your answer.",
    "message_2": "Yes, these two graphs are isomorphic. \n\nTo show that two graphs are isomorphic, we need to find a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between their vertices such that the adjacency relationship is preserved. In other words, we need to find a way to relabel the vertices of one graph so that it becomes identical to the other graph.\n\nHere's one possible bijection between the vertices of the two graphs:\n\nA -> 1\nB -> 2\nC -> 3\nD -> 4\n\nNow let's check if the adjacency relationship is preserved:\n\n- In Graph 1, A is adjacent to B and D. In Graph 2, 1 is adjacent to 2 and 4. So the adjacency is preserved for A and 1.\n- In Graph 1, B is adjacent to A and C. In Graph 2, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. So the adjacency is preserved for B and 2.\n- In Graph 1, C is adjacent to B and D. In Graph 2, 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. So the adjacency is preserved for C and 3.\n- In Graph 1, D is adjacent to A and C. In Graph 2, 4 is adjacent to 1 and 3. So the adjacency is preserved for D and 4.\n\nSince we found a bijection between the vertices that preserves the adjacency relationship, the two graphs are isomorphic.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the two graphs:\n\nGraph 1:       Graph 2:\n\n  A---B          1---2\n  |   |          |   |\n  D---C          4---3\n\nAs you can see, the structure of the two graphs is identical, further confirming their isomorphism."
