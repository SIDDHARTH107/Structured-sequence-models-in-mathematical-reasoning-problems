    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The production process requires two resources, X and Y. The company has 180 units of resource X and 225 units of resource Y available for production each day. The profit earned per unit of each product is $10 for A, $12 for B, and $15 for C. Using grey wolf optimizer, what is the maximum profit that the company can earn in a day if the production capacities of products A, B, and C are 50, 75, and 60 units respectively?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), we need to first define the objective function and constraints. The objective function is the profit function, which we want to maximize:\n\nProfit = 10A + 12B + 15C\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. A <= 50 (production capacity of product A)\n2. B <= 75 (production capacity of product B)\n3. C <= 60 (production capacity of product C)\n4. XA + XB + XC <= 180 (resource X constraint)\n5. YA + YB + YC <= 225 (resource Y constraint)\n\nWe also need to define the resource consumption rates for each product:\n\nXA = resource X consumption rate for product A\nXB = resource X consumption rate for product B\nXC = resource X consumption rate for product C\nYA = resource Y consumption rate for product A\nYB = resource Y consumption rate for product B\nYC = resource Y consumption rate for product C\n\nSince the problem does not provide the resource consumption rates, we cannot proceed with the Grey Wolf Optimizer. However, if you provide the resource consumption rates, we can apply the GWO algorithm to find the optimal production quantities for products A, B, and C to maximize the profit."
