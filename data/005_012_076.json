    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (µ) is 1200 hours, the population standard deviation (σ) is 100 hours, and the sample size (n) is 50.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means (σ_sample):\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n\nσ_sample = 100 / √50\nσ_sample ≈ 14.14 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the range (1185 and 1215 hours):\n\nz_lower = (1185 - µ) / σ_sample\nz_lower = (1185 - 1200) / 14.14\nz_lower ≈ -1.06\n\nz_upper = (1215 - µ) / σ_sample\nz_upper = (1215 - 1200) / 14.14\nz_upper ≈ 1.06\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The probability for z_lower is 0.1446, and the probability for z_upper is 0.8554.\n\nTo find the probability that the average life of the light bulbs will be between 1185 and 1215 hours, we subtract the probability of z_lower from the probability of z_upper:\n\nP(1185 < x < 1215) = P(z_upper) - P(z_lower)\nP(1185 < x < 1215) = 0.8554 - 0.1446\nP(1185 < x < 1215) ≈ 0.7108\n\nSo, the probability that the average life of the 50 light bulbs will be between 1185 and 1215 hours is approximately 71.08%."
