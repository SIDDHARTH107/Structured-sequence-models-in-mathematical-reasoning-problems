    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x + 3) * 2 = (x - 4) * 5\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides:\n\n4x + 6 = 5x - 20\n\nNext, move all the x terms to one side and the constants to the other side:\n\n4x - 5x = -20 - 6\n\n-1x = -26\n\nNow, divide by -1 to isolate x:\n\nx = 26"
