    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 centimeters and a slant height of 10 centimeters. What is the surface area of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven, radius (r) = 5 cm and slant height (l) = 10 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 75π square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 75π square centimeters."
