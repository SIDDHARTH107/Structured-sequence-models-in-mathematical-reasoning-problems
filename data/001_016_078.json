    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $2^5 \\times 2^7$, we can use the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base: $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$. In this case, the base is 2, and the exponents are 5 and 7. \n\nSo, we have:\n\n$2^5 \\times 2^7 = 2^{5+7} = 2^{12}$\n\nThe simplified exponential expression is $2^{12}$."
