    "message_1": "Suppose Alex and Bob are dividing a sum of $100. Alex suggests that he will take $60 and leave Bob with $40. If Bob rejects the proposal, then neither of them gets any money. If Bob accepts the proposal, then they get to keep the suggested amounts. What strategy would you employ if you were Bob?",
    "message_2": "If I were Bob, I would consider the following factors before making a decision:\n\n1. Opportunity cost: If Bob rejects the proposal, both he and Alex will end up with nothing. In this case, Bob loses the opportunity to get $40. If he accepts the proposal, he will have $40, which is better than nothing.\n\n2. Fairness: Ideally, the division should be equal, with both Alex and Bob getting $50 each. However, Alex's proposal is not fair, as he gets $60 and Bob gets only $40.\n\n3. Negotiation: Before making a decision, Bob could try to negotiate with Alex for a more equitable division of the money. For example, he could propose a 50-50 split or another division that is more favorable to him.\n\n4. Relationship: If Alex and Bob have a good relationship, Bob might consider accepting the proposal to maintain harmony. However, if their relationship is not strong, Bob might be more inclined to reject the proposal or negotiate for a better deal.\n\nTaking these factors into account, my strategy as Bob would be to first attempt to negotiate with Alex for a more equitable division of the money. If Alex is unwilling to compromise, I would weigh the importance of the relationship and the opportunity cost of rejecting the proposal. If the relationship is not a significant factor, and I am willing to risk losing the $40, I might reject the proposal to signal that I am not willing to accept an unfair deal. However, if the relationship is important or I am not willing to risk losing the $40, I might accept the proposal despite its unfairness."
