    "message_2": "The minimum number of singular points of a plane cubic curve that can be transformed by a birational map into a non-singular curve is 1. This is because a cubic curve with a single singular point can be transformed into an elliptic curve, which is a non-singular curve, through a process called \"blowing up\" the singular point."
