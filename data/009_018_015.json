    "message_2": "This is a logistic differential equation, which models population growth with a carrying capacity. The general form of the logistic equation is:\n\ny' = ky(1 - y/M)\n\nwhere k is the growth rate constant, y is the population, and M is the carrying capacity (the maximum population that can be sustained over time).\n\nIn the given differential equation, y' = y(1 - y/5), we can identify the parameters:\n\nk = 1 (since there's no other constant multiplying y)\nM = 5 (since the carrying capacity is the value of y that makes the expression inside the parentheses equal to zero)\n\nSo, according to this model, the maximum population that can be sustained over time is 5."
