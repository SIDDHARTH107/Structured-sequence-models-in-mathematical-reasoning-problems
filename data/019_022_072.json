The project has an initial cost of $10,000 and there is a 50% chance that it will generate a profit of $20,000 and a 50% chance that it will generate a profit of only $5,000. Using decision theory, what is the expected value of the investment?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the investment, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding profit and then sum these values. \n\nExpected value = (Probability of outcome 1 * Profit of outcome 1) + (Probability of outcome 2 * Profit of outcome 2)\n\nIn this case, the probabilities are 50% (0.5) for both outcomes. The profit for outcome 1 is $20,000, and the profit for outcome 2 is $5,000. \n\nExpected value = (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $5,000)\nExpected value = ($10,000) + ($2,500)\nExpected value = $12,500\n\nNow, we need to subtract the initial cost of the investment ($10,000) to find the net expected value.\n\nNet expected value = Expected value - Initial cost\nNet expected value = $12,500 - $10,000\nNet expected value = $2,500\n\nThe expected value of the investment is $2,500."
