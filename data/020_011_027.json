    "message_1": "A company is trying to optimize the production of two products, A and B. The production process for each product requires time and resources, and the profits generated by each product are different. The company wants to maximize the total profit subject to the constraints on time and resources. Find the optimal production quantities for A and B.\n\nProduct A requires 10 hours of production time and 3 units of resources, and generates a profit of $50 per unit.\nProduct B requires 6 hours of production time and 4 units of resources, and generates a profit of $60 per unit.\n\nThe company has 120 hours of production time available per week, and 30 units of resources available.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal Profit = 50x + 60y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n10x + 6y ≤ 120 (production time constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 30 (resource constraint)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1) Production time constraint:\n10x + 6y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 10x) / 6\n\n2) Resource constraint:\n3x + 4y ≤ 30\ny ≤ (30 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the boundary lines:\n\n1) Intersection of production time constraint and resource constraint:\n10x + 6y = 120\n3x + 4y = 30\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 6, y = 5\n\n2) Intersection of production time constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n10x + 6(0) = 120\nx = 12\n\n3) Intersection of resource constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n3(0) + 4y = 30\ny = 7.5\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function (Total Profit) at each corner point:\n\n1) (x = 6, y = 5):\nTotal Profit = 50(6) + 60(5) = 300 + 300 = $600\n\n2) (x = 12, y = 0):\nTotal Profit = 50(12) + 60(0) = 600 + 0 = $600\n\n3) (x = 0, y = 7.5):\nTotal Profit = 50(0) + 60(7.5) = 0 + 450 = $450\n\nThe maximum total profit is $600, which occurs at two corner points: (x = 6, y = 5) and (x = 12, y = 0). This means that the company can either produce 6 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B or produce 12 units of Product A and no units of Product B to achieve the maximum total profit of $600."
