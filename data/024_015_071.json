    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of the given differential form $\\omega = 2xydx - x^2dy$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the coefficients of $dx$ and $dy$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, and then apply the definition of the exterior derivative.\n\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form $\\omega = f(x, y)dx + g(x, y)dy$ is given by:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)dx \\wedge dy$\n\nIn our case, $f(x, y) = 2xy$ and $g(x, y) = -x^2$. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (2xy)}{\\partial x} = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (2xy)}{\\partial y} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (-x^2)}{\\partial x} = -2x$\n\nNow, we can plug these partial derivatives into the formula for the exterior derivative:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)dx \\wedge dy = (-2x - 2x)dx \\wedge dy = -4x dx \\wedge dy$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is $d\\omega = -4x dx \\wedge dy$."
