    "message_2": "To find the value of x in radians, we need to use the inverse sine function (also known as arcsin or sin^(-1)).\n\nx = arcsin(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 0.6435 radians\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the sine function is periodic, meaning it repeats its values in a regular pattern. The period of the sine function is 2π, so there is another solution for x in the range of 0 to 2π:\n\nx = π - 0.6435 ≈ 2.4981 radians\n\nSo, the two values of x in the range of 0 to 2π are approximately 0.6435 radians and 2.4981 radians."
