    "message_1": "Suppose you have ten identical apples and you want to divide them between two friends, Alex and Ben, so that each of them gets at least one apple. How many ways can you distribute the apples?",
    "message_2": "Since each friend must get at least one apple, we can give one apple to Alex and one apple to Ben. Now, we have 8 apples left to distribute between them. We can think of this problem as placing a divider between the remaining apples to split them between Alex and Ben.\n\nFor example, if we have 8 apples represented by the letter \"A\":\n\nAAAA|AAAA\n\nThis means Alex gets 4 more apples (5 in total) and Ben gets 4 more apples (5 in total).\n\nWe can place the divider in 7 different positions between the 8 apples, which will result in different distributions:\n\n1. AAAAAAA|A (7 apples for Alex, 3 for Ben)\n2. AAAAAA|AA (6 apples for Alex, 4 for Ben)\n3. AAAAA|AAA (5 apples for Alex, 5 for Ben)\n4. AAAA|AAAA (4 apples for Alex, 6 for Ben)\n5. AAA|AAAAA (3 apples for Alex, 7 for Ben)\n6. AA|AAAAAA (2 apples for Alex, 8 for Ben)\n7. A|AAAAAAA (1 apple for Alex, 9 for Ben)\n\nSo, there are 7 ways to distribute the remaining 8 apples between Alex and Ben."
