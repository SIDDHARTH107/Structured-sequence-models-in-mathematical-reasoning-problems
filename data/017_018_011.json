    "message_2": "Let's use the Cauchy's theorem which states that if G is a finite group and p is a prime number dividing the order of G (|G|), then G has an element of order p.\n\nSince G has order 32, which is 2^5, it must have a subgroup of order 8 (by Cauchy's theorem). Let H be a subgroup of G with order 8. H must be a p-group, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 2).\n\nNow, let's use the Sylow's theorem which states that the number of Sylow p-subgroups in a group G is congruent to 1 mod p and divides the order of G. In our case, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) in H is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides 8 (the order of H). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 4. Since there are 4 elements of order 8 in G, there must be 4 Sylow 2-subgroups in H, so n_2 = 4.\n\nEach Sylow 2-subgroup has order 4, and since there are 4 of them, there are a total of 4 * 4 = 16 elements of order 4 in H. Now, let's consider the elements of order 2 in G.\n\nThe identity element of G has order 1, and there are 4 elements of order 8 and 16 elements of order 4. So, there are 32 - 1 - 4 - 16 = 11 elements left in G. These 11 elements must have order 2, as they cannot have order 1, 4, or 8.\n\nTherefore, G has 11 elements of order 2."
