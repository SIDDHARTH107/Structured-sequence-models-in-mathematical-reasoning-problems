    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem on Adverse Selection for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose there are two types of used cars in a market - good quality and bad quality. The proportion of good quality cars in the market is 0.6, while the proportion of bad quality cars is 0.4. A buyer is willing to pay $8000 for a good quality car and $4000 for a bad quality car. A seller knows the quality of their car, but the buyer cannot tell just by looking at it. The seller knows that 80% of the good quality cars will be sold in the market, while only 20% of the bad quality cars will be sold.\n\n(a) What is the average price that the buyer will pay for a used car in the market?\n(b) What is the expected profit for a seller who has a good quality car?\n(c) What is the expected profit for a seller who has a bad quality car?\n(d) If the seller of a car has to pay a commission of 10% of the selling price to a middleman, will it be profitable for them to sell a good quality car?",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the average price that the buyer will pay for a used car in the market, we need to consider the proportion of good and bad quality cars and the probability of each being sold.\n\nThe probability of a good quality car being sold is 0.6 (proportion of good quality cars) * 0.8 (80% chance of being sold) = 0.48.\nThe probability of a bad quality car being sold is 0.4 (proportion of bad quality cars) * 0.2 (20% chance of being sold) = 0.08.\n\nNow we can calculate the average price:\n\nAverage price = (0.48 * $8000) + (0.08 * $4000) = $3840 + $320 = $4160.\n\n(b) The expected profit for a seller who has a good quality car is the selling price of a good quality car, which is $8000.\n\n(c) The expected profit for a seller who has a bad quality car is the selling price of a bad quality car, which is $4000.\n\n(d) If the seller has to pay a commission of 10% of the selling price to a middleman, the net amount they receive after paying the commission for a good quality car is:\n\nNet amount = $8000 - (0.1 * $8000) = $8000 - $800 = $7200.\n\nSince the seller still receives $7200 after paying the commission, which is more than the expected profit for a bad quality car ($4000), it is profitable for them to sell a good quality car."
