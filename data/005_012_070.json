Based on this sample, they found an average age of 35 years with a standard deviation of 5 years. Find the 95% confidence interval for the true average age of all employees in the company.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true average age of all employees in the company, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (average age)\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation of the sample\nn = sample size\n\nIn this case, we have:\nx̄ = 35 years\nσ = 5 years\nn = 50 employees\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 35 ± 1.96 * (5 / √50)\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard error = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error (Z * standard error):\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = 35 ± 1.3859\nCI = (35 - 1.3859, 35 + 1.3859)\nCI ≈ (33.6141, 36.3859)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average age of all employees in the company is approximately (33.6141, 36.3859) years."
