    "message_2": "Since $H^1(X)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this means that $H^1(X)$ has only one non-trivial element (besides the identity element). Recall that the first cohomology group $H^1(X)$ is related to the number of connected components of the topological space $X$.\n\nIn particular, the rank of $H^0(X)$, which is the zeroth cohomology group, corresponds to the number of connected components of $X$. The zeroth cohomology group $H^0(X)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $n$ is the number of connected components of $X$.\n\nNow, we use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, which states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n$0 \\to \\text{Ext}^1(H_{k-1}(X), G) \\to H^k(X, G) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_k(X), G) \\to 0$\n\nHere, $G$ is a coefficient group, and in our case, we have $G = \\mathbb{Z}$. We are interested in the case when $k=1$. So, we have:\n\n$0 \\to \\text{Ext}^1(H_0(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_1(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$\n\nSince $H^1(X)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, we know that $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ has only one non-trivial element. Moreover, we know that $\\text{Hom}(H_1(X), \\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group, and thus, it has no non-trivial torsion elements. This implies that the non-trivial element in $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ must come from $\\text{Ext}^1(H_0(X), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nNow, we use the fact that $\\text{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Z}^n, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2^{n-1}$, which means that $\\text{Ext}^1(H_0(X), \\mathbb{Z})$ has $2^{n-1}$ non-trivial elements. Since we have only one non-trivial element in $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we must have:\n\n$2^{n-1} = 1$\n\nSolving for $n$, we get $n-1 = 0$, which implies that $n = 1$. Therefore, the topological space $X$ has only one connected component."
