    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface $S$ at the point $(1, -1, 1)$, we first need to find the gradient of the function that defines the surface. The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives with respect to each variable.\n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy - 4z$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x + 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y + 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 2z - 4$\n\nNow, we evaluate the gradient at the point $(1, -1, 1)$:\n\n$\\nabla F(1, -1, 1) = (2(1) + 2(-1), 2(-1) + 2(1), 2(1) - 4) = (0, 0, -2)$\n\nThe tangent plane to the surface $S$ at the point $(1, -1, 1)$ has the equation:\n\n$0(x - 1) + 0(y + 1) - 2(z - 1) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the tangent plane as:\n\n$z = 1$"
