    "message_2": "To triangulate a square, we need to divide it into non-overlapping triangles such that all the vertices of the triangles are also vertices of the square. The minimum number of line segments required to triangulate the square is 2. We can draw a diagonal from (0,1) to (1,0) or from (0,0) to (1,1) to divide the square into two triangles."
