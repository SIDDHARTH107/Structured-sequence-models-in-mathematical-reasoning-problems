    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the mass after 2 seconds, we can use the equation for the displacement of a mass-spring system without damping:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency ω. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (10 N/m) and m is the mass (0.5 kg).\n\nω = sqrt(10/0.5) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.47 rad/s\n\nSince the mass is initially displaced by 0.1 m and then released, the amplitude A is 0.1 m, and the phase angle φ is 0 (because the mass starts at its maximum displacement).\n\nNow we can find the displacement after 2 seconds:\n\nx(2) = 0.1 * cos(4.47 * 2 + 0) ≈ 0.1 * cos(8.94) ≈ -0.062 m\n\nSo the displacement of the mass after 2 seconds is approximately -0.062 m, which means it is 0.062 m to the left of the equilibrium position."
