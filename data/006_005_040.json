    "message_1": "A student is trying to catch a bus that arrives every 20 minutes between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM. If the student arrives at the bus stop at a random time between 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM, what is the probability that the student will catch the next bus that arrives?",
    "message_2": "The bus arrives at 9:00 AM, 9:20 AM, and 9:40 AM within the given time frame. The student arrives at the bus stop at a random time between 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM, which is a 30-minute window.\n\nIf the student arrives between 9:00 AM and 9:20 AM, they will catch the 9:20 AM bus. If they arrive between 9:20 AM and 9:30 AM, they will catch the 9:40 AM bus. Therefore, the student will catch the next bus if they arrive within the first 20 minutes of the 30-minute window.\n\nTo find the probability, divide the favorable outcome (20 minutes) by the total possible outcomes (30 minutes):\n\nProbability = (favorable outcome) / (total possible outcomes) = 20 minutes / 30 minutes = 2/3\n\nSo the probability that the student will catch the next bus that arrives is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%."
