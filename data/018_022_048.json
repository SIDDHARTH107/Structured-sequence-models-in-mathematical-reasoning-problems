    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. Using your result, prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B. This is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A Δ B and B Δ A, denoted as (A Δ B) x (B Δ A).\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1, 4), (4, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B Δ A and A Δ B, denoted as (B Δ A) x (A Δ B).\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(4, 1), (1, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) x (A Δ B). This means that the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to Cartesian product. The initial statement to prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product is incorrect."
