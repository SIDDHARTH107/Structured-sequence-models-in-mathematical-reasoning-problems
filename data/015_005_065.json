    "message_2": "To find the distance between two consecutive peaks of the chaotic attractor of the Rössler system, we need to numerically solve the given system of differential equations and analyze the resulting trajectory. This can be done using numerical methods like the Runge-Kutta method or other similar techniques. Here, we will provide a brief outline of the steps to follow:\n\n1. Define the Rössler system with the given parameters a=0.1, b=0.1, and c=14:\n\n   x' = -(y + z)\n   y' = x + 0.1y\n   z' = 0.1 + xz - 14z\n\n2. Choose an initial condition (x0, y0, z0) and a time step Δt for the numerical integration.\n\n3. Use a numerical method (e.g., Runge-Kutta) to solve the system of differential equations and obtain the trajectory (x(t), y(t), z(t)).\n\n4. Analyze the trajectory to find the consecutive peaks of the chaotic attractor. This can be done by identifying local maxima in the z(t) component of the trajectory.\n\n5. Calculate the distance between the consecutive peaks using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\n   distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)\n\nwhere (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) are the coordinates of the consecutive peaks.\n\nIt's important to note that the distance between consecutive peaks may not be constant due to the chaotic nature of the attractor. Therefore, it might be useful to calculate the distance for several pairs of consecutive peaks and analyze the distribution of these distances.\n\nSince this problem requires numerical methods and analysis, it is best solved using a programming language or software like Python, MATLAB, or Mathematica."
