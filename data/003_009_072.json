    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the length of the other two sides. We are given the base (10 cm) and one angle (60 degrees). Since it's a right-angled triangle, the other angle is 30 degrees (90 - 60 = 30).\n\nWe can use the sine and cosine functions to find the length of the other two sides. Let's denote the hypotenuse as \"c\" and the side opposite to the 60-degree angle as \"a\".\n\nsin(60) = a/c\ncos(60) = 10/c\n\nWe can solve for \"c\" using the cosine function:\n\ncos(60) = 0.5 (since cos(60) = 1/2)\n0.5 = 10/c\nc = 10/0.5\nc = 20 cm\n\nNow, we can solve for \"a\" using the sine function:\n\nsin(60) = sqrt(3)/2 (since sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2)\nsqrt(3)/2 = a/20\na = 20 * sqrt(3)/2\na = 10 * sqrt(3) cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + base + c\nPerimeter = 10 * sqrt(3) + 10 + 20\nPerimeter = 10 * (sqrt(3) + 1) + 20\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 10 * (sqrt(3) + 1) + 20 cm."
