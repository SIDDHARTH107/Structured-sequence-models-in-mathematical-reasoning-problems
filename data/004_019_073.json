    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the skateboarder, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the velocity function $v(t)$.\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t^2 - 2t + 1)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 8t - 2$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t = 3$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(3) = 8(3) - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22$\n\nSo, the velocity of the skateboarder at $t = 3$ seconds is $22$ meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the skateboarder. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(4t^2 - 2t + 1)$\n\nFirst, we already found the first derivative, which is the velocity function:\n\n$v(t) = 8t - 2$\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the velocity function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(8t - 2)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 8$\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration is the same at any time. Therefore, the acceleration of the skateboarder at $t = 3$ seconds is $8$ meters per second squared."
