    "message_1": "Suppose a software company claims that their new program reduces the average time it takes to complete a task from 50 minutes to 40 minutes. To test this claim, a sample of 30 users were taken and asked to complete the task using the new program. The sample mean time taken was found to be 42 minutes with a standard deviation of 7 minutes. Using a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the claim that the average time to complete the task has been reduced to 40 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To test the claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average time to complete the task has been reduced to 40 minutes, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average time is not equal to 40 minutes.\n\nH0: μ = 40\nH1: μ ≠ 40\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 30\nSample mean (x̄) = 42 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 7 minutes\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (42 - 40) / (7 / √30)\nt ≈ 1.63\n\nNext, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 29 degrees of freedom (df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ ± 2.045\n\nNow, we compare the calculated t-score with the critical t-value:\n\n-2.045 < 1.63 < 2.045\n\nSince the calculated t-score falls within the range of the critical t-values, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that, at a 0.05 significance level, we do not have enough evidence to reject the claim that the average time to complete the task has been reduced to 40 minutes."
