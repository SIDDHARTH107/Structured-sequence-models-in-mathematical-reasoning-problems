    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle along the river be x meters and the width perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since one side of the rectangle is along the river, we only need fencing for the other three sides. The total fencing available is 300 meters, so we have:\n\nx + 2y = 300\n\nWe want to maximize the area A of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve the fencing equation for x:\n\nx = 300 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the area equation:\n\nA = (300 - 2y)y\n\nA = 300y - 2y^2\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to y and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dy = 300 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 300\ny = 75\n\nNow, substitute this value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 300 - 2(75)\nx = 300 - 150\nx = 150\n\nSo, the dimensions of the field that maximize its area are 150 meters along the river (length) and 75 meters perpendicular to the river (width)."
