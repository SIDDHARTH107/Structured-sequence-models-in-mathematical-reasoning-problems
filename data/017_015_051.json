Z_2 × Z_12: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 12.\n3. Z_4 × Z_6: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 6.\n4. Z_3 × Z_8: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 8.\n5. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_6: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 6.\n6. Z_2 × Z_4 × Z_3: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2, a cyclic group of order 4, and a cyclic group of order 3.\n7. Z_2 × S_3 × Z_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2, the symmetric group on 3 elements, and a cyclic group of order 2.\n8. Z_2 × D_12: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and the dihedral group of order 12.\n9. Z_3 × D_8: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the dihedral group of order 8.\n10. Z_2 × Q_8: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and the quaternion group of order 8.\n11. S_4: The symmetric group on 4 elements.\n12. A_4 × Z_2: The direct product of the alternating group on 4 elements and a cyclic group of order 2.\n13. SL(2,3): The special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements.\n14. D_24: The dihedral group of order 24.\n15. Q_8 ⋊ Z_3: The semidirect product of the quaternion group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and considering the possible structures of groups of order 24."
