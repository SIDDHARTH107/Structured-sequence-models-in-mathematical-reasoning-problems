    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^2 + 4 on the interval [-2, 2], we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = x^2 + 4\ndy/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[-2, 2] √(1 + (2x)^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[-2, 2] √(1 + 4x^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = 2x\ndu/dx = 2\ndx = du/2\n\nNow, we also need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nx = -2 => u = 2(-2) = -4\nx = 2 => u = 2(2) = 4\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[-4, 4] √(1 + u^2) (du/2)\n\nL = (1/2) ∫[-4, 4] √(1 + u^2) du\n\nThis integral represents the arc length of a hyperbolic function, and its antiderivative is given by:\n\n∫ √(1 + u^2) du = (1/2) (u √(1 + u^2) + sinh^(-1)(u)) + C\n\nNow, we can find the arc length L by evaluating the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nL = (1/2) [(4 √(1 + 4^2) + sinh^(-1)(4)) - (-4 √(1 + (-4)^2) + sinh^(-1)(-4))]\n\nL = (1/2) [(4 √17 + sinh^(-1)(4)) - (-4 √17 - sinh^(-1)(4))]\n\nL = (1/2) [8 √17 + 2 sinh^(-1)(4)]\n\nL = 4 √17 + sinh^(-1)(4)\n\nThe arc length of the curve y = x^2 + 4 on the interval [-2, 2] is approximately:\n\nL ≈ 4 √17 + sinh^(-1)(4) ≈ 11.28 (rounded to two decimal places)."
