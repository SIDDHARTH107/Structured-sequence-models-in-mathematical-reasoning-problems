    "message_2": "To find the number of points of intersection of the two curves in the complex projective plane, we can use Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product of the degrees of the curves, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the curves C1 and C2. The degree of a curve is the highest total degree of any term in its equation.\n\nFor C1: x^2 + y^2 - 9 = 0, the highest total degree is 2 (from the x^2 and y^2 terms). So, the degree of C1 is 2.\n\nFor C2: x - y^3 = 0, the highest total degree is 3 (from the y^3 term). So, the degree of C2 is 3.\n\nNow, we can apply Bézout's theorem. The product of the degrees of the curves is 2 * 3 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 points of intersection of the two curves in the complex projective plane, taking into account multiplicity."
