    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we first need to simplify it. We can do this by finding a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator will be the product of the denominators (x-4), (x+3), and (x^2 - x - 12). \n\nHowever, we can notice that (x^2 - x - 12) can be factored as (x-4)(x+3). So, the common denominator is (x-4)(x+3).\n\nNow, we'll multiply each term by the common denominator:\n\n3(x-4)(x+3)/(x-4) + 4(x-4)(x+3)/(x+3) = 5(x-4)(x+3)/(x^2 - x - 12)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3(x+3) + 4(x-4) = 5\n\nNow, we'll distribute and combine like terms:\n\n3x + 9 + 4x - 16 = 5\n\n7x - 7 = 5\n\nNow, we'll isolate x:\n\n7x = 12\n\nx = 12/7\n\nSo, the solution is x = 12/7."
