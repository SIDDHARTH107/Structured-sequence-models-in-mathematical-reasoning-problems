    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (1/2x+4) = (3/4), we will first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators x, 2x+4, and 4. The LCM of these denominators is 4x(x+2).\n\nNow, we will rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n(2/x) * (4(x+2)/4(x+2)) + (1/2x+4) * (2x/2x) = (3/4) * (x(2x+4)/x(2x+4))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(8(x+2) + 2x^2) / 4x(x+2) = 3x(2x+4) / 4x(x+2)\n\nSince both sides of the equation have the same denominator, we can set the numerators equal to each other:\n\n8(x+2) + 2x^2 = 3x(2x+4)\n\nNow, we will expand and simplify the equation:\n\n8x + 16 + 2x^2 = 6x^2 + 12x\n\nNext, we will move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n0 = 4x^2 + 4x - 16\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 4:\n\n0 = x^2 + x - 4\n\nWe now have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve for x, we can either factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor the equation:\n\n0 = (x+2)(x-2)\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx+2 = 0 => x = -2\nx-2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are -2 and 2."
