    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system of linear equations to find the relationship between x, y, and z.\n\nx + 2y + z = 5\n2x + y + z = 10\n\nWe can subtract the first equation from the second one to eliminate z:\n\n(2x + y + z) - (x + 2y + z) = 10 - 5\nx - y = 5\n\nNow, we have:\n\nx - y = 5\nx = y + 5\n\nWe can substitute x back into the first equation:\n\n(y + 5) + 2y + z = 5\n3y + z = 0\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\nx = y + 5\n3y + z = 0\n\nSince the matrix is positive semi-definite, all its principal minors must be non-negative. The determinant of the matrix is:\n\ndet(A) = 2(2*2 - 1*1) - 1(1*1 - 0*1) + 0(0*1 - 1*1) = 6\n\nSince the determinant is positive, the matrix is positive definite. This means that the optimization problem is convex, and we can find the optimal values of x and y by solving the system of linear equations.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express z in terms of y:\n\nz = -3y\n\nNow, substitute z back into the first constraint equation:\n\nx + 2y - 3y = 5\nx - y = 5\n\nWe already have x = y + 5, so the system of linear equations is consistent. Therefore, the optimal values of x and y are:\n\nx = 5\ny = 0\n\nSo, the optimal values for this problem are x = 5 and y = 0."
