    "message_1": "A simple mechanical system consists of a mass of 2 kg attached to a spring with a spring constant of 16 N/m. The mass is set in motion with an initial displacement of 0.3 meters and an initial velocity of 0.2 meters/second. Determine the equation of motion of the mass and calculate the frequency and period of its oscillations.",
    "message_2": "To determine the equation of motion for the mass, we can use the following formula for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω). We can do this using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (16 N/m) and m is the mass (2 kg).\n\nω = sqrt(16/2) = sqrt(8) = 2 * sqrt(2) rad/s\n\nNow we need to find the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). We know the initial displacement (x0) is 0.3 meters and the initial velocity (v0) is 0.2 meters/second. We can use these values to find A and φ:\n\nx0 = A * cos(φ)\nv0 = -A * ω * sin(φ)\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nA = sqrt(x0^2 + (v0/ω)^2)\nφ = arctan(-v0/(ω * x0))\n\nA = sqrt(0.3^2 + (0.2/(2 * sqrt(2)))^2) = 0.3 m\nφ = arctan(-0.2/(2 * sqrt(2) * 0.3)) ≈ -0.225 radians\n\nNow we can write the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.3 * cos(2 * sqrt(2) * t - 0.225)\n\nTo find the frequency (f) and period (T) of the oscillations, we can use the following formulas:\n\nf = ω / (2 * π)\nT = 1 / f\n\nf = (2 * sqrt(2)) / (2 * π) ≈ 0.225 Hz\nT = 1 / 0.225 ≈ 4.44 seconds\n\nSo, the equation of motion for the mass is x(t) = 0.3 * cos(2 * sqrt(2) * t - 0.225), and the frequency and period of its oscillations are approximately 0.225 Hz and 4.44 seconds, respectively."
