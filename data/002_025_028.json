    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, if the length of the two equal sides are each 7cm and the angle between them is 72°, what is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite to side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the two equal sides have a length of 7 cm (a = b = 7), and the angle between them is 72° (C = 72°). We want to find the length of the third side (c).\n\nc² = 7² + 7² - 2 * 7 * 7 * cos(72°)\nc² = 49 + 49 - 98 * cos(72°)\n\nNow, we find the cosine of 72°:\n\ncos(72°) ≈ 0.309017\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\n\nc² = 49 + 49 - 98 * 0.309017\nc² ≈ 98 - 30.24466\nc² ≈ 67.75534\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc ≈ √67.75534\nc ≈ 8.23 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle is approximately 8.23 cm."
