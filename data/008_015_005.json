    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  1 |\n    | 2  5  2 |\n    | 1  2  4 |\n\nb = | 13 |\n    | 22 |\n    | 16 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T. \n\nL = | l11  0    0  |\n    | l21  l22  0  |\n    | l31  l32  l33|\n\nL^T = | l11  l21  l31 |\n      | 0    l22  l32 |\n      | 0    0    l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition method, we can find the elements of matrix L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(3) = 1.732\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1.732 = 1.155\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 1 / 1.732 = 0.577\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(5 - 1.155^2) = 2.121\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (2 - 0.577 * 1.155) / 2.121 = 0.667\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(4 - 0.577^2 - 0.667^2) = 1.857\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | 1.732  0      0    |\n    | 1.155  2.121  0    |\n    | 0.577  0.667  1.857 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n1.732y1 = 13 => y1 = 7.5\n1.155y1 + 2.121y2 = 22 => y2 = 4.5\n0.577y1 + 0.667y2 + 1.857y3 = 16 => y3 = 3.5\n\nSo, y = | 7.5 |\n        | 4.5 |\n        | 3.5 |\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n1.732x1 + 1.155x2 + 0.577x3 = 7.5 => x1 = 2\n2.121x2 + 0.667x3 = 4.5 => x2 = 1\n1.857x3 = 3.5 => x3 = 3\n\nSo, the solution x = | 2 |\n                      | 1 |\n                      | 3 |\n\nThus, the values of the variables are x = 2, y = 1, and z = 3."
