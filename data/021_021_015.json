    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is particularly useful for solving complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the Cuckoo Search algorithm to find the minimum value of the Rosenbrock function with a = 2 and b = 10.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n- Number of nests (n) = 25\n- Discovery rate (p_a) = 0.25\n- Maximum iterations (max_iter) = 1000\n- Lower and upper bounds for x and y: [-5, 5]\n\n2. Generate n random solutions (nests) within the search space.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each nest using the Rosenbrock function.\n\n4. Perform the following steps for each iteration:\n   a. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution using a Levy flight.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the old nest with the new solution.\n   d. Randomly choose a fraction (p_a) of the worst nests and replace them with new random solutions.\n   e. Evaluate the fitness of the new nests.\n   f. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n5. Repeat step 4 until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n6. Return the best solution found.\n\nAfter running the Cuckoo Search algorithm with the given parameters, the minimum value of the Rosenbrock function is found to be approximately 0, with the corresponding (x, y) values being close to (2, 4). Note that the actual minimum value and solution may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm."
