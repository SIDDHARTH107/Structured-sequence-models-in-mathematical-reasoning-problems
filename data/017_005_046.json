    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there exists a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let H be this normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Since H has order 5^2 = 25, it is a group of prime power order, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, H is isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. C_25 (cyclic group of order 25)\n2. C_5 × C_5 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5)\n\nNow, let K be a subgroup of G such that H ∩ K = {e} (identity element) and |K| = 5. Since H is normal in G, the product HK is a subgroup of G, and by the product formula, |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K| = 25 * 5 / 1 = 125. Thus, G = HK.\n\nIf H is isomorphic to C_25, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of C_25 and C_5, which is a cyclic group of order 125. In this case, G is cyclic.\n\nIf H is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of C_5 × C_5 and C_5, which is C_5 × C_5 × C_5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
