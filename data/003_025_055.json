    "message_2": "Since the ship is sailing at a constant speed of 15 km/h on a bearing of 40 degrees, its velocity can be represented as a vector. In this case, we can break down the velocity vector into its horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) components.\n\nThe horizontal component (Vx) can be found using the formula:\n\nVx = V * cos(θ)\n\nWhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (15 km/h) and θ is the angle (40 degrees).\n\nVx = 15 * cos(40°)\nVx ≈ 11.49 km/h\n\nThe vertical component (Vy) can be found using the formula:\n\nVy = V * sin(θ)\n\nVy = 15 * sin(40°)\nVy ≈ 9.64 km/h\n\nNow that we have the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity, we can find the magnitude of the velocity relative to the stationary observer using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV_relative = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2)\n\nV_relative = √(11.49^2 + 9.64^2)\nV_relative ≈ 15 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity relative to the stationary observer is 15 km/h, which is the same as the ship's speed.\n\nTo find the direction of the velocity relative to the stationary observer, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ_relative = arctan(Vy / Vx)\n\nθ_relative = arctan(9.64 / 11.49)\nθ_relative ≈ 40 degrees\n\nThe direction of the velocity relative to the stationary observer is 40 degrees, which is the same as the ship's bearing.\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the ship's velocity relative to a stationary observer on the shore are 15 km/h and 40 degrees, respectively."
