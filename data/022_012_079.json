    "message_2": "To find the zeroes of $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which $f(z) = 0$. This occurs when the numerator of the function is equal to zero:\n\n$z = 0$\n\nSince there is only one value of $z$ that makes the numerator zero, there is only one zero of the function, and its order is 1 (the exponent of $z$ in the numerator).\n\nNow, to find the poles of $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which $f(z)$ is undefined. This occurs when the denominator of the function is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 + 1 = 0$\n\n$z^2 = -1$\n\n$z = \\pm \\sqrt{-1} = \\pm i$\n\nThere are two values of $z$ that make the denominator zero, so there are two poles of the function. To find their orders, we need to determine the exponent of the factors in the denominator that correspond to these poles. Since the denominator is a quadratic polynomial, and both poles are simple roots of the polynomial, their orders are both 1.\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function $f(z) = \\frac{z}{z^2 + 1}$ has:\n\n1. One zero at $z = 0$ with order 1.\n2. Two poles at $z = \\pm i$ with order 1 for each pole."
