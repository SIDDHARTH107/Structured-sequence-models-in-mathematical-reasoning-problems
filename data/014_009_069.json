    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt a 64-bit block of data using a Feistel cipher structure with 16 rounds. If the key size is 128 bits, what would be the size of each subkey used in the cipher?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the key is divided into subkeys for each round of the encryption process. Since there are 16 rounds in this case, the 128-bit key will be divided into 16 equal parts to generate the subkeys.\n\nTo find the size of each subkey, we can simply divide the total key size by the number of rounds:\n\nSubkey size = Total key size / Number of rounds\nSubkey size = 128 bits / 16 rounds\nSubkey size = 8 bits\n\nSo, each subkey used in the cipher would be 8 bits in size."
