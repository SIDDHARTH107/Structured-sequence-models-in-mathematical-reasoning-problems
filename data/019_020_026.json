    "message_2": "First, let's determine the number of steps required to solve the problem with the given algorithm's time complexity of O(nlogn).\n\nInput size (n) = 10^10\n\nNumber of steps = n * log₂n\n\nTo convert log base 10 to log base 2, we can use the following formula:\n\nlog₂n = log₁₀n / log₁₀2\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of steps:\n\nNumber of steps = (10^10) * (log₁₀(10^10) / log₁₀2)\n\nNumber of steps ≈ (10^10) * (10 / 0.30103) [since log₁₀(10^10) = 10 and log₁₀2 ≈ 0.30103]\n\nNumber of steps ≈ (10^10) * 33.219\n\nNumber of steps ≈ 3.3219 * 10^11\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for each step:\n\nTime per step = 10^-9 seconds\n\nTotal time = Number of steps * Time per step\n\nTotal time = (3.3219 * 10^11) * (10^-9)\n\nTotal time ≈ 332.19 seconds\n\nSo, it would take approximately 332.19 seconds for a computer to solve the mathematical problem with the given input size and algorithm's time complexity."
