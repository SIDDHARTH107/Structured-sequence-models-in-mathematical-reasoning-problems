    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Two of these outcomes (3 and 5) are the ones we are interested in. To find the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 (rolling a 3 or a 5), and the total number of possible outcomes is 6.\n\nProbability = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 on a fair six-sided die is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)."
