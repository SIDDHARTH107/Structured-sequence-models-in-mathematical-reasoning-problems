    "message_1": "A bank wants to predict whether a customer will default or not on their loan, based on their income and loan amount. The bank collected data from 50 customers who either defaulted or did not default on their loan. Using a discriminant analysis, determine the decision boundary between the two groups, assuming equal prior probabilities. Then, predict whether a new customer with an income of $50,000 and a loan amount of $20,000 will default on their loan or not, based on the decision boundary.",
    "message_2": "To perform a discriminant analysis, we first need the data from the 50 customers. Since the data is not provided, I will explain the general steps to perform a discriminant analysis and determine the decision boundary.\n\n1. Divide the data into two groups: those who defaulted on their loan (Group 1) and those who did not default on their loan (Group 2).\n\n2. Calculate the mean income (M1_income) and mean loan amount (M1_loan) for Group 1, and the mean income (M2_income) and mean loan amount (M2_loan) for Group 2.\n\n3. Calculate the covariance matrix for each group. This matrix will contain the variances of income and loan amount, as well as the covariance between income and loan amount for each group.\n\n4. Calculate the pooled covariance matrix by taking the weighted average of the two covariance matrices, assuming equal prior probabilities.\n\n5. Calculate the inverse of the pooled covariance matrix.\n\n6. Determine the decision boundary by calculating the linear discriminant function, which is given by:\n\n   L(x) = W' * x + w0\n   \n   where W is the weight vector, x is the input vector (income and loan amount), and w0 is the threshold. W can be calculated as:\n\n   W = pooled_covariance_matrix_inverse * (M1 - M2)\n\n   where M1 and M2 are the mean vectors for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The threshold w0 can be calculated as:\n\n   w0 = -0.5 * M1' * pooled_covariance_matrix_inverse * M1 + 0.5 * M2' * pooled_covariance_matrix_inverse * M2 + ln(P1/P2)\n\n   Since we assume equal prior probabilities, P1 = P2, and ln(P1/P2) = 0.\n\n7. To predict whether a new customer with an income of $50,000 and a loan amount of $20,000 will default on their loan or not, plug these values into the linear discriminant function L(x):\n\n   L(x) = W' * [50,000, 20,000] + w0\n\n8. If L(x) > 0, the customer is classified as belonging to Group 1 (default on their loan). If L(x) < 0, the customer is classified as belonging to Group 2 (not default on their loan).\n\nWithout the actual data, we cannot perform the calculations and provide a prediction for the new customer. However, these are the steps you would follow to perform a discriminant analysis and determine the decision boundary."
