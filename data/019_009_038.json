    "message_2": "Intuitionistic logic is a type of logic that requires direct evidence or constructive proof for a proposition to be considered true. In this case, we are asked to provide two numbers x and y such that neither P nor Q can be proven using Intuitionistic logic.\n\nHowever, the problem as stated is not well-suited for Intuitionistic logic, as the propositions P and Q are simple arithmetic statements that can be easily proven or disproven using classical logic. Intuitionistic logic is more relevant when dealing with abstract mathematical concepts or philosophical problems.\n\nNonetheless, let's consider the following example:\n\nLet x = 4 and y = 3.\n\nUsing classical logic, we can easily prove that P is true, as 4 is an even number (it can be divided by 2 without a remainder). Similarly, we can prove that Q is true, as 3 is an odd number (it cannot be divided by 2 without a remainder).\n\nIn the context of Intuitionistic logic, we can also prove P and Q by providing direct evidence or constructive proof:\n\nFor P, we can show that x = 4 can be written as 2 * 2, which demonstrates that x is even.\n\nFor Q, we can show that y = 3 can be written as 2 * 1 + 1, which demonstrates that y is odd.\n\nThus, in this example, both P and Q can be proven using Intuitionistic logic. However, it is important to note that Intuitionistic logic is more relevant for abstract mathematical concepts or philosophical problems, rather than simple arithmetic statements like P and Q."
