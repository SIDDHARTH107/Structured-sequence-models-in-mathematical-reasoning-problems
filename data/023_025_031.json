    "message_1": "Consider a material having a mass density function given by ρ(x) = 2 + sin(x), where x is the distance from the origin. If the material occupies the region −π ≤ x ≤ π, find the total mass of the material using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "The problem statement seems to be a bit confusing, as the Fourier transform is not the appropriate tool to find the total mass of the material. Instead, we should use integration to find the total mass.\n\nThe mass density function is given by ρ(x) = 2 + sin(x). To find the total mass, we need to integrate the mass density function over the given region, which is from -π to π.\n\nTotal mass M = ∫[ρ(x) dx] from -π to π\n\nM = ∫[(2 + sin(x)) dx] from -π to π\n\nNow, we integrate the function:\n\nM = [2x - cos(x)] from -π to π\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nM = [2π - cos(π)] - [2(-π) - cos(-π)]\n\nM = [2π + 1] - [-2π + 1]\n\nM = 4π\n\nSo, the total mass of the material is 4π."
