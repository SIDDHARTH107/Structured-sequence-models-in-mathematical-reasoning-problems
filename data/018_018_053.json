    "message_2": "The symmetric difference between two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union (A ∪ B) and intersection (A ∩ B) of the sets A and B.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference between set A and set B is {1, 4}."
