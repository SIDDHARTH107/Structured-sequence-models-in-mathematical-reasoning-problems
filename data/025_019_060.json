    "message_2": "To find the number of lines that lie on the Fano variety, we can use the fact that the Fano variety has a degree of 3. The degree of a variety is the number of points it intersects with a generic linear space of complementary dimension. In this case, the complementary dimension is 1, so we are looking for the number of points the Fano variety intersects with a generic line in $\\mathbb{P}^3$.\n\nLet $L$ be a generic line in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, parameterized by $[x:y] = [\\lambda x_0 + \\mu x_1 : \\lambda y_0 + \\mu y_1]$, where $x_0, x_1, y_0, y_1$ are fixed points in $\\mathbb{P}^1$. We can rewrite the equation of the Fano variety as:\n\n$(\\lambda x_0 + \\mu x_1)^3 + (\\lambda y_0 + \\mu y_1)^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the Bezout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points of two varieties in projective space is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity. In this case, the Fano variety has degree 3, and the line has degree 1, so the number of intersection points is $3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that some of these intersection points may be counted with multiplicity. In this case, it turns out that each intersection point is counted with multiplicity 1, so the total number of lines that lie on the Fano variety is 3."
