    "message_2": "To find the probability of rain on a specific day in this region, we need to divide the number of rainy days by the total number of days in a year.\n\nProbability of rain on a specific day = (Number of rainy days) / (Total number of days in a year)\n\nThere are 200 rainy days and 365 days in a year (assuming it's not a leap year).\n\nProbability of rain on a specific day = 200 / 365 â‰ˆ 0.547 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on a specific day in this region is approximately 0.547 or 54.7%."
