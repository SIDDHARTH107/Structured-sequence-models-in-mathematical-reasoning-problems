Each day, there is a 20% probability that the factory will produce Type A, a 50% probability that it will produce Type B, and a 30% probability that it will produce Type C. If on a given day, the factory produced Type A, what is the probability that it will produce Type B the next day?",
    "message_2": "The probability that the factory will produce Type B the next day is independent of what it produced the previous day. Therefore, the probability that it will produce Type B the next day is still 50%."
