    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, the original line segment is divided into 5 equal parts, and 3 of them are kept after each iteration (the first, third, and fifth parts). So, N = 3 and M = 5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(3) / log(5)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6826\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust in this case is approximately 0.6826."
