    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are not independent, and they actually represent the same plane in 3D space. \n\nTo find the solution, we can solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = 11 - 2x - 3z\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n4x + 2(11 - 2x - 3z) + 6z = 22\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n4x + 22 - 4x - 6z + 6z = 22\n\n4x - 4x = 22 - 22\n\n0 = 0\n\nSince we got a true statement, it means that the second equation is dependent on the first equation, and they represent the same plane.\n\nNow, we can plug the expression for y into the third equation:\n\n6x + 3(11 - 2x - 3z) + 9z = 33\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n6x + 33 - 6x - 9z + 9z = 33\n\n6x - 6x = 33 - 33\n\n0 = 0\n\nAgain, we got a true statement, which means that the third equation is also dependent on the first equation and represents the same plane.\n\nSince all three equations represent the same plane, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations. The solution can be represented as:\n\nx = x\ny = 11 - 2x - 3z\nz = z\n\nwhere x and z can be any real numbers."
