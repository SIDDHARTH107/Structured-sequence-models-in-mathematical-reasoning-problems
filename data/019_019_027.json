    "message_2": "A Turing machine that accepts only binary strings representing even numbers can be designed with the following algorithm:\n\n1. Start in the initial state (q0).\n2. Read the input symbol from the tape.\n3. If the input symbol is '1', move to state q1.\n4. If the input symbol is '0', move to state q2.\n5. If the input symbol is blank, move to state q3.\n\nState transitions:\n- In state q0:\n  - If the input symbol is '1', move to state q1 and move the tape head to the right.\n  - If the input symbol is '0', move to state q2 and move the tape head to the right.\n  - If the input symbol is blank, move to state q3 (reject state).\n\n- In state q1:\n  - If the input symbol is '1' or '0', move the tape head to the right and stay in state q1.\n  - If the input symbol is blank, move to state q3 (reject state).\n\n- In state q2:\n  - If the input symbol is '1' or '0', move the tape head to the right and stay in state q2.\n  - If the input symbol is blank, move to state q4 (accept state).\n\n- In state q3 (reject state), the Turing machine halts and rejects the input.\n- In state q4 (accept state), the Turing machine halts and accepts the input.\n\nThis algorithm works because even binary numbers always end with a '0'. The Turing machine starts by checking the first symbol and moves to the appropriate state based on whether it's a '1' or a '0'. It then continues to read the input symbols until it reaches the end of the input string. If the last symbol read is a '0', the Turing machine moves to the accept state (q4), otherwise, it moves to the reject state (q3)."
