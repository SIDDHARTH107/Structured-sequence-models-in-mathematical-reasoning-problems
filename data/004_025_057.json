    "message_1": "A car is traveling at a speed of 30 meters per second. If the driver applies the brakes and the car comes to a stop over a distance of 60 meters, what is the magnitude of the car's deceleration?",
    "message_2": "We can use the following equation to solve for the magnitude of the car's deceleration:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity (0 m/s, since the car comes to a stop)\nu = initial velocity (30 m/s)\na = acceleration (or deceleration, in this case)\ns = distance (60 meters)\n\n0 = (30)^2 + 2*a*60\n\nNow, we can solve for a:\n\n0 = 900 + 120a\n-900 = 120a\na = -900 / 120\na = -7.5 m/s^2\n\nThe magnitude of the car's deceleration is 7.5 m/s^2."
