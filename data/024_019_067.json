    "message_2": "To find the curvature K of the surface S at the point (1, 2, √2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. The surface S is a sphere with radius 3, centered at the origin.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (3cos(u)sin(v), 3sin(u)sin(v), 3cos(v))\n\nwhere u ∈ [0, 2π] and v ∈ [0, π].\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nru = ∂r/∂u = (-3sin(u)sin(v), 3cos(u)sin(v), 0)\nrv = ∂r/∂v = (3cos(u)cos(v), 3sin(u)cos(v), -3sin(v))\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <ru, ru> = 9sin^2(v)\nF = <ru, rv> = 0\nG = <rv, rv> = 9\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nruu = ∂²r/∂u² = (-3cos(u)sin(v), -3sin(u)sin(v), 0)\nruv = ∂²r/∂u∂v = (-3sin(u)cos(v), 3cos(u)cos(v), 0)\nrvv = ∂²r/∂v² = (-3cos(u)sin(v), -3sin(u)sin(v), -3cos(v))\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <ruu, N> = -3\nM = <ruv, N> = 0\nN = <rvv, N> = -3\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (-3 * -3 - 0^2) / (9 * 9 - 0^2) = 9 / 81 = 1/9\n\nSo, the curvature K of S at the point (1, 2, √2) is 1/9.\n\nNow, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to calculate the Euler characteristic χ of S. The theorem states that:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nSince S is a sphere, we know that the Euler characteristic χ = 2. Therefore, we can write:\n\n∫∫_S (1/9) dA = 2π(2)\n\nTo find the integral, we can use the area of the sphere:\n\nA = 4πR^2 = 4π(3^2) = 36π\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(1/9) * 36π = 4π\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic χ of the surface S is 2."
