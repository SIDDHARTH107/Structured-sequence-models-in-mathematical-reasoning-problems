    "message_1": "What are the poles and zeros of the complex function f(z) = (z-2)/(z^2 + 3z + 2) ?\n\nHint: To find the poles and zeros, factor the denominator of the function, set it equal to zero, and solve for the values of z. The zeros will be the roots of the numerator and the poles will be the roots of the denominator that do not cancel with roots of the numerator.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the zeros of the function by setting the numerator equal to zero:\n\nz - 2 = 0\nz = 2\n\nSo, the function has a single zero at z = 2.\n\nNow, let's find the poles by factoring the denominator and setting it equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 3z + 2 = 0\n(z + 1)(z + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two roots for the denominator: z = -1 and z = -2. Since neither of these roots cancels with the root of the numerator, both of them are poles of the function.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (z-2)/(z^2 + 3z + 2) has one zero at z = 2 and two poles at z = -1 and z = -2."
