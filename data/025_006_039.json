    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of H^1(Y,Q), we can use the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the inclusion map of Y into X. Let i: Y → X be the inclusion map, and let j: X - Y → X be the open complement of Y in X. Then, we have the following long exact sequence in cohomology:\n\n... → H^0(X,Q) → H^0(Y,Q) → H^0(X-Y,Q) → H^1(X,Q) → H^1(Y,Q) → H^1(X-Y,Q) → ...\n\nWe are given that H^0(X,Q) = Q, H^1(X,Q) = Q^2, and H^2(X,Q) = Q^3. Since X - Y is an open subset of X, it has the same cohomology groups as X in dimensions greater than 0. Therefore, H^1(X-Y,Q) = Q^2.\n\nNow, we can determine the dimensions of the cohomology groups in the long exact sequence:\n\n0 → Q → H^0(Y,Q) → Q → Q^2 → H^1(Y,Q) → Q^2 → 0\n\nSince H^0(Y,Q) is the connected components of Y, it must be at least Q. Thus, the map from H^0(X,Q) to H^0(Y,Q) must be an isomorphism, and H^0(Y,Q) = Q. This implies that the map from H^0(Y,Q) to H^0(X-Y,Q) is the zero map.\n\nNow, we have the following exact sequence:\n\n0 → Q^2 → H^1(Y,Q) → Q^2 → 0\n\nThis implies that the dimension of H^1(Y,Q) must be 2, as the maps from H^1(X,Q) to H^1(Y,Q) and from H^1(Y,Q) to H^1(X-Y,Q) are both isomorphisms.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of H^1(Y,Q) is 2."
