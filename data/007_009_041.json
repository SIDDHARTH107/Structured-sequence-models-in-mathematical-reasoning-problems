    "message_2": "First, let's find the prime factorization of n. Since n has 60 positive divisors, we know that the number of divisors can be expressed as the product of one more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization. That is:\n\n60 = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)...\n\nwhere a, b, c, ... are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of n.\n\nWe can find the prime factorization of 60 as 2^2 * 3 * 5. There are a few ways to break down 60 into the product of three factors:\n\n1. 60 = 2 * 2 * 15\n2. 60 = 2 * 3 * 10\n3. 60 = 2 * 5 * 6\n4. 60 = 3 * 4 * 5\n\nNow, let's consider the Euler's totient function φ(n). Recall that:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * (1 - 1/p3)...\n\nwhere p1, p2, p3, ... are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nSince φ(n) = 24, we can write:\n\n24 = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * (1 - 1/p3)...\n\nNow, we will test each of the possible factorizations of 60 to see which one satisfies the given condition.\n\n1. If n = p1^1 * p2^1 * p3^14, then φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * (1 - 1/p3). This gives us:\n\n24 = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * (1 - 1/p3)\n\nHowever, this case does not satisfy the given condition.\n\n2. If n = p1^1 * p2^2 * p3^9, then φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * (1 - 1/p3). This gives us:\n\n24 = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * (1 - 1/p3)\n\nIn this case, we can find a solution: n = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^9. Then:\n\nφ(n) = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^9 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\n     = 2 * 9 * 1953125 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5)\n     = 24\n\nSo, n = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^9 = 2 * 9 * 1953125 = 35156250."
