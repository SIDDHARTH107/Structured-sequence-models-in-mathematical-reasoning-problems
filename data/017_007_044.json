    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. The order of an element a in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element.\n3. Lagrange's theorem: The order of a subgroup H of a group G divides the order of G.\n4. A group of prime order is cyclic.\n\nNow let's consider the possible orders of elements in G. Since the order of G is 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The identity element has order 1, so we are left with orders 2, 3, and 6.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nIf G has an element a of order 6, then the subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has order 6. Since the order of <a> is equal to the order of G, we have G = <a>. This means G is a cyclic group generated by a single element of order 6, so G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 6.\nIn this case, G must have elements of orders 2 and 3, as the identity element has order 1. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3. Then a^2 = e and b^3 = e.\n\nNow consider the element ab. Since (ab)^6 = a^6b^6 = e, the order of ab divides 6. The order of ab cannot be 1, as ab â‰  e. If the order of ab is 6, then G would have an element of order 6, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the order of ab must be either 2 or 3.\n\nIf the order of ab is 2, then (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e, which implies that a = b^(-1), and G = {e, a, b, b^2, ab, b^(-1)ab}. In this case, G has the same structure as the dihedral group D3, which has 6 elements and is generated by a rotation (b) and a reflection (a). Thus, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIf the order of ab is 3, then (ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = e, which implies that a = b^2. In this case, G = {e, a, b, b^2, ab, b^2ab} = {e, b^2, b, b^2, b^3, b^4}. However, this is a contradiction because G would be a cyclic group generated by b, which means G would have an element of order 6. This contradicts our assumption that G has no elements of order 6.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is that G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3. To determine which group is isomorphic to G, we can find all the possible subgroups for G and check their properties. If G has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to C6. If G has elements of orders 2 and 3 but no elements of order 6, it is isomorphic to D3."
