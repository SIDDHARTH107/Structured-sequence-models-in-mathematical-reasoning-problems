    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x), we first need to find its derivative, f'(x). \n\nf(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nWe can factor out a 3 from the equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nTo determine whether each critical point corresponds to a local maximum, local minimum, or neither, we can use the second derivative test. We need to find the second derivative, f''(x), and evaluate it at the critical points.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nDifferentiating f'(x) with respect to x, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we evaluate f''(x) at the critical points:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the function f(x) has a local maximum at x = 1.\nSince f''(3) > 0, the function f(x) has a local minimum at x = 3.\n\nSo, the critical points x = 1 and x = 3 correspond to a local maximum and a local minimum, respectively."
