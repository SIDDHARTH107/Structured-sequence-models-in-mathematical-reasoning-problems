    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x. \n\nGiven the equation: y^2 - 2y - x^3 = 0\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\n(d/dx)(y^2) - (d/dx)(2y) - (d/dx)(x^3) = (d/dx)(0)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n2y(dy/dx) - 2(dy/dx) - 3x^2 = 0\n\nNow, we want to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) - 2(dy/dx) = 3x^2\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\n(dy/dx)(2y - 2) = 3x^2\n\nNow, divide both sides by (2y - 2) to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 / (2y - 2)\n\nWe are given x = 2 and y = 3, so we can plug these values into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = 3(2)^2 / (2(3) - 2)\n\ndy/dx = 12 / 4\n\ndy/dx = 3\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 2 and y = 3 is 3."
