    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x² + 3x + 5 within the range [-10, 10] using WOA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales with random positions within the search space ([-10, 10]).\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale using the given function.\n3. Update the position of each whale based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n5. The whale with the best fitness value represents the minimum value of the function.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I cannot execute the WOA algorithm directly. Instead, I can provide you with the minimum value of the function using calculus.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x² + 3x + 5, we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nSetting f'(x) = 0:\n\n2x + 3 = 0\nx = -3/2\n\nNow, we can check if this critical point is a minimum by taking the second derivative:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(-3/2) > 0, the critical point x = -3/2 is a minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging this value back into the original function:\n\nf(-3/2) = (-3/2)² + 3(-3/2) + 5 = 9/4 - 9/2 + 5 = (9 - 18 + 20)/4 = 11/4\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x² + 3x + 5 within the range [-10, 10] is 11/4 or 2.75."
