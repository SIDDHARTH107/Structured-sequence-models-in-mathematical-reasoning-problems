    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in a market producing identical products. Each firm has a cost function of C(q) = 10q, where q is the quantity of output produced by the firm. The market demand for the product is given by P = 50 - Q, where Q is the total quantity of output produced by both firms.\n\nWhat is the Cournot equilibrium output and price for each firm?",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot equilibrium output and price for each firm, we first need to find the reaction functions for each firm. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the output level chosen by the other firm.\n\nLet q1 and q2 be the output levels of firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total output in the market is Q = q1 + q2. The price is given by the demand function P = 50 - Q.\n\nThe revenue for each firm is given by R(q) = P * q. So, the revenue for firm 1 is R1(q1) = (50 - Q) * q1 = (50 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 = 50q1 - q1^2 - q1q2. Similarly, the revenue for firm 2 is R2(q2) = (50 - Q) * q2 = (50 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 = 50q2 - q2^2 - q1q2.\n\nThe profit for each firm is given by the difference between revenue and cost: π(q) = R(q) - C(q). So, the profit for firm 1 is π1(q1) = R1(q1) - C(q1) = 50q1 - q1^2 - q1q2 - 10q1 = 40q1 - q1^2 - q1q2. Similarly, the profit for firm 2 is π2(q2) = R2(q2) - C(q2) = 50q2 - q2^2 - q1q2 - 10q2 = 40q2 - q2^2 - q1q2.\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the output level that maximizes each firm's profit, taking the output of the other firm as given. We do this by taking the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to the firm's own output and setting it equal to zero.\n\nFor firm 1: ∂π1/∂q1 = 40 - 2q1 - q2 = 0. Rearranging, we get the reaction function for firm 1: q1 = 20 - 0.5q2.\n\nFor firm 2: ∂π2/∂q2 = 40 - 2q2 - q1 = 0. Rearranging, we get the reaction function for firm 2: q2 = 20 - 0.5q1.\n\nNow, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the Cournot equilibrium output levels for both firms.\n\nSubstituting the reaction function of firm 1 into the reaction function of firm 2, we get: q2 = 20 - 0.5(20 - 0.5q2).\n\nSolving for q2, we get: q2 = 13.333.\n\nSubstituting this value of q2 back into the reaction function of firm 1, we get: q1 = 20 - 0.5(13.333) = 13.333.\n\nSo, the Cournot equilibrium output levels for both firms are q1 = q2 = 13.333.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price by substituting these output levels into the demand function: P = 50 - Q = 50 - (13.333 + 13.333) = 50 - 26.666 = 23.334.\n\nThus, the Cournot equilibrium output for each firm is 13.333 units, and the equilibrium price is 23.334."
