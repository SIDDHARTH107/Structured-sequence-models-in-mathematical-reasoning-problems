    "message_2": "The order of a group is the number of its elements. In this case, we are looking for non-abelian groups of order 96. To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 96: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Find all possible combinations of these prime factors: (2^5, 3^1), (2^4, 2, 3), (2^3, 2^2, 3), (2^2, 2^3, 3), (2, 2^4, 3)\n3. For each combination, determine the number of non-abelian groups using the formula: (n_1 - 1) * (n_2 - 1) * ... * (n_k - 1), where n_i is the number of groups of order p_i^k_i.\n\n(2^5, 3^1): (6 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 5\n(2^4, 2, 3): (5 - 1) * (1 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 0\n(2^3, 2^2, 3): (4 - 1) * (3 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 6\n(2^2, 2^3, 3): (3 - 1) * (4 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 6\n(2, 2^4, 3): (1 - 1) * (5 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 0\n\nThe total number of non-abelian groups of order 96 is 5 + 0 + 6 + 6 + 0 = 17.\n\nHowever, listing all 17 non-abelian groups is a complex task and requires a deep understanding of group theory. It is beyond the scope of this platform to provide a complete list of these groups."
