    "message_1": "In a game of Battle of the Sexes, a husband and wife simultaneously choose between going to a basketball game or a opera. If they both choose the same event, they are both happier than if they choose different events. The wife's preference is (basketball, opera) = (2,1) and the husband's preference is (basketball, opera) = (1,2). If they both randomly choose an event, what is the expected payoff for the wife?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected payoff for the wife, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities. There are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both choose basketball (probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n2. Both choose opera (probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n3. Wife chooses basketball, husband chooses opera (probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n4. Wife chooses opera, husband chooses basketball (probability = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nNow, we calculate the expected payoff for each outcome:\n\n1. Both choose basketball: wife's payoff = 2\n2. Both choose opera: wife's payoff = 1\n3. Wife chooses basketball, husband chooses opera: wife's payoff = 0 (since they chose different events)\n4. Wife chooses opera, husband chooses basketball: wife's payoff = 0 (since they chose different events)\n\nFinally, we calculate the expected payoff for the wife by multiplying the payoff of each outcome by its probability and summing them up:\n\nExpected payoff = (1/4 * 2) + (1/4 * 1) + (1/4 * 0) + (1/4 * 0) = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSo, the expected payoff for the wife is 3/4."
