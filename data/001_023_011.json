    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(3x) = 1/2 for x in the interval 0 ≤ x < 2π, we first find the angles for which the cosine is 1/2.\n\nThe angles are π/3 and 5π/3, since cos(π/3) = 1/2 and cos(5π/3) = 1/2.\n\nNow, we set 3x equal to these angles:\n\n3x = π/3\nx = (π/3) / 3\nx = π/9\n\nand\n\n3x = 5π/3\nx = (5π/3) / 3\nx = 5π/9\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval 0 ≤ x < 2π are x = π/9 and x = 5π/9."
