    "message_2": "A simple graph is a graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. To determine if G is a simple graph, we can use the Havel-Hakimi theorem, which states that a degree sequence is graphical (i.e., it can be realized by a simple graph) if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first vertex's degree and subtracting 1 from the next d1 degrees is graphical, where d1 is the degree of the first vertex.\n\nGiven degree sequence: {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}\n\n1. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order:\n{4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2}\n\n2. Remove the first vertex's degree (4) and subtract 1 from the next 4 degrees:\n{3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2}\n\n3. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order:\n{3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1}\n\n4. Remove the first vertex's degree (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 degrees:\n{1, 1, 1, 2, 1}\n\n5. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order:\n{2, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n\n6. Remove the first vertex's degree (2) and subtract 1 from the next 2 degrees:\n{0, 0, 1, 1}\n\n7. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order:\n{1, 1, 0, 0}\n\n8. Remove the first vertex's degree (1) and subtract 1 from the next 1 degree:\n{0, 0, 0}\n\nSince we have reached a sequence of all zeros, the original degree sequence is graphical, and G can be a simple graph."
