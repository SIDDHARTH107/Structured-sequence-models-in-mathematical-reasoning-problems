    "message_2": "To find A x (B ∩ {a}), we first need to find the intersection of B and {a}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of B and {a} is {a} since 'a' is the only element common to both sets.\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product A x {a}. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nSo, A x {a} = {(1, a), (2, a)}\n\nTherefore, A x (B ∩ {a}) = {(1, a), (2, a)}."
