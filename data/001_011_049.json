    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation (3x-2)/(2x+3) = 1/4, we will first cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n(3x - 2) * 4 = (2x + 3) * 1\n\nNow, distribute the 4 and simplify the equation:\n\n12x - 8 = 2x + 3\n\nNext, subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:\n\n12x - 2x - 8 = 2x - 2x + 3\n\n10x - 8 = 3\n\nNow, add 8 to both sides of the equation:\n\n10x - 8 + 8 = 3 + 8\n\n10x = 11\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 10 to solve for x:\n\n10x / 10 = 11 / 10\n\nx = 11/10"
