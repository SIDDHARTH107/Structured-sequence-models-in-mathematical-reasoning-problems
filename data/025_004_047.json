To find the degree of this rational curve, we can expand the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial formula, then group together like terms based on their total degree. We have:\n\n$$(x^2+y^2)^3 = x^6 + 3x^4y^2 + 3x^2y^4 + y^6$$\n\nSo the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$x^6 + 3x^4y^2 + 3x^2y^4 + y^6 = x^2y^2$$\n\nThe maximum degree of the monomials on the left-hand side is 6, which is achieved by the terms $x^6$ and $y^6$. The degree of the monomial on the right-hand side is 3. Therefore, the degree of this rational curve is 6.",
