    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player A is given $10 to divide between themselves and Player B. They must offer a certain amount to Player B, who then decides whether to accept or reject the offer. If Player B accepts, both players keep their respective shares of the money. If Player B rejects, neither player gets any money. What offer should Player A make to maximize their share of the money if Player B's rejection threshold is $3?",
    "message_2": "Since Player B's rejection threshold is $3, Player A should offer Player B exactly $3. This is because if Player A offers any less than $3, Player B will reject the offer and neither player will receive any money. By offering $3, Player A maximizes their share of the money, which will be $7 ($10 - $3)."
