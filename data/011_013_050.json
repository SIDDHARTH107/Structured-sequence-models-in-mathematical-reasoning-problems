    "message_2": "First, let's count the number of vowels and consonants in the word \"COMBINATORICS\".\n\nVowels: O, I, A, O, I, I (6 vowels)\nConsonants: C, M, B, N, T, R, C, S (8 consonants)\n\nNow, let's arrange the consonants first, ensuring that no two consonants are adjacent. We can do this by placing the consonants in the gaps between the vowels. Since there are 6 vowels, there are 7 gaps (including the beginning and end of the word) where we can place the consonants.\n\nWe can place the 8 consonants in these 7 gaps by selecting 7 out of the 8 consonants and arranging them in the gaps. This can be done in C(8,7) * 7! ways, where C(8,7) is the number of combinations of choosing 7 consonants out of 8.\n\nHowever, we have two C's among the consonants, so we need to divide by 2! to account for the repetition.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the consonants is (C(8,7) * 7!) / 2! = (8 * 7!) / 2 = 4 * 7! = 20,160.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vowels. Since there are 6 vowels with 3 I's, we need to divide by 3! to account for the repetition.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the vowels is 6! / 3! = 720 / 6 = 120.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the consonants and the vowels to get the total number of arrangements:\n\n20,160 * 120 = 2,419,200.\n\nSo, there are 2,419,200 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"COMBINATORICS\" such that no two consonants are adjacent."
