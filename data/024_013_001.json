    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the metric for a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, we first need to express the metric in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the metric tensor for a sphere can be written as:\n\nds^2 = dr^2 + r^2(dθ^2 + sin^2(θ)dφ^2)\n\nwhere r is the radial distance from the origin, θ is the polar angle (0 ≤ θ ≤ π), and φ is the azimuthal angle (0 ≤ φ < 2π).\n\nNow, we need to find the volume form of this metric. The volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by the differential volume element in spherical coordinates:\n\ndV = √(g) dr ∧ dθ ∧ dφ\n\nwhere g is the determinant of the metric tensor and ∧ denotes the wedge product.\n\nThe metric tensor for the given metric in spherical coordinates is:\n\ng = | 1    0           0          |\n    | 0    r^2         0          |\n    | 0    0     r^2*sin^2(θ) |\n\nThe determinant of g is:\n\ng = 1 * r^2 * r^2*sin^2(θ) = r^4*sin^2(θ)\n\nNow, we can find the volume form:\n\ndV = √(g) dr ∧ dθ ∧ dφ = √(r^4*sin^2(θ)) dr ∧ dθ ∧ dφ = r^2*sin(θ) dr ∧ dθ ∧ dφ\n\nSince we are considering a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, we have r = 5. Therefore, the volume form of the metric for this sphere is:\n\ndV = 5^2*sin(θ) dr ∧ dθ ∧ dφ = 25*sin(θ) dr ∧ dθ ∧ dφ"
