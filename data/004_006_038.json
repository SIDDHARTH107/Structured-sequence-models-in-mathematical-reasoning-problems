    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative, f'(x).\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nStep 2: Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first simplify it by dividing all terms by 3:\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n0 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nFrom this factored form, we can find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nStep 3: Use the first derivative test to determine the nature of the critical points.\nWe need to analyze the sign of the first derivative, f'(x), in the intervals around the critical points.\n\nInterval 1: x < 1\nChoose a test point, say x = 0.\nf'(0) = 3(0)^2 - 12(0) + 9 = 9 > 0\nSince f'(x) is positive in this interval, the function is increasing.\n\nInterval 2: 1 < x < 3\nChoose a test point, say x = 2.\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 9 = -3 < 0\nSince f'(x) is negative in this interval, the function is decreasing.\n\nInterval 3: x > 3\nChoose a test point, say x = 4.\nf'(4) = 3(4)^2 - 12(4) + 9 = 9 > 0\nSince f'(x) is positive in this interval, the function is increasing.\n\nFrom the first derivative test, we can conclude that:\n- At x = 1, the function changes from increasing to decreasing, so there is a local maximum at x = 1.\n- At x = 3, the function changes from decreasing to increasing, so there is a local minimum at x = 3.\n\nThus, the critical points are a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 3."
