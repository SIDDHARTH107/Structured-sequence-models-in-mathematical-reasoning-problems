    "message_2": "To find the second letter of the key, we need to decrypt the second letter of the encrypted message using the Vigenere cipher decryption method. The Vigenere cipher decryption formula is:\n\nP = (C - K) mod 26\n\nwhere P is the plaintext letter, C is the ciphertext letter, and K is the key letter. All letters are represented by their position in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n\nThe second letter of the encrypted message is \"H\". Since the first letter of the key is 'A', which corresponds to 0, we can decrypt the second letter as follows:\n\nP = (C - K) mod 26\nP = (7 - 0) mod 26\nP = 7\n\nThe plaintext letter corresponding to 7 is \"H\". Therefore, the second letter of the key is \"H\"."
