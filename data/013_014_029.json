    "message_1": "A charity organization wants to collect donations from three donors. Each donor has a maximum budget of $100, and the charity wants to maximize the total amount of donations it receives. The charity can offer each donor a different prize from a set of 5 prizes, with each prize having a different cost. The cost of the prizes are:\n\nPrize 1: $50\nPrize 2: $75\nPrize 3: $100\nPrize 4: $125\nPrize 5: $150\n\nThe charity hires a mechanism designer to design a mechanism for allocating prizes to donors. The mechanism designer proposes that each donor should submit a sealed bid with the amount they are willing to donate and the prize they would like to receive. The charity will then allocate the prizes in such a way that the total amount of donations is maximized.\n\nIf the three donors submit the following bids:\n\nDonor 1: $75 for prize 2\nDonor 2: $100 for prize 3\nDonor 3: $50 for prize 1\n\nWhich prize should each donor receive, and how much will the charity collect in donations?",

In this case:\n\nDonor 1 should receive Prize 2, as they are willing to donate $75 for it.\nDonor 2 should receive Prize 3, as they are willing to donate $100 for it.\nDonor 3 should receive Prize 1, as they are willing to donate $50 for it.\n\nThe total amount the charity will collect in donations is $75 (from Donor 1) + $100 (from Donor 2) + $50 (from Donor 3) = $225."
