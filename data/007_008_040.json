    "message_1": "Let's say the student has learned about Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is any positive integer that is not divisible by p, then a raised to the power of p minus a is always divisible by p. Now, here's a question that a student can solve:\n\nIf p = 7 and a = 3, find the remainder when 3 raised to the power of 7 is divided by 7.",
    "message_2": "Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that if p = 7 (a prime number) and a = 3 (not divisible by 7), then 3^(7-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7). In other words, 3^6 is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 3^7 is divided by 7. We can rewrite 3^7 as (3^6) * 3. Since we know that 3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can substitute this into our expression:\n\n(1) * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 3 raised to the power of 7 is divided by 7 is 3."
