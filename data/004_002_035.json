    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to simplify the function.\n\nWe notice that the numerator (x^2 - 4) can be factored as a difference of squares:\n\nx^2 - 4 = (x + 2)(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = ((x + 2)(x - 2)) / (x - 2)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 2) terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = x + 2\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 2 is 4."
