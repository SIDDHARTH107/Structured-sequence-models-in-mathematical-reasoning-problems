    "message_1": "A rectangular metal plate of dimension 2m x 1m is heated to an initial temperature of 50°C. If the edges of the plate are well-insulated and the initial temperature at the edges is 0°C, find the temperature distribution inside the plate after a time interval of 30 seconds. Also, determine the maximum temperature inside the plate. Use Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the two-dimensional heat equation with insulated boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α(∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal plate.\n\nThe initial condition is T(x, y, 0) = 50°C for 0 < x < 2m and 0 < y < 1m, and the boundary conditions are:\n\n∂T(0, y, t) / ∂x = ∂T(2, y, t) / ∂x = ∂T(x, 0, t) / ∂y = ∂T(x, 1, t) / ∂y = 0\n\nTo solve this problem using Fourier transform, we will first separate the variables by assuming that the solution has the form:\n\nT(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation and dividing by X(x)Y(y)T(t), we get:\n\n(1/T)∂T/∂t = α[(1/X)∂²X/∂x² + (1/Y)∂²Y/∂y²]\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². This gives us three ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1/T)∂T/∂t = -αλ²\n(1/X)∂²X/∂x² = -λ²\n(1/Y)∂²Y/∂y² = -λ²\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nT(t) = e^(-αλ²t)\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\nY(y) = C*cos(λy) + D*sin(λy)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we find that B = D = 0 and λ_x = nπ/2 and λ_y = mπ, where n and m are integers. Therefore, the solution has the form:\n\nT(x, y, t) = ∑(n=1,3,5,...) ∑(m=1,2,3,...) A_nm * cos(nπx/2) * cos(mπy) * e^(-α(n²π²/4 + m²π²)t)\n\nTo find the coefficients A_nm, we use the initial condition T(x, y, 0) = 50°C:\n\n50 = ∑(n=1,3,5,...) ∑(m=1,2,3,...) A_nm * cos(nπx/2) * cos(mπy)\n\nWe can find A_nm by multiplying both sides by cos(n'πx/2) * cos(m'πy) and integrating over the domain 0 < x < 2 and 0 < y < 1:\n\nA_nm = (16/((nπ)(mπ))) * ∫(x=0 to 2) ∫(y=0 to 1) 50 * cos(nπx/2) * cos(mπy) dx dy\n\nCalculating the integrals, we get:\n\nA_nm = (800/((n²)(m²)(π²))) * (1 - (-1)^n) * (1 - (-1)^m)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution inside the plate after 30 seconds:\n\nT(x, y, 30) = ∑(n=1,3,5,...) ∑(m=1,2,3,...) (800/((n²)(m²)(π²))) * (1 - (-1)^n) * (1 - (-1)^m) * cos(nπx/2) * cos(mπy) * e^(-α(n²π²/4 + m²π²)30)\n\nTo find the maximum temperature, we can look for the maximum value of T(x, y, 30) in the domain 0 < x < 2 and 0 < y < 1. Since the exponential term e^(-α(n²π²/4 + m²π²)30) is always less than 1, the maximum temperature will be less than the initial temperature of 50°C. The exact value of the maximum temperature depends on the thermal diffusivity α of the metal plate."
