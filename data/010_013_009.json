    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of the total space $E$ of the vector bundle, we will use the Gysin sequence, which relates the cohomology of the base space $M$, the total space $E$, and the fiber $F$. The Gysin sequence is given by:\n\n$$\n\\cdots \\to H^i(M) \\xrightarrow{\\pi^*} H^i(E) \\xrightarrow{\\cup e} H^{i+n}(E) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_*} H^{i+n}(M) \\to \\cdots\n$$\n\nHere, $\\pi^*$ is the pullback map induced by the projection $\\pi: E \\to M$, $\\cup e$ is the cup product with the Euler class $e$ of the vector bundle, and $\\pi_*$ is the pushforward map.\n\nNow, we want to compute the Euler characteristic of $E$, which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\chi(E) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(E)\n$$\n\nUsing the Gysin sequence, we can relate the dimensions of the cohomology groups of $E$ and $M$. Since $M$ is compact, its cohomology groups are finite-dimensional, and the Euler characteristic of $M$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\chi(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(M) = m\n$$\n\nNow, we will analyze the Gysin sequence term by term. Notice that the map $\\cup e: H^i(E) \\to H^{i+n}(E)$ is an isomorphism for $0 \\leq i \\leq k-n$, where $k$ is the rank of the vector bundle. This is because the Euler class $e$ is non-zero, and the cup product with a non-zero cohomology class is an isomorphism.\n\nFor $i > k-n$, the map $\\pi^*: H^i(M) \\to H^i(E)$ is an isomorphism. This is because the cohomology groups of $M$ vanish for $i > k$, and the cohomology groups of $E$ vanish for $i > k+n$.\n\nUsing these isomorphisms, we can compute the Euler characteristic of $E$:\n\n$$\n\\chi(E) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-n} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(M) + \\sum_{i=k-n+1}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(M) = m + (-1)^{k-n+1} m\n$$\n\nSince the dimension of the fiber $F$ is $n$, we have $k-n+1 = n+1$. Therefore, the Euler characteristic of the total space $E$ is:\n\n$$\n\\chi(E) = m + (-1)^{n+1} m = \\begin{cases}\n2m & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd}\n\\end{cases}\n$$"
