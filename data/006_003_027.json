    "message_2": "To find the probability of drawing exactly two aces from a standard deck of 52 cards in a 5-card hand, we can use the formula for combinations and the concept of probability.\n\nThere are 4 aces in a standard deck of 52 cards. We want to choose 2 of these aces, which can be done in C(4,2) ways. C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. The formula for C(n,k) is:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the number of ways to choose 2 aces from 4:\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6\n\nNow, we need to choose the remaining 3 cards from the 48 non-ace cards (52 cards - 4 aces). This can be done in C(48,3) ways:\n\nC(48,3) = 48! / (3!(48-3)!) = 17,296\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose a 5-card hand from a deck of 52 cards, we use C(52,5):\n\nC(52,5) = 52! / (5!(52-5)!) = 2,598,960\n\nNow, we can find the probability of drawing exactly two aces by dividing the number of successful outcomes (choosing 2 aces and 3 non-aces) by the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 5-card hand):\n\nProbability = (C(4,2) * C(48,3)) / C(52,5) = (6 * 17,296) / 2,598,960 â‰ˆ 0.03993\n\nSo, the probability of drawing exactly two aces from a standard deck of 52 cards in a 5-card hand is approximately 0.03993 or 3.993%."
