    "message_2": "To find the current through the RLC circuit, we first need to find the impedance (Z) of the circuit. The impedance of an RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance. \n\nFirst, let's find the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC):\n\nXL = 2πfL\nXC = 1 / (2πfC)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven values:\nf = 50 Hz\nL = 2 H\nC = 0.0001 F\n\nNow, let's calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2π(50)(2) = 628.32 ohms\nXC = 1 / (2π(50)(0.0001)) = 31.83 ohms\n\nNow, we can find the impedance (Z):\n\nZ = √((10^2) + (628.32 - 31.83)^2) = √(100 + 596.49^2) = √(356,105.24) = 596.74 ohms\n\nFinally, we can find the current (I) using Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V / Z\n\nwhere V is the voltage.\n\nGiven value:\nV = 120 V\n\nNow, let's calculate the current:\n\nI = 120 / 596.74 = 0.201 A\n\nSo, the current through the RLC circuit is approximately 0.201 A."
