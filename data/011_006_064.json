    "message_1": "A box contains 6 red balls, 4 green balls, and 5 blue balls. If you randomly select 7 balls from the box, what is the probability that exactly 3 will be red, 2 will be green, and 2 will be blue? Use generating function to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to find the generating functions for each color of balls. \n\nLet R(x) be the generating function for red balls, G(x) for green balls, and B(x) for blue balls. Since there are 6 red balls, 4 green balls, and 5 blue balls, the generating functions are:\n\nR(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6\nG(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4\nB(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^7 in the product R(x^3)G(x^2)B(x^2), which represents the probability of selecting exactly 3 red balls, 2 green balls, and 2 blue balls.\n\nR(x^3) = x^0 + x^3 + x^6 + x^9 + x^12 + x^15 + x^18\nG(x^2) = x^0 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8\nB(x^2) = x^0 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8 + x^10\n\nNow, we multiply these generating functions:\n\nR(x^3)G(x^2)B(x^2) = (x^0 + x^3 + x^6 + x^9 + x^12 + x^15 + x^18)(x^0 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8)(x^0 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8 + x^10)\n\nTo find the coefficient of x^7, we can look for the terms that multiply to x^7:\n\nx^3 * x^2 * x^2 = x^7\n\nThere's only one way to get x^7 from the product of these generating functions. Now, we need to find the number of ways to select 7 balls from the total of 15 balls:\n\nC(15, 7) = 15! / (7! * (15 - 7)!) = 6435\n\nSo, the probability of selecting exactly 3 red balls, 2 green balls, and 2 blue balls is:\n\nP(3 red, 2 green, 2 blue) = (Number of ways to get x^7) / C(15, 7) = 1 / 6435\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/6435."
