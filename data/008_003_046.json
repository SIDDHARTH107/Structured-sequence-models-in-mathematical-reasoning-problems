    "message_1": "Sure, here's a sample question for a math student to solve:\n\nGiven the matrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & -3 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\nDetermine the rank of A by reducing it to row echelon form.",
    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to reduce it to its row echelon form. Here are the steps to do that:\n\n1. Swap rows if necessary to make sure the first row has a non-zero element in the first column. In this case, the first row is already fine.\n\n2. Perform row operations to make all elements below the first element in the first column equal to zero. We can do this by adding 2 times the first row to the second row, and subtracting 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\nR2 = R2 + 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n3. Now, move to the second column and make sure there's a non-zero element in the second row. In this case, it's already there.\n\n4. Perform row operations to make all elements below the second element in the second column equal to zero. We can do this by adding the second row to the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 + R2\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form. In this case, there are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 2."
