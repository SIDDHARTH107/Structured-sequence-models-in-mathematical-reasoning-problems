    "message_1": "Sorry, but Deontic logic is not really about numerical problems or calculations. Instead, it deals with the logic of norms, obligations, permissions, etc. \n\nHowever, here's a possible question based on deontic logic that a math student could try to solve: \n\nLet S be the set of all integers from 1 to 100. Let P(x) be the proposition \"x is a prime number\", and let O(x) be the proposition \"x is odd\". \n\n(a) Write down the negation of the proposition \"For every x in S, if P(x) then O(x)\". \n(b) Write down the contrapositive of the proposition \"For every x in S, if P(x) then O(x)\". \n(c) Are the original proposition and its contrapositive logically equivalent? If yes, prove it; if not, give a counterexample.",
    "message_2": "(a) The negation of the proposition \"For every x in S, if P(x) then O(x)\" can be written as \"There exists an x in S such that P(x) and not O(x)\".\n\n(b) The contrapositive of the proposition \"For every x in S, if P(x) then O(x)\" can be written as \"For every x in S, if not O(x) then not P(x)\".\n\n(c) Yes, the original proposition and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nProof:\n\nLet's consider the original proposition \"For every x in S, if P(x) then O(x)\". This means that if x is a prime number, then x must be odd. We know that all prime numbers, except for 2, are odd because they cannot be divisible by 2. Since 2 is the only even prime number, the proposition holds for all other prime numbers in the set S.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive \"For every x in S, if not O(x) then not P(x)\". This means that if x is not odd (i.e., x is even), then x cannot be a prime number. As mentioned earlier, all prime numbers except for 2 are odd. So, if a number is even and not equal to 2, it cannot be a prime number. Thus, the contrapositive also holds for all numbers in the set S.\n\nSince both the original proposition and its contrapositive hold for all numbers in the set S, they are logically equivalent."
