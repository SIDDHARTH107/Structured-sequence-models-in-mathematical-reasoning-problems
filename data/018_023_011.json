    "message_2": "First, let's compute the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's compute the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and C, denoted as (A △ B) × C. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, c) where a is in A △ B and c is in C.\n\n(A △ B) × C = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nNext, let's compute the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B × C:\n\nB × C = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compute the symmetric difference of A and (B × C), denoted as A △ (B × C). \n\nA △ (B × C) = (A ∪ (B × C)) - (A ∩ (B × C))\n\nA △ (B × C) = ({1, 2} ∪ {(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}) - ({1, 2} ∩ {(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)})\n\nA △ (B × C) = ({1, 2, (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}) - {}\n\nA △ (B × C) = {1, 2, (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, we can see that (A △ B) × C ≠ A △ (B × C) since:\n\n(A △ B) × C = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nA △ (B × C) = {1, 2, (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
