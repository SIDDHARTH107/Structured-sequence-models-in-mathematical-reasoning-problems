    "message_1": "In an English auction, there are three bidders with valuations of $100, $80, and $60 for an item. The auction begins at $20, and the bidding increments are $5. Assuming all bidders bid truthfully, who wins the auction and what is the final price?",
    "message_2": "In an English auction, the highest bidder wins the auction. In this case, the bidder with a valuation of $100 is the highest bidder. The bidding will continue in increments of $5 until the second-highest bidder, with a valuation of $80, drops out. Therefore, the final price will be $80 + $5 = $85. The bidder with a valuation of $100 wins the auction at a final price of $85."
