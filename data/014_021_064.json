    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with the given encryption matrix, we first need to convert the letters to their numerical equivalents (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). \n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nNext, we need to arrange the numerical equivalents into a matrix and multiply it with the given encryption matrix. Since the encryption matrix is 2x2, we will arrange the plaintext into a 2x2 matrix as well:\n\nPlaintext matrix:\n[12 19]\n[ 0  7]\n\nNow, we multiply the encryption matrix with the plaintext matrix:\n\n[5 6]   [12 19]   [(5*12 + 6*0)  (5*19 + 6*7)]\n[7 8] * [ 0  7] = [(7*12 + 8*0)  (7*19 + 8*7)]\n\nPerform the calculations:\n\n[60  67]\n[84 189]\n\nSince we are working with a 26-letter alphabet, we need to take the result modulo 26:\n\n[ 8 15]\n[ 6  1]\n\nNow, we convert the numerical values back to letters:\n\nI = 8\nP = 15\nG = 6\nB = 1\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext for the plaintext \"MATH\" is \"IPGB\"."
