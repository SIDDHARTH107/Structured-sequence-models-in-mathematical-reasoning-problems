    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring in two variables $R = \\mathbb{C}\\langle x,y\\rangle$ with the relation $xy-yx=1$. Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$ generated by $x^2+1$ and $y^2+1$.\n\nWhat is the Hilbert series of the quotient ring $R/I$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the Hilbert series of the quotient ring $R/I$, we first need to find a basis for the quotient as a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$. Since $I$ is generated by $x^2 + 1$ and $y^2 + 1$, we have the following relations in $R/I$:\n\n1. $x^2 = -1$\n2. $y^2 = -1$\n\nUsing these relations, we can rewrite any monomial in $R/I$ in terms of a basis. Notice that any monomial in $R/I$ can be written as $x^i y^j$ for some non-negative integers $i$ and $j$. Using the relations above, we can rewrite any monomial with $i \\geq 2$ or $j \\geq 2$ as a linear combination of monomials with smaller exponents. For example, $x^3 = x(x^2) = -x$ and $y^3 = y(y^2) = -y$. \n\nThus, a basis for $R/I$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$ consists of the monomials $1, x, y, xy$. This means that the Hilbert series of $R/I$ is given by the generating function:\n\n$H_{R/I}(t) = 1 + t + t + t^2 = 1 + 2t + t^2$\n\nSo, the Hilbert series of the quotient ring $R/I$ is $1 + 2t + t^2$."
