    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x, which represents the slope of the curve at any point x.\n\nThe given equation is y = x² + 3x - 1.\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx) is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at x = 2. Plug x = 2 into the derivative equation:\n\ndy/dx = 2(2) + 3\n\ndy/dx = 4 + 3\n\ndy/dx = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = 2 is 7."
