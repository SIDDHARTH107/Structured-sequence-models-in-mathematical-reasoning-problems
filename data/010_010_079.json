    "message_1": "Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function defined by $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$. Determine the total number of critical points of $f$ and classify them as non-degenerate maximums, non-degenerate minimums or saddle points.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)$.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy$.\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$\\begin{cases}\n3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\\\\n-6xy = 0\n\\end{cases}$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\n1. $x = 0$: In this case, the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, we have the critical point $(0,0)$.\n\n2. $y = 0$: In this case, the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. But this case leads to the same critical point $(0,0)$ as in the first case.\n\nThus, there is only one critical point $(0,0)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify this critical point. To do this, we will use the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives:\n\n$H(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nComputing the second-order partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -6y$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = -6y$, and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -6x$.\n\nSo, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we will evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical point $(0,0)$:\n\n$H(0,0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince the Hessian matrix is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) at the critical point, we cannot use the standard classification method for Morse functions. However, we can still analyze the behavior of the function around the critical point.\n\nConsider the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$. For $x > 0$ and $y = 0$, $f(x,0) = x^3 > 0$. For $x < 0$ and $y = 0$, $f(x,0) = x^3 < 0$. This means that the function changes sign as we move along the $x$-axis, which indicates that the critical point $(0,0)$ is a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one critical point $(0,0)$, and it is a saddle point."
