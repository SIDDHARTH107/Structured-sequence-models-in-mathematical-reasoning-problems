The data set has a median of 45 weeks and a mean of 50 weeks with a standard deviation of 15 weeks. Calculate the percentage of patients who survived for more than 60 weeks.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage of patients who survived for more than 60 weeks, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere z is the z-score, X is the data point (in this case, 60 weeks), μ is the mean (50 weeks), and σ is the standard deviation (15 weeks).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-score for 60 weeks:\n\nz = (60 - 50) / 15\nz = 10 / 15\nz = 0.67\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the area to the left of the z-score (0.67). This area represents the percentage of patients who survived for 60 weeks or less. The area to the left of z = 0.67 is approximately 0.7486, or 74.86%.\n\nSince we want to find the percentage of patients who survived for more than 60 weeks, we need to subtract this value from 100%:\n\nPercentage of patients who survived more than 60 weeks = 100% - 74.86% = 25.14%\n\nTherefore, approximately 25.14% of the patients survived for more than 60 weeks."
