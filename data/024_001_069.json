    "message_1": "A space curve is defined by the vector function r(t) = (3t^(2), 3t+2, t^(3)-4t). Find the curvature and torsion of the curve at t=1.",
    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector function r(t).\n\nr(t) = (3t^2, 3t+2, t^3-4t)\n\nFirst derivative:\nr'(t) = (6t, 3, 3t^2-4)\n\nSecond derivative:\nr''(t) = (6, 0, 6t)\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t). The tangent vector T(t) is the unit tangent vector, which is the normalized first derivative of r(t).\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t=1:\nr'(1) = (6, 3, -1)\n||r'(1)|| = sqrt(6^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(46)\n\nT(1) = (6/sqrt(46), 3/sqrt(46), -1/sqrt(46))\n\nNow, we find the derivative of T(t) with respect to t.\n\nT'(t) = (6/sqrt(46), 0, 6t/sqrt(46))\n\nAt t=1:\nT'(1) = (6/sqrt(46), 0, 6/sqrt(46))\n\nNow, we can find the curvature, κ(t), at t=1.\n\nκ(t) = ||T'(t)||\n\nκ(1) = ||(6/sqrt(46), 0, 6/sqrt(46))|| = sqrt((6/sqrt(46))^2 + (6/sqrt(46))^2) = 6*sqrt(2)/sqrt(46) = 6*sqrt(2)/sqrt(46) * sqrt(46)/sqrt(46) = 6*sqrt(92)/46 = 3*sqrt(2)/23\n\nNow, let's find the torsion, τ(t), at t=1. We need to find the binormal vector B(t) and its derivative B'(t). The binormal vector B(t) is the cross product of T(t) and the normal vector N(t).\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t=1:\nN(1) = (6/sqrt(46), 0, 6/sqrt(46)) / (6*sqrt(2)/23) = (sqrt(2)/23, 0, sqrt(2)/23)\n\nNow, we find the binormal vector B(t) = T(t) x N(t).\n\nAt t=1:\nB(1) = (6/sqrt(46), 3/sqrt(46), -1/sqrt(46)) x (sqrt(2)/23, 0, sqrt(2)/23) = (3*sqrt(2)/23, -2*sqrt(2)/23, 6*sqrt(2)/23)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of B(t) with respect to t.\n\nB'(t) = (0, -2*sqrt(2)/23, 6*sqrt(2)/23)\n\nAt t=1:\nB'(1) = (0, -2*sqrt(2)/23, 6*sqrt(2)/23)\n\nFinally, we find the torsion, τ(t), at t=1.\n\nτ(t) = -<B'(t), N(t)>\n\nτ(1) = -<(0, -2*sqrt(2)/23, 6*sqrt(2)/23), (sqrt(2)/23, 0, sqrt(2)/23)> = -(-2*sqrt(2)/23 * sqrt(2)/23 + 6*sqrt(2)/23 * sqrt(2)/23) = -(-2/23 + 12/23) = -10/23\n\nSo, the curvature at t=1 is κ(1) = 3*sqrt(2)/23, and the torsion at t=1 is τ(1) = -10/23."
