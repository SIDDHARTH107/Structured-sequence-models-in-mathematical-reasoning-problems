Let n be a positive integer. Find the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $I^n(X,Y)$ of X with respect to Y.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $I^n(X,Y)$, we can use the Goresky-MacPherson formula, which relates the intersection cohomology of a pair (X, Y) to the ordinary cohomology of X and Y.\n\nThe Goresky-MacPherson formula states that:\n\n$I^n(X,Y) = \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H^p(X, R^q i_* \\mathbb{C}_Y)$\n\nwhere $i: Y \\hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion map, $R^q i_* \\mathbb{C}_Y$ is the $q$-th derived pushforward of the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{C}_Y$ on Y, and $H^p(X, -)$ denotes the $p$-th cohomology group with coefficients in a sheaf.\n\nNow, since Y is a smooth, closed subvariety of X, we have the following isomorphism:\n\n$R^q i_* \\mathbb{C}_Y \\cong \\mathbb{C}_Y[-2q]$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{C}_Y[-2q]$ denotes the shift of the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{C}_Y$ by $-2q$. This isomorphism follows from the fact that the derived pushforward of a smooth, closed subvariety is given by the shifted constant sheaf.\n\nUsing this isomorphism, we can rewrite the Goresky-MacPherson formula as:\n\n$I^n(X,Y) = \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H^p(X, \\mathbb{C}_Y[-2q])$\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group by computing the dimensions of the individual cohomology groups in the direct sum:\n\n$\\dim I^n(X,Y) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H^p(X, \\mathbb{C}_Y[-2q])$\n\nSince the cohomology of X with coefficients in the shifted constant sheaf $\\mathbb{C}_Y[-2q]$ is concentrated in degree $p = 2q$, the sum reduces to:\n\n$\\dim I^n(X,Y) = \\dim H^n(X, \\mathbb{C}_Y)$\n\nThus, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $I^n(X,Y)$ is equal to the dimension of the $n$-th cohomology group of X with coefficients in the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{C}_Y$."
