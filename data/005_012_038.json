    "message_2": "In simple random sampling, each student has an equal chance of being selected. To find the probability of any particular student being selected, you can divide the number of students you want to select (50) by the total number of students (500).\n\nProbability = (Number of students to be selected) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 50 / 500\n\nThe probability that any particular student will be selected is 0.1 or 10%."
