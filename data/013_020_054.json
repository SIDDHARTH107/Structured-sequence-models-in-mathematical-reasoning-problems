    "message_1": "In a beauty contest, there are 100 participants. Each participant is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the beauty contest is the person whose chosen number is closest to 2/3 of the average number chosen by all participants. If multiple participants are equidistant from this value, then the winner is chosen randomly among those participants. What number should a participant choose in order to have a maximum chance of winning the beauty contest?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the chance of winning the beauty contest, a participant should try to choose a number that is as close as possible to 2/3 of the expected average number chosen by all participants. \n\nAssuming that all participants choose their numbers randomly and uniformly between 0 and 100, the expected average number chosen by all participants would be the midpoint of the range, which is 50. \n\nNow, to find the number closest to 2/3 of the expected average, we can calculate:\n\n(2/3) * 50 = 100/3 â‰ˆ 33.33\n\nTherefore, a participant should choose the number 33 to have the maximum chance of winning the beauty contest. However, it's important to note that this strategy assumes that all other participants are choosing their numbers randomly and uniformly. If other participants are also trying to maximize their chances of winning, they might also choose numbers around 33, which could change the optimal strategy."
