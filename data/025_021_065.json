    "message_2": "The degree of a hypersurface in projective space is determined by the highest degree of the monomials in the defining equation. In this case, the equation is:\n\nx^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0\n\nThe highest degree of the monomials is 4 (x^4, y^4, z^4, and w^4). Therefore, the degree of the hypersurface in the projective space P^3 over the complex numbers is 4."
