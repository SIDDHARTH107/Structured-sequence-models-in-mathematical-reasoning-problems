Apply the power iteration method to find the largest eigenvalue of A and its corresponding eigenvector, using an initial approximation of [1, 1]. Perform the iteration process until the relative error in the eigenvalue estimate is less than 0.01.",
    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. The algorithm starts with an initial approximation of the eigenvector, and iteratively multiplies it by the matrix until convergence is reached.\n\nLet's start with the given matrix A and initial approximation of the eigenvector x0:\n\nA = [[3, 1], [2, 2]]\nx0 = [1, 1]\n\nNow, we will perform the power iteration method until the relative error in the eigenvalue estimate is less than 0.01.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = A * x0 = [[3, 1], [2, 2]] * [1, 1] = [4, 4]\nλ1 = x1 / x0 = [4/1, 4/1] = [4, 4] (element-wise division)\nλ1 = 4 (take the average)\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = A * x1 = [[3, 1], [2, 2]] * [4, 4] = [16, 16]\nλ2 = x2 / x1 = [16/4, 16/4] = [4, 4]\nλ2 = 4\n\nThe eigenvalue estimate has not changed from iteration 1 to iteration 2, so the relative error is 0, which is less than 0.01. Therefore, we can stop the iteration process.\n\nThe largest eigenvalue of A is λ = 4, and its corresponding eigenvector is x = [1, 1] (normalized)."
