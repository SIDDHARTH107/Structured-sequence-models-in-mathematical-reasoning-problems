    "message_2": "A regular tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four equilateral triangle faces. \n\nVertices: Since each vertex is shared by three faces, there are a total of 4 vertices in a regular tetrahedron.\n\nEdges: Each edge is shared by two faces, and since there are 4 faces and each face has 3 edges, there are a total of (4 * 3) / 2 = 6 edges in a regular tetrahedron.\n\nFaces: A regular tetrahedron has 4 equilateral triangle faces.\n\nSo, in the triangulation of a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2 units, there are 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces."
