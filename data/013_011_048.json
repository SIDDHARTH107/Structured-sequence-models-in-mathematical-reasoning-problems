    "message_1": "Assume that two gas stations are located on opposite sides of a highway, and they both sell gasoline at a fixed price. The stations are Bertrand competitors, meaning they independently set their prices and attempt to capture as much market share as possible. If the stations have a marginal cost of $2.50 per gallon and a capacity to sell 10,000 gallons of gasoline, what price should each station set to maximize their profits? Assume that customers will always choose the station with the lower price if the prices are the same, and that there are infinitely many potential customers in the market.",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition with identical products and capacity, both firms will set their prices equal to their marginal costs to capture the entire market share. If either firm tries to set a price higher than their marginal cost, the other firm can slightly undercut them and capture the entire market. Therefore, in this scenario, both gas stations should set their prices at $2.50 per gallon to maximize their profits."
