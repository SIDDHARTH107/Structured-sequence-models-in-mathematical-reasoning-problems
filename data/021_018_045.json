    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit for product A and product B is $50 and $80, respectively. The company's production capacity is limited to 600 units per day, and it must produce a minimum of 150 units of product A every day. The company wants to determine the number of units of each product it should produce every day to maximize profit. Use tabu search algorithm to solve the optimization problem and determine the maximum profit that the company can earn per day.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It uses a local search procedure with a memory structure called the \"tabu list\" to avoid cycling and explore the solution space more efficiently. However, implementing the tabu search algorithm in this text-based format is not feasible. Instead, I will solve the problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced per day. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 80y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 600 (production capacity constraint)\n2. x ≥ 150 (minimum production of product A constraint)\n3. x, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 600 is the equation of a straight line with slope -1 and y-intercept 600. All points below this line satisfy the constraint x + y ≤ 600.\n2. x = 150 is a vertical line. All points to the right of this line satisfy the constraint x ≥ 150.\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (150, 0), (150, 450), and (600, 0). We will now evaluate the objective function at these vertices to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. Profit at (150, 0): 50(150) + 80(0) = $7500\n2. Profit at (150, 450): 50(150) + 80(450) = $43500\n3. Profit at (600, 0): 50(600) + 80(0) = $30000\n\nThe maximum profit is $43,500 per day, which occurs when the company produces 150 units of product A and 450 units of product B."
