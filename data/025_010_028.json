If $d\\geq g-1$, then $h^0(C,L)=d-g+1$. \n\nNow, let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $3$, and let $L$ be a line bundle on $C$ such that $L^{\\otimes 2} \\cong K_C$, where $K_C$ is the canonical bundle of $C$. Find the dimension of the space of global sections of $L$.",
    "message_2": "Since $L^{\\otimes 2} \\cong K_C$, we have that $\\deg(L^{\\otimes 2}) = \\deg(K_C)$. Recall that for a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, the degree of the canonical bundle is given by $\\deg(K_C) = 2g-2$. In our case, $g=3$, so $\\deg(K_C) = 2(3)-2 = 4$.\n\nNow, we have that $\\deg(L^{\\otimes 2}) = 2\\deg(L)$. Therefore, $2\\deg(L) = 4$, which implies that $\\deg(L) = 2$. \n\nNow we can apply the formula for the dimension of the space of global sections of $L$:\n\n$$h^0(C,L) = \\mathrm{max}\\{0 , d-g+1\\}$$\n\nIn our case, $d = \\deg(L) = 2$ and $g = 3$. So we have:\n\n$$h^0(C,L) = \\mathrm{max}\\{0 , 2-3+1\\} = \\mathrm{max}\\{0, 0\\} = 0$$\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of global sections of $L$ is $0$."
