    "message_1": "Consider the following system of equations:\n\nx + y + z = 6 \n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 14 \n\n4x + 5y + 6z = 21 \n\nSolve the system using Gauss elimination method and determine if the system is ill-conditioned. If it is ill-conditioned, find its condition number.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2  3  4 | 14 ]\n[ 4  5  6 | 21 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  3 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  1 ]\n```\n\nAt this point, we can see that the system is inconsistent, as the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution to this system of equations.\n\nNow, let's determine if the system is ill-conditioned. A system is considered ill-conditioned if small changes in the coefficients or constants can lead to large changes in the solution. In this case, since the system has no solution, it is not considered ill-conditioned.\n\nAs a result, there is no need to calculate the condition number for this system, as it is not ill-conditioned."
