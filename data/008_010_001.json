    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its reduced row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  8 ]\n[ 2 -3  1 | -1 ]\n[ 3 -4  2 | 16 ]\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  8 ]\n[ 0 -7  3 | -17 ]\n[ 0 -10  5 | -8 ]\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\nR2 = R2 / -7\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  8 ]\n[ 0  1 -3/7 | 17/7 ]\n[ 0 -10  5 | -8 ]\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 + 10*R2\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  8 ]\n[ 0  1 -3/7 | 17/7 ]\n[ 0  0  5/7 | 54/7 ]\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 5/7 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 * 7/5\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  8 ]\n[ 0  1 -3/7 | 17/7 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 54/5 ]\n\nNow we have the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can now use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = 54/5\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny - (3/7)z = 17/7\ny = 17/7 + (3/7)(54/5)\ny = 17/7 + 162/35\ny = 289/35\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx + 2y - z = 8\nx = 8 - 2(289/35) + 54/5\nx = 8 - 578/35 + 270/35\nx = 142/35\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 142/35\ny = 289/35\nz = 54/5"
