    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 4 cm, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2π(4 cm)\nC = 8π cm\n\nApproximating π as 3.14, the circumference is:\n\nC ≈ 8(3.14) cm\nC ≈ 25.12 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the circle with a radius of 4 cm is approximately 25.12 cm."
