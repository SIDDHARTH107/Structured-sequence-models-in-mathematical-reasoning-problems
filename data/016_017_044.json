    "message_2": "The total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * (2^n - 1) / (2^(n-1))\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^8 - 1) / (2^(8-1))\nLength = 1 * (256 - 1) / (2^7)\nLength = 1 * 255 / 128\nLength = 255 / 128\nLength = 1.9921875 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after the 8th iteration is approximately 1.9921875 units."
