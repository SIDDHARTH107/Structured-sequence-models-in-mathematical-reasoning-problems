    "message_2": "To prove that there exists no non-abelian group of order 30 that is isomorphic to D15, we will first analyze the properties of D15 and then show that no group of order 30 can have these properties.\n\nD15 is the dihedral group of order 30, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 15-gon. It has 15 rotational symmetries and 15 reflectional symmetries, making a total of 30 elements. The group structure of D15 can be described as the set {r^n s^m | n = 0, 1, ..., 14; m = 0, 1}, where r is a rotation by 2π/15 radians and s is a reflection about an axis of symmetry. The group operation is given by (r^n s^m)(r^p s^q) = r^(n+p) s^(m+q) if m+q is even, and r^(n-p) s^(m+q) if m+q is odd.\n\nNow, let's consider a group G of order 30. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must divide 6 (the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1, which means that there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of G. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must divide 10 (the index of the Sylow 3-subgroup) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of G.\n\nIf both P_5 and P_3 are normal in G, then their product P_5P_3 is also a subgroup of G, and by the product formula, |P_5P_3| = |P_5| * |P_3| / |P_5 ∩ P_3|. Since P_5 and P_3 are of prime order, their intersection is trivial, so |P_5 ∩ P_3| = 1. Thus, |P_5P_3| = 15, and P_5P_3 is a normal subgroup of G of order 15.\n\nNow, since G has order 30 and P_5P_3 has order 15, the index of P_5P_3 in G is 2, which implies that G/P_5P_3 is a group of order 2. This means that G has a normal subgroup of order 15, and any group of order 15 is cyclic (since 15 = 3 * 5, and 3 and 5 are coprime). Therefore, G must have a cyclic normal subgroup of order 15.\n\nHowever, D15 does not have a cyclic normal subgroup of order 15. The only normal subgroups of D15 are the ones generated by the rotations, which form a cyclic group of order 15, but this subgroup is not normal in D15 since the reflections do not commute with the rotations.\n\nThus, no group of order 30 can be isomorphic to D15, as it would require having a cyclic normal subgroup of order 15, which D15 does not have."
