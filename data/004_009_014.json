    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2\nv(x) = sin(x)\n\nNext, we need to find the derivatives of these individual functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x (derivative of x^2)\nv'(x) = cos(x) (derivative of sin(x))\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\n(f(x) = u(x) * v(x))' = u'(x) * v(x) + u(x) * v'(x)\n\nSo, for our function, the derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = (2x) * (sin(x)) + (x^2) * (cos(x))\n\nf'(x) = 2x * sin(x) + x^2 * cos(x)"
