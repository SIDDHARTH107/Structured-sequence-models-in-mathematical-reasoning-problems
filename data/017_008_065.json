    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given group G and its properties.\n\n1. The order of G is 8.\n2. The elements a, b, f, g, and h have order 2.\n3. The element c has order 4, since (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e.\n4. The element d has order 4, since d^2 = e and gh = d.\n\nNow, let's analyze the three groups C8, Q8, and D4.\n\nC8: The cyclic group of order 8 has one element of order 8 and all other elements have orders dividing 8. In our group G, there is no element of order 8, so G is not isomorphic to C8.\n\nQ8: The quaternion group Q8 has the following properties:\n1. The order of Q8 is 8.\n2. The elements -1, i, j, and k have order 4.\n3. The elements -i, -j, and -k have order 2.\n\nComparing the properties of G and Q8, we can see that G has more elements of order 2 than Q8. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to Q8.\n\nD4: The dihedral group D4 has the following properties:\n1. The order of D4 is 8.\n2. The elements r^2, s, sr, s(r^2), and s(r^3) have order 2.\n3. The element r has order 4.\n\nComparing the properties of G and D4, we can see that they have the same number of elements of each order. Now, let's define a mapping φ from G to D4 to check if it is an isomorphism:\n\nφ: G → D4\nφ(e) = e\nφ(a) = r^2\nφ(b) = s\nφ(c) = sr\nφ(d) = r\nφ(f) = s(r^2)\nφ(g) = s(r^3)\nφ(h) = sr^3\n\nWe can verify that this mapping preserves the group operation:\n\nFor example, φ(ab) = φ(c) = sr, and φ(a)φ(b) = (r^2)(s) = sr, so the mapping is consistent with the group operation.\n\nSimilarly, we can verify the other relations in G, and we will find that the mapping φ preserves the group operation for all elements in G.\n\nSince the mapping φ is a bijection and preserves the group operation, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4."
