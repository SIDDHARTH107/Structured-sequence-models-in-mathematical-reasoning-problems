    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function P(x) and determine which one corresponds to the maximum profit. \n\nFirst, let's find the profit function P(x):\n\nP(x) = 350x - C(x) = 350x - (0.01x^3 - 0.4x^2 + 10x + 5000)\n\nNow, simplify P(x):\n\nP(x) = 350x - 0.01x^3 + 0.4x^2 - 10x - 5000\n\nNext, we need to find the first derivative of P(x) with respect to x:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = 350 - 0.03x^2 + 0.8x - 10\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting P'(x) equal to 0:\n\n0 = 350 - 0.03x^2 + 0.8x - 10\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n0.03x^2 - 0.8x + 340 = 0\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 0.03, b = -0.8, and c = 340.\n\nx = (0.8 ± √((-0.8)^2 - 4(0.03)(340))) / (2(0.03))\n\nx = (0.8 ± √(0.64 + 40.8)) / 0.06\n\nx = (0.8 ± √41.44) / 0.06\n\nx ≈ 12.84, 886.16\n\nSince the company cannot produce a negative number of units or a non-integer number of units, we can round the values to the nearest integers, which are 13 and 886. We need to check the second derivative to determine which of these values corresponds to a maximum profit.\n\nFind the second derivative of P(x):\n\nP''(x) = d^2P(x)/dx^2 = -0.06x + 0.8\n\nNow, evaluate P''(x) at x = 13 and x = 886:\n\nP''(13) ≈ 0.22 (positive value)\nP''(886) ≈ -52.96 (negative value)\n\nSince the second derivative is positive at x = 13, this corresponds to a local minimum, and since it is negative at x = 886, this corresponds to a local maximum. Therefore, the company should produce 886 units to maximize their profit."
