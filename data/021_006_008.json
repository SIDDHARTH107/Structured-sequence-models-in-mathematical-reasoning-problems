    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method with piecewise linear basis functions, we first need to discretize the domain and define the basis functions.\n\n1. Discretize the domain:\n\nDivide the interval $[0, 1]$ into $N=4$ equal subintervals. The grid points are given by:\n\n$$x_i = \\frac{i}{N}, \\quad i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$$\n\nSo, we have the grid points $x_0 = 0, x_1 = 0.25, x_2 = 0.5, x_3 = 0.75, x_4 = 1$.\n\n2. Define the basis functions:\n\nWe use piecewise linear basis functions, denoted by $\\phi_i(x)$, which are defined as follows:\n\n$$\\phi_i(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x - x_{i-1}}{x_i - x_{i-1}}, & x \\in [x_{i-1}, x_i] \\\\\n\\frac{x_{i+1} - x}{x_{i+1} - x_i}, & x \\in [x_i, x_{i+1}] \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE:\n\nMultiply the PDE by a test function $v(x)$ and integrate over the domain:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 (-u''(x) + u(x))v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 x^2 v(x) dx$$\n\nIntegrate the second derivative term by parts:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 u'(x)v'(x) dx - \\int_0^1 u(x)v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 x^2 v(x) dx$$\n\n4. Approximate the solution:\n\nApproximate the solution $u(x)$ by a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\n$$u(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} c_i \\phi_i(x)$$\n\nSubstitute this approximation into the weak form:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} c_i \\phi_i'(x)\\right)v'(x) dx - \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} c_i \\phi_i(x)\\right)v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 x^2 v(x) dx$$\n\n5. Solve for the coefficients:\n\nChoose $v(x) = \\phi_j(x)$ for $j = 1, \\dots, N-1$ and solve for the coefficients $c_i$:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} c_i \\left(\\int_0^1 \\phi_i'(x)\\phi_j'(x) dx - \\int_0^1 \\phi_i(x)\\phi_j(x) dx\\right) = \\int_0^1 x^2 \\phi_j(x) dx$$\n\nThis is a linear system of equations of the form $Ac = b$, where $A_{ij} = \\int_0^1 \\phi_i'(x)\\phi_j'(x) dx - \\int_0^1 \\phi_i(x)\\phi_j(x) dx$ and $b_j = \\int_0^1 x^2 \\phi_j(x) dx$. Solve this system to obtain the coefficients $c_i$.\n\n6. Compute the approximate solution:\n\nOnce the coefficients $c_i$ are obtained, the approximate solution is given by:\n\n$$u(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} c_i \\phi_i(x)$$"
