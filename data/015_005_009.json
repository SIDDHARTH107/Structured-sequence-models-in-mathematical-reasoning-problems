    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, given by:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the variables, and a, b, and c are the parameters of the system.\n\nA chaotic attractor is a set of initial conditions that evolve chaotically over time. To have a chaotic attractor with at least 3 positive Lyapunov exponents, the Rössler system must be at least 3-dimensional and exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\n\nHowever, the Rössler system is a 3-dimensional system with only one positive Lyapunov exponent. The other two exponents are negative. Therefore, it is not possible to produce a chaotic attractor with at least 3 positive Lyapunov exponents in the Rössler system."
