    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is a number that is a perfect square modulo a given modulus. In this case, the modulus is 13. To find the quadratic residues of 13, we need to compute the squares of the numbers from 0 to 12 (half of 13 rounded up) modulo 13.\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 13)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 13)\n3² ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n4² ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n5² ≡ 12 (mod 13)\n6² ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can list the distinct residues:\n\n0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, and 12\n\nThese are the quadratic residues of 13."
