    "message_1": "A signal processing problem: \n\nA digital camera produces an image with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. You want to apply the Fourier transform to this image to convert it into the frequency domain.\n\n(a) What is the size of the matrix that represents the image in MATLAB, assuming that each pixel is represented by 8 bits?\n\n(b) How many samples per second are needed to capture the image?\n\n(c) How many total frequency coefficients will be produced by the Fourier transform?",
    "message_2": "(a) The size of the matrix that represents the image in MATLAB will be 1920 x 1080, as each pixel corresponds to one element in the matrix. Since each pixel is represented by 8 bits, the total number of bits required to represent the image is 1920 x 1080 x 8.\n\n(b) The question does not provide information about the frame rate of the digital camera, which is needed to determine the number of samples per second. However, if we assume a standard frame rate of 30 frames per second, then the number of samples per second would be 1920 x 1080 x 30.\n\n(c) When applying the Fourier transform to the image, the resulting frequency coefficients will be in a matrix of the same size as the input image. Therefore, there will be 1920 x 1080 total frequency coefficients produced by the Fourier transform."
