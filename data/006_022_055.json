    "message_1": "In a certain school, it has been recorded that out of 500 students who graduated last year, 60% continued their education at the university level. Out of these students who continued their education, 80% completed their degrees within 4 years. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from this school both continues to university and completes their degree within 4 years?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of students who continued their education at the university level. \n\n60% of 500 students = 0.60 * 500 = 300 students\n\nNext, we need to find the number of students who completed their degrees within 4 years.\n\n80% of 300 students = 0.80 * 300 = 240 students\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a randomly selected student both continues to university and completes their degree within 4 years.\n\nProbability = (Number of students who continued to university and completed their degree within 4 years) / (Total number of students)\n\nProbability = 240 / 500 = 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from this school both continues to university and completes their degree within 4 years is 0.48 or 48%."
