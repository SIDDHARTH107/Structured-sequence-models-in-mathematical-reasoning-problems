    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the mean value theorem of calculus, we first need to find the velocity function of the truck. Since the acceleration is constant at 5 m/s², we can integrate the acceleration function to find the velocity function.\n\nLet a(t) = 5 m/s² be the acceleration function. Then, the velocity function v(t) is the integral of a(t):\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫5 dt = 5t + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nTo find the constant C, we need an initial condition. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the initial velocity, we can assume it to be 0 for simplicity. Therefore, v(0) = 0:\n\n0 = 5(0) + C\nC = 0\n\nSo, the velocity function is v(t) = 5t.\n\nNow, we can use the mean value theorem of calculus to find the average velocity during the time interval from 5 seconds to 10 seconds. The mean value theorem states that the average value of a continuous function on an interval [a, b] is equal to the integral of the function over that interval divided by the length of the interval:\n\naverage velocity = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a,b] v(t) dt\n\nIn this case, a = 5 seconds and b = 10 seconds:\n\naverage velocity = (1/(10-5)) * ∫[5,10] 5t dt\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\naverage velocity = (1/5) * [∫5t dt from 5 to 10]\naverage velocity = (1/5) * [(5/2)t^2 from 5 to 10]\naverage velocity = (1/5) * [(5/2)(10^2) - (5/2)(5^2)]\naverage velocity = (1/5) * [(5/2)(100) - (5/2)(25)]\naverage velocity = (1/5) * [250 - 62.5]\naverage velocity = (1/5) * 187.5\naverage velocity = 37.5 m/s\n\nSo, the average velocity of the truck during the time interval from 5 seconds to 10 seconds is 37.5 m/s."
