    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A).\n\n1. (A △ B) △ A = ({1, 2, 5, 6} △ {1, 2, 3, 4})\n   = ({1, 2, 5, 6} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4})\n   = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2}\n   = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n2. A △ (B △ A) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} △ {1, 2, 5, 6})\n   = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {1, 2, 5, 6}) - ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 5, 6})\n   = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2}\n   = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nAs we can see, the results of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A) are identical, both equal to {3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative. Let A, B, and C be any three sets. We want to show that (A △ B) △ C = A △ (B △ C).\n\nLet x be an element in (A △ B) △ C. Then x is in either (A △ B) or C, but not both. There are four possible cases:\n\n1. x ∈ A, x ∉ B, x ∉ C: In this case, x ∈ A and x ∉ B △ C, so x ∈ A △ (B △ C).\n2. x ∉ A, x ∈ B, x ∉ C: In this case, x ∈ B △ C and x ∉ A, so x ∈ A △ (B △ C).\n3. x ∉ A, x ∉ B, x ∈ C: In this case, x ∈ B △ C and x ∉ A, so x ∈ A △ (B △ C).\n4. x ∈ A, x ∈ B, x ∈ C: In this case, x ∉ A △ (B △ C) since x ∈ A and x ∈ B △ C.\n\nIn all cases, x ∈ (A △ B) △ C if and only if x ∈ A △ (B △ C). Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is associative."
