    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is its total surface area? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the base area and the lateral area and then add them together.\n\nThe base area (A_base) of a cone is given by the formula:\nA_base = π * r^2\nwhere r is the radius.\n\nThe lateral area (A_lateral) of a cone is given by the formula:\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nwhere l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem:\nl = √(r^2 + h^2)\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\nl = √(5^2 + 12^2)\nl = √(25 + 144)\nl = √169\nl = 13 cm\n\nNow, let's calculate the base area and the lateral area:\nA_base = π * 5^2\nA_base = 25π cm^2\n\nA_lateral = π * 5 * 13\nA_lateral = 65π cm^2\n\nFinally, let's add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area:\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π + 65π\nA_total = 90π cm^2\n\nNow, let's round the answer to two decimal places:\nA_total ≈ 283.53 cm^2"
