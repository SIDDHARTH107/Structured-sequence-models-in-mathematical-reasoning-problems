    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine, which states that:\n\n$\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$\n\nSince we know that $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{3}{5}$, we can square this value and plug it into the identity:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$\n\n$\\frac{9}{25} + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\cos^2\\theta$:\n\n$\\cos^2\\theta = 1 - \\frac{9}{25}$\n\n$\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{16}{25}$\n\nSince $\\theta$ is an acute angle, the cosine of the angle must be positive. Therefore, we can take the positive square root of $\\frac{16}{25}$ to find the maximum value of $\\cos\\theta$:\n\n$\\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}}$\n\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nSo, the maximum value of $\\cos\\theta$ is $\\frac{4}{5}$."
