    "message_1": "A steel company is designing a cylindrical tank that will hold 500 cubic feet of liquid. The top and bottom of the tank will be made of steel while the sides will be made of a cheaper material that costs $4 per square foot. What is the minimum cost of materials for the tank?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of materials for the tank, we need to minimize the surface area of the cheaper material used for the sides. Let's denote the radius of the tank as r and the height as h. The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe know that the volume of the tank is 500 cubic feet, so:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nNow, let's find the surface area of the sides of the tank. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA = 2πrh\n\nWe want to minimize this area, so we need to express h in terms of r using the volume formula:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h in the surface area formula:\n\nA = 2πr(500 / (πr^2))\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nA = 1000 / r\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of A. To do this, we can take the derivative of A with respect to r and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -1000 / r^2\n\nSince the derivative is always negative, the function is always decreasing, and there is no minimum value for A. However, we can find the minimum cost by considering the cost of the cheaper material:\n\nCost = $4 * A = $4 * (1000 / r)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to maximize the value of r. However, there is no upper bound on r, so the minimum cost cannot be determined without more information about the dimensions of the tank or the cost of the steel used for the top and bottom."
