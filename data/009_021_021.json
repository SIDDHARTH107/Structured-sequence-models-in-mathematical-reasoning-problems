Use $\\alpha = 1$ and approximate the solution using the method of finite differences with $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 0.1$ and $\\Delta t = 0.02$.",
    "message_2": "To approximate the solution using the method of finite differences, we first discretize the spatial and temporal domains. Let $u_{i,j}^n$ denote the approximate solution at grid point $(i\\Delta x, j\\Delta y)$ and time step $n\\Delta t$. We can approximate the second-order spatial derivatives using central finite differences:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n}{(\\Delta y)^2} $$\n\nWe can approximate the first-order time derivative using forward finite differences:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j}^{n+1} - u_{i,j}^n}{\\Delta t} $$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$ \\frac{u_{i,j}^{n+1} - u_{i,j}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\left(\\frac{u_{i+1,j}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^n - 2u_{i,j}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right) $$\n\nSince $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$, we can simplify this expression:\n\n$$ u_{i,j}^{n+1} = u_{i,j}^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\left(u_{i+1,j}^n + u_{i-1,j}^n + u_{i,j+1}^n + u_{i,j-1}^n - 4u_{i,j}^n\\right) $$\n\nNow, we can use the initial and boundary conditions to set up the grid. For the initial condition, we have:\n\n$$ u_{i,j}^0 = \\sin(\\pi i\\Delta x)\\sin(\\pi j\\Delta y) $$\n\nFor the boundary conditions, we have:\n\n$$ u_{0,j}^n = u_{10,j}^n = u_{i,0}^n = u_{i,10}^n = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we can use the finite difference formula to iteratively update the grid values for each time step. The approximate solution at time step $n\\Delta t$ is given by the grid values $u_{i,j}^n$."
