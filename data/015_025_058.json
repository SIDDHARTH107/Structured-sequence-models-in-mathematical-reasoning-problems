    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we need to analyze its equation. The forced van der Pol oscillator equation is given by:\n\nx''(t) - µ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + ω₀²x(t) = A*cos(ωt)\n\nwhere:\nx(t) is the displacement of the oscillator at time t\nx'(t) is the velocity of the oscillator at time t\nx''(t) is the acceleration of the oscillator at time t\nµ is the damping coefficient\nω₀ is the natural frequency of the oscillator\nA is the forcing amplitude\nω is the forcing frequency\n\nIn this case, we have µ = 2, A = 0.5, and ω₀ = 1.5. To find the maximum amplitude, we need to find the steady-state solution of the oscillator when it is driven at its resonance frequency. The resonance frequency is given by:\n\nω = ω₀\n\nNow, we need to find the steady-state solution of the forced van der Pol oscillator equation. The steady-state solution is given by:\n\nx(t) = X * cos(ωt - δ)\n\nwhere X is the maximum amplitude and δ is the phase shift. To find X, we need to analyze the amplitude response of the oscillator. The amplitude response is given by:\n\nX = A / sqrt((ω₀² - ω²)² + (2µω)²)\n\nSince the resonance frequency is ω = ω₀, we can substitute this into the amplitude response equation:\n\nX = A / sqrt((ω₀² - ω₀²)² + (2µω₀)²)\n\nX = 0.5 / sqrt((1.5² - 1.5²)² + (2*2*1.5)²)\n\nX = 0.5 / sqrt(0 + 36)\n\nX = 0.5 / 6\n\nX = 1/12\n\nTherefore, the maximum amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator with the given parameters is 1/12 or approximately 0.0833."
