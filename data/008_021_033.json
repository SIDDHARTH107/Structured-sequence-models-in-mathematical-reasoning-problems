    "message_2": "Since the given system of linear equations has a singular matrix, it means that the equations are either inconsistent (no solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions). Let's analyze the given system:\n\nEquation 1: 2x + 4y + z = 8\nEquation 2: 4x + 8y + 2z = 16\nEquation 3: 6x + 12y + 3z = 24\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equations by dividing each equation by their greatest common divisor (GCD):\n\nEquation 1: x + 2y + 0.5z = 4 (Divide by 2)\nEquation 2: x + 2y + 0.5z = 4 (Divide by 4)\nEquation 3: x + 2y + 0.5z = 4 (Divide by 6)\n\nAs we can see, all three simplified equations are the same. This means that the given system of linear equations is dependent and has infinitely many solutions. To express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve for z in terms of x and y using the simplified Equation 1:\n\n0.5z = 4 - x - 2y\nz = 8 - 2x - 4y\n\nThe solutions for the given system of linear equations can be expressed as:\n\nx = x\ny = y\nz = 8 - 2x - 4y\n\nwhere x and y can be any real numbers."
