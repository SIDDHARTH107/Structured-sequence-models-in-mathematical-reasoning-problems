    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is 2. The Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal, and its Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of √2 (s = √2). Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(√2) ≈ 2"
