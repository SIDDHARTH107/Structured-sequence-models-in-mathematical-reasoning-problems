    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal curve that is generated by repeatedly replacing the sides of an equilateral triangle with smaller equilateral triangles. The total length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nThe length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (2^n + 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and the order is 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5 + 1) = 1 * (32 + 1) = 1 * 33 = 33\n\nSo, the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve of order 5 is 33."
