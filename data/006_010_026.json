    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of an adult in a certain demographic group being affected by a disease is 0.08. If a random sample of 500 adults from that demographic group is taken, what is the probability that at most 40 adults will be affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, adults affected by the disease) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an adult being affected by the disease, which is 0.08)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of adults affected by the disease)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at most 40 adults will be affected by the disease, which means we need to find the probability for 0, 1, 2, ..., 40 adults being affected and then sum those probabilities.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X ≤ 40) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 40\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and compute the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 40) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.08)^k * (1-0.08)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 40\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X ≤ 40) ≈ 0.9515\n\nSo, the probability that at most 40 adults will be affected by the disease in a random sample of 500 adults from that demographic group is approximately 0.9515 or 95.15%."
