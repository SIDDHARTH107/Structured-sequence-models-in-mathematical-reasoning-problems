    "message_2": "To solve the equation |4x - 8| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 4x - 8 = 12\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 8 to both sides of the equation:\n4x - 8 + 8 = 12 + 8\n4x = 20\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 4:\n4x / 4 = 20 / 4\nx = 5\n\nSo, in the first case, x = 5.\n\nCase 2: 4x - 8 = -12\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 8 to both sides of the equation:\n4x - 8 + 8 = -12 + 8\n4x = -4\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 4:\n4x / 4 = -4 / 4\nx = -1\n\nSo, in the second case, x = -1.\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation |4x - 8| = 12 are x = 5 and x = -1."
