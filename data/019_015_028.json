    "message_2": "If each element in A must be mapped to a unique element in B, then it is not possible to create such a function. This is because there are three elements in A and only two elements in B. \n\nIn order to map each element in A to a unique element in B, there must be at least as many elements in B as there are in A. In this case, there are more elements in A than in B, so it is not possible to create a function that maps each element in A to a unique element in B."
