    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2y + y^3$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$f_x(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6xy$$\n$$f_y(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -3x^2 + 3y^2$$\n\nNow we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$f_x(x, y) = 0 \\Rightarrow 3x^2 - 6xy = 0$$\n$$f_y(x, y) = 0 \\Rightarrow -3x^2 + 3y^2 = 0$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can factor out $3x$:\n\n$$3x(x - 2y) = 0$$\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\n1) $x = 0$, which when plugged into the second equation gives:\n\n$$-3(0)^2 + 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$$\n\nSo we have the critical point $(0, 0)$.\n\n2) $x - 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2y$, which when plugged into the second equation gives:\n\n$$-3(2y)^2 + 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow -12y^2 + 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$$\n\nSo we have the critical point $(2y, y) = (2(0), 0) = (0, 0)$, which is the same as the first critical point.\n\nNow we need to classify the critical point $(0, 0)$. To do this, we will use the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$f_{xx}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6y$$\n$$f_{yy}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y$$\n$$f_{xy}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -6x$$\n\nNow we will evaluate these second partial derivatives at the critical point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$$f_{xx}(0, 0) = 0$$\n$$f_{yy}(0, 0) = 0$$\n$$f_{xy}(0, 0) = 0$$\n\nSince $f_{xx}(0, 0) = f_{yy}(0, 0) = f_{xy}(0, 0) = 0$, we cannot use the second partial derivative test to classify the critical point. However, we can analyze the function around the critical point.\n\nConsider the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2y + y^3$ around $(0, 0)$. If we fix $y = 0$, we have $f(x, 0) = x^3$, which has a local minimum at $x = 0$. If we fix $x = 0$, we have $f(0, y) = y^3$, which also has a local minimum at $y = 0$. Therefore, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum."
