    "message_1": "A torus has an outer radius of 8 cm and an inner radius of 4 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π² * R * r²\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (the outer radius minus half the width of the tube), and r is the radius of the tube (half the width of the tube).\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 8 cm and the inner radius is 4 cm. The width of the tube is 8 - 4 = 4 cm, so the radius of the tube (r) is 4 / 2 = 2 cm. The distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (R) is 4 cm (halfway between the inner and outer radii).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π² * 4 * 2²\nVolume = 2 * π² * 4 * 4\nVolume = 8 * π² * 4\nVolume ≈ 8 * 9.8696 * 4\nVolume ≈ 314.1592 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 314.16 cubic centimeters."
