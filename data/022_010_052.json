    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z-2) centered at z = 1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-1). Let w = z - 1, then z = w + 1. Substituting this into the function, we get:\n\nf(w) = ((w + 1)^2 + 1) / (w - 1)\n\nNow, we want to rewrite the function as a series of the form:\n\nf(w) = Σ a_n w^n\n\nTo do this, we can perform long division on the numerator and denominator of the function:\n\n          w^2 + 2w + 3\n        __________________\nw - 1 | w^2 + 2w + 2\n          -(w^2 - w)\n        __________________\n                 3w + 2\n                -(3w - 3)\n        __________________\n                        5\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf(w) = (w^2 + 2w + 3) + 5 / (w - 1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the last term as a geometric series:\n\n5 / (w - 1) = 5 * 1 / (1 - (-w))\n\nUsing the geometric series formula:\n\nΣ a r^n = a / (1 - r)\n\nWe get:\n\n5 / (w - 1) = 5 * Σ (-w)^n\n\nNow, we can rewrite the entire function as a Laurent series:\n\nf(w) = (w^2 + 2w + 3) + 5 * Σ (-w)^n\n\nSince the function is analytic everywhere except at z = 2 (w = 1), the radius of convergence of the series is |w - 1| = 1."
