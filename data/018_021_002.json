    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of this result with the set {2, 3}. Finally, find the symmetric difference of A intersect {2, 3} and B intersect {2, 3}. Show that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection using these results.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {5}\n\nA ∆ B = {1} ∪ {5} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of this result with the set {2, 3}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ {2, 3} = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3} = ∅ (since there are no common elements)\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and {2, 3} and the intersection of B and {2, 3}.\n\nA ∩ {2, 3} = {2, 3}\nB ∩ {2, 3} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of these two intersections.\n\n(A ∩ {2, 3}) ∆ (B ∩ {2, 3}) = {2, 3} ∆ {2, 3} = ∅ (since the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set)\n\nNow, we have shown that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ {2, 3} = (A ∩ {2, 3}) ∆ (B ∩ {2, 3})\n∅ = ∅\n\nThis demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection using the given sets A, B, and {2, 3}."
