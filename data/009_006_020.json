Here is an example problem for the math student to solve:\n\n\"Consider a chemical reaction in which a reactant A is converted into a product B at a rate proportional to the concentration of A. If the initial concentration of A is 0.1 mol/L and the rate constant is 0.05 s^-1, at what time will the concentration of A decrease to 0.025 mol/L?\"",
    "message_2": "This is a first-order reaction, so we can use the first-order rate law equation:\n\nln([A]t/[A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of A at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, k is the rate constant, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given the initial concentration [A]0 = 0.1 mol/L, the rate constant k = 0.05 s^-1, and the final concentration [A]t = 0.025 mol/L. We need to find the time t when the concentration of A decreases to 0.025 mol/L.\n\nPlugging the given values into the equation:\n\nln(0.025/0.1) = -0.05t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = ln(0.025/0.1) / -0.05\n\nt â‰ˆ 27.73 seconds\n\nSo, the concentration of A will decrease to 0.025 mol/L after approximately 27.73 seconds."
