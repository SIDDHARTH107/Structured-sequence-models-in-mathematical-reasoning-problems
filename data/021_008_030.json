    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y | = | 2x   2y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |   | 3x^2 -1 |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 10 and f2(x, y) = x^3 - y - 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = 1/(2x*(-1) - 2y*3x^2) * | -1  -2y |\n                                                        | -3x^2 2x |\n\nNext, we need an initial guess for the solution (x0, y0). Let's use (x0, y0) = (1, 2) as our initial guess.\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method iteratively using the following formula:\n\n(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_n, y_n) - J^(-1)(x_n, y_n) * (f1(x_n, y_n), f2(x_n, y_n))\n\nWe will iterate this process until the change in both x and y is less than 0.0001.\n\nIteration 1:\nInitial guess: (x0, y0) = (1, 2)\nJ^(-1)(1, 2) = 1/(-2 - 12) * | -1  -4 |\n                                            | -3   2 |\n                  = 1/(-14) * | -1  -4 |\n                                     | -3   2 |\n                  = | 1/14  2/7 |\n                    | 3/14 -1/7 |\n\nf1(1, 2) = 1^2 + 2^2 - 10 = -5\nf2(1, 2) = 1^3 - 2 - 1 = -2\n\n(x1, y1) = (1, 2) - J^(-1)(1, 2) * (-5, -2)\n          = (1, 2) - (| 1/14  2/7 | * (-5) + | 3/14 -1/7 | * (-2))\n          = (1, 2) - (-5/14 + 6/7, -15/14 + 2/7)\n          = (1, 2) - (-1/2, -1/2)\n          = (1.5, 2.5)\n\nIteration 2:\nJ^(-1)(1.5, 2.5) = 1/(-3 - 33.75) * | -1  -5 |\n                                                | -6.75  3 |\n                      = 1/(-36.75) * | -1  -5 |\n                                         | -6.75  3 |\n                      = | 1/36.75  5/36.75 |\n                        | 6.75/36.75 -3/36.75 |\n\nf1(1.5, 2.5) = 1.5^2 + 2.5^2 - 10 = 0.25\nf2(1.5, 2.5) = 1.5^3 - 2.5 - 1 = 0.875\n\n(x2, y2) = (1.5, 2.5) - J^(-1)(1.5, 2.5) * (0.25, 0.875)\n          = (1.5, 2.5) - (| 1/36.75  5/36.75 | * (0.25) + | 6.75/36.75 -3/36.75 | * (0.875))\n          = (1.5, 2.5) - (0.0068, 0.0239)\n          = (1.4932, 2.4761)\n\nSince the change in both x and y is less than 0.0001, we can stop the iteration process.\n\nThus, the solution to the system of equations correct to four decimal places is (x, y) = (1.4932, 2.4761)."
