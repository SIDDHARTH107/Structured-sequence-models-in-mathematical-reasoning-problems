    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10cm, a width of 8cm, and a height of 6cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the prism:\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism are length (l) = 10cm, width (w) = 8cm, and height (h) = 6cm, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nd^2 = (10)^2 + (8)^2 + (6)^2\nd^2 = 100 + 64 + 36\nd^2 = 200\n\nNow, to find the length of the diagonal (d), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nd = √200\nd ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm."
