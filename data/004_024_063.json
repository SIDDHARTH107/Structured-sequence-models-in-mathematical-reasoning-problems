    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we'll first need to implicitly differentiate the given equation with respect to x.\n\nThe given equation is x^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\n\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\n\ndy/dx = -x / y\n\nWe are given x = 3, and we need to find the corresponding value of y. We can do this by plugging x = 3 back into the original equation:\n\n(3)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\n9 + y^2 = 25\n\ny^2 = 16\n\ny = Â±4 (since y can be positive or negative)\n\nNow, we can find the value of dy/dx for both values of y:\n\nFor y = 4:\n\ndy/dx = -3 / 4\n\nFor y = -4:\n\ndy/dx = -3 / -4\ndy/dx = 3 / 4\n\nSo, when x = 3, dy/dx can be either -3/4 or 3/4, depending on whether y is positive or negative."
