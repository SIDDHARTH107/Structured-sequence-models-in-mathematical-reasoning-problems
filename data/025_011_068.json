    "message_1": "Let A be an Abelian variety of dimension 2 over a field K, and let P be a point on A. If P has order 3 and there exists a non-constant morphism f: A -> P^1, where P^1 is the projective line over K, then what is the degree of the extension K(P^1)/K?",
    "message_2": "Since A is an Abelian variety of dimension 2, it is a complex torus of dimension 2. Let f: A -> P^1 be a non-constant morphism. The projective line P^1 is a rational curve, and its function field is K(P^1) = K(x) for some rational function x.\n\nNow, consider the morphism f: A -> P^1. Since P has order 3, we have 3P = 0 in A, where 0 denotes the identity element of A. Applying f to this equation, we get f(3P) = f(0). Since f is a morphism, it must satisfy f(3P) = 3f(P) and f(0) = 0. Thus, 3f(P) = 0 in P^1.\n\nThe degree of the extension K(P^1)/K is the degree of the field extension K(x)/K, which is the degree of the minimal polynomial of x over K. Since 3f(P) = 0 in P^1, the minimal polynomial of x must divide the polynomial 3x. Therefore, the degree of the extension K(P^1)/K is at most 1.\n\nHowever, since f is a non-constant morphism, the degree of the extension K(P^1)/K cannot be 1, as that would imply that f is constant. Therefore, the degree of the extension K(P^1)/K must be equal to 1."
