    "message_2": "To solve this second-order logic equation, we need to determine if the statement is true or false. Let's break down the equation into its two parts and analyze them separately.\n\nLeft side of the equation: ∀x(∃y(x > y))\n\nThis statement says that for every natural number x, there exists a natural number y such that x > y. This is true since for any natural number x, we can always find a smaller natural number y (e.g., y = x - 1).\n\nRight side of the equation: ∃z∀y(y < z → y < x)\n\nThis statement says that there exists a natural number z such that for every natural number y, if y < z, then y < x. To determine if this statement is true, we need to find a value for z that satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's consider z = x + 1. For any natural number y, if y < x + 1, then y must be less than x. Therefore, the statement is true for z = x + 1.\n\nSince both sides of the equation are true, the overall second-order logic equation is true:\n\n∀x(∃y(x > y)) ↔ ∃z∀y(y < z → y < x) is true for natural numbers x, y, and z."
