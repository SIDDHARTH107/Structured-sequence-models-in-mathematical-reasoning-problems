    "message_2": "To find the smallest integer x such that 3^x ≡ 10 (mod 13), we can start by calculating the powers of 3 modulo 13:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n3^4 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n3^5 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n3^6 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n...\n\nWe can see that the powers of 3 modulo 13 repeat in a cycle of length 3: {3, 9, 1}. Now, we can try to find a power of 3 that is congruent to 10 modulo 13:\n\n10 ≡ 3^x (mod 13)\n\nWe can multiply each element of the cycle by 3 to see if we can get 10:\n\n3 * 3 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n9 * 3 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n1 * 3 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n\nNone of these are congruent to 10 modulo 13. Let's try multiplying each element of the cycle by 9:\n\n3 * 9 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n9 * 9 ≡ 81 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n1 * 9 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\n\nWe found that 9 * 9 ≡ 10 (mod 13). Since 9 ≡ 3^2 (mod 13), we can rewrite this as:\n\n(3^2)^2 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nSo, 3^4 ≡ 10 (mod 13). Therefore, the smallest integer x such that 3^x ≡ 10 (mod 13) is x = 4."
