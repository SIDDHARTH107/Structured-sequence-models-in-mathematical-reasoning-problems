    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y), we need to compute its gradient and set it to zero:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x(x^2 + y^2) - 8x = 4x(3x^2 + y^2)\n∂f/∂y = 4y(x^2 + y^2) + 8y = 4y(x^2 + 3y^2)\n\nSetting the gradient to zero:\n\n4x(3x^2 + y^2) = 0\n4y(x^2 + 3y^2) = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, either x = 0 or 3x^2 + y^2 = 0. From the second equation, either y = 0 or x^2 + 3y^2 = 0.\n\n1. If x = 0, then from the second equation, either y = 0 or 3y^2 = 0. Both cases lead to the point (0, 0).\n2. If y = 0, then from the first equation, either x = 0 or 3x^2 = 0. Both cases lead to the point (0, 0).\n3. If 3x^2 + y^2 = 0 and x^2 + 3y^2 = 0, then x = y = 0, which leads to the point (0, 0).\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, (0, 0).\n\nNow, we need to classify this critical point by its Morse index. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of f:\n\nH(f) = | ∂^2f/∂x^2  ∂^2f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂^2f/∂y∂x  ∂^2f/∂y^2 |\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = 12x^2 + 4y^2 - 8\n∂^2f/∂y^2 = 4x^2 + 12y^2 - 8\n∂^2f/∂x∂y = ∂^2f/∂y∂x = 8xy\n\nAt the critical point (0, 0), the Hessian matrix is:\n\nH(f) = | -8  0 |\n          |  0 -8 |\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix is det(H(f)) = (-8)(-8) - (0)(0) = 64, which is positive. Since both eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are negative, the Morse index of the critical point (0, 0) is 2.\n\nTherefore, there is only one connected component of the set M of critical points, and its Morse index is 2."
