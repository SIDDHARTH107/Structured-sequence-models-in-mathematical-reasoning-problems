    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 8 cm. Find its surface area.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width.\n\nThe rectangular prism has three pairs of congruent faces:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 10 cm × 5 cm (length × width)\n2. Two faces with dimensions 10 cm × 8 cm (length × height)\n3. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 8 cm (width × height)\n\nNow, we find the area of each pair of faces and add them together:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 10 cm × 5 cm: 2 × (10 × 5) = 2 × 50 = 100 square cm\n2. Two faces with dimensions 10 cm × 8 cm: 2 × (10 × 8) = 2 × 80 = 160 square cm\n3. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 8 cm: 2 × (5 × 8) = 2 × 40 = 80 square cm\n\nFinally, we add the areas of all the pairs of faces together:\n\nSurface area = 100 + 160 + 80 = 340 square cm\n\nSo, the surface area of the rectangular prism is 340 square cm."
