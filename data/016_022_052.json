    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid (also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron) is a fractal formed by repeatedly applying a process of subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra and removing the central one. The number of triangles in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid with 6 layers (iterations), we can calculate the total number of triangles as follows:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 + 4^4 + 4^5\nNumber of triangles = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024\nNumber of triangles = 1365\n\nSo, there are a total of 1365 triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid consisting of 6 layers (iterations)."
