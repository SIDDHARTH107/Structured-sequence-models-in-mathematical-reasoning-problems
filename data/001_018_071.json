    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log(base 2)(64) - log(base 2)(8), we can use the logarithmic property:\n\nlog(base b)(a) - log(base b)(c) = log(base b)(a/c)\n\nApplying this property, we get:\n\nlog(base 2)(64/8)\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction:\n\nlog(base 2)(8)\n\nSince 2^3 = 8, the logarithmic expression simplifies to:\n\n3"
