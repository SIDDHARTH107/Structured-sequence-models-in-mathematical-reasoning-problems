    "message_2": "First, let's identify the vowels and consonants in the word \"COMBINATORICS\":\n\nVowels: O, I, A, O, I, I\nConsonants: C, M, B, N, T, R, C, S\n\nThere are 6 vowels and 8 consonants. We can start with a consonant and alternate with vowels, or start with a vowel and alternate with consonants. Let's calculate the number of arrangements for each case.\n\nCase 1: Starting with a consonant:\n\nThere are 8 consonants, so there are 8 choices for the first position. After that, there are 6 vowels, so there are 6 choices for the second position. Then, there are 7 consonants left for the third position, 5 vowels left for the fourth position, and so on. So, the number of arrangements for this case is:\n\n8 * 6 * 7 * 5 * 6 * 4 * 5 * 3 * 4 * 2 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 1 = 8! * 6!\n\nCase 2: Starting with a vowel:\n\nThere are 6 vowels, so there are 6 choices for the first position. After that, there are 8 consonants, so there are 8 choices for the second position. Then, there are 5 vowels left for the third position, 7 consonants left for the fourth position, and so on. So, the number of arrangements for this case is:\n\n6 * 8 * 5 * 7 * 4 * 6 * 3 * 5 * 2 * 4 * 1 * 3 * 1 * 2 = 6! * 8!\n\nHowever, we need to consider that there are duplicate letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS\". We have 2 O's, 3 I's, and 2 C's. To account for these repetitions, we need to divide the total arrangements by the factorial of the number of repetitions for each letter.\n\nSo, the final number of arrangements for both cases is:\n\n(8! * 6!) / (2! * 3! * 2!) + (6! * 8!) / (2! * 3! * 2!) = 2 * (8! * 6!) / (2! * 3! * 2!)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n2 * (8! * 6!) / (2! * 3! * 2!) = 2 * (8! * 6!) / (12) = (8! * 6!) / 6\n\nCalculating the value:\n\n(40320 * 720) / 6 = 28,915,200 / 6 = 4,819,200\n\nSo, there are 4,819,200 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"COMBINATORICS\" such that the vowels and consonants appear in alternate positions."
