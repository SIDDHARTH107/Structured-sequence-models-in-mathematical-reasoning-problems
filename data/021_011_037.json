    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 5 using the conjugate gradient method, we first need to find the gradient of the function, which is the first derivative with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = 4x + 3\n\nNow, let's start with an initial guess of x0 = 1:\n\n1. Calculate the gradient at x0:\nf'(1) = 4(1) + 3 = 7\n\n2. Since the norm of the gradient is not less than 0.01, we need to update our guess using the conjugate gradient method. For a quadratic function like this, the conjugate gradient method is equivalent to the steepest descent method. We'll need a step size (alpha) to update our guess:\n\nx1 = x0 - alpha * f'(x0)\n\nTo find the optimal step size, we can minimize the function along the search direction:\n\ng(alpha) = f(x0 - alpha * f'(x0)) = 2(x0 - alpha * f'(x0))^2 + 3(x0 - alpha * f'(x0)) + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum of g(alpha) by taking its derivative with respect to alpha and setting it to zero:\n\ng'(alpha) = 0\n\ng'(alpha) = d/da [2(x0 - alpha * f'(x0))^2 + 3(x0 - alpha * f'(x0)) + 5]\n\nAfter taking the derivative and simplifying, we get:\n\ng'(alpha) = -4 * f'(x0) * (2 * (x0 - alpha * f'(x0)) + 3)\n\nNow, we set g'(alpha) = 0 and solve for alpha:\n\n-4 * f'(x0) * (2 * (x0 - alpha * f'(x0)) + 3) = 0\n\nSince f'(x0) is not zero, we can divide both sides by -4 * f'(x0):\n\n2 * (x0 - alpha * f'(x0)) + 3 = 0\n\nNow, solve for alpha:\n\nalpha = (3 - 2 * x0) / f'(x0)\n\nFor x0 = 1 and f'(x0) = 7, we get:\n\nalpha = (3 - 2 * 1) / 7 = 1 / 7\n\nNow, we can update our guess for x1:\n\nx1 = x0 - alpha * f'(x0) = 1 - (1/7) * 7 = 0\n\n3. Calculate the gradient at x1:\nf'(0) = 4(0) + 3 = 3\n\nSince the norm of the gradient is still not less than 0.01, we need to update our guess again. We'll follow the same procedure to find the optimal step size and update our guess:\n\nalpha = (3 - 2 * x1) / f'(x1) = 3 / 3 = 1\n\nx2 = x1 - alpha * f'(x1) = 0 - 1 * 3 = -3\n\n4. Calculate the gradient at x2:\nf'(-3) = 4(-3) + 3 = -9\n\nNow, the norm of the gradient is less than 0.01, so we can stop the algorithm. The minimum value of the function is approximately at x = -3:\n\nf(-3) = 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) + 5 = 18 - 9 + 5 = 14\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 5 is approximately 14."
