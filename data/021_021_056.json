    "message_1": "Consider the following optimization problem: \n\nMinimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 using cuckoo search algorithm over the interval [0,6]. \n\nUse an initial population size of 15 cuckoos, a maximum number of generations of 1000, a step size of 0.01, and a probability of cuckoo eggs being laid in a new nest of 0.25. \n\nDetermine the global minimum and value of the objective function.",
    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of 15 cuckoos randomly within the interval [0, 6].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo (i.e., calculate the objective function f(x) for each cuckoo).\n3. Perform the search for a maximum number of generations (1000).\n4. In each generation, update the cuckoo's position using the step size (0.01) and the probability of laying eggs in a new nest (0.25).\n5. Evaluate the fitness of the new cuckoos and replace the worst cuckoo if the new cuckoo has better fitness.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the maximum number of generations is reached.\n7. Determine the global minimum and the value of the objective function.\n\nSince the actual implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm requires programming and cannot be done directly in this text-based format, I will provide you with the global minimum and the value of the objective function for the given problem.\n\nThe global minimum of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 occurs at x = 2.5. At this point, the value of the objective function is f(2.5) = 2.5^2 - 5(2.5) + 6 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 6 = -0.25.\n\nSo, the global minimum is x = 2.5, and the value of the objective function at this point is f(x) = -0.25."
