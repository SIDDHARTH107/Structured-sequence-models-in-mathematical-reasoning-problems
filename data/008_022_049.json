    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products A, B and C. The production process requires three steps, represented by three matrices. Let's call these matrices M1, M2 and M3. The company wants to produce 200 units of A, 300 units of B and 400 units of C. However, due to some errors in the production process, the resulting system of linear equations is ill-conditioned. Solve the system of linear equations using the matrices given below:\n\nM1 = [2 4 6; 8 10 12; 14 16 18]\nM2 = [1 1 1; 1 1 1; 1 1 1]\nM3 = [3 3 3; 2 2 2; 1 1 1] \n\nFind the number of units of each product the company has to produce to meet the demand.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we first need to find the inverse of each matrix. However, matrices M2 and M3 are singular matrices, meaning their determinants are zero, and they do not have an inverse. This makes the system of linear equations ill-conditioned and unsolvable using the given matrices.\n\nIn real-world applications, ill-conditioned systems can lead to large errors in the solution or make the problem unsolvable. In this case, the company would need to reevaluate their production process and correct the errors in the matrices to obtain a solvable system of linear equations."
