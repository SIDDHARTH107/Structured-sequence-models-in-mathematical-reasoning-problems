Let's consider the action of each element of the group on the point $[x:y:z]$:\n\n1. For $\\zeta = 0$, the action is trivial, i.e., $0 \\cdot [x:y:z] = [x:y:z]$.\n2. For $\\zeta = 1$, we have $1 \\cdot [x:y:z] = [1x : 1^2 y : z] = [x:y:z]$.\n3. For $\\zeta = 2$, we have $2 \\cdot [x:y:z] = [2x : 2^2 y : z] = [2x : 4y : z] = [2x : y : z]$ (since we are working in the projective plane, we can ignore the factor of 4).\n\nNow, we want to find all points $[x:y:z]$ such that $[2x : y : z] = [x:y:z]$. This means that $2x = x$ and $y = y$ and $z = z$. Since we are working in the projective plane, we can scale the coordinates by a non-zero scalar. Thus, we can divide the first equation by $x$ (assuming $x \\neq 0$) to get $2 = 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $x = 0$.\n\nSo, the fixed points are of the form $[0:y:z]$. These points are already fixed under the action of $\\zeta = 1$ and $\\zeta = 0$. For $\\zeta = 2$, we have $2 \\cdot [0:y:z] = [0 : 4y : z] = [0 : y : z]$, which is true for all $y$ and $z$.\n\nHence, all the fixed points of the action of the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ on the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$ are of the form $[0:y:z]$."
