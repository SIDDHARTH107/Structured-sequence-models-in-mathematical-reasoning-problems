    "message_1": "Here's an optimization problem using the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm:\n\nA company produces two types of products, product A and product B. The total production cost for each unit of product A is $10 and for product B is $15. The company has a total budget of $5000 and they want to maximize their profit. The sales of product A and B generate revenue of $20 and $30 per unit respectively. Use the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm to find out how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit\nProfit = (Revenue from product A + Revenue from product B) - (Cost of product A + Cost of product B)\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\nProfit = (20x + 30y) - (10x + 15y)\n\nConstraints:\n1. Total budget constraint: 10x + 15y <= 5000\n2. Non-negativity constraint: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nParameters for the ABC Algorithm:\n- Number of employed bees (n): This is a user-defined parameter. For this example, let's assume n = 50.\n- Number of onlooker bees (m): Usually, m = n. So, m = 50.\n- Maximum number of cycles (MCN): This is the stopping criterion for the algorithm. Let's assume MCN = 1000.\n- Limit: This is the maximum number of trials for a food source before it is abandoned. Let's assume Limit = 100.\n\nNow, let's implement the ABC Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function.\n3. For each employed bee, generate a new solution in the neighborhood of the current solution and evaluate its fitness.\n4. Apply the greedy selection process to choose the better solution between the current and the new solution.\n5. Calculate the probability values for each solution based on their fitness.\n6. For each onlooker bee, select a solution based on the probability values, generate a new solution in the neighborhood of the selected solution, and evaluate its fitness.\n7. Apply the greedy selection process to choose the better solution between the selected and the new solution.\n8. Update the trial counter for each solution.\n9. If a solution reaches the Limit, abandon it and replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n10. Memorize the best solution found so far.\n11. Repeat steps 3-10 until the maximum number of cycles (MCN) is reached.\n\nAfter the algorithm converges, the best solution found will provide the optimal number of units of product A (x) and product B (y) that the company should produce to maximize their profit."
