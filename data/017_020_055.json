    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we first find the prime factorization of 40. We have 40 = 2^3 * 5^1. Now we use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: If G is a group of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes and a, b are positive integers, then G is a semi-direct product of a Sylow p-subgroup and a Sylow q-subgroup.\n\nUsing this theorem, we can find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40 by considering the possible semi-direct products of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: Since 40 = 2^3 * 5^1, there are two possibilities for the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup: 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8. For order 4, there is only one group up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group Z_4. For order 8, there are three groups up to isomorphism: the cyclic group Z_8, the dihedral group D_4, and the quaternion group Q_8.\n\n2. Sylow 5-subgroups: Since 40 = 2^3 * 5^1, there is only one possibility for the order of a Sylow 5-subgroup: 5^1 = 5. There is only one group of order 5 up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group Z_5.\n\nNow we consider the possible semi-direct products:\n\n1. Z_4 and Z_5: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_5 to Aut(Z_4), which is given by the automorphism x -> x^3 in Z_4. This gives us two semi-direct products: the direct product Z_4 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_20, and the non-abelian group of order 40 with presentation ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩.\n\n2. Z_8 and Z_5: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(Z_8), which are given by the automorphisms x -> x^3 and x -> x^7 in Z_8. Both of these homomorphisms give the same semi-direct product up to isomorphism, which is the non-abelian group of order 40 with presentation ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩.\n\n3. D_4 and Z_5: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_5 to Aut(D_4), which is given by the automorphism that swaps the reflections in D_4. This gives us two semi-direct products: the direct product D_4 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to D_20, and the non-abelian group of order 40 with presentation ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩.\n\n4. Q_8 and Z_5: There are no non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(Q_8), so the only semi-direct product is the direct product Q_8 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Q_40.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 40:\n\n1. Z_20\n2. Non-abelian group with presentation ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n3. Non-abelian group with presentation ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n4. D_20\n5. Q_40\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic because they have different properties, such as being abelian or non-abelian, having different orders of elements, and having different presentations."
