    "message_2": "To use abductive logic, we first look for a pattern in the given sequence:\n\n2, 4, 8, 14, 22, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n4 - 2 = 2\n8 - 4 = 4\n14 - 8 = 6\n22 - 14 = 8\n\nThe differences are increasing by 2 each time (2, 4, 6, 8). So, we can assume that the next difference will be 10. \n\nNow, let's add this difference to the last number in the sequence:\n\n22 + 10 = 32\n\nSo, using abductive logic, we can make an educated guess that the missing number in the sequence is 32. The complete sequence would then be:\n\n2, 4, 8, 14, 22, 32"
