Using the expected value approach, which project should the company choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which project the company should choose using the expected value approach, we need to calculate the expected value for each project.\n\nExpected Value (EV) = Probability of Success × Potential Profit\n\nFor the first project:\nEV1 = 0.70 (70% chance of success) × $100,000 (potential profit)\nEV1 = $70,000\n\nFor the second project:\nEV2 = 0.90 (90% chance of success) × $50,000 (potential profit)\nEV2 = $45,000\n\nComparing the expected values, the first project has a higher expected value of $70,000 compared to the second project's expected value of $45,000. Therefore, the company should choose the first project with a 70% chance of success and a potential profit of $100,000."
