    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x - 9| = 22, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x - 9 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can write the equation as:\n5x - 9 = 22\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n5x = 22 + 9\n5x = 31\nx = 31/5\n\nSo, in this case, x = 31/5.\n\nCase 2: 5x - 9 is negative\nIn this case, we can write the equation as:\n-(5x - 9) = 22\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n-5x + 9 = 22\n-5x = 22 - 9\n-5x = 13\nx = -13/5\n\nSo, in this case, x = -13/5.\n\nTherefore, the two solutions for x are x = 31/5 and x = -13/5."
