    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\nA * X = B\n```\n\nwhere\n\n```\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  4  6 |\n    | 3  6  9 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  4  |\n    |  8  |\n    |  12 |\n```\n\nNotice that the rows of matrix A are linearly dependent, as the second row is twice the first row, and the third row is three times the first row. This means that the determinant of matrix A is zero, and thus, the matrix A is singular.\n\nNow, let's check if the system is consistent. If the augmented matrix [A|B] has a row of the form [0 0 0 | b], where b ≠ 0, then the system is inconsistent and has no solution. Otherwise, the system is consistent and has either a unique solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe augmented matrix [A|B] is:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  4  |\n| 2  4  6 |  8  |\n| 3  6  9 |  12 |\n```\n\nWe can perform Gaussian elimination to row reduce the augmented matrix:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  4  |\n| 0  0  0 |  0  |\n| 0  0  0 |  0  |\n```\n\nSince there are no rows of the form [0 0 0 | b], where b ≠ 0, the system is consistent.\n\nSince matrix A is singular and the system is consistent, the system has infinitely many solutions. To find the solutions, we can express the variables in terms of a free variable.\n\nFrom the first row of the row-reduced augmented matrix, we have:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 4\n\nLet z be the free variable, and express x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = 4 - 2y - 3z\ny = y\n\nThe general solution of the system is:\n\nx = 4 - 2y - 3z\ny = y\nz = z\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers."
