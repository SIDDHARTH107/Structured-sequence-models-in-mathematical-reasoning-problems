    "message_2": "To find the fundamental solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional harmonic potential well, we first write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$\n\nHere, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\\psi(x)$ is the wave function we want to find. The potential energy function is given as $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, and the energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nWe can rewrite the Schrödinger equation as:\n\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - V(x))\\psi(x)$\n\nSubstitute the given potential energy function and energy:\n\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega - \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\right)\\psi(x)$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by introducing a dimensionless variable $\\xi = \\sqrt{\\frac{mk}{\\hbar^2}}x$:\n\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(\\xi)}{d\\xi^2} = -\\left(2\\frac{E}{\\hbar\\omega} - \\xi^2\\right)\\psi(\\xi)$\n\nFor the fundamental solution, we are looking for the ground state energy, which corresponds to the lowest energy level $n=0$. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by $E_n = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, so for the ground state, $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(\\xi)}{d\\xi^2} = -\\left(2 - \\xi^2\\right)\\psi(\\xi)$\n\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation is given by Hermite polynomials, which are denoted by $H_n(\\xi)$. The ground state wave function is proportional to the lowest order Hermite polynomial, $H_0(\\xi) = 1$. The complete wave function also includes a Gaussian factor to ensure that it is normalizable:\n\n$\\psi_0(\\xi) = A\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2}\\right)$\n\nHere, $A$ is a normalization constant. To find $A$, we impose the normalization condition:\n\n$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi_0(x)|^2 dx = 1$\n\nSubstituting the wave function and changing the variable to $\\xi$, we get:\n\n$A^2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi = 1$\n\nThe integral is a standard Gaussian integral, which evaluates to $\\sqrt{\\pi}$. Therefore, the normalization constant is $A = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/4}}$.\n\nFinally, we can write the fundamental solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional harmonic potential well as:\n\n$\\psi_0(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/4}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{mk}{\\hbar^2}}x^2\\right)$"
