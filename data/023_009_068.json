    "message_1": "A steel rod is 10 cm long and is heated on one end to a temperature of 100°C. The other end is insulated, so no heat escapes. Find the temperature distribution along the rod using Fourier transform. The thermal diffusivity of the steel is 0.01 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod using Fourier transform, we need to solve the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material (0.01 cm²/s for steel).\n\nSince one end of the rod is insulated, we have the following boundary conditions:\n\nT(0,t) = 100°C (heated end)\n∂T(10,t) / ∂x = 0 (insulated end)\n\nAnd the initial condition:\n\nT(x,0) = 0°C (initial temperature of the rod)\n\nNow, we can solve the heat equation using the Fourier transform method. First, we apply the Fourier sine transform to the heat equation and the boundary conditions:\n\n∂T^(n,t) / ∂t = -α (nπ/L)² T^(n,t)\n\nwhere T^(n,t) is the Fourier sine transform of T(x,t), L is the length of the rod (10 cm), and n is an integer.\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, which can be solved using separation of variables:\n\nT^(n,t) = T^(n,0) * exp(-α (nπ/L)² t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier sine transform of the initial condition T(x,0) = 0°C:\n\nT^(n,0) = (2/L) ∫[0,L] T(x,0) sin(nπx/L) dx = 0\n\nSince T^(n,0) = 0, the solution of the ODE is:\n\nT^(n,t) = 0\n\nNow, we apply the inverse Fourier sine transform to obtain the temperature distribution T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [T^(n,t) * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nSince T^(n,t) = 0 for all n, the temperature distribution is:\n\nT(x,t) = 0\n\nHowever, this result contradicts the boundary condition T(0,t) = 100°C. This is because the problem is not well-posed for the Fourier transform method, as the boundary conditions are not homogeneous. In this case, it is more appropriate to use other methods, such as separation of variables or the Laplace transform, to solve the heat equation and find the temperature distribution along the rod."
