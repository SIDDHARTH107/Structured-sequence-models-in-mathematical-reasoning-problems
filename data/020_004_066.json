    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The production of each product requires two types of resources: Resource X and Resource Y. \n\nThe following table shows the resources required to produce each product as well as the total available amount of each resource.\n\n| Product  | Resource X | Resource Y |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| A  | 3  | 5  |\n| B  | 4  | 2  |\n| Total available  | 36  | 28  |\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit, which is $8 for each unit of Product A and $10 for each unit of Product B. The company can produce a maximum of 6 units of Product A and 8 units of Product B. \n\nWhat is the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's profit subject to the resource constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 8x + 10y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n3x + 4y ≤ 36 (Resource X constraint)\n5x + 2y ≤ 28 (Resource Y constraint)\n0 ≤ x ≤ 6 (Product A constraint)\n0 ≤ y ≤ 8 (Product B constraint)\n\nWe can start by finding the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1.
