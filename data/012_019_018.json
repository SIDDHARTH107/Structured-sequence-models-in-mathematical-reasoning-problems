    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either equal to the maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn the given graph, the maximum degree is 3 (there are vertices with 3 edges connected to them). So, the chromatic index will be either 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges with 3 colors. We can start by coloring the edges connected to the vertex with the maximum degree:\n\n1. Color the top-left edge with color 1.\n2. Color the top-right edge with color 2.\n3. Color the bottom edge with color 3.\n\nNow, we can proceed to color the remaining edges:\n\n4. Color the left-most vertical edge with color 2.\n5. Color the right-most vertical edge with color 1.\n\nAt this point, we can see that we cannot color the middle vertical edge without using a 4th color, as it is adjacent to edges with colors 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic index of the given graph is 4."
