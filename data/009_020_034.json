    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using optimal control theory, we first need to rewrite the problem as an optimal control problem. Let's define the state variable x(t) and the control variable u(t) as follows:\n\nx(t) = y(t)\nu(t) = x^2(t) - y(t)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\ndx(t)/dt = u(t)\n\nThe objective is to find the control function u(t) that minimizes a certain cost function while satisfying the given initial condition x(0) = y(0) = 1. Let's consider the following cost function:\n\nJ(u) = ∫(u^2(t) + x^2(t)) dt from 0 to T\n\nWe want to minimize J(u) subject to the differential equation and the initial condition. To do this, we can use the Hamiltonian function H(x, u, λ) defined as:\n\nH(x, u, λ) = u^2(t) + x^2(t) + λ(t)(u(t) - dx(t)/dt)\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order conditions for optimality. These conditions are given by the following equations:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. -dλ(t)/dt = ∂H/∂x\n\nFrom equation 1, we get:\n\n2u(t) + λ(t) = 0\nu(t) = -λ(t)/2\n\nFrom equation 2, we get:\n\n-dλ(t)/dt = 2x(t)\n\nNow, we can substitute u(t) back into the differential equation:\n\ndx(t)/dt = -λ(t)/2\n\nWe have two differential equations:\n\n1. dx(t)/dt = -λ(t)/2\n2. dλ(t)/dt = 2x(t)\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously. Differentiating equation 1 with respect to t and substituting equation 2, we get:\n\nd^2x(t)/dt^2 = -dλ(t)/dt = -2x(t)\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThe roots are r1 = i√2 and r2 = -i√2. Therefore, the general solution for x(t) is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(√2*t) + B*sin(√2*t)\n\nNow, we need to find A and B using the initial condition x(0) = 1:\n\n1 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\n1 = A\n\nSo, the particular solution for x(t) is:\n\nx(t) = cos(√2*t) + B*sin(√2*t)\n\nSince x(t) = y(t), the particular solution for y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = cos(√2*t) + B*sin(√2*t)\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the value of B without more information about the problem."
