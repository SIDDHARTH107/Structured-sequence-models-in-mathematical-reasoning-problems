    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can provide you with some guidance on how to approach this problem, but I cannot provide you with the key and plaintext message without more information.\n\nThe Playfair cipher is a digraph substitution cipher, which means it encrypts pairs of letters instead of single letters. It uses a 5x5 grid filled with the letters of the alphabet (excluding one letter, usually 'Q', to fit into the grid) based on a keyword or keyphrase. The keyword or keyphrase is used to fill the grid, and the remaining letters are filled in alphabetical order.\n\nTo decrypt the message, you would need to know the key used to create the grid. Since you don't have the key, you would need to use cryptanalysis techniques to try and break the cipher. One common method is frequency analysis, where you analyze the frequency of digraphs (pairs of letters) in the ciphertext and compare them to the expected frequency of digraphs in the plaintext language (e.g., English).\n\nHowever, even with frequency analysis, breaking a Playfair cipher can be quite challenging, especially with a short ciphertext like the one you provided. It is likely that you would need more information or a longer ciphertext to have a better chance of successfully decrypting the message.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information or context, it is not possible to determine the key and plaintext message from the given ciphertext."
