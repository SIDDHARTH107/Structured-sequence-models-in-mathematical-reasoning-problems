    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces 5000 products per day. It has been observed that, on average, 5% of the products produced are defective. What is the probability that there are less than 250 defective products in a day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of products produced per day, which is 5000)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective products, which we want to be less than 250)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a product being defective, which is 5% or 0.05)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nWe want to find the probability that there are less than 250 defective products in a day, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 249. \n\nP(X < 250) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 249\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with the same mean and variance when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1. In this case, n = 5000 and p = 0.05, so the approximation should be reasonable.\n\nThe mean (μ) and variance (σ^2) of a binomial distribution are given by:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ^2 = n * p * (1-p)\n\nFor our problem:\n\nμ = 5000 * 0.05 = 250\nσ^2 = 5000 * 0.05 * 0.95 = 237.5\n\nNow we can calculate the standard deviation (σ):\n\nσ = sqrt(σ^2) = sqrt(237.5) ≈ 15.4\n\nNext, we'll use the normal distribution to approximate the probability. We want to find P(X < 250), which is equivalent to finding the area under the normal curve to the left of 250. To do this, we'll use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor X = 250:\n\nz = (250 - 250) / 15.4 = 0\n\nNow we'll use a z-table or calculator to find the probability corresponding to a z-score of 0. A z-score of 0 corresponds to the mean, so the probability is 0.5 or 50%. However, since we want the probability of less than 250 defective products, we need to consider the continuity correction. We'll subtract 0.5 from 250 to get 249.5 and recalculate the z-score:\n\nz = (249.5 - 250) / 15.4 ≈ -0.032\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability corresponding to a z-score of -0.032 is approximately 0.488. Therefore, the probability that there are less than 250 defective products in a day is approximately 48.8%."
