    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral tetrahedron into four smaller equilateral tetrahedra. The number of triangles in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^5 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = (1024 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = 1023 / 3\nTotal triangles = 341\n\nSo, there are 341 triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
