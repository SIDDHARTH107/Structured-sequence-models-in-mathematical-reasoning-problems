    "message_2": "The temporal logic statement $\\textbf{G}(x > 0)$ means that $x > 0$ is true globally, i.e., it is true at all time points.\n\n1. In the first scenario, $x = 5$ for all time. Since $5 > 0$, the statement $x > 0$ is true for all time points. Therefore, the truth value of the statement $\\textbf{G}(x > 0)$ is True in this scenario.\n\n2. In the second scenario, $x = -1$ for all time. Since $-1$ is not greater than $0$, the statement $x > 0$ is false for all time points. Therefore, the truth value of the statement $\\textbf{G}(x > 0)$ is False in this scenario."
