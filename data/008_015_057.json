    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Cholesky decomposition method, we first need to rewrite the given system of equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |\n    | 1  3  2 |\n    | 1  2  5 |\n\nb = | 5  |\n    | 10 |\n    | 18 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T: A = LL^T.\n\nL = | l11  0    0  |\n    | l21  l22  0  |\n    | l31  l32  l33|\n\nL^T = | l11  l21  l31 |\n      | 0    l22  l32 |\n      | 0    0    l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition method, we can find the elements of L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(2) = 1.4142\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 1 / 1.4142 = 0.7071\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 1 / 1.4142 = 0.7071\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(3 - 0.5) = 1.5811\nl32 = (a32 - l21 * l31) / l22 = (2 - 0.5) / 1.5811 = 0.9487\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(5 - 0.5 - 0.9) = 1.9365\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | 1.4142  0      0     |\n    | 0.7071  1.5811  0     |\n    | 0.7071  0.9487  1.9365|\n\nNow, we need to solve the following two systems of linear equations:\n\n1. Ly = b\n2. L^Tx = y\n\nFirst, solve Ly = b for y:\n\n1.4142y1 = 5\ny1 = 5 / 1.4142 = 3.5355\n\n0.7071y1 + 1.5811y2 = 10\n1.5811y2 = 10 - 0.7071 * 3.5355 = 7.5\ny2 = 7.5 / 1.5811 = 4.7434\n\n0.7071y1 + 0.9487y2 + 1.9365y3 = 18\n1.9365y3 = 18 - 0.7071 * 3.5355 - 0.9487 * 4.7434 = 11.25\ny3 = 11.25 / 1.9365 = 5.8095\n\nNow, we have y = (3.5355, 4.7434, 5.8095).\n\nNext, solve L^Tx = y for x:\n\n1.4142x1 + 0.7071x2 + 0.7071x3 = 3.5355\nx1 = (3.5355 - 0.7071x2 - 0.7071x3) / 1.4142\n\n0.7071x2 + 1.5811x3 = 4.7434\nx2 = (4.7434 - 1.5811x3) / 0.7071\n\n1.9365x3 = 5.8095\nx3 = 5.8095 / 1.9365 = 3\n\nNow, substitute x3 back into the equation for x2:\n\nx2 = (4.7434 - 1.5811 * 3) / 0.7071 = 1\n\nFinally, substitute x2 and x3 back into the equation for x1:\n\nx1 = (3.5355 - 0.7071 * 1 - 0.7071 * 3) / 1.4142 = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = (2, 1, 3)."
