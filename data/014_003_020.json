A message M = 8 is encrypted using this system to produce the ciphertext (r = 10, c = 16). Find the decrypted message using the public key information.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the ElGamal encrypted message, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the shared secret key: s = r^a mod p\n2. Compute the inverse of the shared secret key: s_inv = s^(-1) mod p\n3. Decrypt the message: M = c * s_inv mod p\n\nGiven the values p = 17, g = 3, a = 5, r = 10, and c = 16, let's perform the decryption:\n\n1. Compute the shared secret key:\ns = r^a mod p = 10^5 mod 17 = 100000 mod 17 = 13\n\n2. Compute the inverse of the shared secret key:\nWe need to find a number s_inv such that (s * s_inv) mod p = 1.\nTrying out numbers from 1 to 16, we find that s_inv = 4 satisfies this condition:\n(13 * 4) mod 17 = 52 mod 17 = 1\n\n3. Decrypt the message:\nM = c * s_inv mod p = 16 * 4 mod 17 = 64 mod 17 = 8\n\nThe decrypted message is M = 8, which matches the original message."
