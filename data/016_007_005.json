    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes.\n\nThe volume of the initial cube (order 0) is V0 = side_length^3. In this case, the side length is 3 units, so V0 = 3^3 = 27 cubic units.\n\nFor each iteration, the volume of the remaining cubes is multiplied by 20/27, since 20 out of the 27 smaller cubes are left.\n\nFor a Menger sponge of order 4, we need to apply this process four times:\n\nV1 = V0 * (20/27) = 27 * (20/27) = 20 cubic units\nV2 = V1 * (20/27) = 20 * (20/27) = 400/27 cubic units\nV3 = V2 * (20/27) = (400/27) * (20/27) = 8000/729 cubic units\nV4 = V3 * (20/27) = (8000/729) * (20/27) = 160000/19683 cubic units\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 4 with an initial side length of 3 units is 160000/19683 cubic units."
