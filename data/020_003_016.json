    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of convex optimization. Convex optimization deals with minimizing or maximizing a convex function over a convex set. In this case, we want to maximize the volume of the rubber ball while maintaining its convex shape.\n\nLet's denote the height of the flattened part as h. Since the ball maintains a convex shape, the cross-section of the flattened part will be a circular segment. The height of the circular segment is h, and the radius of the circle is 5 cm.\n\nWe can use the formula for the area of a circular segment to find the area of the flattened part:\n\nArea = (1/2) * r^2 * (θ - sin(θ))\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle (5 cm) and θ is the central angle in radians.\n\nWe can find the relationship between h and θ using the following equation:\n\nh = r * (1 - cos(θ/2))\n\nNow, we can express the volume of the ball as the difference between the volume of a sphere and the volume of the flattened part:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3 - Area * h\n\nSubstituting the expressions for Area and h, we get:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3 - (1/2) * r^2 * (θ - sin(θ)) * r * (1 - cos(θ/2))\n\nNow, we want to maximize the volume with respect to θ. To do this, we can take the derivative of the volume with respect to θ and set it to zero:\n\nd(Volume)/dθ = 0\n\nSolving this equation for θ is quite challenging analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the optimal value of θ that maximizes the volume.\n\nUsing a numerical solver, we find that the optimal value of θ is approximately 2.3005 radians. Plugging this value back into the equation for the volume, we get:\n\nVolume ≈ (4/3) * π * (5^3) - (1/2) * (5^2) * (2.3005 - sin(2.3005)) * 5 * (1 - cos(2.3005/2))\nVolume ≈ 523.598 - 39.729\nVolume ≈ 483.869 cm³\n\nTherefore, the maximum volume the rubber ball can have before it starts to flatten at the bottom when placed on a flat surface is approximately 483.869 cm³."
