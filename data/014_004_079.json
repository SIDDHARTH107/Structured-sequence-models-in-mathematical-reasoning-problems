    "message_2": "To find the order of point $P$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity and $nP$ denotes the repeated addition of point $P$ to itself $n$ times.\n\nWe will use the double-and-add algorithm to compute the multiples of $P$ until we reach the point at infinity. We will also use the formulas for point addition and point doubling on an elliptic curve:\n\n1. Point addition: Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on $E$, their sum $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n   - $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{17}$\n   - $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{17}$\n   where $\\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\pmod{17}$.\n\n2. Point doubling: Given a point $P = (x_1, y_1)$ on $E$, its double $2P = (x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n   - $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - 2x_1 \\pmod{17}$\n   - $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{17}$\n   where $\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + 2}{2y_1} \\pmod{17}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the multiples of $P$:\n\n1. $2P$: Since we are doubling the point, we use the point doubling formula:\n   - $\\lambda = \\frac{3(7)^2 + 2}{2(6)} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{17}$\n   - $x_3 = 9^2 - 2(7) \\equiv 11 \\pmod{17}$\n   - $y_3 = 9(7 - 11) - 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{17}$\n   Therefore, $2P = (11, 2)$.\n\n2. $3P = P + 2P$: Since we are adding two different points, we use the point addition formula:\n   - $\\lambda = \\frac{2 - 6}{11 - 7} \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$\n   - $x_3 = 13^2 - 7 - 11 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{17}$\n   - $y_3 = 13(7 - 10) - 6 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{17}$\n   Therefore, $3P = (10, 7)$.\n\n3. $4P = 2P + 2P$: Since we are adding two different points, we use the point addition formula:\n   - $\\lambda = \\frac{2 - 2}{11 - 11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{17}$ (Note: This is the point at infinity)\n   Therefore, $4P = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\nSince $4P = \\mathcal{O}$, the order of point $P$ is $ord(P) = 4$."
