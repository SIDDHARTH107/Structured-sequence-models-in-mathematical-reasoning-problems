    "message_2": "Let A be an Abelian variety defined over the field of rational numbers Q with dimension 2. Let P be a rational point on A, and let n be a positive integer. We want to compute the cardinality of the group of rational points on the subgroup nP of A generated by n copies of P.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic facts about Abelian varieties. An Abelian variety is a projective algebraic group, which means it is both a projective algebraic variety and a group. In particular, it has a group law that is defined by rational functions. The dimension of an Abelian variety is the dimension of the underlying algebraic variety.\n\nSince A is defined over Q, its group of rational points, denoted A(Q), is a finitely generated abelian group. By the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, we can write A(Q) as the direct sum of a free part and a torsion part:\n\nA(Q) ≅ Z^r ⊕ T,\n\nwhere r is the rank of A(Q) and T is the torsion subgroup of A(Q).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup nP of A generated by n copies of P. This subgroup is also a finitely generated abelian group, and we can write it as a direct sum of a free part and a torsion part:\n\nnP ≅ Z^s ⊕ U,\n\nwhere s is the rank of nP and U is the torsion subgroup of nP.\n\nSince nP is a subgroup of A(Q), we have s ≤ r. Moreover, every element of nP is of the form nQ for some Q in A(Q). Therefore, the group of rational points on nP is given by the set of points Q in A(Q) such that nQ is in nP. In other words, we want to compute the cardinality of the set\n\n{Q ∈ A(Q) : nQ ∈ nP}.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the multiplication-by-n map, [n]: A(Q) → A(Q), given by [n](Q) = nQ, is a group homomorphism. The kernel of this homomorphism is precisely the set of points Q in A(Q) such that nQ = 0. This kernel is a subgroup of the torsion subgroup T, and its cardinality is equal to the number of n-torsion points in A(Q), which we denote by |A[n](Q)|.\n\nBy the first isomorphism theorem for groups, we have\n\nA(Q) / ker([n]) ≅ Im([n]),\n\nwhere Im([n]) is the image of the multiplication-by-n map. Since ker([n]) is a subgroup of T, the quotient A(Q) / ker([n]) is isomorphic to a subgroup of A(Q) / T ≅ Z^r. Therefore, the cardinality of Im([n]) is a divisor of the cardinality of A(Q) / T, which is equal to 2^r.\n\nNow, we can compute the cardinality of the group of rational points on nP as follows:\n\n|{Q ∈ A(Q) : nQ ∈ nP}| = |A(Q) / ker([n])| = |Im([n])|.\n\nSince |Im([n])| is a divisor of 2^r, the cardinality of the group of rational points on nP is a power of 2. To determine the exact power of 2, we would need more information about the specific Abelian variety A and the point P."
