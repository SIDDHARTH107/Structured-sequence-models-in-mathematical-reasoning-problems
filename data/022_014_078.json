    "message_2": "To find the value of the integral of f(z) along the unit circle |z| = 1, we first need to parameterize the unit circle. We can do this using the following parameterization:\n\nz(t) = e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of z(t) with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = ie^(it).\n\nNext, we need to express f(z) in terms of t using the parameterization:\n\nf(z(t)) = u(x(t), y(t)) + iv(x(t), y(t)) = (x(t)y(t)) + i(x(t)^2 - y(t)^2).\n\nSince z(t) = e^(it), we have x(t) = cos(t) and y(t) = sin(t). Substituting these into the expression for f(z(t)), we get:\n\nf(z(t)) = (cos(t)sin(t)) + i(cos(t)^2 - sin(t)^2).\n\nNow, we can find the integral of f(z) along the unit circle |z| = 1:\n\n∫(C) f(z)dz = ∫(0 to 2π) f(z(t)) * (dz/dt) dt\n= ∫(0 to 2π) [(cos(t)sin(t)) + i(cos(t)^2 - sin(t)^2)] * i * e^(it) dt.\n\nLet's separate the real and imaginary parts of the integrand:\n\n= ∫(0 to 2π) [-cos(t)sin(t)e^(it)] dt + i * ∫(0 to 2π) [(cos(t)^2 - sin(t)^2)e^(it)] dt.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the integral of a function over a closed curve is equal to the sum of the integrals of its real and imaginary parts:\n\n= - ∫(0 to 2π) cos(t)sin(t)e^(it) dt + i * ∫(0 to 2π) (cos(t)^2 - sin(t)^2)e^(it) dt.\n\nNotice that both of these integrals are the integrals of odd functions over the interval [0, 2π]. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around the origin is zero. Therefore, both of these integrals are zero:\n\n= 0 + i * 0.\n\nSo, the value of the integral of f(z) along the unit circle |z| = 1 is 0."
