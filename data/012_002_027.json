    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given edges and the structure of the graph G:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 6 - 9 - 10\n|   |   |   |   |\n4 - 7 - 8 - 5\n\nWe can see that the graph is not a complete graph, so the chromatic number is less than or equal to 10 - 1 = 9.\n\nNow, let's try to color the graph using the minimum number of colors:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1).\n3. Color vertex 3 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertex 2).\n4. Color vertex 4 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 1 and 3).\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertex 2).\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 3 and 5).\n7. Color vertex 7 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertices 4 and 8).\n8. Color vertex 8 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 5 and 7).\n9. Color vertex 9 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertex 6).\n10. Color vertex 10 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 9 and 8).\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph G using only two colors (A and B) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph G is 2."
