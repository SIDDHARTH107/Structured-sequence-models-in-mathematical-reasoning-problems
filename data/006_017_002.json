    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a fatal head-on collision occurring on a particular road, we can use the concept of the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, fatal head-on collisions) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nLet λ (lambda) be the average rate of fatal head-on collisions per year. In this case, λ = 1/10, since there is one fatal head-on collision every 10 years on average.\n\nThe probability of a fatal head-on collision occurring in a given year can be calculated using the Poisson probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k fatal head-on collisions occurring in a given year\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average rate of fatal head-on collisions per year\n- k is the number of fatal head-on collisions we want to find the probability for (in this case, k = 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-1/10) * (1/10)^1) / 1!\n\nP(X = 1) ≈ (0.904837 * 0.1) / 1\n\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.0904837\n\nSo, the probability of a fatal head-on collision occurring on the particular road in a given year is approximately 9.05%."
