    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 2, 2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe surface equation is given by F(x, y, z) = 4x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 16.\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 8x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 2, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 2, 2) = 8(1) = 8\n∂F/∂y(1, 2, 2) = 2(2) = 4\n∂F/∂z(1, 2, 2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nThe gradient of the surface at the point (1, 2, 2) is given by the vector (8, 4, 4).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the gradient and the point (1, 2, 2). The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\n∇F(x, y, z) ⋅ (x - x₀, y - y₀, z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point (1, 2, 2) and ∇F(x, y, z) is the gradient (8, 4, 4).\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane is:\n\n(8, 4, 4) ⋅ (x - 1, y - 2, z - 2) = 0\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n8(x - 1) + 4(y - 2) + 4(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we obtain the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n8x + 4y + 4z = 24"
