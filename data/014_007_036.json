    "message_2": "To find the resulting ciphertext, we need to XOR the plaintext with the first 8 bits of the pseudorandom binary key stream. However, the length of the key stream is given as 100, but the actual key stream is not provided. \n\nPlease provide the pseudorandom binary key stream to proceed with the calculation."
