    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that can be constructed by repeatedly replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments, each equal in length to the removed segment, and connected at a 60-degree angle.\n\nThe number of triangles in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^5 = 243\n\nSo, there are 243 triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve."
