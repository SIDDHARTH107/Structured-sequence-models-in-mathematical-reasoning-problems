    "message_1": "A student wants to find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin. The student starts at point (1, 1, 2) and wants to travel along a geodesic to point (-3, 2, 1). What is the equation of the geodesic the student should take?",
    "message_2": "To find the geodesic on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. The geodesics on the surface of a sphere are the shortest paths between two points, which are the arcs of great circles.\n\nGiven a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, we have the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\n\nThe two points are (1, 1, 2) and (-3, 2, 1). To find the great circle passing through these points, we can find the plane that contains these points and the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet the equation of the plane be Ax + By + Cz = D. Since the plane passes through the center of the sphere, we have:\n\nA(0) + B(0) + C(0) = D => D = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the values of A, B, and C using the given points:\n\nA(1) + B(1) + C(2) = 0 => A + B + 2C = 0 ...(1)\nA(-3) + B(2) + C(1) = 0 => -3A + 2B + C = 0 ...(2)\n\nWe have two equations and three unknowns, so we can't find unique values for A, B, and C. However, we can express one variable in terms of the others:\n\nFrom equation (1), we have A = -B - 2C.\n\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n\n-3(-B - 2C) + 2B + C = 0\n3B + 6C + 2B + C = 0\n5B + 7C = 0\n\nNow, let's express B in terms of C:\n\nB = -(7/5)C\n\nNow we have the equation of the plane in terms of C:\n\nA = -(-7/5)C - 2C = (7/5)C - 2C\nB = -(7/5)C\nC = C\n\nThe equation of the plane is:\n\n((7/5)C - 2C)x - (7/5)Cy + Cz = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere:\n\n[((7/5)C - 2C)x - (7/5)Cy + Cz]^2 = 25\n\nThis equation represents the geodesic on the surface of the sphere. However, it's important to note that there are infinitely many great circles that pass through the given points, as the value of C can vary. To find a specific geodesic, we would need more information to determine the value of C."
