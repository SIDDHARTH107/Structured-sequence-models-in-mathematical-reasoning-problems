    "message_1": "Consider a triangle with sides of length 6, 8 and 10. Divide this triangle into smaller triangles by adding a line segment from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. How many total triangles are in the resulting triangulation?",
    "message_2": "When you add a line segment from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, you are essentially dividing the original triangle into two smaller triangles. So, in the resulting triangulation, there will be a total of 1 (original triangle) + 2 (smaller triangles) = 3 triangles."
