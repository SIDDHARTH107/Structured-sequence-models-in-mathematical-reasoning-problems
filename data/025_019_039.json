    "message_2": "Since X is a Fano surface with Picard number 1, we have Pic(X) ≅ ℤ, and the anti-canonical divisor -K_X is ample. Let L be an arbitrary line bundle on X with intersection number L^2 = 3.\n\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer m such that the line bundle L⊗m is very ample on X. By the Nakai-Moishezon criterion, a line bundle L' on X is very ample if and only if L'^2 > 0 and L'⋅C > 0 for every irreducible curve C on X.\n\nLet's consider the intersection of L with -K_X. Since -K_X is ample and L^2 = 3 > 0, there exists a positive integer n such that nL - K_X is ample. In particular, this implies that (nL - K_X)⋅C > 0 for every irreducible curve C on X. \n\nNow, let's consider the line bundle L⊗m = mL. We want to find the smallest m such that (mL)^2 > 0 and mL⋅C > 0 for every irreducible curve C on X. Since L^2 = 3, we have (mL)^2 = m^2L^2 = 3m^2. Thus, (mL)^2 > 0 for every m > 0.\n\nNext, we have mL⋅C = m(L⋅C) for every irreducible curve C on X. Since nL - K_X is ample, we have (nL - K_X)⋅C > 0, which implies that nL⋅C > K_X⋅C for every irreducible curve C on X. Since K_X⋅C is an integer, we can choose m = n + 1, so that mL⋅C > K_X⋅C + L⋅C > 0 for every irreducible curve C on X.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer m such that the line bundle L⊗m is very ample on X is m = n + 1, where n is the smallest positive integer such that nL - K_X is ample."
