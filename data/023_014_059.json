    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding the particle between x = -1 and x = 2, we need to compute the integral of the square of the magnitude of the wave function over this interval:\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 2) = ∫[|ψ(x)|^2] dx from -1 to 2\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of the wave function:\n\n|ψ(x)| = |(1/√2π) * e^(i2x-3x^2)| = (1/√2π) * |e^(i2x-3x^2)|\n\nSince the magnitude of an exponential function is 1 for any imaginary argument, we have:\n\n|ψ(x)| = (1/√2π)\n\nNow, let's compute the integral:\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 2) = ∫[|ψ(x)|^2] dx from -1 to 2 = ∫[(1/2π)] dx from -1 to 2\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 2) = (1/2π) * ∫[1] dx from -1 to 2 = (1/2π) * [x] from -1 to 2\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 2) = (1/2π) * (2 - (-1)) = (1/2π) * 3 = 3/(2π)\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle between x = -1 and x = 2 is 3/(2π). Note that we didn't actually need to use the Fourier transform in this case, as the magnitude of the wave function was constant over the interval."
