    "message_1": "What is the area of a triangle with a base of 8cm and a height of 10cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 × 10) / 2\nArea = 80 / 2\nArea = 40 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
