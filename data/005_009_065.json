    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8\n\nSince there are 10 students (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values. In this case, the middle values are 4 and 5.\n\nThe median is (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5\n\nSo, the median number of hours per week spent on studying for exams by this group of students is 4.5 hours."
