    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the theta function $\\vartheta(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with an imaginary part strictly greater than zero and a real part between $0$ and $1$, we can use the properties of the theta function and the transformation formula.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the theta function using the Poisson summation formula:\n\n$\\vartheta(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty e^{\\pi i n^2 z} = \\sqrt{-iz} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\pi i n^2 / z}$\n\nNow, let $z = x + iy$ with $0 < x < 1$ and $y > 0$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\vartheta(z) = \\sqrt{-i(x+iy)} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-\\pi i n^2 / (x+iy)}$\n\nSince the imaginary part of $z$ is strictly greater than zero, we can use the transformation formula for the theta function:\n\n$\\vartheta(z) = \\sqrt{-iz} \\vartheta(-1/z)$\n\nSubstituting $z = x + iy$, we get:\n\n$\\vartheta(x+iy) = \\sqrt{-i(x+iy)} \\vartheta(-1/(x+iy))$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of $\\vartheta(z)$ for $z$ in the given domain. To do this, we can consider the absolute value of the theta function:\n\n$|\\vartheta(z)| = |\\sqrt{-iz} \\vartheta(-1/z)| = |\\sqrt{-iz}| |\\vartheta(-1/z)|$\n\nSince $|\\sqrt{-iz}|$ is always positive, the maximum value of $|\\vartheta(z)|$ will be achieved when $|\\vartheta(-1/z)|$ is maximized.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = \\vartheta(-1/z)$. We want to find the maximum value of $|g(z)|$ for $z = x + iy$ with $0 < x < 1$ and $y > 0$. Note that $g(z)$ is an entire function, and its maximum value on a compact set is achieved on the boundary of the set.\n\nThe boundary of the given domain consists of two parts: the vertical line segment from $z = i$ to $z = 1+i$, and the horizontal line segment from $z = i$ to $z = i+y$ for $y > 0$. On the vertical line segment, the real part of $z$ is fixed at $x = 1$, and the imaginary part varies from $y = 1$ to $y \\to \\infty$. On the horizontal line segment, the imaginary part of $z$ is fixed at $y = 1$, and the real part varies from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$.\n\nBy the maximum modulus principle, the maximum value of $|g(z)|$ must be achieved on the boundary of the domain. However, since the theta function is an entire function, it cannot have a maximum value on the horizontal line segment, as this would contradict the maximum modulus principle. Therefore, the maximum value of $|g(z)|$ must be achieved on the vertical line segment.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(z) = \\vartheta(z)$ on the vertical line segment. Since the theta function is an entire function, the maximum value of $|h(z)|$ must also be achieved on the boundary of the domain. Thus, the maximum value of $|\\vartheta(z)|$ is achieved when both $|h(z)|$ and $|g(z)|$ are maximized.\n\nBy the transformation formula, we have:\n\n$|\\vartheta(z)| = |\\sqrt{-iz}| |\\vartheta(-1/z)|$\n\nSince $|\\sqrt{-iz}|$ is always positive, the maximum value of $|\\vartheta(z)|$ is achieved when both $|\\vartheta(z)|$ and $|\\vartheta(-1/z)|$ are maximized. Therefore, the maximum value of the theta function in the given domain is achieved when both $|h(z)|$ and $|g(z)|$ are maximized on the vertical line segment.\n\nHowever, finding the exact maximum value of the theta function in this domain is a difficult problem, and it is not known whether there exists a closed-form expression for this maximum value."
