    "message_2": "Let's first find the elements of set A and set B.\n\nSet A contains prime numbers less than 10. The prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, A = {2, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nSet B is the complement of A in the set of prime numbers less than 20. This means that set B contains prime numbers that are not in set A but are less than 20. The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Since set A contains 2, 3, 5, and 7, set B will contain the remaining prime numbers: B = {11, 13, 17, 19}.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between set A and set B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement B is an empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
