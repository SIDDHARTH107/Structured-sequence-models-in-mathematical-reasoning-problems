    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Since the universal set is not provided, we cannot find the exact complements of A and B. However, we can still find the Cartesian product of their complements, denoted as (A' x B').\n\nA' x B' = {(a', a), (a', b), (a', c), (b', a), (b', b), (b', c), (c', a), (c', b), (c', c), ...}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as (A x B)'. The complement of a Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' is in A' and b' is in B'.\n\n(A x B)' = {(a', a), (a', b), (a', c), (b', a), (b', b), (b', c), (c', a), (c', b), (c', c), ...}\n\nComparing (A x B)' and (A' x B'), we can see that they are not equal. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
