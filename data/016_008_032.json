    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not depend on the number of iterations or the original length of the line segment. It is a constant value that characterizes the fractal nature of the curve. To find the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, each line segment is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. Therefore, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the number of iterations or the original length of the line segment."
