    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 3| = 9, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 3 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n2x + 3 = 9\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n2x = 6\n\nDivide by 2:\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 2x + 3 is negative\nIn this case, we need to change the sign of the expression inside the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n-(2x + 3) = 9\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-2x - 3 = 9\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n-2x = 12\n\nDivide by -2:\nx = -6\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -6."
