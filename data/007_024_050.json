    "message_2": "To find the value of x in the equation 3^x = 11 (mod 17), we can use the discrete logarithm. We will try different values of x and see which one satisfies the equation.\n\n1. x = 1: 3^1 = 3 (mod 17) ≠ 11 (mod 17)\n2. x = 2: 3^2 = 9 (mod 17) ≠ 11 (mod 17)\n3. x = 3: 3^3 = 27 ≡ 10 (mod 17) ≠ 11 (mod 17)\n4. x = 4: 3^4 = 81 ≡ 13 (mod 17) ≠ 11 (mod 17)\n5. x = 5: 3^5 = 243 ≡ 11 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the value of x that satisfies the equation 3^x = 11 (mod 17) is x = 5."
