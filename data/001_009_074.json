    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, we have two terms with x³ and two terms with x².\n\nThe expression is:\n\n2x² + 4x³ - 3x² + 5x³ - 7\n\nCombine the x³ terms:\n\n(4x³ + 5x³) = 9x³\n\nCombine the x² terms:\n\n(2x² - 3x²) = -1x²\n\nNow, rewrite the expression with the combined terms:\n\n9x³ - 1x² - 7\n\nSince there are no more like terms to combine, this is the simplified expression:\n\n9x³ - x² - 7"
