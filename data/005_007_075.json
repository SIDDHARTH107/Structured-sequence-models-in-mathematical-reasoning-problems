    "message_1": "What is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the scores obtained in a math exam, if the data collected from a sample of 30 students have a mean of 4 hours studied and a standard deviation of 2 hours, and a mean score of 80 and a standard deviation of 10?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), we need the covariance between the two variables (hours studied and scores obtained) and the standard deviations of both variables. However, the provided information only includes the means and standard deviations of both variables, but not the covariance. \n\nIf you can provide the covariance or the raw data of the hours studied and scores obtained for the 30 students, I can help you calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient."
