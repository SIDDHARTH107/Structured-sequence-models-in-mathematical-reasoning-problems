Determine whether the following subsets of X are open, closed, or neither:\n\n(a) {1}\n(b) {1, 2}\n(c) {1, 3}\n(d) {2, 3} \n\nFor each subset, justify your answer by explaining why it is open, closed, or neither.",
    "message_2": "(a) {1}\nThis subset is neither open nor closed. It is not open because it is not an element of the topology T. To check if it is closed, we need to see if its complement is open. The complement of {1} is {2, 3, 4}, which is not an element of T. Therefore, {1} is neither open nor closed.\n\n(b) {1, 2}\nThis subset is open because it is an element of the topology T. To check if it is also closed, we need to see if its complement is open. The complement of {1, 2} is {3, 4}, which is an element of T. Therefore, {1, 2} is both open and closed.\n\n(c) {1, 3}\nThis subset is neither open nor closed. It is not open because it is not an element of the topology T. To check if it is closed, we need to see if its complement is open. The complement of {1, 3} is {2, 4}, which is not an element of T. Therefore, {1, 3} is neither open nor closed.\n\n(d) {2, 3}\nThis subset is neither open nor closed. It is not open because it is not an element of the topology T. To check if it is closed, we need to see if its complement is open. The complement of {2, 3} is {1, 4}, which is not an element of T. Therefore, {2, 3} is neither open nor closed."
