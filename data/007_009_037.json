    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nFor a prime number p, φ(p) = p-1, since all positive integers less than p are relatively prime to p. \n\nFor a power of a prime number, p^k, the totient function can be calculated using the formula:\n\nφ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1)\n\nIn this case, we want to find φ(27). Since 27 is a power of the prime number 3 (27 = 3^3), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(3^3) = 3^3 - 3^(3-1) = 27 - 9 = 18\n\nSo, φ(27) = 18."
