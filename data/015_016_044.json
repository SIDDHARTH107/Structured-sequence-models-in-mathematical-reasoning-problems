If you apply an initial condition of $x(0) = 0$, $y(0) = -0.1$, and $z(0) = 0.2$, what is the maximum and minimum voltage observed in the output $v_2(t)$ over the time interval $t \\in [0, 500]$ milliseconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum voltage observed in the output $v_2(t)$ over the time interval $t \\in [0, 500]$ milliseconds, we need to solve the Chua circuit equations numerically. The Chua circuit is described by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha (y - x - h(x))$\n2. $\\frac{dy}{dt} = x - y + z$\n3. $\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\beta y$\n\nwhere $h(x) = m_1 x + \\frac{1}{2}(m_0 - m_1)(|x + a| - |x - a|)$, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{R C_1}$, and $\\beta = \\frac{1}{R C_2}$.\n\nGiven the parameters, we have:\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{(10)(100 \\times 10^{-9})} = 10^7$ s$^{-1}$\n\n$\\beta = \\frac{1}{(10)(50 \\times 10^{-9})} = 2 \\times 10^7$ s$^{-1}$\n\nNow, we can solve the system of ODEs numerically using a suitable numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, with the given initial conditions $x(0) = 0$, $y(0) = -0.1$, and $z(0) = 0.2$. The output voltage $v_2(t)$ is related to the variable $y(t)$ as $v_2(t) = \\frac{1}{C_2} \\int y(t) dt$.\n\nAfter solving the system of ODEs and computing $v_2(t)$, we can find the maximum and minimum voltage observed in the output $v_2(t)$ over the time interval $t \\in [0, 500]$ milliseconds.\n\nSince this is a numerical problem, the exact values of the maximum and minimum voltage will depend on the specific numerical method and its implementation. However, the Chua circuit is known for its chaotic behavior, so the output voltage will exhibit a complex, non-periodic pattern."
