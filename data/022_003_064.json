    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first check if the function f(z) is analytic in the region enclosed by the circle |z - 1| = 2. If it is, then by Cauchy's theorem, the integral will be zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = (z^3 + 1)/(z + 3) has a simple pole at z = -3. The circle |z - 1| = 2 is centered at z = 1 with a radius of 2. The pole at z = -3 is outside the circle, so the function f(z) is analytic inside and on the circle |z - 1| = 2.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic in the region enclosed by the circle, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) along the circle is zero:\n\nâˆ® f(z) dz = 0"
