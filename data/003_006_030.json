    "message_1": "Liza is standing at a point A and sees a plane flying overhead at an angle of elevation of 35 degrees. She walks to point B which is 500 meters away from point A, and now sees the plane at an angle of elevation of 50 degrees. How high is the plane flying? (Assume the ground is level and use the law of sines to solve the triangle.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the points as follows: A is Liza's initial position, B is her final position, and C is the position of the plane. We are given that angle CAB is 35 degrees, angle CBA is 50 degrees, and the distance between A and B is 500 meters. We want to find the height of the plane, which is the length of side AC.\n\nFirst, we need to find the third angle of the triangle, angle ACB. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nangle ACB = 180 - (angle CAB + angle CBA) = 180 - (35 + 50) = 95 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the length of side AC. The law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\nAC / sin(angle CBA) = AB / sin(angle ACB)\n\nWe want to find AC, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n\nAC = (AB * sin(angle CBA)) / sin(angle ACB)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nAC = (500 * sin(50)) / sin(95)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nAC ≈ (500 * 0.766) / 0.997\nAC ≈ 383.3\n\nSo the height of the plane is approximately 383.3 meters."
