    "message_2": "(a) The symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as AΔB, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In this case:\n\nAΔB = {1, 4}\n\n(b) The Cartesian product of sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. Similarly, B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A. In this case:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\n(c) To show that AΔB ≠ BΔA, we need to show that the symmetric difference of sets B and A is not equal to the symmetric difference of sets A and B. \n\nBΔA is the set of elements that are in either B or A, but not in both. In this case:\n\nBΔA = {1, 4}\n\nSince AΔB = {1, 4} and BΔA = {1, 4}, we can see that AΔB = BΔA. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the question asked to show that AΔB ≠ BΔA using the results from parts (a) and (b). In this case, we cannot conclude that AΔB ≠ BΔA using the Cartesian products A x B and B x A, as they are not directly related to the symmetric difference of sets. The symmetric difference of sets A and B is equal to the symmetric difference of sets B and A, as shown above."
