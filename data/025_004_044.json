Let $C$ be a rational curve in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ given by the parametrization\n$$(s,t) \\mapsto [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3].$$\nFind the equation of the tangent line to $C$ at the point $[1:1:1:1]$.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $C$ at the point $[1:1:1:1]$, we first need to find the parameter values $(s,t)$ that correspond to this point. Since $[1:1:1:1] = [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3]$, we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$s^3 = 1, \\quad s^2t = 1, \\quad st^2 = 1, \\quad t^3 = 1.$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $s = 1$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $t = 1$. Thus, the point $[1:1:1:1]$ corresponds to the parameter values $(s,t) = (1,1)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector to the curve at this point. To do this, we compute the partial derivatives of the parametrization with respect to $s$ and $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3] = [3s^2:2st:t^2:0],$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3] = [0:s^2:2st:3t^2].$$\n\nEvaluating these partial derivatives at $(s,t) = (1,1)$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} [1:1:1:1] = [3:2:1:0],$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [1:1:1:1] = [0:1:2:3].$$\n\nNow, we can find the tangent line to the curve at the point $[1:1:1:1]$ by taking the cross product of these two tangent vectors:\n\n$$[3:2:1:0] \\times [0:1:2:3] = [5:-3:3:1].$$\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent line to the curve $C$ at the point $[1:1:1:1]$ is given by:\n\n$$5x - 3y + 3z - w = 0.$$"
