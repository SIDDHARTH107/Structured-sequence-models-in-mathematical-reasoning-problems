    "message_2": "The given time-domain signal is x(t) = 5sin(2π(5t)) + 3sin(2π(15t)) + 2sin(2π(25t)). This signal is already in the form of a sum of sinusoids, which means we can directly identify the frequency content without needing to compute the Fourier transform.\n\nThe frequency content of the signal can be determined by looking at the coefficients of the sinusoids and their corresponding frequencies:\n\n1. The first sinusoid has an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 5 Hz (since 2π(5t) has a frequency of 5 Hz).\n2. The second sinusoid has an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of 15 Hz (since 2π(15t) has a frequency of 15 Hz).\n3. The third sinusoid has an amplitude of 2 and a frequency of 25 Hz (since 2π(25t) has a frequency of 25 Hz).\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal x(t) consists of three distinct frequencies: 5 Hz, 15 Hz, and 25 Hz, with corresponding amplitudes of 5, 3, and 2, respectively."
