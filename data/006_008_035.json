    "message_2": "The probability of getting a rainy day in a week of seven days, given that the historical data shows that on average there are 3 rainy days in a week during the month of July, can be calculated as follows:\n\nThere are 3 rainy days out of a total of 7 days in a week. So, the probability of a day being rainy is:\n\nP(rainy day) = (number of rainy days) / (total number of days in a week)\nP(rainy day) = 3 / 7\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting a rainy day in a week of seven days is 3/7 or approximately 0.4286 (rounded to four decimal places)."
