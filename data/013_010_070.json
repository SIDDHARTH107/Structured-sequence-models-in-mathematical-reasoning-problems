They sell their oil to a market where demand is given by the function Q = 120 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the market price per barrel. Company A and Company B simultaneously decide how much oil to produce. If they both produce the same amount, the market price is determined by the formula P = 60 - Q/2. If one company produces more than the other, the market price is determined by the formula P = 70 - Q/2. What will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each company under the Cournot competition assumption?",
    "message_2": "Under the Cournot competition assumption, each firm chooses its production level to maximize its profit, taking the production level of the other firm as given. Let qA and qB be the quantities produced by Company A and Company B, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse demand function, which gives the market price as a function of the total quantity produced. From the demand function Q = 120 - P, we can solve for P:\n\nP = 120 - Q\n\nNow, let's find the profit functions for Company A and Company B. The profit for each company is the difference between its revenue and its cost:\n\nπA = (P * qA) - (10 * qA)\nπB = (P * qB) - (10 * qB)\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function for P:\n\nπA = ((120 - Q) * qA) - (10 * qA)\nπB = ((120 - Q) * qB) - (10 * qB)\n\nNow, substitute Q = qA + qB:\n\nπA = ((120 - (qA + qB)) * qA) - (10 * qA)\nπB = ((120 - (qA + qB)) * qB) - (10 * qB)\n\nTo find the Cournot equilibrium, we need to find the Nash equilibrium of this game, where each firm chooses its production level to maximize its profit, given the production level of the other firm. This involves finding the first-order conditions for profit maximization and solving the resulting system of equations.\n\nThe first-order conditions are the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to each firm's production level:\n\n∂πA/∂qA = 120 - 2qA - qB - 10\n∂πB/∂qB = 120 - 2qB - qA - 10\n\nSet the first-order conditions equal to zero and solve the system of equations:\n\n120 - 2qA - qB - 10 = 0\n120 - 2qB - qA - 10 = 0\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n110 - 2qA - qB = 0\n110 - 2qB - qA = 0\n\nSolve the first equation for qA:\n\nqA = (110 - qB) / 2\n\nSubstitute this expression for qA into the second equation:\n\n110 - 2qB - ((110 - qB) / 2) = 0\n\nSolve for qB:\n\nqB = 30\n\nNow, substitute qB back into the expression for qA:\n\nqA = (110 - 30) / 2\nqA = 40\n\nSo, the Cournot equilibrium quantities are qA = 40 and qB = 30. Company A will produce 40 barrels of oil, and Company B will produce 30 barrels of oil."
