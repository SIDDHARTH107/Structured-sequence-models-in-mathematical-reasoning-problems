    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product AxB:\nAxB = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nNow, let's find (AxB) ∩ B. Since B contains only single elements, and AxB contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between AxB and B. Therefore, (AxB) ∩ B is an empty set:\n(AxB) ∩ B = ∅\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ B. Since B is a set, the intersection of B with itself is just B:\nB ∩ B = B = {2,3}\n\nNow, let's find A x (B ∩ B), which is the same as A x B since B ∩ B = B:\nA x (B ∩ B) = A x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nNow, we can see that (AxB) ∩ B = ∅ and A x (B ∩ B) = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}. Since these two results are not equal, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
