    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| in the region |z| < 2, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is analytic in a bounded domain and continuous on its boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary.\n\nSince f(z) = z^3 + 2z - 4 is a polynomial, it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane, including the region |z| < 2. Therefore, we only need to consider the boundary of the region, which is the circle |z| = 2.\n\nLet z = 2e^(iθ), where θ is the angle in polar coordinates. Then,\n\nf(z) = (2e^(iθ))^3 + 2(2e^(iθ)) - 4\n     = 8e^(3iθ) + 4e^(iθ) - 4\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|:\n\n|f(z)| = |8e^(3iθ) + 4e^(iθ) - 4|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|, we can use the triangle inequality:\n\n|8e^(3iθ) + 4e^(iθ) - 4| ≤ |8e^(3iθ)| + |4e^(iθ)| + |-4|\n                            = 8 + 4 + 4\n                            = 16\n\nEquality holds when 8e^(3iθ), 4e^(iθ), and -4 are collinear and have the same direction. This occurs when θ = 0, which corresponds to the point z = 2. Thus, the maximum value of |f(z)| is 16, and it is attained at z = 2.\n\nTo find the minimum value of |f(z)|, we can use the reverse triangle inequality:\n\n|f(z)| ≥ ||8e^(3iθ)| - |4e^(iθ)| - |-4||\n          = |8 - 4 - 4|\n          = 0\n\nEquality holds when 8e^(3iθ) and 4e^(iθ) are collinear and have opposite directions, and their sum is equal to 4. This occurs when θ = π, which corresponds to the point z = -2. Thus, the minimum value of |f(z)| is 0, and it is attained at z = -2.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum value of |f(z)| in the region |z| < 2 is 16, attained at z = 2, and the minimum value is 0, attained at z = -2."
