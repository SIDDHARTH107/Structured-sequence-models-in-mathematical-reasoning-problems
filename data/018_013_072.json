    "message_2": "First, let's find AxB, which is the Cartesian product of A and B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nNow, let's find (AxB) U C, which is the union of the set AxB and the set C.\n\n(AxB) U C = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), 5}\n\nNext, let's find B U C, which is the union of the sets B and C.\n\nB U C = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find A x (B U C), which is the Cartesian product of A and the set B U C.\n\nA x (B U C) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two results we found: (AxB) U C and A x (B U C).\n\n(AxB) U C = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), 5}\nA x (B U C) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)}\n\nAs we can see, (AxB) U C â‰  A x (B U C). This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
