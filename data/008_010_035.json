    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  5 ]\n[ 3  4 -5 | -7 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we'll subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -7 ]\n[ 0  1 -8 | -25 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we'll add 1/3 times the second row to the third row.\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -7 ]\n[ 0  0 -25| -74 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nWe can see that the third row represents the equation -25z = -74. Solving for z, we get:\n\nz = -74 / -25 = 74/25\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow we can substitute z back into the second row, which represents the equation -3y + 1z = -7:\n\n-3y + (74/25) = -7\n\nTo solve for y, we'll first multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-75y + 74 = -175\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n-75y = -249\ny = 249 / 75 = 83/25\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute y and z back into the first row, which represents the equation x + y + z = 6:\n\nx + (83/25) + (74/25) = 6\n\nTo solve for x, we'll first multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n25x + 83 + 74 = 150\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n25x = -7\nx = -7 / 25\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = -7/25\ny = 83/25\nz = 74/25"
