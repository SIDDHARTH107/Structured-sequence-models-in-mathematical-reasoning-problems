    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, one leg (a) measures 6 units, and the other leg (b) measures 8 units. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\nc² = 6² + 8²\nc² = 36 + 64\nc² = 100\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = √100\nc = 10\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 units."
