    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company can produce at most 200 units of Product A and 300 units of Product B per day. The cost of producing one unit of Product A is $6 while the cost of producing one unit of Product B is $8. The total revenue for selling one unit of Product A is $20, while the total revenue for selling one unit of Product B is $25. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the company produce per day?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B that the company should produce per day. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 200 (maximum units of Product A)\n2. y ≤ 300 (maximum units of Product B)\n\nThe profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nThe revenue for Product A is $20 per unit, and the cost is $6 per unit. So, the profit for Product A is $20 - $6 = $14 per unit.\nSimilarly, the revenue for Product B is $25 per unit, and the cost is $8 per unit. So, the profit for Product B is $25 - $8 = $17 per unit.\n\nThe total profit function can be written as:\n\nTotal Profit = 14x + 17y\n\nWe want to maximize the total profit function subject to the constraints. This is a linear programming problem. The feasible region is a rectangle with vertices at (0, 0), (200, 0), (0, 300), and (200, 300).\n\nWe will evaluate the total profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Total Profit at (0, 0) = 14(0) + 17(0) = $0\n2. Total Profit at (200, 0) = 14(200) + 17(0) = $2800\n3. Total Profit at (0, 300) = 14(0) + 17(300) = $5100\n4. Total Profit at (200, 300) = 14(200) + 17(300) = $2800 + $5100 = $7900\n\nThe maximum total profit is $7900, which occurs when the company produces 200 units of Product A and 300 units of Product B per day."
