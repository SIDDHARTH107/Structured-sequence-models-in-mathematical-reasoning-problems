    "message_1": "Suppose a company hired five new employees with salaries of $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $60,000, and $70,000. What is the median salary of these five employees using the method of absolute deviation?",
    "message_2": "To find the median salary using the method of absolute deviation, we first need to arrange the salaries in ascending order, which is already done: $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $60,000, and $70,000.\n\nSince there are five employees, the median salary is the middle value, which is the third value in the ordered list. Therefore, the median salary is $50,000."
