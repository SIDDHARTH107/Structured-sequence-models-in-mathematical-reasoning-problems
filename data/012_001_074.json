    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex D, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited vertices and initialize the distance of the starting vertex (A) to 0 and the distances of all other vertices to infinity.\n\n2. Select the vertex with the smallest distance (A, with distance 0) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances of its neighboring vertices (B and C). The distance to B is now 7, and the distance to C is now 9.\n\n4. Select the vertex with the smallest distance among the unvisited vertices (B, with distance 7) and mark it as visited.\n\n5. Update the distances of its neighboring vertices (C and D). The distance to C is now min(9, 7+10) = 9, and the distance to D is now min(infinity, 7+15) = 22.\n\n6. Select the vertex with the smallest distance among the unvisited vertices (C, with distance 9) and mark it as visited.\n\n7. Update the distances of its neighboring vertices (D). The distance to D is now min(22, 9+6) = 15.\n\n8. Select the vertex with the smallest distance among the unvisited vertices (D, with distance 15) and mark it as visited.\n\nSince we have now visited the destination vertex (D), we can stop the algorithm. The shortest path from vertex A to vertex D is A -> C -> D with a total weight of 15."
