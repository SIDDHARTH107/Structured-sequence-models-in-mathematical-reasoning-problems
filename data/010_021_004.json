    "message_2": "To find the period of the resulting motion, we need to first write down Hamilton's equations of motion for the given Hamiltonian function. The Hamiltonian function is given by:\n\n$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = T(p_x, p_y) + V(x, y)$,\n\nwhere $T(p_x, p_y)$ is the kinetic energy and $V(x, y)$ is the potential energy. Since we are not given any information about the kinetic energy, we will assume it has the standard form:\n\n$T(p_x, p_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2)$.\n\nNow, the Hamiltonian function is:\n\n$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + x^3 - 3xy^2$.\n\nHamilton's equations of motion are given by:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x}$, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y}$,\n\n$\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$, $\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}$.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = p_x$, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = p_y$,\n\n$\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -3x^2 + 3y^2$, $\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = 6xy$.\n\nNow, we are given that the energy level is $E = 7$. This means that:\n\n$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 7$.\n\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian function, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + x^3 - 3xy^2 = 7$.\n\nTo find the period of the resulting motion, we need to solve this system of differential equations. However, this is a highly nontrivial task, and it is unlikely that there is a closed-form solution for the period. In general, one would need to resort to numerical methods to find the period of the motion for this specific Hamiltonian system."
