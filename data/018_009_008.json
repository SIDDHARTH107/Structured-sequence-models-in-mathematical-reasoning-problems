    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} , B = {3, 4} and C = {5}. Find:\n\n1. (A x B) x C\n2. A x (B x C)\n3. Verify whether the Cartesian product of two sets is associative or not.",
    "message_2": "1. (A x B) x C:\nFirst, we need to find A x B. The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, we need to find (A x B) x C. The Cartesian product (A x B) x C is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) is in A x B and c is in C. So, (A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}.\n\n2. A x (B x C):\nFirst, we need to find B x C. The Cartesian product B x C is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b is in B and c is in C. So, B x C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nNow, we need to find A x (B x C). The Cartesian product A x (B x C) is the set of all ordered pairs (a, (b, c)) where a is in A and (b, c) is in B x C. So, A x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}.\n\n3. Verify whether the Cartesian product of two sets is associative or not:\nTo check if the Cartesian product is associative, we need to see if (A x B) x C = A x (B x C) for all sets A, B, and C.\n\nFrom our calculations above, we have:\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as the elements in the sets have different structures. In (A x B) x C, the elements are of the form ((a, b), c), while in A x (B x C), the elements are of the form (a, (b, c)). Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative."
