    "message_2": "Using inductive logic, we can observe that the difference between each consecutive even number in the sequence is 2. Therefore, to find the next even number in the sequence, we can add 2 to the last given even number, 6:\n\n6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the next even number in the sequence is 8."
