    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to divide a set of 7 distinct objects into 3 non-empty subsets, we can use Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), where n is the number of objects and k is the number of subsets.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and k = 3. The formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo calculate S(7, 3), we first need to find the values of S(6, 3), S(6, 2), S(5, 3), and S(5, 2). Using the formula recursively:\n\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1)\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nWe know that S(n, 1) = 1 for all n, and S(n, n) = 1 for all n. So, we can find the values for S(4, 1), S(4, 2), S(4, 3), and S(4, 4):\n\nS(4, 1) = 1\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 4) = 1\n\nNow we can calculate the values for S(5, 2) and S(5, 3):\n\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\n\nNext, we can calculate the values for S(6, 2) and S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1) = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nFinally, we can calculate the value for S(7, 3):\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2) = 3 * 90 + 31 = 301\n\nSo, there are 301 ways to divide a set of 7 distinct objects into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
