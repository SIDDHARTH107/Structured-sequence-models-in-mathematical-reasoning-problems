    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 4x + 6 > 22, we need to isolate x. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 6 from both sides of the inequality.\n4x + 6 - 6 > 22 - 6\n4x > 16\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the inequality by 4.\n4x/4 > 16/4\nx > 4\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 4.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from 0 to 10 (you can extend it if you want, but this range is enough for our solution).\n2. Locate the number 4 on the number line.\n3. Since the solution is x > 4, we want to represent all the numbers greater than 4. To do this, place an open circle (or parenthesis) at 4 to indicate that 4 is not included in the solution.\n4. Draw an arrow to the right of the open circle, indicating that all numbers greater than 4 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph should look like this:\n\n----(4)----->"
