    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 5| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 5 is positive or zero\n2x + 5 = 11\n2x = 11 - 5\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 2x + 5 is negative\n-(2x + 5) = 11\n-2x - 5 = 11\n-2x = 11 + 5\n-2x = 16\nx = -8\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -8."
