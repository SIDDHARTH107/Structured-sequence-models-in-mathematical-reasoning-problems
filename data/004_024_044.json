    "message_2": "To find the rate of change of the car's speed when x = 3, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x, dy/dx.\n\nGiven the implicit function x² + y² = 100, we can differentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\ndy/dx = -2x / 2y\ndy/dx = -x / y\n\nAt the moment when x = 3, we can find the value of y by plugging x into the implicit function:\n\n3² + y² = 100\n9 + y² = 100\ny² = 91\ny = ±√91\n\nSince the speed of the car cannot be negative, we take the positive value:\n\ny = √91\n\nNow, we can find the rate of change of the car's speed by plugging x and y into the dy/dx equation:\n\ndy/dx = -3 / √91\n\nSo, the rate of change of the car's speed at the moment when x = 3 is -3 / √91."
