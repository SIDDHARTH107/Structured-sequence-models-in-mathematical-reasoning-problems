    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of apples in a grocery store follow a normal distribution with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the probability that the average weight of a random sample of 36 apples is less than 145 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 150 grams, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 20 grams. We have a sample size (n) of 36 apples.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sample mean (x̄) will have a normal distribution with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nMean of the sample mean (μ_x̄) = μ = 150 grams\nStandard deviation of the sample mean (σ_x̄) = σ / √n = 20 / √36 = 20 / 6 = 3.33 grams\n\nNow we want to find the probability that the average weight of a random sample of 36 apples is less than 145 grams. To do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ_x̄) / σ_x̄\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 145 grams. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (145 - 150) / 3.33 ≈ -1.50\n\nNow we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -1.50. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the left of -1.50, which represents the probability we are looking for.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of -1.50 is approximately 0.0668.\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of a random sample of 36 apples is less than 145 grams is approximately 0.0668 or 6.68%."
