    "message_1": "A rectangle has a length of 15 cm and a width of 8 cm. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 15 cm and the width is 8 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (15 + 8) = 2 * (23) = 46 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 46 cm."
