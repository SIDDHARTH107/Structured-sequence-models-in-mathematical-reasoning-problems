    "message_2": "To prove the statement \"If X is a prime number greater than 2, then X+1 is not a prime number\" using intuitionistic logic, we can use the properties of prime numbers and even numbers.\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a type of mathematical logic that requires a more constructive proof than classical logic. In this case, we can provide a constructive proof by showing that if X is a prime number greater than 2, then X+1 must be an even number, and therefore not prime.\n\nProof:\n\n1. Let X be a prime number greater than 2.\n2. By definition, a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n3. Since X is greater than 2, it must be an odd number (as 2 is the only even prime number).\n4. Let X = 2n + 1, where n is an integer (this is the general form of an odd number).\n5. Now consider X+1: X+1 = (2n + 1) + 1 = 2n + 2 = 2(n + 1).\n6. We can see that X+1 is divisible by 2, as it can be written in the form 2(n + 1), where n + 1 is an integer.\n7. Since X+1 is divisible by 2, it is an even number.\n8. An even number greater than 2 cannot be a prime number, as it has at least three distinct positive divisors: 1, 2, and itself.\n9. Therefore, if X is a prime number greater than 2, then X+1 is not a prime number.\n\nThis proof shows that the statement is true using intuitionistic logic, as we have provided a constructive proof based on the properties of prime numbers and even numbers."
