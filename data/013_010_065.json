    "message_1": "In a Cournot duopoly, two companies, A and B, produce identical products. Company A has a total cost function of TC(Qa) = 8Qa and Company B has a total cost function of TC(Qb) = 10Qb. The inverse demand function is P(Q) = 120 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both companies. Determine the quantities produced by each company and the market price at equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantities and market price, we first need to find the reaction functions for both companies. The reaction function shows the best response of one company to the output of the other company.\n\nFirst, let's find the marginal cost for each company:\nMC(Qa) = d(TC(Qa))/dQa = 8\nMC(Qb) = d(TC(Qb))/dQb = 10\n\nNext, we find the marginal revenue for each company. The total revenue for each company is given by:\nTR(Qa) = P(Q) * Qa = (120 - Q) * Qa = 120Qa - Qa^2 - QaQb\nTR(Qb) = P(Q) * Qb = (120 - Q) * Qb = 120Qb - Qb^2 - QaQb\n\nNow, we find the marginal revenue by taking the derivative of the total revenue with respect to each company's output:\nMR(Qa) = d(TR(Qa))/dQa = 120 - 2Qa - Qb\nMR(Qb) = d(TR(Qb))/dQb = 120 - 2Qb - Qa\n\nIn equilibrium, each company's marginal cost equals its marginal revenue:\nMC(Qa) = MR(Qa) => 8 = 120 - 2Qa - Qb\nMC(Qb) = MR(Qb) => 10 = 120 - 2Qb - Qa\n\nNow, we solve this system of linear equations for Qa and Qb:\nFrom the first equation, Qb = 112 - 2Qa\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n10 = 120 - 2Qb - Qa => 10 = 120 - 2(112 - 2Qa) - Qa\nSolve for Qa:\n10 = 120 - 224 + 4Qa - Qa => 3Qa = 114 => Qa = 38\n\nNow, substitute Qa back into the equation for Qb:\nQb = 112 - 2(38) => Qb = 112 - 76 => Qb = 36\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantities are Qa = 38 and Qb = 36. Now, we can find the market price at equilibrium using the inverse demand function:\nP(Q) = 120 - Q => P(38 + 36) = 120 - 74 => P = 46\n\nIn equilibrium, Company A produces 38 units, Company B produces 36 units, and the market price is 46."
