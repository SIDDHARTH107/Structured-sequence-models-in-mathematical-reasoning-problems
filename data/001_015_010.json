    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can start by expressing 27 as a power of 3:\n\n$27 = 3^3$\n\nNow we have:\n\n$3^{2x-1} = 3^3$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n$2x - 1 = 3$\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n$2x = 4$\n\n$x = 2$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = 2$."
