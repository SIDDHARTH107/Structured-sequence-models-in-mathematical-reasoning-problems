    "message_1": "Suppose that in a school there are 150 students in total and 60 of them are enrolled in an advanced math course. If a teacher selects 20 students at random for a competition, what is the probability that exactly 8 of the selected students are from the advanced math course?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the hypergeometric probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k)) / C(N, n)\n\nwhere:\n- N is the total number of students (150)\n- K is the number of students in the advanced math course (60)\n- n is the number of students selected for the competition (20)\n- k is the number of advanced math students we want in the selected group (8)\n- C(a, b) represents the number of combinations of choosing b items from a set of a items, which can be calculated as C(a, b) = a! / (b! * (a-b)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 8) = (C(60, 8) * C(150-60, 20-8)) / C(150, 20)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the combinations:\n\nC(60, 8) = 60! / (8! * (60-8)!) = 60! / (8! * 52!) ≈ 5,461,512\nC(90, 12) = 90! / (12! * (90-12)!) = 90! / (12! * 78!) ≈ 3,153,341,040\nC(150, 20) = 150! / (20! * (150-20)!) = 150! / (20! * 130!) ≈ 5,518,167,243,760\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 8) = (5,461,512 * 3,153,341,040) / 5,518,167,243,760 ≈ 0.187\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 8 of the selected students are from the advanced math course is approximately 0.187 or 18.7%."
