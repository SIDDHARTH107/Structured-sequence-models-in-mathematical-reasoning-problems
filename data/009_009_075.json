    "message_2": "To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle with mass $m=1$ and potential energy function $V(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ in a one-dimensional space with a well-defined energy of $E = 2$, we first plug in the given values into the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2}\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\psi(x) = 2\\psi(x)$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$-\\hbar^{2}\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}} + x^{2}\\psi(x) = 4\\psi(x)$$\n\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the wave function $\\psi(x)$. The equation is a well-known problem in quantum mechanics called the quantum harmonic oscillator. The general solution to this equation can be expressed in terms of Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions.\n\nThe wave function for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\n$$\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n n!}} \\left(\\frac{m\\omega}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} e^{-\\frac{m\\omega x^2}{2\\hbar}} H_n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{\\hbar}}x\\right)$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the quantum number (non-negative integer), $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator, and $H_n(x)$ are the Hermite polynomials.\n\nTo find the specific solution for the given energy $E=2$, we need to determine the value of $n$ and $\\omega$. The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\n$$E_n = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nGiven $E=2$, we can solve for $n$ and $\\omega$:\n\n$$2 = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nHowever, without knowing the value of $\\hbar$ or $\\omega$, we cannot determine the exact value of $n$. Nonetheless, the general form of the wave function for the quantum harmonic oscillator is the solution to the given problem."
