    "message_2": "A surface with genus 2 is a surface with two \"holes\" or handles, like a double torus. To determine the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a regular polyhedral decomposition of this surface, we can use the Euler characteristic formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere χ is the Euler characteristic, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a surface with genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nSince we have a surface with genus 2, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = -2\n\nNow, let's consider a regular polyhedral decomposition of this surface. Suppose that each face has p sides (or edges) and each vertex has q edges. Then, by the definition of a regular polyhedron, we have:\n\nE = (1/2)pF (since each edge is shared by two faces)\nE = qV (since each vertex is shared by q edges)\n\nNow, we can use the Euler characteristic formula:\n\n-2 = V - E + F\n\nSubstituting the expressions for E:\n\n-2 = V - (1/2)pF + F\n-2 = V - qV + (1/2)pF\n\nNow, we can solve for F in terms of V:\n\nF = (2 + (q - (1/2)p)V) / ((1/2)p)\n\nSince F, V, p, and q are all integers (as they represent the number of faces, vertices, and edges), we can look for integer solutions that satisfy the equation. One possible solution is:\n\np = 4 (each face is a quadrilateral)\nq = 4 (each vertex has 4 edges)\n\nWith these values, we have:\n\nF = (2 + (4 - (1/2)(4))V) / ((1/2)(4))\nF = V\n\nNow, substituting this back into the Euler characteristic formula:\n\n-2 = V - E + V\n-2 = 2V - E\n\nSince E = qV, we have:\n\n-2 = 2V - 4V\n2V = 4\nV = 2\n\nNow, we can find the number of faces:\n\nF = V = 2\n\nAnd the number of edges:\n\nE = qV = 4(2) = 8\n\nSo, a regular polyhedral decomposition of a surface with genus 2 has 2 vertices, 8 edges, and 2 faces."
