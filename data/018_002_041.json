Therefore, the intersection of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, let's verify that this intersection is a subset of both A and B. A subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set.\n\nFor A ∩ B to be a subset of A, all elements in A ∩ B must be in A. Since 4 and 8 are both in A, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nFor A ∩ B to be a subset of B, all elements in A ∩ B must be in B. Since 4 and 8 are both in B, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of sets A and B, A ∩ B = {4, 8}, is a subset of both A and B."
