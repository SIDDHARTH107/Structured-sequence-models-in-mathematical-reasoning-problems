    "message_2": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 100π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.1416, the surface area is:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 100 * 3.1416 cm^2\n\nSurface Area ≈ 314.16 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters."
