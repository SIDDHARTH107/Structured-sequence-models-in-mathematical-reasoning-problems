    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the finite difference method to approximate the solution of the heat equation. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = D(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient (D = 1 in this case), u(x, y, t) is the intensity value at position (x, y) and time t, and the partial derivatives represent the spatial and temporal changes in intensity.\n\nWe will use the forward difference for time and central difference for space. Let Δx = Δy = 1 and Δt = 1. Then, the finite difference approximation is:\n\n(u(x, y, t+1) - u(x, y, t))/Δt = D * ((u(x+1, y, t) - 2u(x, y, t) + u(x-1, y, t))/Δx² + (u(x, y+1, t) - 2u(x, y, t) + u(x, y-1, t))/Δy²)\n\nRearranging the terms, we get the update formula for u(x, y, t+1):\n\nu(x, y, t+1) = u(x, y, t) + D * Δt * ((u(x+1, y, t) - 2u(x, y, t) + u(x-1, y, t))/Δx² + (u(x, y+1, t) - 2u(x, y, t) + u(x, y-1, t))/Δy²)\n\nNow, we will apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. Left boundary: u(0, y, t) = 0\n2. Top boundary: u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t)\n3. Right boundary: u(3, y, t) = 255\n4. Bottom boundary: u(x, 3, t) = u(x, 2, t)\n\nUsing the update formula and boundary conditions, we can compute the intensity values at time t = 1:\n\nu(1,1,1) = 20 + 1 * (30 - 2*20 + 10 + 30 - 2*20 + 20) = 20 + 20 = 40\nu(1,2,1) = 30 + 1 * (40 - 2*30 + 20 + 40 - 2*30 + 30) = 30 + 10 = 40\nu(2,1,1) = 30 + 1 * (40 - 2*30 + 20 + 50 - 2*30 + 20) = 30 + 10 = 40\nu(2,2,1) = 40 + 1 * (50 - 2*40 + 30 + 60 - 2*40 + 30) = 40 + 0 = 40\n\nSo, the intensity values at time t = 1 are:\n\n[ 10, 20, 30, 40 ]\n\n[  0, 40, 40, 50 ]\n\n[ 20, 40, 40, 60 ]\n\n[ 40, 50, 60, 70 ]"
