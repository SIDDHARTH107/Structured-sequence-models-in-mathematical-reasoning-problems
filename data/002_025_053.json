    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, one of the equal angles is 60 degrees and the length of the other two sides are 8 cm each. What is the length of the third side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the vertices of the isosceles triangle as A, B, and C, with vertex A being the one with the 60-degree angle. Since the triangle is isosceles, angles B and C are equal, and the sides opposite to these angles (AB and AC) have the same length of 8 cm each.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side BC:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = b = 8 cm, and angle C = 180 - 60 = 120 degrees.\n\nc² = 8² + 8² - 2 * 8 * 8 * cos(120)\nc² = 64 + 64 - 128 * (-1/2)\nc² = 128 + 64\nc² = 192\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √192 ≈ 13.86 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is approximately 13.86 cm."
