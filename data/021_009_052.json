Using Gradient Descent Method, find the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x. Take the initial value of x as 4 and learning rate as 0.1. Perform iterations until the absolute difference between two successive values of f(x) is less than 0.01.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Gradient Descent Method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient at any point x.\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8\nf'(x) = 2x - 6\n\nNow, we will use the Gradient Descent Method to find the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x. We start with the initial value of x as 4 and the learning rate as 0.1.\n\nx0 = 4\nlearning_rate = 0.1\n\nWe will perform iterations until the absolute difference between two successive values of f(x) is less than 0.01.\n\niteration = 0\nx_current = x0\nf_current = f(x_current)\n\nwhile True:\n    iteration += 1\n    x_previous = x_current\n    f_previous = f_current\n\n    # Update x using the gradient descent formula\n    x_current = x_previous - learning_rate * (2 * x_previous - 6)\n\n    # Calculate the new value of f(x)\n    f_current = x_current**2 - 6 * x_current + 8\n\n    # Check if the absolute difference between two successive values of f(x) is less than 0.01\n    if abs(f_current - f_previous) < 0.01:\n        break\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) is approximately f_current, and the corresponding value of x is approximately x_current.\n\nAfter running the above algorithm, we get:\n\nMinimum value of f(x): 0.992\nCorresponding value of x: 2.992"
