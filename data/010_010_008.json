    "message_2": "1) To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2 + y^2, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 6x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\n2y = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have y = 0. Now, let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\nx(3x - 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: x = 0 and x = 2. Therefore, we have two critical points: (0, 0) and (2, 0).\n\n2) Morse theory is a tool used in differential topology to study the topology of a manifold using the critical points of a smooth function on that manifold. In this case, we are given a range of [-5, 5] for both x and y, and we want to find the number of critical points of f in that range.\n\nSince we have already found the critical points of f, we just need to check if they are within the given range:\n\n(0, 0) is within the range [-5, 5] for both x and y.\n(2, 0) is also within the range [-5, 5] for both x and y.\n\nThus, there are 2 critical points of f in the range [-5, 5]."
