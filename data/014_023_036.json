    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted the following message that was encrypted using a Rail fence cipher with three rails: \n\n```\nTNEESRSEOTPHOOWEUFEAARARL\n```\n\nDecrypt the message by rearranging the letters into their original positions.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail fence cipher with three rails, we need to rearrange the letters in a zigzag pattern. First, we determine the length of the message, which is 25 characters. Then, we divide the message into three parts:\n\n1. Top rail: T E E R E O O E U A A A L (7 characters)\n2. Middle rail: N S S T P H W F E R R (11 characters)\n3. Bottom rail: E O P O (4 characters)\n\nNow, we can rearrange the letters in a zigzag pattern:\n\n```\nT . . . E . . . E . . . R . . . E . . . O . . . O . . . E . . . U . . . A . . . A . . . A . . . L\n. N . S . S . T . P . H . W . F . E . R . R .\n. . E . . . O . . . P . . . O . . .\n```\n\nReading the message row by row, we get the decrypted message:\n\n```\nTHERESEONETWOFALSEARUOP\n```\n\nHowever, this message doesn't seem to make sense. It's possible that the message was encrypted with a different number of rails or that there is a typo in the encrypted message."
