The particle is in the ground state with wave function given by:\nψ(x) = (2/L)^(1/2) * sin(pi * x / L)\n\nWhat is the probability of finding the particle between x = 0 and x = L/4?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding the particle between x = 0 and x = L/4, we need to integrate the square of the wave function (ψ^2(x)) over this interval. \n\nThe square of the wave function is given by:\n\nψ^2(x) = (2/L) * sin^2(pi * x / L)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this function over the interval [0, L/4]:\n\nP(x) = ∫[0, L/4] (2/L) * sin^2(pi * x / L) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the identity:\n\nsin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2\n\nSo, we have:\n\nP(x) = ∫[0, L/4] (2/L) * (1 - cos(2 * pi * x / L))/2 dx\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nP(x) = (2/L) * ∫[0, L/4] (1/2 - (1/2)cos(2 * pi * x / L)) dx\n\nLet's integrate each term separately:\n\n∫[0, L/4] (1/2) dx = (1/2) * [x] from 0 to L/4 = (1/2) * (L/4) = L/8\n\n∫[0, L/4] (-1/2)cos(2 * pi * x / L) dx = (-1/2) * [sin(2 * pi * x / L) * (L / (4 * pi))] from 0 to L/4\n\n= (-1/2) * (L / (4 * pi)) * (sin(pi/2) - sin(0)) = (-1/2) * (L / (4 * pi)) * (1 - 0) = -L/(8 * pi)\n\nNow, we can add these two results together:\n\nP(x) = (2/L) * (L/8 - (-L/(8 * pi)))\n\nP(x) = (1/4) + (1/(4 * pi))\n\nThis is the probability of finding the particle between x = 0 and x = L/4."
