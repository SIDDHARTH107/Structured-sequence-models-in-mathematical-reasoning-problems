    "message_2": "To form a committee of 5 people from a group of 12 people, we need to find the number of combinations. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (12 in this case) and k is the number of people to be selected (5 in this case).\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!7!)\n\nC(12, 5) = (12*11*10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(7*6*5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(12, 5) = (12*11*10*9*8) / (5*4*3*2*1)\n\nC(12, 5) = 95040 / 120\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nSo, there are 792 different committees that can be formed."
