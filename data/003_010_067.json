    "message_1": "A tree casts a 30-meter long shadow on the ground. The angle of elevation from the tip of the shadow to the top of the tree is 60 degrees. What is the height of the tree to the nearest meter, using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this problem, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and the length of the shadow (adjacent side) is 30 meters. We want to find the height of the tree (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 30\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\nheight = 30 * tan(60°)\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to √3:\n\nheight = 30 * √3\n\nNow, we can calculate the height:\n\nheight ≈ 30 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 51.96\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tree is approximately 52 meters."
