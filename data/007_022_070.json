If there is, we will add the point (x, y) to our list of points on the curve.\n\nThe equation is y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 (mod 11).\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 2 (mod 11)\nThere is no y value that satisfies this equation.\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 5 (mod 11)\ny = 4, 7 (mod 11)\nPoints: (1, 4), (1, 7)\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 14 (mod 11) = 3 (mod 11)\nThere is no y value that satisfies this equation.\n\nFor x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 35 (mod 11) = 2 (mod 11)\nThere is no y value that satisfies this equation.\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 74 (mod 11) = 6 (mod 11)\ny = 5, 6 (mod 11)\nPoints: (4, 5), (4, 6)\n\nFor x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 2*5 + 2 = 137 (mod 11) = 1 (mod 11)\ny = 1, 10 (mod 11)\nPoints: (5, 1), (5, 10)\n\nFor x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 230 (mod 11) = 0 (mod 11)\ny = 0 (mod 11)\nPoint: (6, 0)\n\nFor x = 7:\ny^2 = 7^3 + 2*7 + 2 = 359 (mod 11) = 7 (mod 11)\nThere is no y value that satisfies this equation.\n\nFor x = 8:\ny^2 = 8^3 + 2*8 + 2 = 530 (mod 11) = 3 (mod 11)\ny = 5, 6 (mod 11)\nPoints: (8, 5), (8, 6)\n\nFor x = 9:\ny^2 = 9^3 + 2*9 + 2 = 749 (mod 11) = 10 (mod 11)\ny = 3, 8 (mod 11)\nPoints: (9, 3), (9, 8)\n\nFor x = 10:\ny^2 = 10^3 + 2*10 + 2 = 1022 (mod 11) = 4 (mod 11)\ny = 2, 9 (mod 11)\nPoints: (10, 2), (10, 9)\n\nSo, the points on the curve are:\n(1, 4), (1, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 10), (6, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 8), (10, 2), (10, 9)\n\n2.
