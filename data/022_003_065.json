    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (i.e., holomorphic) on a simply connected domain D and its boundary, then the integral of the function over any closed contour in D is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = 3z^2 + 2iz - 5 is a polynomial, and polynomials are holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic on the domain D containing the circular contour C: |z-1| = 3 and its boundary.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic on D and its boundary, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) over the contour C is zero.\n\nSo, the value of the integral of the function f(z) = 3z^2 + 2iz - 5 over the circular contour C: |z-1| = 3, traversed once anticlockwise starting at point z = 4, is 0."
