    "message_2": "The fundamental group of a topological space is a group that captures information about the loops in the space. For the 3D torus, which is also known as the three-dimensional torus or T^3, the fundamental group is given by the direct product of three copies of the integers, denoted as:\n\nπ1(T^3) = Z × Z × Z\n\nHere, Z represents the group of integers under addition. This result can be understood by considering that the 3D torus can be formed by gluing the opposite faces of a cube, and there are three independent loops that can be formed by going around each pair of opposite faces. Each of these loops corresponds to one of the factors of Z in the direct product."
