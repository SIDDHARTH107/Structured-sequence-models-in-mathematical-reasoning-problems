    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle $|z-2|=2$ under the mapping $f(z)=\\frac{1}{z-1}$, we first need to find the inverse of the mapping $f(z)$. Let $w=f(z)$. Then, we have:\n\n$w = \\frac{1}{z-1}$\n\nNow, we solve for $z$:\n\n$z-1 = \\frac{1}{w}$\n\n$z = \\frac{1}{w} + 1$\n\nNow, we substitute $z$ with the inverse mapping in the equation of the circle:\n\n$|\\frac{1}{w} + 1 - 2| = 2$\n\n$|\\frac{1}{w} - 1| = 2$\n\nNow, we solve for $w$:\n\n$\\left|\\frac{1-w}{w}\\right| = 2$\n\n$\\frac{1-w}{w} = 2$ or $\\frac{1-w}{w} = -2$\n\nFor the first case, we have:\n\n$1-w = 2w$\n\n$w = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nFor the second case, we have:\n\n$1-w = -2w$\n\n$w = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThus, the image of the circle under the given mapping is a single point, $w = \\frac{1}{3}$."
