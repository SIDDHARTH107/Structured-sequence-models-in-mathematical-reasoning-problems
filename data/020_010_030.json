    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $15. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of machine time and each unit of Product B requires 3 hours of machine time. The company has a total of 16 hours of machine time available per day. However, due to the possibility of machine breakdowns, the company wants to make sure that they can still produce at least 10 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B even in the worst-case scenario. What is the maximum profit the company can make per day while satisfying these constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nThe machine time constraint is given by 2x + 3y ≤ 16.\n\nThe company wants to ensure that they can produce at least 10 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B in the worst-case scenario. Therefore, x ≥ 10 and y ≥ 5.\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of P(x, y) subject to these constraints.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 16\nx ≥ 10\ny ≥ 5\n\nNow, let's find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (x, y) = (10, 5) - This is the worst-case scenario where the company produces the minimum required units of both products.\n2. (x, y) = (10, 0) - This is not in the feasible region because y ≥ 5.\n3. (x, y) = (0, 5) - This is not in the feasible region because x ≥ 10.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function at the corner point (10, 5):\n\nP(10, 5) = 10(10) + 15(5) = 100 + 75 = $175\n\nSince there is only one corner point in the feasible region, the maximum profit the company can make per day while satisfying the constraints is $175."
