    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average salary of its employees. They choose a simple random sample of 100 employees from a total of 500 employees. The sample mean salary is $50,000 and the sample standard deviation is $5,000. Estimate the true population mean salary with a 95% confidence level.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the true population mean salary with a 95% confidence level, we will use the formula for the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is $50,000, the sample standard deviation is $5,000, and the sample size is 100 employees. For a 95% confidence level, the critical value (z-score) is 1.96.\n\nConfidence Interval = $50,000 ± (1.96 * ($5,000 / √100))\n\nConfidence Interval = $50,000 ± (1.96 * ($5,000 / 10))\n\nConfidence Interval = $50,000 ± (1.96 * $500)\n\nConfidence Interval = $50,000 ± $980\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean salary is between $49,020 and $50,980."
