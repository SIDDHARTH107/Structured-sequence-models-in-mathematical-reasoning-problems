    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x-2)/(4x+3) = 7/11, we can use the cross-multiplication method:\n\n(3x - 2) * 11 = (4x + 3) * 7\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n33x - 22 = 28x + 21\n\nNow, isolate the x term by subtracting 28x from both sides:\n\n33x - 28x = 21 + 22\n\n5x = 43\n\nNow, divide by 5 to solve for x:\n\nx = 43/5"
