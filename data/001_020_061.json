    "message_2": "To find the range of values of x that satisfy the equation |x + 3| + 5 = 8, we first need to isolate the absolute value term.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n|x + 3| = 3\n\nStep 2: Consider the two possible cases for the absolute value:\n\nCase 1: x + 3 is non-negative (x + 3 â‰¥ 0)\nx + 3 = 3\nx = 0\n\nCase 2: x + 3 is negative (x + 3 < 0)\n-(x + 3) = 3\n-x - 3 = 3\n-x = 6\nx = -6\n\nSo, the range of values of x that satisfy the equation |x + 3| + 5 = 8 is x = 0 and x = -6."
