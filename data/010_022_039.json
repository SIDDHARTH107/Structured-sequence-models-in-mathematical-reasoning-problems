    "message_2": "In the contact geometry approach, we consider the distance between two points as the length of the shortest path between them. In this case, we want to find the distance between the center of the circle (0,0) and the point (3,4).\n\nWe can use the distance formula to find the distance between these two points:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of the center of the circle (0,0) and the point (3,4):\n\nDistance = √((3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2)\nDistance = √(3^2 + 4^2)\nDistance = √(9 + 16)\nDistance = √25\nDistance = 5 cm\n\nSo, the distance between the center of the circle and the point (3,4) is 5 cm."
