    "message_1": "Suppose a store sells T-shirts in three different colors (red, blue, and green) and in four different sizes (small, medium, large and XL). If the store has an unlimited number of T-shirts in each size and color, how many different combinations of T-shirts can the store offer to its customers?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of different combinations of T-shirts the store can offer, we need to multiply the number of colors by the number of sizes. There are 3 colors (red, blue, and green) and 4 sizes (small, medium, large, and XL).\n\nSo, the total number of combinations is:\n\n3 colors * 4 sizes = 12 different combinations of T-shirts."
