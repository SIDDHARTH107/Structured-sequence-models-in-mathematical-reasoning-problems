    "message_2": "To prove that (AxB)' is not equal to A'xB', we will first find the Cartesian product AxB, and then find its complement (AxB)'. After that, we will find the complements of A and B, i.e., A' and B', and then find their Cartesian product A'xB'. Finally, we will show that (AxB)' and A'xB' are not equal.\n\n1. Cartesian product AxB:\nAxB = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\n2. Complement of AxB, denoted as (AxB)':\n(AxB)' = {(x, y) | x ∉ A or y ∉ B}\nSince A = {1,2} and B = {3,4}, the complement of AxB will include all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x is not 1 or 2, or y is not 3 or 4. This means that (AxB)' includes all ordered pairs except for those in AxB.\n\n3. Complements of A and B:\nA' = {x | x ∉ A} = All elements except 1 and 2\nB' = {y | y ∉ B} = All elements except 3 and 4\n\n4. Cartesian product A'xB':\nA'xB' = {(a', b') | a' ∈ A', b' ∈ B'}\nSince A' and B' include all elements except those in A and B, the Cartesian product A'xB' will include all ordered pairs (a', b') such that a' is not 1 or 2, and b' is not 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's compare (AxB)' and A'xB':\n\n(AxB)' includes all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x is not 1 or 2, or y is not 3 or 4.\nA'xB' includes all ordered pairs (a', b') such that a' is not 1 or 2, and b' is not 3 or 4.\n\nNotice the difference between \"or\" in (AxB)' and \"and\" in A'xB'. This difference implies that (AxB)' and A'xB' are not equal, as they represent different sets of ordered pairs. Therefore, we have proved that (AxB)' is not equal to A'xB'."
