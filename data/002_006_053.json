    "message_1": "A circular garden has a diameter of 14 feet. What is the circumference of the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nIn this case, the diameter of the garden is 14 feet. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = πd\nC = 3.14159 × 14\nC ≈ 44.0 feet\n\nThe circumference of the garden is approximately 44.0 feet."
