    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The outcomes we are interested in are rolling a 2 or a 4. There are 2 favorable outcomes (2 and 4) out of the 6 possible outcomes. \n\nTo find the probability, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 2 / 6\n\nProbability = 1 / 3\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 2 or a 4 on a fair six-sided die is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)."
