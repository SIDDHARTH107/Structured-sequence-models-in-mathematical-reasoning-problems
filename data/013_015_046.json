    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to handle a project. The project may either succeed or fail. If it succeeds, the principal can earn a profit of $100,000. If it fails, the principal incurs a loss of $50,000. The principal can offer the agent an incentive scheme where the agent can choose between two effort levels: low effort which costs $20,000 or high effort which costs $40,000. The probability of project success is 0.5 under low effort and 0.8 under high effort. If the agent chooses low effort and the project fails, the agent will not receive any payment, whereas if the agent chooses high effort and the project fails, the agent will be paid a consolation payment of $10,000. If the project succeeds, the principal will pay the agent a commission on the profit earned, which is 2% for low effort and 4% for high effort. Which effort level should the agent choose, and what would be the expected payoff for both the principal and the agent?",
    "message_2": "To determine which effort level the agent should choose, we need to calculate the expected payoff for the agent under both low effort and high effort scenarios.\n\nLow Effort:\n- Probability of success: 0.5\n- Commission on success: 2% of $100,000 = $2,000\n- Cost of low effort: $20,000\n\nExpected payoff for the agent under low effort = (0.5 * $2,000) - $20,000 = $1,000 - $20,000 = -$19,000\n\nHigh Effort:\n- Probability of success: 0.8\n- Commission on success: 4% of $100,000 = $4,000\n- Cost of high effort: $40,000\n- Consolation payment on failure: $10,000\n\nExpected payoff for the agent under high effort = (0.8 * $4,000) - $40,000 + (0.2 * $10,000) = $3,200 - $40,000 + $2,000 = -$34,800 + $2,000 = -$32,800\n\nSince the expected payoff for the agent is higher under low effort (-$19,000) compared to high effort (-$32,800), the agent should choose low effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff for the principal under both scenarios.\n\nLow Effort:\n- Probability of success: 0.5\n- Profit on success: $100,000 - $2,000 (agent's commission) = $98,000\n- Loss on failure: -$50,000\n\nExpected payoff for the principal under low effort = (0.5 * $98,000) + (0.5 * -$50,000) = $49,000 - $25,000 = $24,000\n\nHigh Effort:\n- Probability of success: 0.8\n- Profit on success: $100,000 - $4,000 (agent's commission) = $96,000\n- Loss on failure: -$50,000 + $10,000 (consolation payment to the agent) = -$40,000\n\nExpected payoff for the principal under high effort = (0.8 * $96,000) + (0.2 * -$40,000) = $76,800 - $8,000 = $68,800\n\nIn conclusion, the agent should choose low effort, and the expected payoffs for the principal and the agent would be $24,000 and -$19,000, respectively. However, it is important to note that the principal would have a higher expected payoff if the agent chose high effort. The principal may need to adjust the incentive scheme to encourage the agent to choose high effort, which would result in a higher expected payoff for both parties."
