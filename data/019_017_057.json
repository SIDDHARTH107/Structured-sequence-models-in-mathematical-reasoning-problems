What is the size of the universe of discourse?\n2. What is the range of the function f?\n3. Is the function f injective (one-to-one)?\n4. Is the function f surjective (onto)?",
    "message_2": "1. The size of the universe of discourse, which is the set A, is 3 since A = {1, 2, 3}.\n\n2. The range of the function f is the set of all possible output values. In this case, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, and f(3) = 1. Therefore, the range of f is {1, 2}.\n\n3. The function f is not injective (one-to-one) because f(1) = f(3) = 1. In a one-to-one function, each element in the domain must map to a unique element in the codomain, which is not the case here.\n\n4. The function f is surjective (onto) if every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. In this case, the codomain is not explicitly given, but we can assume it to be the set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3} since the domain is {1, 2, 3}. Since the range of f is {1, 2}, which does not cover the entire codomain, the function f is not surjective (onto)."
