At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall? (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
    "message_2": "We can use related rates to solve this problem. Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and let y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder has a length of 15 feet, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n\nWe are also given that the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 9 feet.\n\nFirst, we need to differentiate the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd/dt(x^2 + y^2) = d/dt(15^2)\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(9)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nTo find the value of y when x = 9, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n9^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n81 + y^2 = 225\ny^2 = 144\ny = 12\n\nNow we can plug in the value of y and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(9)(2) + 2(12)(dy/dt) = 0\n36 + 24(dy/dt) = 0\n24(dy/dt) = -36\ndy/dt = -36/24\ndy/dt = -1.5\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 feet per second when the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall."
