    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 20, we have |G| = 20 = 2^2 * 5. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 4.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 = 1. This implies that P is a normal subgroup of G since it is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroup Q. Since |Q| = 4, Q is either isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_4 or the Klein four-group V_4. If Q is isomorphic to Z_4, then G would have an element of order 4, which would imply that G is cyclic (since lcm(4, 5) = 20). However, we are given that G is not cyclic, so Q must be isomorphic to V_4.\n\nNow, since P is normal in G, we can form the semi-direct product of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q. The semi-direct product is determined by a homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P), where Aut(P) is the group of automorphisms of P. Since P is isomorphic to Z_5, Aut(P) is isomorphic to Z_4.\n\nThe homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P) has the following possibilities:\n\n1. φ is the trivial homomorphism, which means that every element of Q is mapped to the identity automorphism of P. In this case, the semi-direct product P ⋊ Q is the direct product P × Q, which is isomorphic to Z_5 × V_4, a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\n2. φ is a non-trivial homomorphism. In this case, there exists an element of Q that is mapped to an automorphism of order 2 in Aut(P). This automorphism corresponds to the inversion map in Z_5, which sends an element x to its inverse x^(-1). The semi-direct product P ⋊ Q in this case is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a non-cyclic group of order 20, then G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20 (Z_5 × V_4)."
