The market demand curve is given by P(Q) = 240 - Q, where Q = qa + qb is the total market quantity. The cost functions for both firms are given by CA(qa) = 40qa and CB(qb) = 60qb, respectively. Find the Cournot equilibrium output levels and prices for both firms.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot equilibrium output levels and prices for both firms, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the output level chosen by the other firm.\n\nLet's start with firm A. Firm A's profit function is given by:\n\nπA(qa, qb) = P(Q) * qa - CA(qa) = (240 - (qa + qb)) * qa - 40qa\n\nTo find the best response of firm A, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to qa. To do this, we take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to qa and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπA(qa, qb) / dqa = (240 - 2qa - qb) - 40 = 0\n\nSolving for qa, we get firm A's reaction function:\n\nqa = (200 - qb) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the reaction function for firm B. Firm B's profit function is given by:\n\nπB(qa, qb) = P(Q) * qb - CB(qb) = (240 - (qa + qb)) * qb - 60qb\n\nTo find the best response of firm B, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to qb. To do this, we take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to qb and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπB(qa, qb) / dqb = (240 - qa - 2qb) - 60 = 0\n\nSolving for qb, we get firm B's reaction function:\n\nqb = (180 - qa) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the Cournot equilibrium output levels by solving the system of reaction functions:\n\nqa = (200 - qb) / 2\nqb = (180 - qa) / 2\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nqa = (200 - ((180 - qa) / 2)) / 2\n\nSolving for qa, we get:\n\nqa = 80\n\nNow, substituting the value of qa back into the second equation, we get:\n\nqb = (180 - 80) / 2\nqb = 50\n\nSo, the Cournot equilibrium output levels are qa = 80 and qb = 50.\n\nNow, let's find the equilibrium price. We know that the market demand curve is given by P(Q) = 240 - Q, where Q = qa + qb. Plugging in the equilibrium output levels, we get:\n\nP(Q) = 240 - (80 + 50) = 240 - 130 = 110\n\nSo, the Cournot equilibrium price is $110.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cournot equilibrium output levels for firms A and B are 80 and 50, respectively, and the equilibrium price is $110."
