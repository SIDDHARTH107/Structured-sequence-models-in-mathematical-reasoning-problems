    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the keyword and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is usually combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\nKeyword: CRYPTOGAHBDEFIKLMNQSUVWXZ\nGrid:\nC R Y P T\nO G A H B\nD E F I K\nL M N Q S\nU V W X Z\n\n2. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an \"X\" between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add an \"X\" at the end.\n\nPlaintext: MATHEMATICS\nDigraphs: MA TH EM AT IC SX\n\n3. Encrypt each digraph using the grid:\n- If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around if necessary).\n- If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n- If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nMA -> OD\nTH -> YP\nEM -> GA\nAT -> TB\nIC -> FK\nSX -> QW\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n\nCiphertext: ODYPGATBFKQW"
