Let's denote the given congruences as follows:\n\nx ≡ a1 (mod n1),\nx ≡ a2 (mod n2),\nx ≡ a3 (mod n3),\n\nwhere a1 = 2, n1 = 3, a2 = 3, n2 = 4, a3 = 1, and n3 = 5.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solution for x can be found using the following formula:\n\nx = (Σ(ai * Ni * yi)) mod N,\n\nwhere N = n1 * n2 * n3, Ni = N / ni, and yi is the modular inverse of Ni (mod ni).\n\nFirst, let's find N:\n\nN = n1 * n2 * n3 = 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.\n\nNow, let's find N1, N2, and N3:\n\nN1 = N / n1 = 60 / 3 = 20,\nN2 = N / n2 = 60 / 4 = 15,\nN3 = N / n3 = 60 / 5 = 12.\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses y1, y2, and y3:\n\ny1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod n1) => 20^(-1) (mod 3),\ny2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod n2) => 15^(-1) (mod 4),\ny3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod n3) => 12^(-1) (mod 5).\n\nWe can find the modular inverses using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or by trial and error:\n\ny1 = 2 (since 20 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)),\ny2 = 3 (since 15 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4)),\ny3 = 3 (since 12 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5)).\n\nNow, we can find x using the formula:\n\nx = (Σ(ai * Ni * yi)) mod N\n  = (a1 * N1 * y1 + a2 * N2 * y2 + a3 * N3 * y3) mod N\n  = (2 * 20 * 2 + 3 * 15 * 3 + 1 * 12 * 3) mod 60\n  = (80 + 135 + 36) mod 60\n  = 251 mod 60\n  = 11.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given system of congruences is x = 11."
