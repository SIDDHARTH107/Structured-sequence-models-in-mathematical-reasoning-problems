    "message_2": "(a) To find the image of the rectangle under the transformation $w = f(z)$, we can evaluate the function at the four vertices of the rectangle and then find the shape of the image.\n\nLet $z_1 = -1$, $z_2 = 1$, $z_3 = -1 + 2i$, and $z_4 = 1 + 2i$. Then,\n\n$f(z_1) = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) + 2 = 5$\n\n$f(z_2) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 2 = 1$\n\n$f(z_3) = (-1 + 2i)^2 - 2(-1 + 2i) + 2 = 3 - 4i$\n\n$f(z_4) = (1 + 2i)^2 - 2(1 + 2i) + 2 = 3 + 4i$\n\nThe image of the rectangle is a parallelogram with vertices at $5, 1, 3 - 4i, 3 + 4i$.\n\n(b) To transform the region bounded by the image of the rectangle to the upper half plane, we can use a Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$g(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$\n\nWe want to map the vertices of the parallelogram to the real axis. Let's map $1 \\mapsto 0$, $5 \\mapsto 1$, $3 - 4i \\mapsto -1$, and $3 + 4i \\mapsto \\infty$. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\n$\\frac{a + b}{c + d} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{5a + b}{5c + d} = 1$\n\n$\\frac{-a + 2bi + b}{-c + 2di + d} = -1$\n\n$\\frac{a + 2bi + b}{c + 2di + d} = \\infty$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $a = 2i$, $b = -2i$, $c = 1$, and $d = 1$. Thus, the conformal map is:\n\n$g(z) = \\frac{2iz - 2i}{z + 1}$\n\n(c) The mapping $w = g(z)$ that accomplishes this is:\n\n$w = \\frac{2iz - 2i}{z + 1}$"
