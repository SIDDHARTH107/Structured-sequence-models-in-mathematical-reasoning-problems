    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. Plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (8 cm × 10 cm) / 2\n\nArea = (80 cm²) / 2\n\nArea = 40 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
