    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and B, which is denoted as (A ∆ B) ∩ B. The intersection is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {2, 4, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted as B ∆ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, meaning A ∆ B = B ∆ A, we already know the result:\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B and (B ∆ A), which is denoted as B ∩ (B ∆ A). \n\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = {2, 4, 6}\n\nComparing the two results, we can see that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {2, 4, 6} = B ∩ (B ∆ A)\n\nTherefore, (A ∆ B) ∩ B = B ∩ (B ∆ A) is verified."
