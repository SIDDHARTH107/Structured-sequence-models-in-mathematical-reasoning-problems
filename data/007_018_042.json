    "message_2": "According to the Goldbach Conjecture, every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it has been found to be true in all cases. However, it has not been proven or disproven yet.\n\nSo, as per the current understanding, there is no smallest even integer greater than 2 that is not the sum of two prime numbers."
