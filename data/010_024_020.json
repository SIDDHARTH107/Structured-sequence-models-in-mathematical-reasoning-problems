    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is less than 180 degrees. The formula for the angle sum of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nsum of angles = 180 - A\n\nwhere A is the area of the triangle in hyperbolic geometry.\n\nGiven the angles 90 degrees and 60 degrees, we can find the third angle x:\n\n90 + 60 + x < 180\n\n150 + x < 180\n\nx < 30\n\nSince we don't have information about the side lengths or the area of the triangle, we can't determine the exact value of x. However, we can conclude that x must be less than 30 degrees."
