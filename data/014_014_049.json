    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"SECRET MESSAGE\" using the Playfair Cipher with the keyword \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: MATHS (no duplicates in this case)\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in order (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher): MATHSBCDEFGIKLNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow the Playfair matrix looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNext, we need to split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters) and apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, insert an 'X' between them (if the repeated letter is at the end of the message, add an 'X' at the end)\n2. If the letters form a rectangle in the matrix, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other column of the rectangle\n3. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around if necessary)\n4. If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around if necessary)\n\nSplit the message into digraphs: SE CR ET ME SS AG EX (added X at the end)\nApply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\nSE -> DV (rectangle)\nCR -> RT (rectangle)\nET -> GT (same row)\nME -> LN (rectangle)\nSS -> SC (same column)\nAG -> TH (rectangle)\nEX -> FS (rectangle)\n\nThe encrypted message is: DVRTGTlnSCthFS"
