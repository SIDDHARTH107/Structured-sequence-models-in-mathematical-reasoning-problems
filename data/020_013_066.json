    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of linear programming. First, let's rewrite the constraints in a more convenient form:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5\n2. x + 2y ≤ 8\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n5. The matrix [[1,x,y],[x,4,y],[y,y,z]] is positive semi-definite.\n\nFor the matrix to be positive semi-definite, all its principal minors (determinants of the submatrices) must be non-negative. The principal minors are:\n\n1. det([[1]]) = 1 ≥ 0\n2. det([[1,x],[x,4]]) = 4 - x^2 ≥ 0\n3. det([[1,x,y],[x,4,y],[y,y,z]]) = z(4-x^2) - y^2(1-x^2) ≥ 0\n\nThe first minor is always non-negative. The second minor gives us another constraint:\n\n6. 4 - x^2 ≥ 0 => x^2 ≤ 4 => -2 ≤ x ≤ 2\n\nNow let's analyze the third minor. Since z is not given, we can't derive a constraint directly from it. However, we can use the fact that the matrix is positive semi-definite to find a relationship between x, y, and z. If the matrix is positive semi-definite, then for any non-zero vector v = [a, b, c], we have:\n\nv^T * M * v ≥ 0, where M is the matrix and v^T is the transpose of v.\n\nLet's choose v = [0, 1, -1], so v^T = [0, 1, -1]. Then:\n\nv^T * M * v = [0, 1, -1] * [[1,x,y],[x,4,y],[y,y,z]] * [0, 1, -1] = 4 - 2y - z ≥ 0\n\nThis gives us another constraint:\n\n7. z ≥ 2y - 4\n\nNow we have all the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5\n2. x + 2y ≤ 8\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n5. -2 ≤ x ≤ 2\n6. z ≥ 2y - 4\n\nWe can now graph the feasible region and find the vertices. The vertices are the points where the constraints intersect:\n\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (2, 0)\nC. (0, 4)\nD. (2, 3)\n\nNow we evaluate the objective function f(x, y) = 3x + 2y at each vertex:\n\nf(A) = 3(0) + 2(0) = 0\nf(B) = 3(2) + 2(0) = 6\nf(C) = 3(0) + 2(4) = 8\nf(D) = 3(2) + 2(3) = 12\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 12, and it occurs at the vertex D with coordinates (x, y) = (2, 3)."
