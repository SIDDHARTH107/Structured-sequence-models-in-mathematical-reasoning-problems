    "message_2": "To model the situation, we can use the exponential growth differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population of bacteria, t is the time in hours, and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nSince the population doubles every hour, we can find the value of k as follows:\n\nP(t+1) = 2P(t)\n2 = e^(k)\nk = ln(2)\n\nNow we can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\ndP/dt = ln(2)P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = ln(2)dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P)dP = ∫ln(2)dt\nln(P) = ln(2)t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition at 11:00 am, when P(0) = 10:\n\nln(10) = ln(2) * 0 + C\nC = ln(10)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = ln(2)t + ln(10)\n\nTo find the population at 1:00 pm, we need to find P(2), since 1:00 pm is 2 hours after 11:00 am:\n\nln(P(2)) = ln(2) * 2 + ln(10)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to solve for P(2):\n\nP(2) = e^(ln(2) * 2 + ln(10))\nP(2) = e^(ln(4) + ln(10))\nP(2) = e^(ln(40))\n\nSince e^(ln(x)) = x, we have:\n\nP(2) = 40\n\nSo, the population of bacteria at 1:00 pm will be 40."
