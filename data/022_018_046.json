    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the complex Laplace equation, we first note that the Laplace equation is linear and homogeneous. This means that if we find two independent solutions, their linear combination will also be a solution.\n\nLet $u(x, y) = f(x) + ig(y)$, where $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ are real functions of $x$ and $y$, respectively. Then, we can write the complex Laplace equation as:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 (f + ig)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 (f + ig)}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + i\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\n\nSince the real and imaginary parts are independent, we can set each part equal to zero:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\n\nThese are ordinary differential equations. Solving them, we get:\n\n$$ f(x) = Ax + B $$\n$$ g(y) = Cy + D $$\n\nwhere $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants. Thus, the general solution of the complex Laplace equation is:\n\n$$ u(x, y) = (Ax + B) + i(Cy + D) $$"
