    "message_1": "A particle moves along a straight line with a position function given by s(t) = 3t^2 - 4t + 2, where t is measured in seconds and s is measured in meters. Find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the particle, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time (t). The first derivative represents the velocity function, v(t).\n\ns(t) = 3t^2 - 4t + 2\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(3t^2 - 4t + 2)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 6t - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity at t = 2 seconds. We plug t = 2 into the velocity function:\n\nv(2) = 6(2) - 4\nv(2) = 12 - 4\nv(2) = 8\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 8 meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time (t). The second derivative represents the acceleration function, a(t).\n\nWe already found the first derivative (velocity function) to be:\n\nv(t) = 6t - 4\n\nNow, we find the second derivative (acceleration function):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 4)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 6\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration is the same for all values of t. Therefore, the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 6 meters per second squared.\n\nIn summary, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 8 meters per second, and the acceleration is 6 meters per second squared."
