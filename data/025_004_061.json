    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of all points on the curve of the form (u^2, u^3, u) where u is a nonzero rational number, we will substitute these expressions into the given equation and check if they satisfy the equation.\n\nGiven equation: Y^2Z = X^3 - XZ^2\n\nSubstitute X = u^2, Y = u^3, and Z = u:\n\n(u^3)^2 * u = (u^2)^3 - (u^2)(u)^2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nu^6 * u = u^6 - u^4\n\nu^7 = u^6 - u^4\n\nNow, we want to find the values of u for which this equation holds true. We can factor out u^4 from the right side of the equation:\n\nu^7 = u^4(u^2 - 1)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by u^4 (since u is nonzero):\n\nu^3 = u^2 - 1\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nu^3 - u^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation in u. Unfortunately, there is no general formula to find rational roots for a cubic equation. However, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to check for possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial P(u) = u^3 - u^2 + 1 must be of the form ±p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term (1) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the only possible rational roots are ±1.\n\nChecking these roots:\n\nP(1) = 1^3 - 1^2 + 1 = 1\nP(-1) = (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 + 1 = -1\n\nNeither of these roots are equal to zero, so there are no rational roots for the cubic equation. Therefore, there are no points on the curve of the form (u^2, u^3, u) where u is a nonzero rational number."
