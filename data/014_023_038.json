    "message_2": "In a rail fence cipher with 4 rails, the pattern of the characters in the plain-text message repeats every 6 columns (4 rails for the first column and 2 additional columns for the zigzag pattern). To find the number of columns used in the encryption of the message, we can divide the total number of characters (36) by the number of characters per pattern (6).\n\n36 characters / 6 characters per pattern = 6 patterns\n\nSince each pattern takes up 6 columns, we can multiply the number of patterns by the number of columns per pattern to find the total number of columns used in the encryption.\n\n6 patterns * 6 columns per pattern = 36 columns\n\nSo, 36 columns were used in the encryption of the message."
