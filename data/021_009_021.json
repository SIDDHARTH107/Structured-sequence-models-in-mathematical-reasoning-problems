    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of f(x) using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient or slope of the function at any point x.\n\nf(x) = (x-4)^2 + 5\nf'(x) = d/dx((x-4)^2 + 5) = 2(x-4)\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method with a learning rate of 0.1 and perform 10 iterations starting from x=0.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - learning_rate * f'(x0)\nx1 = 0 - 0.1 * 2(0-4) = 0 + 0.8 = 0.8\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - learning_rate * f'(x1)\nx2 = 0.8 - 0.1 * 2(0.8-4) = 0.8 + 0.64 = 1.44\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - learning_rate * f'(x2)\nx3 = 1.44 - 0.1 * 2(1.44-4) = 1.44 + 0.512 = 1.952\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - learning_rate * f'(x3)\nx4 = 1.952 - 0.1 * 2(1.952-4) = 1.952 + 0.4096 = 2.3616\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - learning_rate * f'(x4)\nx5 = 2.3616 - 0.1 * 2(2.3616-4) = 2.3616 + 0.32768 = 2.68928\n\nIteration 6:\nx6 = x5 - learning_rate * f'(x5)\nx6 = 2.68928 - 0.1 * 2(2.68928-4) = 2.68928 + 0.262144 = 2.951424\n\nIteration 7:\nx7 = x6 - learning_rate * f'(x6)\nx7 = 2.951424 - 0.1 * 2(2.951424-4) = 2.951424 + 0.2097152 = 3.1611392\n\nIteration 8:\nx8 = x7 - learning_rate * f'(x7)\nx8 = 3.1611392 - 0.1 * 2(3.1611392-4) = 3.1611392 + 0.16777216 = 3.32891136\n\nIteration 9:\nx9 = x8 - learning_rate * f'(x8)\nx9 = 3.32891136 - 0.1 * 2(3.32891136-4) = 3.32891136 + 0.134217728 = 3.463129088\n\nIteration 10:\nx10 = x9 - learning_rate * f'(x9)\nx10 = 3.463129088 - 0.1 * 2(3.463129088-4) = 3.463129088 + 0.1073741824 = 3.5705032704\n\nAfter 10 iterations, we have x ≈ 3.5705. Now, we can find the minimum value of f(x) using this x value:\n\nf(x) = (x-4)^2 + 5\nf(3.5705) ≈ (3.5705-4)^2 + 5 ≈ 0.1845\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) using the gradient descent method with 10 iterations is approximately 0.1845."
