    "message_2": "Let S be a set of 10 elements and A be a subset of S with 4 elements. The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in S that are not in A. Since there are 10 elements in S and 4 elements in A, there must be 10 - 4 = 6 elements in the complement of A (A').\n\nNow, let's prove that the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set using set theory. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, we want to show that there are no elements that are common to both A and A'.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an element x that is in both A and A'. By definition of the complement, x must not be in A since it is in A'. This is a contradiction because we assumed that x is in both A and A'. Therefore, there cannot be any elements that are common to both A and A'.\n\nHence, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set, denoted as âˆ…."
