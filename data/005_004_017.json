The scores are normally distributed and the sample sizes for each group are equal. \n\nMethod A: 70, 80, 75, 85, 90 \nMethod B: 60, 70, 75, 80, 85 \nMethod C: 65, 75, 80, 85, 90 \n\nCalculate the ANOVA table and determine if there is a significant difference between the teaching methods at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we first need to calculate the means, sum of squares, and degrees of freedom for each group and the overall data. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the means for each group and the overall mean.\nMethod A mean: (70 + 80 + 75 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 80\nMethod B mean: (60 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85) / 5 = 74\nMethod C mean: (65 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 79\nOverall mean: (80 + 74 + 79) / 3 = 77.67\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW) and between groups (SSB).\nSSW = Σ(Σ(x_ij - mean_i)^2) for each group i and observation j\nSSW_A = (70-80)^2 + (80-80)^2 + (75-80)^2 + (85-80)^2 + (90-80)^2 = 250\nSSW_B = (60-74)^2 + (70-74)^2 + (75-74)^2 + (80-74)^2 + (85-74)^2 = 250\nSSW_C = (65-79)^2 + (75-79)^2 + (80-79)^2 + (85-79)^2 + (90-79)^2 = 250\nSSW = SSW_A + SSW_B + SSW_C = 250 + 250 + 250 = 750\n\nSSB = Σn_i(mean_i - overall_mean)^2 for each group i\nSSB_A = 5 * (80 - 77.67)^2 = 34.45\nSSB_B = 5 * (74 - 77.67)^2 = 54.45\nSSB_C = 5 * (79 - 77.67)^2 = 8.95\nSSB = SSB_A + SSB_B + SSB_C = 34.45 + 54.45 + 8.95 = 97.85\n\nStep 3: Calculate the degrees of freedom within groups (dfW) and between groups (dfB).\ndfW = total number of observations - number of groups = 15 - 3 = 12\ndfB = number of groups - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nStep 4: Calculate the mean squares within groups (MSW) and between groups (MSB).\nMSW = SSW / dfW = 750 / 12 = 62.5\nMSB = SSB / dfB = 97.85 / 2 = 48.925\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F statistic.\nF = MSB / MSW = 48.925 / 62.5 = 0.7828\n\nStep 6: Determine the critical F value at a 5% level of significance.\nUsing an F-distribution table, we find the critical F value for dfB = 2 and dfW = 12 at a 5% level of significance to be approximately 3.89.\n\nStep 7: Compare the F statistic to the critical F value.\nSince the F statistic (0.7828) is less than the critical F value (3.89), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between the teaching methods at a 5% level of significance."
