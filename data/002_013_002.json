    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 9 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 cm * 4 cm * 9 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 216 cubic cm\n\nVolume = 72 cubic cm\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 72 cubic centimeters."
