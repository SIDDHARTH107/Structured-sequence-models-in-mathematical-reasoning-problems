    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 6 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (6 cm)³\nV = (4/3) * π * (216 cm³)\nV = 288π cm³\n\nApproximating π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nV ≈ 288 * 3.14159 cm³\nV ≈ 904.77856 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 6 cm is approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters."
