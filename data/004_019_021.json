    "message_2": "To find the particle's velocity after 4 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nWe know the acceleration (a) is 4 m/s², and we want to find the velocity after 4 seconds (t = 4). However, we need to find the initial velocity (u) first. We are given that at t = 2 seconds, the velocity is 10 m/s. We can use this information to find the initial velocity:\n\n10 m/s = u + 4 m/s² × 2 s\n\n10 m/s = u + 8 m/s\n\nu = 10 m/s - 8 m/s = 2 m/s\n\nNow that we have the initial velocity, we can find the velocity after 4 seconds:\n\nv = 2 m/s + 4 m/s² × 4 s\n\nv = 2 m/s + 16 m/s\n\nv = 18 m/s\n\nSo, the particle's velocity after 4 seconds has elapsed is 18 m/s."
