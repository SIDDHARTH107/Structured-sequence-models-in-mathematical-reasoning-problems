(A x B) ∩ B\nSince B contains single elements and A x B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty.\n(A x B) ∩ B = ∅\n\n2. A x (B ∩ A)\nFirst, let's find the intersection of B and A:\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A x (B ∩ A):\nA x (B ∩ A) = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\n3.
