    "message_1": "Suppose a company needs to test 6 different factors affecting their manufacturing process, with each factor having 4 possible levels. Using an orthogonal array, how many runs will be required to conduct the experiment?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a statistical method used in experimental design to reduce the number of runs required while still maintaining the ability to analyze the effects of each factor. In this case, we have 6 factors, each with 4 levels. \n\nTo determine the appropriate orthogonal array, we need to find an array with the smallest number of runs that can accommodate the given factors and levels. In this case, we can use the L16 orthogonal array, which has 16 runs and can accommodate up to 6 factors with 4 levels each.\n\nSo, the company will need to conduct 16 runs to test the 6 factors with 4 levels each using an L16 orthogonal array."
