    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 10 cm and a base radius of 4 cm. Find its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, h is the height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the height (h) is 10 cm and the base radius (r) is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4²)(10)\nVolume = (1/3)π(16)(10)\nVolume = (1/3)π(160)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numbers:\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(160)\nVolume ≈ (1.047197)(160)\nVolume ≈ 167.55168\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 167.55 cubic centimeters."
