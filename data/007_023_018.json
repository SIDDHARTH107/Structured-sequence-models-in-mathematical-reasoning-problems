What is the maximum number of distinct input messages that can be hashed by this function without producing a collision (i.e., two different inputs that have the same hash output)?",
    "message_2": "A cryptographic hash function takes an input message and produces a fixed-size hash output. In this case, the input message is 128 bits, and the hash output is 64 bits. The maximum number of distinct input messages that can be hashed without producing a collision is determined by the number of possible hash outputs.\n\nSince the hash output is 64 bits, there are 2^64 possible hash outputs. However, due to the pigeonhole principle, we can only guarantee that there will be no collisions for up to 2^64 distinct input messages. Once we have more input messages than hash outputs, there must be at least one collision.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of distinct input messages that can be hashed by this function without producing a collision is 2^64."
