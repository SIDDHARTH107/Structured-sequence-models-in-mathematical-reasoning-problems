    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is created by iteratively replacing each line segment with four smaller segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. The number of line segments in the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (4^n)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of line segments in the Koch snowflake curve of size 4 (n = 4). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of line segments = 3 * (4^4) = 3 * 256 = 768\n\nSo there are 768 line segments in the Koch snowflake curve of size 4, where the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit."
