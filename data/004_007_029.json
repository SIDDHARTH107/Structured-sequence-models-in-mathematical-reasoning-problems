    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question:\n\nSuppose you have a composite function f(x) = sin(2x^2 + 3) and g(x) = 2x - 1. What is the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x using the chain rule?",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) with respect to x:\n\nf(x) = sin(2x^2 + 3)\nf'(x) = d(sin(2x^2 + 3))/dx = cos(2x^2 + 3) * d(2x^2 + 3)/dx = cos(2x^2 + 3) * (4x)\n\ng(x) = 2x - 1\ng'(x) = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we will find the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x using the chain rule:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = (cos(2(g(x))^2 + 3) * (4(g(x)))) * 2\n\nNow, substitute g(x) back into the expression:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = (cos(2(2x - 1)^2 + 3) * (4(2x - 1))) * 2\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = 8(2x - 1)cos(2(2x - 1)^2 + 3)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x is:\n\n8(2x - 1)cos(2(2x - 1)^2 + 3)"
