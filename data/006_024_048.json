    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, friends bringing a backpack)\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as nCx or \"n choose x\")\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of friends, which is 10)\n- x is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of friends bringing a backpack, which is 7)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a friend bringing a backpack, which is 0.8)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a friend not bringing a backpack, which is 0.2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(7) = C(10, 7) * 0.8^7 * 0.2^3\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 friends out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(7) = 120 * 0.8^7 * 0.2^3\nP(7) ≈ 120 * 0.2097152 * 0.008\nP(7) ≈ 0.201326592\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 7 of the friends will bring a backpack is approximately 0.201 or 20.1%."
