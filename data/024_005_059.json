    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parametrize the surface as:\n\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nS_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nS_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = |<S_u, S_u>  <S_u, S_v>|\n      |<S_v, S_u>  <S_v, S_v>|\n\nI = |(1 + 4u^2)  4uv|\n      |4uv  (1 + 4v^2)|\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nS_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nS_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = |<S_uu, N>  <S_uv, N>|\n       |<S_uv, N>  <S_vv, N>|\n\nTo find the normal vector N, we compute the cross product of S_u and S_v:\n\nN = S_u Ã— S_v = (2u, 2v, -1)\n\nNow, we compute the dot products for the second fundamental form:\n\n<S_uu, N> = 4\n<S_uv, N> = 0\n<S_vv, N> = 4\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n\nII = |4  0|\n       |0  4|\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix (I^(-1) * II). First, we find the inverse of the first fundamental form I:\n\nI^(-1) = (1 / det(I)) * |(1 + 4v^2)  -4uv|\n                                |-4uv  (1 + 4u^2)|\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nI^(-1) = (1 / 9) * |5  -4|\n                          |-4  5|\n\nNow, we compute the product I^(-1) * II:\n\nI^(-1) * II = (1 / 9) * |20  0|\n                                    |0  20|\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the principal curvatures. In this case, both eigenvalues are equal to 20/9. Therefore, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1,1,2) are k1 = 20/9 and k2 = 20/9."
