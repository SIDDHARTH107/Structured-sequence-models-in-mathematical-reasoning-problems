    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nGiven set A = {2, 3, 5, 7} and set B = {3, 5, 8, 9}, let's find the symmetric difference:\n\n1. Union of A and B (A ∪ B): Combine all the elements of A and B, without repeating any element.\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}\n\n2. Intersection of A and B (A ∩ B): Find the elements that are common in both A and B.\nA ∩ B = {3, 5}\n\n3. Subtract the intersection from the union:\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} - {3, 5} = {2, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\n1. Union of B and A (B ∪ A): Combine all the elements of B and A, without repeating any element.\nB ∪ A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}\n\n2. Intersection of B and A (B ∩ A): Find the elements that are common in both B and A.\nB ∩ A = {3, 5}\n\n3. Subtract the intersection from the union:\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} - {3, 5} = {2, 7, 8, 9}\n\nSince A Δ B = {2, 7, 8, 9} and B Δ A = {2, 7, 8, 9}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative."
