    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first analyze the possible orders of elements in G. Since G has order 8, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, or 8. We know that there is exactly one element of order 1, which is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 8. If there exists an element of order 8, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8. So, in this case, the number of elements of order 2 or 4 is 0.\n\nNext, let's consider the number of elements of order 4. If there are at least two elements of order 4, say a and b, then we can form a subgroup H = {e, a, a^2, a^3, b, b^2, b^3} of order 8. Since G has order 8, G = H, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of C4 and C2, which is D4. In this case, the number of elements of order 2 or 4 is 3 (a^2, b^2, and a^3b^2).\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where there is exactly one element of order 4, say a. Then, the remaining 4 non-identity elements must have order 2. Let b be one of these elements of order 2. Then, we can form a subgroup H = {e, a, a^2, a^3, b} of order 8. Since G has order 8, G = H, and G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. In this case, the number of elements of order 2 or 4 is 1 (a^2).\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the number of elements of order 2 or 4 in G is either 0, 1, or 3, and in each case, G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4."
