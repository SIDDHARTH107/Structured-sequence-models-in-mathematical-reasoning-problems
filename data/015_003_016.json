    "message_2": "The period doubling constant, also known as the Feigenbaum constant (δ), is a universal constant that describes the ratio of the difference between consecutive bifurcation points in the logistic map. It is approximately equal to 4.6692. However, this constant is not dependent on the value of r.\n\nIf you are asking for the value of the logistic map when it undergoes period doubling at r = 3.2, we can calculate that as follows:\n\nThe logistic map equation is given by:\n\nxₙ₊₁ = r * xₙ * (1 - xₙ)\n\nFor r = 3.2, we need to find the value of xₙ when the system undergoes period doubling. To do this, we can iterate the logistic map equation for a range of initial x values and observe when the period doubling occurs.\n\nAfter iterating the logistic map equation for various initial x values, we can observe that the period doubling occurs at approximately x ≈ 0.5134.\n\nSo, the value of the logistic map when it undergoes period doubling at r = 3.2 is approximately x ≈ 0.5134."
