    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. Since each box must have at least two balls, we can start by placing two balls in each box. This leaves us with 6 balls to distribute among the 3 boxes.\n\nNow, we can think of the problem as distributing these 6 remaining balls into the 3 boxes without any restrictions. Using the stars and bars method, we have 6 \"stars\" (balls) and 2 \"bars\" to separate the boxes.\n\nWe need to arrange these 6 stars and 2 bars in a row. There are a total of 8 positions, and we need to choose 2 of them for the bars. This can be done in C(8,2) ways, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 28\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to distribute twelve identical balls into three distinct boxes such that each box has at least two balls."
