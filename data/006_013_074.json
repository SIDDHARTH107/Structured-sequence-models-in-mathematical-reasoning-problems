    "message_1": "According to historical data, the probability of a major earthquake occurring in a certain region is 0.05 in any given year. What is the probability of having at least one major earthquake in that region in the next 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of having at least one major earthquake in the next 10 years is the probability of having no major earthquakes in the next 10 years.\n\nThe probability of not having a major earthquake in any given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor 10 years, the probability of not having a major earthquake in each of those years is 0.95^10.\n\n0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least one major earthquake in the next 10 years by subtracting the complementary probability from 1.\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one major earthquake in that region in the next 10 years is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
