    "message_2": "We can use the Möbius transformation to find a bijective mapping that maps the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane. The general form of a Möbius transformation is:\n\nf(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex numbers and ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nTo map the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane, we can use the following Möbius transformation:\n\nf(z) = i * (z + 1) / (1 - z)\n\nLet's verify that this transformation maps the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane:\n\n1. f(0) = i * (0 + 1) / (1 - 0) = i, which is in the upper half plane.\n\n2. If |z| < 1 (inside the unit circle), then |1 - z| > 0. Thus, the denominator is nonzero, and the transformation is well-defined.\n\n3. The imaginary part of f(z) is positive for z inside the unit circle. To see this, let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers and |z| < 1. Then:\n\nf(z) = i * (x + yi + 1) / (1 - x - yi)\n     = i * (x + 1 + yi) / (1 - x - yi)\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, we get:\n\nf(z) = i * (x + 1 + yi) * (1 - x + yi) / ((1 - x)^2 + y^2)\n     = i * ((x + 1)(1 - x) + y^2 + y(x + 1 - x^2 + y^2)) / ((1 - x)^2 + y^2)\n\nThe imaginary part of f(z) is:\n\nIm(f(z)) = (x + 1 - x^2 + y^2) / ((1 - x)^2 + y^2)\n\nSince |z| < 1, we have x^2 + y^2 < 1, and thus:\n\nIm(f(z)) > 0\n\nThis shows that f(z) maps the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane.\n\n4. The transformation is bijective. To see this, we can find its inverse:\n\nf_inv(w) = (w - i) / (w + i)\n\nIt's easy to verify that f(f_inv(w)) = w and f_inv(f(z)) = z, which shows that the transformation is bijective.\n\nIn conclusion, the bijective mapping that maps the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane is:\n\nf(z) = i * (z + 1) / (1 - z)"
