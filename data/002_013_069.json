    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base with dimensions of 8 m by 5 m and a height of 10 m. Find the volume of the pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base area can be found by multiplying the length and width of the rectangular base:\n\nBase_area = length * width\nBase_area = 8 m * 5 m\nBase_area = 40 m²\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 40 m² * 10 m\nVolume = (1/3) * 400 m³\nVolume = 133.33 m³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 133.33 cubic meters."
