    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs, and the number of defective bulbs per week is known to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean of 5. What is the probability that the company will produce 7 defective bulbs or more in a given week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of producing 7 or more defective bulbs in a given week, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the event not occurring is producing 6 or fewer defective bulbs.\n\nLet X be the number of defective bulbs produced in a week. X follows a Poisson distribution with a mean (λ) of 5.\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X ≤ 6)\n\nTo find P(X ≤ 6), we can sum the probabilities of producing 0 to 6 defective bulbs:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + ... + P(X=6)\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nWhere e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), λ is the mean, and k is the number of defective bulbs.\n\nUsing the PMF, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 6:\n\nP(X=0) = (e^(-5) * 5^0) / 0! ≈ 0.0067\nP(X=1) = (e^(-5) * 5^1) / 1! ≈ 0.0337\nP(X=2) = (e^(-5) * 5^2) / 2! ≈ 0.0842\nP(X=3) = (e^(-5) * 5^3) / 3! ≈ 0.1404\nP(X=4) = (e^(-5) * 5^4) / 4! ≈ 0.1755\nP(X=5) = (e^(-5) * 5^5) / 5! ≈ 0.1755\nP(X=6) = (e^(-5) * 5^6) / 6! ≈ 0.1462\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) ≈ 0.0067 + 0.0337 + 0.0842 + 0.1404 + 0.1755 + 0.1755 + 0.1462 ≈ 0.7622\n\nFinally, use the complement rule:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X ≤ 6) ≈ 1 - 0.7622 ≈ 0.2378\n\nSo, the probability that the company will produce 7 or more defective bulbs in a given week is approximately 0.2378 or 23.78%."
