    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 2, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 8x + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -8, and c = 5.\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4(3)(5))) / (2(3))\nx = (8 ± √(64 - 60)) / 6\nx = (8 ± √4) / 6\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\nx = (8 + 2) / 6 = 10 / 6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.67\nx = (8 - 2) / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1\n\nNow, we need to check if these critical points are within the interval [0, 5]. Both 1 and 5/3 are within the interval, so we have two critical points:\n\nx = 1 and x = 5/3"
