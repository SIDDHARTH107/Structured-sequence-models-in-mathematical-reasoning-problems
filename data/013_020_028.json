    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a Beauty Contest game, there are 10 players who each choose a number between 1 and 100. The winner is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the chosen numbers. Assume that all players have perfect rationality and know that the other players will also choose rationally. What number should a player choose in order to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. Since all players are perfectly rational, they know that no one will choose a number greater than 2/3 * 100 = 66.66, because choosing a number greater than that would never be the closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNow, all players know that no one will choose a number greater than 66.66, so they will adjust their choices accordingly. They will now choose a number between 1 and 2/3 * 66.66 â‰ˆ 44.44.\n\nThis reasoning will continue iteratively, with each step reducing the range of numbers that rational players will choose. The sequence of upper bounds will be:\n\n100, 66.66, 44.44, 29.63, 19.75, 13.17, 8.78, 5.85, 3.9, 2.6, ...\n\nAs the number of players is 10, we can stop at the 10th term in the sequence, which is 2.6. Since all players are rational, they will choose a number close to 2.6 to maximize their chances of winning."
