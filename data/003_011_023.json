    "message_1": "A student wants to measure the distance between a lighthouse and a boat. The boat is located 500 meters away from the lighthouse at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the lighthouse. What is the distance between the lighthouse and the boat? Use trigonometric formulas to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the lighthouse and the boat, we can use the cosine formula. The cosine formula states that the adjacent side (the distance we want to find) is equal to the hypotenuse (the distance from the boat to the lighthouse) multiplied by the cosine of the angle.\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse is 500 meters, and the angle is 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can use the cosine formula:\n\nAdjacent side = Hypotenuse * cos(angle)\nAdjacent side = 500 * cos(π / 6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nAdjacent side ≈ 500 * 0.866025\nAdjacent side ≈ 433.01 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the lighthouse and the boat is approximately 433.01 meters."
