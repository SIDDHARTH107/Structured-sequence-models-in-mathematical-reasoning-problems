    "message_1": "A trapezium has a length of 7 cm for one base, a length of 15 cm for the other base, and a height of 9 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the shorter base a (7 cm), the longer base b (15 cm), and the height h (9 cm). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the segment connecting the two bases, which we'll call d. This segment is parallel to the height and divides the trapezium into two right triangles. The length of d can be found by subtracting the shorter base from the longer base:\n\nd = b - a\nd = 15 - 7\nd = 8 cm\n\nNow, we have two right triangles with legs of length 8 cm and 9 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse (the other two sides of the trapezium) for each triangle:\n\nc^2 = 8^2 + 9^2\nc^2 = 64 + 81\nc^2 = 145\nc = √145\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + 2c\nPerimeter = 7 + 15 + 2(√145)\nPerimeter ≈ 7 + 15 + 2(12.04)\nPerimeter ≈ 7 + 15 + 24.08\nPerimeter ≈ 46.08 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 46.08 cm."
