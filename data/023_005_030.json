    "message_2": "To solve the given homogeneous differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation. The Fourier transform of a function y(t) is given by:\n\n$Y(ω) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y(t) e^{-iωt} dt$\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\n$y''(t) - 4y(t) = 0$\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides:\n\n$\\mathcal{F}\\{y''(t)\\} - 4\\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = 0$\n\nUsing the property of Fourier transform for the second derivative:\n\n$(-iω)^2Y(ω) - 4Y(ω) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$(ω^2 + 4)Y(ω) = 0$\n\nNow, let's find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω):\n\n$y(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Y(ω)\\}$\n\nSince $Y(ω) = 0$ for $ω^2 ≠ -4$, the inverse Fourier transform will be zero for those values of ω. For $ω^2 = -4$, we have $ω = ±2i$. Thus, the general solution of the given differential equation can be written as:\n\n$y(t) = c_1 e^{2it} + c_2 e^{-2it}$\n\nNow, we need to find the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ using the given initial conditions:\n\n$y(0) = 2$\n\n$2 = c_1 e^{0} + c_2 e^{0}$\n\n$2 = c_1 + c_2$\n\n$y'(t) = 2ic_1 e^{2it} - 2ic_2 e^{-2it}$\n\n$y'(0) = 0$\n\n$0 = 2ic_1 - 2ic_2$\n\nDividing by 2i:\n\n$0 = c_1 - c_2$\n\nSolving the system of equations:\n\n$c_1 = 1$\n\n$c_2 = 1$\n\nThus, the solution to the given homogeneous differential equation is:\n\n$y(t) = e^{2it} + e^{-2it}$"
