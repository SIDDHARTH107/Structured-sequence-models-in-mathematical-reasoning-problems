    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n4x^2 - 16x = 4x(x - 4)\n\nDenominator:\n12x^3 - 48x^2 = 12x^2(x - 4)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(4x(x - 4)) / (12x^2(x - 4))\n\nWe can see that both the numerator and the denominator have a common factor of (x - 4). We can cancel out this common factor:\n\n(4x) / (12x^2)\n\nNow, we can simplify further by canceling out the common factor of 4x:\n\n4x / 12x^2 = 1 / (3x)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n1 / (3x)"
