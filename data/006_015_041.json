    "message_1": "If a network has 500 devices and the probability of a cyber attack occurring on any one device is 0.1, what is the probability that at least 50 devices will be attacked?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, devices being attacked)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of devices, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of devices being attacked)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a device being attacked, which is 0.1)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a device not being attacked, which is 0.9)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 50 devices will be attacked. This means we need to find the probability of 50 devices being attacked, 51 devices being attacked, 52 devices being attacked, and so on, up to 500 devices being attacked. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = P(X = 50) + P(X = 51) + P(X = 52) + ... + P(X = 500)\n\nHowever, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = 1 - P(X < 50)\n\nThis means we can find the probability of fewer than 50 devices being attacked and subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least 50 devices being attacked. So, we need to calculate:\n\nP(X < 50) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + ... + P(X = 49)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and sum them up. However, this is still a large number of calculations. To make this easier, we can use a cumulative binomial probability calculator or statistical software to find the cumulative probability of P(X < 50).\n\nUsing a cumulative binomial probability calculator with n = 500, p = 0.1, and k = 49, we get:\n\nP(X < 50) ≈ 0.0664\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 50 devices being attacked:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - 0.0664 ≈ 0.9336\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 devices will be attacked is approximately 0.9336 or 93.36%."
