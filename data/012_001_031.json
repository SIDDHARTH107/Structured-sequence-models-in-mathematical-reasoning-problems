    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 using Dijkstra's algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance array with the following values: [0, infinity, infinity, infinity] (since we start at vertex 1, its distance is 0, and we don't know the distances to other vertices yet).\n2. Create a set of unvisited vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n3. Start with the vertex with the smallest distance value (vertex 1 in this case).\n\nNow, perform the following steps until the set of unvisited vertices is empty:\n\n1. Mark the current vertex as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited vertices.\n2. Update the distance values of its adjacent vertices.\n3. Move to the vertex with the smallest distance value among the unvisited vertices.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n- Start with vertex 1:\n  - Mark vertex 1 as visited: {2, 3, 4}.\n  - Update distances: [0, 2, 4, infinity].\n  - Move to vertex 2 (smallest distance value among unvisited vertices).\n\n- Vertex 2:\n  - Mark vertex 2 as visited: {3, 4}.\n  - Update distances: [0, 2, 4, 5] (vertex 4's distance is updated from infinity to 5 because going through vertex 2 is shorter than the previous value).\n  - Move to vertex 3 (smallest distance value among unvisited vertices).\n\n- Vertex 3:\n  - Mark vertex 3 as visited: {4}.\n  - Update distances: [0, 2, 4, 5] (vertex 4's distance remains the same because going through vertex 3 doesn't provide a shorter path).\n  - Move to vertex 4 (smallest distance value among unvisited vertices).\n\n- Vertex 4:\n  - Mark vertex 4 as visited: {} (empty set, algorithm stops).\n\nThe shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is found to have a distance of 5. To find the actual path, backtrack from vertex 4:\n\n1. Vertex 4 has a distance of 5, which was updated when visiting vertex 2. So, the previous vertex in the path is vertex 2.\n2. Vertex 2 has a distance of 2, which was updated when visiting vertex 1. So, the previous vertex in the path is vertex 1.\n\nThus, the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is 1 -> 2 -> 4."
