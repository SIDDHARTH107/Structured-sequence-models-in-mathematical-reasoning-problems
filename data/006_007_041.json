    "message_1": "A company's stock price at the beginning of the day is $50 per share. The probability of the stock price increasing by the end of the day is 0.6, and the probability of it decreasing is 0.4. What is the probability that the stock price will be above $60 per share by the end of the day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the stock price will increase by more than $10 per share by the end of the day. Since we are given the probabilities of the stock price increasing and decreasing, we can use these probabilities to find the probability of the stock price being above $60 per share.\n\nLet's denote the increase in stock price as X. We are looking for the probability P(X > $10). We know that the probability of the stock price increasing is 0.6, but we don't know the distribution of the increase. Without more information about the distribution of the stock price increase, we cannot directly calculate the probability of the stock price being above $60 per share by the end of the day.\n\nHowever, if we were given more information about the distribution of the stock price increase, we could use that information to calculate the probability of the stock price being above $60 per share."
