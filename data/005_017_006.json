    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve related to Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n\nSuppose we have a dataset with 5 variables and 100 observations. After performing Principal Component Analysis, we find that the first principal component accounts for 50% of the total variance, the second principal component accounts for 30% of the total variance, and the third principal component accounts for 10% of the total variance. What percentage of the total variance is accounted for by the fourth and fifth principal components combined? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "Since the first three principal components account for 50% + 30% + 10% = 90% of the total variance, the remaining variance must be accounted for by the fourth and fifth principal components combined. Therefore, the fourth and fifth principal components account for 100% - 90% = 10% of the total variance. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the answer is 10%."
