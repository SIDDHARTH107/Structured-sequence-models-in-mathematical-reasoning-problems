    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nUsing Cholesky decomposition, solve the system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y + z = 11 \n\n2x + 5y + 2z = 24\n\nx + 2y + 4z = 19\n\nShow your work and round your solutions to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  1 |      x = | x |      b = | 11 |\n    | 2  5  2 |          | y |          | 24 |\n    | 1  2  4 |          | z |          | 19 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the elements of the L matrix.\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1.73 ≈ 1.16\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 1 / 1.73 ≈ 0.58\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(5 - 1.16^2) ≈ 2.08\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (2 - 0.58 * 1.16) / 2.08 ≈ 0.68\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(4 - 0.58^2 - 0.68^2) ≈ 1.92\n\nSo, the L matrix is:\n\nL = | 1.73  0    0  |\n    | 1.16  2.08  0  |\n    | 0.58  0.68  1.92 |\n\nStep 2: Solve the system Ly = b for y.\n\n1.73y1 = 11 => y1 ≈ 6.36\n(1.16y1 + 2.08y2) = 24 => y2 ≈ 4.43\n(0.58y1 + 0.68y2 + 1.92y3) = 19 => y3 ≈ 5.76\n\nStep 3: Solve the system L^Tx = y for x.\n\n1.92z = 5.76 => z ≈ 3.00\n(0.68z + 2.08y) = 4.43 => y ≈ 2.00\n(1.73x + 1.16y + 0.58z) = 6.36 => x ≈ 1.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x ≈ 1.00, y ≈ 2.00, and z ≈ 3.00."
