    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of bacteria at time t (in hours). Since the growth rate is proportional to the size, we can model the population growth using the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(0) is the initial population, k is the growth constant, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe are given that P(0) = 10 and P(8) = 70. We can use this information to find the growth constant k.\n\n70 = 10 * e^(8k)\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n7 = e^(8k)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(7) = 8k\n\nSolve for k:\n\nk = ln(7) / 8\n\nNow that we have the growth constant k, we can find the population after 10 hours, P(10):\n\nP(10) = P(0) * e^(10k)\nP(10) = 10 * e^(10 * ln(7) / 8)\n\nP(10) ≈ 10 * e^(10 * 0.2546)\nP(10) ≈ 10 * e^2.546\nP(10) ≈ 10 * 12.762\n\nP(10) ≈ 127.62\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bacterium, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get the final population:\n\nP(10) ≈ 128\n\nSo, after 10 hours, there will be approximately 128 bacteria."
