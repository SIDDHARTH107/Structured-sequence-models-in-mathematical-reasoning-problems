    "message_1": "What is the Z-score of an observation that has a value of 75 when the mean of the dataset is 50 and the standard deviation is 10? Determine whether this observation is an outlier or not by considering a commonly used threshold of +/-3 for the Z-score.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Z-score, we use the formula:\n\nZ-score = (observation - mean) / standard deviation\n\nIn this case, the observation is 75, the mean is 50, and the standard deviation is 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nZ-score = (75 - 50) / 10\nZ-score = 25 / 10\nZ-score = 2.5\n\nThe Z-score of the observation is 2.5. Since the commonly used threshold for outliers is +/-3, and the Z-score of 2.5 is within this range, the observation is not considered an outlier."
