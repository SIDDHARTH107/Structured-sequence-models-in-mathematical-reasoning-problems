    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed, we can use the theorem that states that the chromatic number (minimum number of colors needed) of a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of the graph. The maximum degree of a graph is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex.\n\nLet's find the maximum degree of the graph. Since there are 7 vertices and 10 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 10) / 7 â‰ˆ 2.86. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario: a vertex with the maximum degree of 4. In this case, we would need 4 + 1 = 5 colors to guarantee that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nHowever, we need to check if it's possible to have a vertex with a degree of 4 in our graph. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges (by the Handshaking lemma). So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in our graph is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nIf we have a vertex with a degree of 4, the sum of the degrees of the remaining 6 vertices should be 20 - 4 = 16. The maximum degree for each of the remaining vertices is 3 (since they cannot be connected to each other, otherwise they would have the same color as the vertex with degree 4). So, the sum of the degrees of the remaining 6 vertices can be at most 6 * 3 = 18, which is greater than 16. This means it's possible to have a vertex with a degree of 4 in our graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph is 5."
