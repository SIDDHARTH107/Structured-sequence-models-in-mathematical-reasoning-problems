    "message_1": "A block cipher uses a secret key to encrypt a block of 64 bits and output a block of 64 bits. If the number of possible keys is 2^(56), calculate the total number of possible ciphertext that can be generated by the cipher?",
    "message_2": "Since the block cipher encrypts a block of 64 bits, there are 2^64 possible plaintext inputs. For each of these plaintext inputs, there is a unique ciphertext output for each of the 2^56 possible keys. Therefore, to calculate the total number of possible ciphertexts, we multiply the number of possible plaintext inputs by the number of possible keys:\n\nTotal number of possible ciphertexts = (Number of possible plaintext inputs) * (Number of possible keys)\nTotal number of possible ciphertexts = (2^64) * (2^56)\n\nTo multiply these two numbers, we can add their exponents:\n\nTotal number of possible ciphertexts = 2^(64+56)\nTotal number of possible ciphertexts = 2^120\n\nSo, there are 2^120 possible ciphertexts that can be generated by the cipher."
