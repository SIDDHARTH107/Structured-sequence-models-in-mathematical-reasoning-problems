    "message_2": "First, let's calculate each expression:\n\n1. (A × B) ∪ {2, 3}\n\nThe Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}. Now, we take the union of this set with {2, 3}:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {2, 3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)} ∪ {2, 3}\n\nThe union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set. Therefore, the result is:\n\n{(1, 3), (2, 3), 2, 3}\n\n2. A × (B ∪ {3}) ∪ {1}\n\nFirst, we calculate the union B ∪ {3}:\n\nB ∪ {3} = {3} ∪ {3} = {3}\n\nNow, we calculate the Cartesian product A × (B ∪ {3}):\n\nA × {3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nFinally, we take the union of this set with {1}:\n\nA × (B ∪ {3}) ∪ {1} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)} ∪ {1}\n\nThe result is:\n\n{(1, 3), (2, 3), 1}\n\nComparing the two results, we see that:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {2, 3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3), 2, 3}\n\nA × (B ∪ {3}) ∪ {1} = {(1, 3), (2, 3), 1}\n\nSince the two sets are not equal, this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
