    "message_2": "The given sinusoidal function is y = 3sin(2x - 1). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 3, B = 2, and the function is in the form y = 3sin(2(x - 1/2)). Comparing this to the general form, we can see that the phase shift C = 1/2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nc) 1/2"
