    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^2 + y^3 = 5y^2, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + y^3 - 5y^2. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 10y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n3y^2 - 10y = 0 => y(3y - 10) = 0 => y = 0 or y = 10/3\n\nSo, we have two potential singular points: (0, 0) and (0, 10/3).\n\nNow, we need to check if these points are indeed singular points by computing the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f. The Hessian matrix H(f) is given by:\n\nH(f) = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂²f/∂y∂x  ∂²f/∂y² |\n\nComputing the second-order partial derivatives:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n∂²f/∂y∂x = 0\n∂²f/∂y² = 6y - 10\n\nNow, the Hessian matrix H(f) is:\n\nH(f) = |  2   0  |\n          |  0  6y-10 |\n\nThe determinant of H(f) is:\n\ndet(H(f)) = (2)(6y - 10) - (0)(0) = 12y - 20\n\nNow, we check the determinant at the potential singular points:\n\n1. At (0, 0):\ndet(H(f)) = 12(0) - 20 = -20 < 0, which means (0, 0) is not a singular point.\n\n2. At (0, 10/3):\ndet(H(f)) = 12(10/3) - 20 = 40 - 20 = 20 > 0, which means (0, 10/3) is a singular point.\n\nSo, the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^2 + y^3 = 5y^2 has one singular point at (0, 10/3)."
