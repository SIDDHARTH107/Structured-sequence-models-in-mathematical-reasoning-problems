    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of the third side in an isosceles triangle with sides measuring 5cm and 5cm each. What is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "To determine the length of the third side in an isosceles triangle, we need more information. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and one unequal side. In this case, the two equal sides are 5cm each. However, without knowing the angles of the triangle or the length of the third side, we cannot determine the length of the third side. Please provide more information."
