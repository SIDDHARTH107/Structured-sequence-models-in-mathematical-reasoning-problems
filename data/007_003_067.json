    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 32768 is divided by 17 using modular arithmetic, we can use the property that (a * b) % m = ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m. \n\n32768 can be written as 2^15. So, we want to find the remainder when 2^15 is divided by 17.\n\nLet's break down 2^15 into smaller powers of 2:\n\n2^15 = 2^8 * 2^7\n\nNow, let's find the remainders when these smaller powers are divided by 17:\n\n2^8 % 17 = 256 % 17 = 1 (since 256 = 17 * 15 + 1)\n2^7 % 17 = 128 % 17 = 3 (since 128 = 17 * 7 + 3)\n\nNow, we can use the property mentioned earlier:\n\n(2^8 * 2^7) % 17 = ((2^8 % 17) * (2^7 % 17)) % 17 = (1 * 3) % 17 = 3\n\nSo, the remainder when 32768 is divided by 17 is 3."
