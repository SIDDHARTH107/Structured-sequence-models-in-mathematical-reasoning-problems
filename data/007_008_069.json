    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 7^15 is divided by 13. Since 13 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem with a = 7 and p = 13:\n\n7^(13-1) ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n7^12 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder of 7^15 when divided by 13. We can rewrite 7^15 as (7^12) * (7^3):\n\n7^15 ≡ (7^12) * (7^3) (mod 13)\n\nUsing the result from Fermat's Little Theorem, we can substitute 7^12 with 1:\n\n7^15 ≡ 1 * (7^3) (mod 13)\n\nNow, we just need to find the remainder of 7^3 when divided by 13:\n\n7^3 = 343\n\nDividing 343 by 13, we get:\n\n343 = 13 * 26 + 5\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^15 is divided by 13 is 5."
