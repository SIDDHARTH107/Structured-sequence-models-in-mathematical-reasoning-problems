    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum size vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that covers all edges.\n\nIn this graph, we can choose vertices B and C as our vertex cover. This covers all the edges:\n\n- (A,B) is covered by B\n- (B,C) is covered by B and C\n- (B,D) is covered by B\n- (C,E) is covered by C\n\nNo smaller vertex cover exists, so the minimum size vertex cover of this graph has a size of 2, with vertices {B, C}."
