    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^5 - 2x^3 + 4 using the power rule, we need to apply the rule to each term in the function. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term x^5, n = 5, so the derivative is 5x^(5-1) = 5x^4.\n2. For the term -2x^3, n = 3, so the derivative is -2 * 3x^(3-1) = -6x^2.\n3. For the constant term 4, the derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 5x^4 - 6x^2 + 0\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^5 - 2x^3 + 4 is:\n\nf'(x) = 5x^4 - 6x^2"
