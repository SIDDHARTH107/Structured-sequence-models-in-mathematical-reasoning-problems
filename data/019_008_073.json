    "message_2": "To find the centroid of the fuzzy set A, we can use the following formula:\n\nCentroid = (Σ (x * μA(x))) / Σ μA(x)\n\nIn this case, we have three non-zero membership degrees:\n\nμA(2) = 0.6, μA(5) = 1.0, and μA(8) = 0.3\n\nSo, the centroid can be calculated as:\n\nCentroid = (2 * 0.6 + 5 * 1.0 + 8 * 0.3) / (0.6 + 1.0 + 0.3)\nCentroid = (1.2 + 5 + 2.4) / 1.9\nCentroid = (8.6) / 1.9\nCentroid ≈ 4.53\n\nTherefore, the centroid of the fuzzy set A is approximately 4.53."
