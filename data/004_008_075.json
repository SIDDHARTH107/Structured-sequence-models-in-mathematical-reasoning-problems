    "message_1": "Ok. Here's a specific question for a calculus student: \n\nGiven the equation of a curve y = 3x² - 4x + 1, find the slope of the tangent line to the curve when x = 2.",
    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a specific point, we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x, and then evaluate it at the given x-value.\n\nThe given equation is y = 3x² - 4x + 1.\n\nFirst, find the derivative dy/dx:\ndy/dx = d(3x² - 4x + 1)/dx = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line when x = 2. Plug in x = 2 into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve when x = 2 is 8."
