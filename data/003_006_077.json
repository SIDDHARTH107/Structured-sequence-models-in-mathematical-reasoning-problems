    "message_1": "A triangle has two known angles, one is 30 degrees and the other is 85 degrees. The length of the side opposite the 30 degree angle is 10 units. Find the length of the side opposite the 85 degree angle.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the side opposite the 85-degree angle, we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\n(side opposite 30-degree angle) / sin(30 degrees) = (side opposite 85-degree angle) / sin(85 degrees)\n\nWe are given that the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 10 units. The sine of 30 degrees is 0.5, and the sine of 85 degrees is approximately 0.9962. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n10 / 0.5 = (side opposite 85-degree angle) / 0.9962\n\nNow, we can solve for the side opposite the 85-degree angle:\n\n(side opposite 85-degree angle) = 10 / 0.5 * 0.9962\n(side opposite 85-degree angle) ≈ 20 * 0.9962\n(side opposite 85-degree angle) ≈ 19.924\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 85-degree angle is approximately 19.924 units."
