The rod has a thermal diffusivity of 0.01 m²/s and a thermal conductivity of 200 W/m-K. Find the temperature distribution on the rod at time t = 20 seconds.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\nT(x=0, t) = 100°C\nT(x=0.5, t) = 50°C\n\nTo find the temperature distribution T(x, t) at t = 20 seconds, we will use the separation of variables method. First, we assume that the solution can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = α X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we divide both sides by αXT:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = α X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nα X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -λT(t)\nα X''(x) = -λX(x)\n\nWe can solve the second equation for X(x) using the boundary conditions. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A cos(√(λ/α) x) + B sin(√(λ/α) x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = 100 => A = 100\nX(0.5) = 50 => 100 cos(√(λ/α) 0.5) + B sin(√(λ/α) 0.5) = 50\n\nWe can solve the first equation for T(t) using the initial condition:\n\nT(t) = C e^(-λt)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A, B, λ, and C. To do this, we will use the Fourier series method. We will express the temperature distribution as a sum of an infinite series of sine and cosine functions:\n\nT(x, t) = A₀ + ∑[A_n cos(√(λ/α) nx) + B_n sin(√(λ/α) nx)] e^(-λn²t)\n\nWe can find the coefficients A₀, A_n, and B_n using the orthogonality property of sine and cosine functions and the given boundary conditions. However, this process is quite involved and requires advanced mathematical techniques.\n\nIn summary, the temperature distribution T(x, t) can be found using the separation of variables method and the Fourier series method. The final solution will be in the form of an infinite series of sine and cosine functions with coefficients determined by the boundary conditions."
