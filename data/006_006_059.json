    "message_2": "To find the probability of making at least 8 free throws, we need to calculate the probabilities of making exactly 8, 9, and 10 free throws and then add those probabilities together.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k free throws\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of free throw attempts (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful free throws (8, 9, or 10)\n- p is the probability of making a free throw (0.75)\n- (1-p) is the probability of missing a free throw (0.25)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of making exactly 8 free throws:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.75)^8 * (0.25)^2\n\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * 2!) = 45\n\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.75)^8 * (0.25)^2 ≈ 0.2816\n\nNext, let's find the probability of making exactly 9 free throws:\n\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * (0.75)^9 * (0.25)^1\n\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9! * 1!) = 10\n\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.75)^9 * (0.25)^1 ≈ 0.1877\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of making all 10 free throws:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * (0.75)^10 * (0.25)^0\n\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10! * 0!) = 1\n\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.75)^10 * (0.25)^0 ≈ 0.0563\n\nNow, we can add the probabilities of making exactly 8, 9, and 10 free throws to find the probability of making at least 8 free throws:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.2816 + 0.1877 + 0.0563 ≈ 0.5256\n\nSo, the probability of making at least 8 free throws out of 10 attempts is approximately 52.56%."
