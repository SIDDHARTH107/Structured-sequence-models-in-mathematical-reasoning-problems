    "message_2": "To solve the equation (5/x) + (3/x^2) = 2, we first find a common denominator for the two fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x^2. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(5x/x^2) + (3/x^2) = 2\n\nNow, we can combine the two fractions on the left side:\n\n(5x + 3)/x^2 = 2\n\nNext, we can get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by x^2:\n\n(5x + 3) = 2x^2\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. To solve it, we need to set it equal to zero:\n\n2x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)^2 - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± 7) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (5 + 7) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3\n\nx = (5 - 7) / 4 = -2 / 4 = -1/2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -1/2."
