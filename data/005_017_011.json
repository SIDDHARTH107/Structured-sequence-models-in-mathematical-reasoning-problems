    "message_1": "In a survey of 100 students, data was collected on their grades and the number of hours spent studying. If the correlation between grades and study hours is 0.75, what is the percentage of the total variation in grades that can be explained by study hours using principal component analysis?",
    "message_2": "In this case, the correlation coefficient (r) between grades and study hours is given as 0.75. To find the percentage of the total variation in grades that can be explained by study hours using principal component analysis, we need to calculate the coefficient of determination (R^2).\n\nThe coefficient of determination (R^2) is the square of the correlation coefficient (r). So, R^2 = r^2.\n\nR^2 = (0.75)^2\nR^2 = 0.5625\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n0.5625 * 100 = 56.25%\n\nSo, 56.25% of the total variation in grades can be explained by study hours using principal component analysis."
