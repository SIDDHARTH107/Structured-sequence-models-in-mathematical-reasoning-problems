    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the sphere is 10 centimeters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 centimeters.\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface area = 100π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)."
