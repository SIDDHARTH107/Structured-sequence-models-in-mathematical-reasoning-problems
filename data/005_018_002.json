    "message_2": "To find the probability that a patient with the specific disease will survive for at least 5 years, we can use the survival function of the exponential distribution. The survival function, S(t), is given by:\n\nS(t) = e^(-t/λ)\n\nwhere t is the time (in years) and λ is the mean survival time (in this case, 4 years).\n\nWe want to find the probability that a patient will survive for at least 5 years, so we will plug in t = 5 and λ = 4 into the survival function:\n\nS(5) = e^(-5/4)\nS(5) ≈ 0.2865\n\nTherefore, the probability that a patient with the specific disease will survive for at least 5 years is approximately 28.65%."
