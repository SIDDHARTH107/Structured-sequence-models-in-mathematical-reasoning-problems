    "message_2": "To find the limit of the given function as x approaches 2, we can try to simplify the expression first.\n\nThe function is:\n\nf(x) = (x^2 - 3x + 2) / (x - 2)\n\nWe can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nSo the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 1)(x - 2)) / (x - 2)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\nf(x) = x - 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) f(x) = lim (x -> 2) (x - 1)\n\n= 2 - 1\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the limit of the function (x^2 - 3x + 2) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 1."
