We are looking for the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's test the smallest prime numbers:\n\nFor p = 2:\n(2-1)! = 1! = 1 ≡ -1 (mod 2), which is true since 1 is congruent to -1 modulo 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 2."
