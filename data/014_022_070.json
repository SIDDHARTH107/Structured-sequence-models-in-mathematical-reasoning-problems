    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"SECRET\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the key \"MATHS\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Break the plaintext message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them and continue. In this case, the plaintext message \"SECRET\" can be broken into the digraphs \"SE\", \"CR\", \"ET\".\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n4. Apply the rules to each digraph:\n\n   - SE: S and E are in the same row. Replace S with H and E with F. The new digraph is \"HF\".\n   - CR: C and R form a rectangle. Replace C with R and R with I. The new digraph is \"RI\".\n   - ET: E and T are in the same column. Replace E with F and T with H. The new digraph is \"FH\".\n\n5. Combine the new digraphs to form the ciphertext: \"HFRIFH\".\n\nSo, the ciphertext produced using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\" for the plaintext message \"SECRET\" is \"HFRIFH\"."
