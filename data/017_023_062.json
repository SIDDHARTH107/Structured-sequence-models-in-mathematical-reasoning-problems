    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of this order.\n\nFor 2-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\nFor 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible group structures:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup. In this case, the group is the direct product of these subgroups, which is abelian (Z_8 × Z_9).\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the form Z_8 ⋊ Z_9. There are two non-abelian groups of this form: the semi-direct product with trivial action (which is isomorphic to the direct product and thus abelian) and the semi-direct product with non-trivial action.\n\n3. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1, then there are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the form Z_9 ⋊ Z_8. There are four non-abelian groups of this form.\n\n4. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4, then there are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, the group structure is more complicated, and there are no additional non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 4 = 6 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nAn example of a non-abelian group of order 72 is the semi-direct product Z_8 ⋊ Z_9 with non-trivial action. This can be represented as a group of matrices of the form:\n\n{[1, 0, 0], [0, a, 0], [0, 0, b]},\n{[1, 0, 0], [0, a, 0], [0, 0, c]},\n\nwhere a is an element of Z_8, b is an element of Z_9, and c is an element of Z_9 with the non-trivial action."
