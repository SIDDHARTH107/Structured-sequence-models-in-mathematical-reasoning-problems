    "message_2": "A convex polygon with n sides can be triangulated in (n-2) non-intersecting diagonals. In this case, we have a convex polygon with 7 sides, so we need to use 5 non-intersecting diagonals to triangulate it.\n\nThe number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon with n sides can be found using the Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * (n+1)!))\n\nFor a convex polygon with 7 sides, we want to find the 5th Catalan number (since we're using 5 diagonals):\n\nC(5) = (1/(5+1)) * (2*5 choose 5) = (1/6) * (10! / (5! * 6!))\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * (3628800 / (120 * 720))\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * (30240)\n\nC(5) = 5040\n\nSo there are 5040 ways to triangulate a convex polygon with 7 sides such that no two of the triangulation lines intersect in the interior of the polygon."
