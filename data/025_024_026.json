    "message_2": "To find the polynomial ring C[x,y]G of polynomial functions on 𝔸² invariant under the action of G, we need to find the polynomials that remain unchanged under the action of any invertible 2x2 complex matrix.\n\nLet A ∈ G be an invertible 2x2 complex matrix, i.e., A = ((a, b), (c, d)) with ad - bc ≠ 0. The action of A on a point (x, y) ∈ 𝔸² is given by:\n\nA * (x, y) = ((a, b), (c, d)) * (x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy).\n\nNow, let f(x, y) be a polynomial in C[x,y]. We want to find the polynomials f(x, y) such that:\n\nf(ax + by, cx + dy) = f(x, y) for all A ∈ G.\n\nTo find such polynomials, we can use the Reynolds operator, which averages the action of G over the polynomial ring. The Reynolds operator R is defined as:\n\nR(f) = (1/|G|) ∑_{A ∈ G} f(A * (x, y)),\n\nwhere |G| is the cardinality of G. Since G is the group of complex 2x2 invertible matrices, it is an infinite group, and we cannot directly compute the sum. However, we can use the fact that the action of G on 𝔸² is transitive, meaning that for any two points P, Q ∈ 𝔸², there exists an A ∈ G such that A * P = Q.\n\nIn particular, this means that the action of G on the polynomial ring C[x,y] is also transitive, and we can find the invariant polynomials by looking at the fixed points of the action. The fixed points are the polynomials f(x, y) such that:\n\nf(ax + by, cx + dy) = f(x, y) for all A ∈ G.\n\nWe can find these fixed points by considering the transformation properties of the monomials x^n y^m under the action of G. For example, let's consider the monomial x^2:\n\n(x^2)(ax + by, cx + dy) = (ax + by)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abxy + b^2y^2.\n\nThis monomial is not invariant under the action of G, as it transforms into a linear combination of x^2, xy, and y^2. Similarly, we can check that all monomials of the form x^n y^m with n, m > 0 are not invariant under the action of G.\n\nThe only monomials that are invariant under the action of G are the constant polynomials, i.e., the polynomials of the form f(x, y) = c, where c is a complex number. Therefore, the polynomial ring C[x,y]G of polynomial functions on 𝔸² invariant under the action of G is just the ring of constant polynomials:\n\nC[x,y]G = C."
