Since any graph with at least 4 vertices will have either an edge or an independent set of size 4, R(2, 4) = 4.\n\nR(3, 3) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size 3 (a triangle) or an independent set of size 3 (three vertices with no edges between them). It is known that R(3, 3) = 6.\n\nNow, we can use the inequality to find R(3, 4):\n\nR(3, 4) ≤ R(2, 4) + R(3, 3)\nR(3, 4) ≤ 4 + 6\nR(3, 4) ≤ 10\n\nIt is known that R(3, 4) = 9 because there exists a graph with 8 vertices, called the Clebsch graph, which does not contain a triangle or an independent set of size 4. Therefore, the smallest integer R that guarantees the existence of either a triangle or an independent set of size 4 is 9.\n\nSo, R(3, 4) = 9."
