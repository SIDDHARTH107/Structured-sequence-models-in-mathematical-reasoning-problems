    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case, the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B, can be found as follows:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3})\n       = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3}\n       = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference (A Δ B) with the set {2, 3}. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection can be found as follows:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ {2, 3} = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3}\n                  = {}\n\nThe intersection is the empty set, which means there are no common elements between the symmetric difference (A Δ B) and the set {2, 3}.\n\nNow, let's verify the distributive property of symmetric difference over intersection. The distributive property states that:\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C)\n\nLet C = {2, 3}. We need to find A Δ (B ∩ C) and compare it to (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C).\n\nFirst, let's find B ∩ C:\n\nB ∩ C = {2, 3, 4} ∩ {2, 3}\n       = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find A Δ (B ∩ C):\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = A Δ {2, 3}\n            = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3})\n            = {1, 2, 3} - {2, 3}\n            = {1}\n\nNow, let's find A Δ C:\n\nA Δ C = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3})\n       = {1, 2, 3} - {2, 3}\n       = {1}\n\nNow, let's find (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C):\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C) = {1, 4} ∩ {1}\n                  = {1}\n\nSince A Δ (B ∩ C) = {1} and (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C) = {1}, the distributive property of symmetric difference over intersection holds true for the given sets A, B, and C."
