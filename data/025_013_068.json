    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve C defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 4x, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 8x + 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 2) = -3(1)^2 - 8(1) + 4 = -3 - 8 + 4 = -7\n∂F/∂y(1, 2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nFinally, we can write the Jacobian matrix J_F(x, y) as:\n\nJ_F(x, y) = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n                |  -7         4  |\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the algebraic curve C at the point (1, 2) is:\n\nJ_F(1, 2) = | -7  4 |"
