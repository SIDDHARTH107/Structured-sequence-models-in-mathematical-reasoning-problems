    "message_1": "A company wants to produce two products, A and B. The company has 900 units of raw material and 450 units of labor available. The profit for product A is $30 per unit and for product B it is $50 per unit. It takes 3 units of raw material and 2 units of labor to produce one unit of A, and it takes 4 units of raw material and 3 units of labor to produce one unit of B. What is the maximum profit the company can make if they want to produce both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw material and labor are as follows:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 900 (raw material constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 450 (labor constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 30x + 50y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 900\ny ≤ (900 - 3x) / 4\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 450\ny ≤ (450 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (you can't produce a negative amount of products), we also have:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\nx = 0, y = 0\n\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (450 - 2x) / 3:\nx = 0, y = (450 - 2(0)) / 3 = 150\n\n3. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (900 - 4y) / 3:\ny = 0, x = (900 - 4(0)) / 3 = 300\n\n4. Intersection of y = (900 - 3x) / 4 and y = (450 - 2x) / 3:\n(900 - 3x) / 4 = (450 - 2x) / 3\n3(900 - 3x) = 4(450 - 2x)\n2700 - 9x = 1800 - 8x\nx = 900\n\ny = (450 - 2(900)) / 3 = -300 (not feasible since y must be non-negative)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P = 30x + 50y at the corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 30(0) + 50(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 150) = 30(0) + 50(150) = 7500\n3. P(300, 0) = 30(300) + 50(0) = 9000\n\nSince P(300, 0) = 9000 is the highest value, the maximum profit the company can make if they want to produce both products is $9,000. They should produce 300 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
