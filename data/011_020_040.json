    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to find all the possible combinations of three integers from the given set that add up to 9.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. {1, 2, 6}: The sum of these three integers is 1 + 2 + 6 = 9.\n\n2. {1, 3, 5}: The sum of these three integers is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.\n\n3. {2, 3, 4}: The sum of these three integers is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\n\nThere are no other combinations of three integers from the given set that add up to 9. Therefore, there are 3 different ways to choose three integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} such that their sum is equal to 9."
