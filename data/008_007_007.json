    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P such that P⁻¹AP = D, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. This involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of A:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[4-λ, 2, 2], [2, 4-λ, 2], [2, 2, 4-λ]]\n\nThe determinant of (A - λI) is:\n\n|A - λI| = (4-λ)[(4-λ)(4-λ) - 4] - 2[2(4-λ) - 4] + 2[4 - (4-λ)] = (4-λ)((4-λ)^2 - 4) - 4(4-λ) + 8 = λ^3 - 12λ^2 + 48λ - 64\n\nSetting the determinant equal to zero and solving for λ:\n\nλ^3 - 12λ^2 + 48λ - 64 = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 2, λ2 = 2, and λ3 = 8.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors of A:\nNow we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = λ2 = 2:\n(A - 2I)v = [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]v = 0\nThe eigenvectors are v1 = [1, -1, 0] and v2 = [1, 0, -1].\n\nFor λ3 = 8:\n(A - 8I)v = [[-4, 2, 2], [2, -4, 2], [2, 2, -4]]v = 0\nThe eigenvector is v3 = [1, 1, 1].\n\n3. Form the matrix P and diagonal matrix D:\nNow we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as diagonal entries.\n\nP = [[1, 1, 1], [-1, 0, 1], [0, -1, 1]]\nD = [[2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 8]]\n\nSo, the invertible matrix P is [[1, 1, 1], [-1, 0, 1], [0, -1, 1]] and the diagonal matrix D is [[2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 8]]."
