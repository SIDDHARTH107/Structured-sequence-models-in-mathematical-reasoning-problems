    "message_1": "A chemical reaction follows the rate law,  $Rate = k[A]^2[B]$. If the concentration of reactant A is 0.01 M and the concentration of B is 0.02 M, and the rate constant k is 0.02 M^-1 s^-1, what is the rate of the reaction in M/s?",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of the reaction, we can plug the given values into the rate law equation:\n\n$Rate = k[A]^2[B]$\n\n$Rate = (0.02\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})(0.01\\,\\text{M})^2(0.02\\,\\text{M})$\n\n$Rate = (0.02)(0.0001)(0.02)$\n\n$Rate = 4 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{M/s}$\n\nSo the rate of the reaction is $4 \\times 10^{-5}$ M/s."
