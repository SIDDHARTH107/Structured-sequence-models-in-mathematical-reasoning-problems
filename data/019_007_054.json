    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem related to the subtopic of non-monotonic logic in mathematics as it deals with reasoning with uncertain or incomplete information rather than mathematical calculations. It involves the study of how knowledge can be added or modified by new information, and how this can affect the overall conclusion drawn from reasoning. It is more of a theoretical concept than a practical one. Can I assist you with any other query?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please feel free to ask any other mathematical or related questions, and I'll be happy to help."
