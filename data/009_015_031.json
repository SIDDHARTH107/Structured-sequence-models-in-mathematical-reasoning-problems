    "message_1": "A certain amount of radioactive material initially contains 1000 atoms. After 15 hours the number of atoms has decreased to 500. Find the half-life of the material.",
    "message_2": "To find the half-life of the radioactive material, we can use the formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere N(t) is the number of atoms remaining after time t, N0 is the initial number of atoms, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life of the material.\n\nIn this case, N0 = 1000, N(t) = 500, and t = 15 hours. We need to find T.\n\n500 = 1000 * (1/2)^(15/T)\n\nDivide both sides by 1000:\n\n0.5 = (1/2)^(15/T)\n\nNow, take the logarithm of both sides (using base 1/2):\n\nlog_(1/2)(0.5) = log_(1/2)((1/2)^(15/T))\n\nSince the logarithm of a number to its own base is 1:\n\n1 = 15/T\n\nNow, solve for T:\n\nT = 15\n\nSo, the half-life of the material is 15 hours."
