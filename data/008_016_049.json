    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Jacobi method, we first rewrite the equations in the form x1 = f1(x2, x3), x2 = f2(x1, x3), and x3 = f3(x1, x2):\n\nx1 = (4 - 3x2 + x3) / 2\nx2 = (4x1 + 2x3 - 3) / 3\nx3 = (10 - x1 - 2x2) / 5\n\nNow, we use the initial guess {x1, x2, x3} = {0, 0, 0} and iterate the Jacobi method:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (4 - 3*0 + 0) / 2 = 2\nx2 = (4*0 + 2*0 - 3) / 3 = -1\nx3 = (10 - 0 - 2*0) / 5 = 2\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = (4 - 3*(-1) + 2) / 2 = 3\nx2 = (4*2 + 2*2 - 3) / 3 = 1\nx3 = (10 - 3 - 2*(-1)) / 5 = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx1 = (4 - 3*1 + 1) / 2 = 1\nx2 = (4*3 + 2*1 - 3) / 3 = 1\nx3 = (10 - 1 - 2*1) / 5 = 1.6\n\nWe can continue iterating until the values converge to a desired level of accuracy. For the sake of brevity, let's stop here. The approximate solution after 3 iterations is {x1, x2, x3} = {1, 1, 1.6}."
