    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 10 cm. A sphere is inscribed inside the cube. What is the volume of the sphere? (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 10 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nThe formula to find the volume of a sphere is:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nSubstitute the radius (r = 5 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 125 cm^3\nV ≈ 523.6 cm^3\n\nThe volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
