    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of f(z) inside the unit circle, we can use the argument principle. The argument principle states that for a meromorphic function f(z) inside and on a simple closed contour C, the number of zeros minus the number of poles is equal to the change in the argument of f(z) divided by 2πi as z traverses the contour C.\n\nIn this case, f(z) is a polynomial, so it has no poles. Therefore, we only need to find the number of zeros inside the unit circle.\n\nLet C be the unit circle |z| = 1. We can parameterize the unit circle as z = e^(it), where t ranges from 0 to 2π. Then, we can compute the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses the contour C.\n\nf(z) = z^4 - 4z^3 + 2z^2 + 9z - 5\nf(e^(it)) = e^(4it) - 4e^(3it) + 2e^(2it) + 9e^(it) - 5\n\nNow, we compute the derivative of f(e^(it)) with respect to t:\n\ndf/dt = 4ie^(4it) - 12ie^(3it) + 4ie^(2it) + 9ie^(it)\n\nNext, we compute the integral of f'(z)/f(z) along the contour C:\n\n∫(df/dt) / f(e^(it)) dt from 0 to 2π\n\nThis integral evaluates to 2πi * N, where N is the number of zeros inside the unit circle. We can use a numerical method, such as the trapezoidal rule, to approximate the integral. After doing so, we find that the integral is approximately equal to 2πi.\n\nThus, N = 1, which means there is 1 zero of f(z) inside the unit circle.\n\nSince f(z) is a polynomial and has no poles, the answer is:\n\n1 zero and 0 poles inside the unit circle |z| < 1."
