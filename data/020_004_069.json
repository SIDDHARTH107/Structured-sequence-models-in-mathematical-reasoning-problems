    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $3 and the profit per unit of product B is $5. The company has 3 machines that produce both products but each machine has a limited capacity. The first machine can produce up to 200 units of product A or 100 units of product B; the second machine can produce up to 150 units of product A or 300 units of product B, and the third machine can produce up to 250 units of product A or 150 units of product B. Assuming the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce using the machines?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, the company should focus on producing more units of product B since it has a higher profit per unit. We can use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nP = 3x + 5y\n\nThe constraints are given by the machine capacities:\n\n1. Machine 1: x/200 + y/100 ≤ 1\n2. Machine 2: x/150 + y/300 ≤ 1\n3. Machine 3: x/250 + y/150 ≤ 1\n4. x ≥ 0\n5. y ≥ 0\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\n\n1. y ≤ -2x + 200\n2. y ≤ -x/2 + 150\n3. y ≤ -5x/3 + 250\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities and finding the intersection points:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and 2: (-2x + 200 = -x/2 + 150) -> x = 100, y = 0\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and 3: (-2x + 200 = -5x/3 + 250) -> x = 150, y = -100 (not feasible, since y ≥ 0)\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and 3: (-x/2 + 150 = -5x/3 + 250) -> x = 300, y = 0 (not feasible, since it doesn't satisfy constraint 1)\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (100, 0), and (150, 50).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the objective function P = 3x + 5y at these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0\n2. P(100, 0) = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300\n3. P(150, 50) = 3(150) + 5(50) = 750\n\nThe maximum profit is $750, which occurs when the company produces 150 units of product A and 50 units of product B."
