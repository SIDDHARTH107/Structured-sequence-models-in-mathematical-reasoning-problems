    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting two consecutive sunny days in a city where it rains 40% of the time, we first need to find the probability of a sunny day.\n\nSince it rains 40% of the time, the probability of a sunny day is 100% - 40% = 60%.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of having two consecutive sunny days. To do this, we multiply the probability of a sunny day by itself:\n\nProbability of two consecutive sunny days = (Probability of a sunny day) * (Probability of a sunny day)\n= 0.6 * 0.6\n= 0.36\n\nSo, the probability of getting two consecutive sunny days in this city is 36%."
