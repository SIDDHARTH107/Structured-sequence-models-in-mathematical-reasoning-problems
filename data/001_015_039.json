    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3^(2x+1) = 27^(x-1), we can start by expressing 27 as a power of 3, since 27 = 3^3. The equation then becomes:\n\n3^(2x+1) = (3^3)^(x-1)\n\nNow, we can use the property of exponents that states (a^m)^n = a^(m*n) to simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n3^(2x+1) = 3^(3(x-1))\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x + 1 = 3(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by distributing the 3 on the right side and then isolating x:\n\n2x + 1 = 3x - 3\n\nNext, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n1 = x - 3\n\nFinally, add 3 to both sides to solve for x:\n\nx = 4"
