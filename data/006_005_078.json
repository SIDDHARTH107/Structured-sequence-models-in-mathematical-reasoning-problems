    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces electronic components and knows that the average rate of defects is 0.05 per unit. What is the probability of producing at least one defective component in a batch of 50 units?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of producing at least one defective component in a batch of 50 units, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of producing no defective components.\n\nThe probability of a single unit being non-defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor a batch of 50 units, the probability of all units being non-defective is (0.95)^50 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, to find the probability of producing at least one defective component, we can subtract the complementary probability from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability of producing at least one defective component in a batch of 50 units is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
