    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 3+4i \\\\\n3 & -1 & 4 & 2+2i \\\\\n2 & 3 & -1 & -1+3i\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 3 times the first row from the second row, and 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 3+4i \\\\\n0 & -7 & 7 & -7-10i \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & -7-5i\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n2. Multiply the second row by -1/7 and the third row by -1:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 3+4i \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 1+\\frac{10}{7}i \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 7+5i\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n3. Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 3+4i \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 1+\\frac{10}{7}i \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 6+\\frac{25}{7}i\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nSince the third row has all zeros in the coefficient columns and a non-zero value in the constant column, this system of equations has no solution."
