    "message_1": "In a small community of 200 families, the probability of a family owning a dog is 0.35, and the probability of a family owning a cat is 0.25. What is the probability that a randomly chosen family from this community owns either a dog or a cat?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen family owns either a dog or a cat, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of owning a dog, B is the event of owning a cat, and A ∩ B is the event of owning both a dog and a cat.\n\nWe are given P(A) = 0.35 and P(B) = 0.25. However, we don't have the information about the probability of a family owning both a dog and a cat (P(A ∩ B)). \n\nIf we assume that owning a dog and owning a cat are independent events (meaning that the probability of owning a dog does not affect the probability of owning a cat and vice versa), then we can calculate P(A ∩ B) as follows:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.35 * 0.25 = 0.0875\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a family owning either a dog or a cat:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.35 + 0.25 - 0.0875 = 0.5125\n\nSo the probability that a randomly chosen family from this community owns either a dog or a cat is 0.5125 or 51.25%."
