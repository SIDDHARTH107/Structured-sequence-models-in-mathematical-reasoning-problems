    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph of the original graph.\n\nLet's analyze the given edge set and find the largest clique in graph G.\n\nEdge set: {(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(5,6),(5,7)}\n\nWe can see that vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all connected to each other:\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nThis forms a complete subgraph (clique) with 4 vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow let's check if there is a larger clique in the graph. The only other vertices left are 5, 6, and 7. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 2, 3, 6, and 7. However, vertices 6 and 7 are not connected to any other vertices except 5, so they cannot be part of a larger clique.\n\nTherefore, the largest clique in graph G is the one with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}, and its size is 4."
