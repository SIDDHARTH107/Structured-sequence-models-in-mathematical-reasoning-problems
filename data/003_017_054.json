    "message_1": "Suppose a pendulum swings with an amplitude of 10cm and a period of 2 seconds. Find the average height of the pendulum over one full swing, assuming that the height of the pendulum at any given time can be modeled by the trigonometric function h(t) = 10cos(πt), where t is measured in seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the average height of the pendulum over one full swing, we need to integrate the height function h(t) over one period and then divide by the length of the period. The period of the pendulum is 2 seconds, so we will integrate from 0 to 2.\n\nThe height function is h(t) = 10cos(πt). We will integrate this function with respect to t from 0 to 2 and then divide by 2.\n\nAverage height = (1/2) * ∫[10cos(πt) dt] from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate the cosine function, we can use the following rule:\n\n∫cos(ax) dx = (1/a)sin(ax) + C\n\nIn our case, a = π. So, the integral of 10cos(πt) dt is:\n\n(10/π)sin(πt) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral from 0 to 2:\n\n(1/2) * [(10/π)sin(π(2)) - (10/π)sin(π(0))]\n\nsin(π(2)) = sin(2π) = 0 and sin(π(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n(1/2) * [(10/π)(0) - (10/π)(0)] = 0\n\nThe average height of the pendulum over one full swing is 0 cm. This makes sense because the pendulum spends equal amounts of time above and below its equilibrium position, so the average height is at the equilibrium position, which is 0 cm in this case."
