    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have a system described by the differential equation\n\ny'' - 3y' + 2y = u(t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the system's output and u(t) is the system's input. We want to design a control law such that the output y(t) decays to zero as fast as possible. \n\nAssuming that u(t) is a constant input equal to u = 1, what value of the control gain K would minimize the settling time of the system? Use the time-domain method to find the optimal value of K, and assume that the initial conditions are y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1.",
    "message_2": "To design a control law, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the given system. The given differential equation is:\n\ny'' - 3y' + 2y = u(t)\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\ns^2 - 3s + 2 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(s - 1)(s - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the system has two poles at s = 1 and s = 2. To make the system decay to zero as fast as possible, we need to move these poles to the left half of the complex plane by applying a control law.\n\nLet's assume the control law is:\n\nu(t) = -Ky(t) + 1\n\nNow, the closed-loop system equation becomes:\n\ny'' - 3y' + 2y = -Ky + 1\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\ny'' - 3y' + (2 + K)y = 1\n\nThe new characteristic equation is:\n\ns^2 - 3s + (2 + K) = 0\n\nTo minimize the settling time, we want to maximize the real part of the poles. The optimal value of K will make the two poles equal and have the maximum real part. Using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (3 ± √(3^2 - 4(2 + K)))/2\n\nFor equal poles, the discriminant must be zero:\n\n3^2 - 4(2 + K) = 0\n\nSolving for K, we get:\n\n9 - 8 - 4K = 0\n4K = 1\nK = 1/4\n\nSo, the optimal value of the control gain K that minimizes the settling time of the system is K = 1/4."
