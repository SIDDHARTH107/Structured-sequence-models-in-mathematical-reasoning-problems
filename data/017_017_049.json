    "message_2": "To prove that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 modulo 3, we will use Sylow's Theorems. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. According to Sylow's Theorems:\n\n1. There exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say P, with order 3.\n2. All Sylow 3-subgroups of G are conjugate to P.\n3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides the order of G (which is 30), and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nSince the order of G is 30, we can write it as 2 * 3 * 5. Now, we need to find the divisors of 30 that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. Among these divisors, the ones that are congruent to 1 modulo 3 are 1, 4, and 10. However, 4 is not a divisor of 30, so we can ignore it.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities for n_3: 1 and 10.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. This case satisfies the condition n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 10\nIn this case, there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and each has order 3. Since the Sylow 3-subgroups are pairwise disjoint except for the identity element, there are a total of 10 * (3 - 1) = 20 elements of order 3 in G. This leaves 30 - 20 = 10 elements in G that do not have order 3. Since the order of any element in G must divide the order of G (Lagrange's Theorem), the remaining 10 elements must form a single Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. However, this does not contradict Sylow's Theorems, so this case is also possible.\n\nIn both cases, n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Therefore, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 modulo 3."
