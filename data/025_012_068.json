    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$ at the point $(-2, 3)$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. \n\nImplicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + 5x + 7)$$\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n$$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 5$$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point $(-2, 3)$. Plug in the coordinates of the point into the equation:\n\n$$2(3)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(-2)^2 + 5$$\n\n$$6\\frac{dy}{dx} = 12 + 5$$\n\n$$6\\frac{dy}{dx} = 17$$\n\nDivide by 6:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{17}{6}$$\n\nNow we have the slope of the tangent line at the point $(-2, 3)$. To find the equation of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:\n\n$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$\n\nPlug in the point $(-2, 3)$ and the slope $\\frac{17}{6}$:\n\n$$y - 3 = \\frac{17}{6}(x + 2)$$\n\nNow, we can distribute the slope and simplify the equation:\n\n$$y - 3 = \\frac{17}{6}x + \\frac{34}{6}$$\n\n$$y = \\frac{17}{6}x + \\frac{34}{6} + 3$$\n\n$$y = \\frac{17}{6}x + \\frac{52}{6}$$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$ at the point $(-2, 3)$ is:\n\n$$y = \\frac{17}{6}x + \\frac{52}{6}$$"
