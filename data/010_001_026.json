    "message_2": "A topological space with 10 points can have a maximum number of connected components equal to the number of points in the space. This is because each point can be considered as a connected component itself, with the discrete topology.\n\nIn the discrete topology, every subset of the space is an open set, so each singleton set {x} containing a single point x is open. Since the only open set containing x is {x} itself, the connected component containing x must be {x}. Therefore, each point forms its own connected component.\n\nSo, the maximum number of connected components that a topological space with 10 points can have is 10."
