    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 40, and let n_5 and n_2 denote the number of 5-Sylow and 2-Sylow subgroups of G, respectively. By Sylow's Theorems, we have:\n\nn_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and n_5 | 8, so n_5 = 1 or 8.\nn_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and n_2 | 5, so n_2 = 1 or 5.\n\nWe are given that G has a normal 5-Sylow subgroup, so n_5 = 1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G, and Q be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then |P| = 5 and |Q| = 8.\n\nSince P is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q. The structure of this semidirect product depends on the action of Q on P, which is determined by a homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P).\n\nNow, |Aut(P)| = |Aut(Z_5)| = 4, where Z_5 is the cyclic group of order 5. Since |Q| = 8, we have two possibilities for φ:\n\n1. φ is trivial, i.e., φ(q) = id for all q in Q. In this case, the semidirect product P ⋊ Q is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_8, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. φ is non-trivial, i.e., there exists q in Q such that φ(q) is not the identity automorphism. In this case, the semidirect product P ⋊ Q is not a direct product, and G is non-abelian.\n\nSince we are looking for a non-abelian group, we consider the second case. The non-trivial automorphisms of P are of order 2 or 4. If φ(Q) has an element of order 4, then Q must have an element of order 4 as well. However, this would imply that Q is not a 2-Sylow subgroup, which is a contradiction. Therefore, φ(Q) must have an element of order 2.\n\nLet q_0 be an element of order 2 in Q such that φ(q_0) is an automorphism of order 2 in Aut(P). Then G has the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨p, q | p^5 = 1, q^8 = 1, q^4 = q_0, p^q = p^φ(q)⟩\n\nSince φ(q_0) is of order 2, we have:\n\np^(q^2) = p^(φ(q_0)) = p\n\nThus, G has the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨p, q | p^5 = 1, q^8 = 1, q^4 = q_0, p^q = p^φ(q), p^(q^2) = p⟩\n\nThis is the unique non-abelian group of order 40 with a normal 5-Sylow subgroup. It is not isomorphic to any of the other groups of order 40 mentioned in the subtopic, as it is the only non-abelian group with this property."
