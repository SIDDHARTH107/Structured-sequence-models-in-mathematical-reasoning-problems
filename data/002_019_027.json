    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 4 cm and a slant height of 8 cm. What is the total surface area of the cone? Round your answer to two decimal places if necessary.",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle, so we can find its area using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(4 cm)² = 16π cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area of the cone. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(4 cm)(8 cm) = 32π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 16π cm² + 32π cm² = 48π cm²\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14:\n\nA_total ≈ 48(3.14) cm² ≈ 150.72 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is approximately 150.72 cm², rounded to two decimal places."
