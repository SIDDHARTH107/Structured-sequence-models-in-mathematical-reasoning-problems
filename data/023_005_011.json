    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the given function on the right-hand side, which is 2sin(3x).\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [0, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an*cos(nπx/L) + bn*sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere\na0 = (2/L) * ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to L\nan = (2/L) * ∫[f(x)*cos(nπx/L)dx] from 0 to L\nbn = (2/L) * ∫[f(x)*sin(nπx/L)dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 2sin(3x) and L = π. Since f(x) is an odd function, all the an coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the bn coefficients.\n\nbn = (2/π) * ∫[2sin(3x)*sin(nπx/π)dx] from 0 to π\n\nFor n = 3, bn = (2/π) * ∫[2sin(3x)*sin(3x)dx] from 0 to π\nbn = (4/π) * ∫[sin^2(3x)dx] from 0 to π\n\nUsing the identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2, we get:\n\nbn = (4/π) * ∫[(1 - cos(6x))/2 dx] from 0 to π\nbn = (2/π) * [x - (1/6)sin(6x)] from 0 to π\nbn = 2\n\nFor n ≠ 3, bn = 0.\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series representation of 2sin(3x):\n\n2sin(3x) = 2*sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given differential equation as:\n\ny''(x) + 4y(x) = 2*sin(3x)\n\nLet's assume the solution y(x) has the form:\n\ny(x) = A*cos(3x) + B*sin(3x)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\ny'(x) = -3A*sin(3x) + 3B*cos(3x)\ny''(x) = -9A*cos(3x) - 9B*sin(3x)\n\nSubstitute y''(x) and y(x) into the given differential equation:\n\n-9A*cos(3x) - 9B*sin(3x) + 4A*cos(3x) + 4B*sin(3x) = 2*sin(3x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-5A*cos(3x) - 5B*sin(3x) = 2*sin(3x)\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\n-5A = 0 => A = 0\n-5B = 2 => B = -2/5\n\nSo, the solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = -2/5*sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\ny(0) = -2/5*sin(0) = 1\ny(π) = -2/5*sin(3π) = -1\n\nHowever, the boundary conditions are not satisfied by the solution y(x) = -2/5*sin(3x). This indicates that the given differential equation with the specified boundary conditions has no solution."
