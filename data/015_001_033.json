    "message_2": "The Lorenz system exhibits chaotic behavior for certain parameter values. The smallest positive value of parameter r (ρ) for which the system exhibits chaotic behavior is known as the critical value. The critical values for the other parameters σ and b are typically set to σ = 10 and b = 8/3.\n\nThe critical value of ρ for the onset of chaos in the Lorenz system is approximately ρ = 24.74. This is the smallest positive value of ρ for which the system exhibits chaotic behavior when σ = 10 and b = 8/3."
