    "message_1": "The Traveler's Dilemma involves two players trying to guess the highest amount the other player will guess. Using Game Theory, what is the Nash equilibrium for this scenario if the possible numbers that can be guessed are between 1 and 100 and the penalty for guessing too high is the difference between your guess and the correct answer?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two players simultaneously choose a number between 1 and 100. If both players choose the same number, they both receive that amount as a reward. If they choose different numbers, the player with the lower number receives their chosen number as a reward, and the player with the higher number receives the lower number minus the difference between the two numbers as a reward.\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify a strategy for each player such that no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose the lowest possible number, which is 1.\n\nHere's why: Suppose one player chooses a number higher than 1, say 2. The other player can choose 1, which guarantees them a reward of 1. If the first player chooses 1 instead, they also receive a reward of 1. Since neither player can improve their outcome by choosing a higher number, the Nash equilibrium is for both players to choose 1."
