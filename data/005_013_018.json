If the correlation coefficient between weight and height is 0.75, and between age and height is -0.50, what is the correlation coefficient between weight and age?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient between weight and age, we can use the formula for the correlation coefficient of a third variable:\n\nr(W, A) = (r(W, H) * r(A, H)) / sqrt((1 - r(W, H)^2) * (1 - r(A, H)^2))\n\nwhere r(W, A) is the correlation coefficient between weight and age, r(W, H) is the correlation coefficient between weight and height, and r(A, H) is the correlation coefficient between age and height.\n\nGiven r(W, H) = 0.75 and r(A, H) = -0.50, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr(W, A) = (0.75 * -0.50) / sqrt((1 - 0.75^2) * (1 - (-0.50)^2))\nr(W, A) = (-0.375) / sqrt((1 - 0.5625) * (1 - 0.25))\nr(W, A) = (-0.375) / sqrt(0.4375 * 0.75)\nr(W, A) = (-0.375) / sqrt(0.328125)\nr(W, A) ≈ -0.375 / 0.5727\nr(W, A) ≈ -0.654\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient between weight and age is approximately -0.654."
