    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 5    4  |  20 ]\n[ 10.01  8.02  |  40.4 ]\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 5 to get a leading 1:\n\n[ 1    0.8  |  4 ]\n[ 10.01  8.02  |  40.4 ]\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 10.01 times the first row:\n\n[ 1    0.8  |  4 ]\n[ 0    0.006  |  0.4 ]\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 0.006 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n[ 1    0.8  |  4 ]\n[ 0    1  |  66.67 ]\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y = 66.67.\n\nSubstituting this value into the first row, we get:\n\nx + 0.8(66.67) = 4\nx = 4 - 0.8(66.67)\nx = 4 - 53.336\nx = -49.336\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -49.336 and y = 66.67.\n\nNow, let's comment on the condition of the coefficient matrix of the system. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n[ 5    4 ]\n[ 10.01  8.02 ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\ndet(A) = (5)(8.02) - (4)(10.01) = 40.1 - 40.04 = 0.06\n\nSince the determinant is very close to zero, the matrix is nearly singular, which means the system of linear equations is ill-conditioned. This implies that the system is sensitive to small changes in the coefficients, and the solution may not be stable or accurate."
