    "message_1": "A company sells a product for $50 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the number of units demanded and P is the price per unit. The company has a fixed cost of $5000 and a variable cost of $20 per unit. What price should the company charge in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the price (P) that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nRevenue = Price × Quantity = P × Q\nCost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost × Quantity = $5000 + $20 × Q\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between P and Q using the demand function:\n\nQ = 100 - 2P\n\nNow, we can express the revenue and cost functions in terms of P:\n\nRevenue = P × (100 - 2P)\nCost = $5000 + $20 × (100 - 2P)\n\nNow, we can find the profit function:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = P × (100 - 2P) - ($5000 + $20 × (100 - 2P))\n\nNow, we need to find the price (P) that maximizes the profit function. To do this, we can take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to P and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 0\n\nLet's find the first derivative of the profit function:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = d(P × (100 - 2P) - ($5000 + $20 × (100 - 2P)))/dP\nd(Profit)/dP = (100 - 2P) - 2P × (100 - 2P) - 0 - $20 × (-4P)\nd(Profit)/dP = 100 - 4P - 4P^2 + 80P\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for P:\n\n0 = 100 - 4P - 4P^2 + 80P\n0 = -4P^2 + 76P + 100\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nP = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -4, b = 76, and c = 100:\n\nP = (-76 ± √(76^2 - 4 × (-4) × 100)) / (2 × (-4))\nP = (-76 ± √(5776 + 1600)) / (-8)\nP = (-76 ± √7376) / (-8)\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for P:\n\nP1 = (-76 + √7376) / (-8) ≈ 14.29\nP2 = (-76 - √7376) / (-8) ≈ 1.75\n\nSince the demand function is Q = 100 - 2P, a higher price will result in a lower quantity demanded. Therefore, we should choose the higher price, P1 ≈ 14.29, to maximize profit.\n\nHowever, this price is significantly lower than the current price of $50 per unit. It's important to note that this is a theoretical result based on the given demand function and cost structure. In practice, the company may need to consider other factors, such as market conditions and competitor pricing, before making a decision on the optimal price."
