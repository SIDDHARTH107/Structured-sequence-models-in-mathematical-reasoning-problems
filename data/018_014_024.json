    "message_2": "First, let's find A x B, which is the Cartesian product of sets A and B. This means we will create ordered pairs with elements from A in the first position and elements from B in the second position.\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B)'. This means we will find all the ordered pairs in the universal set U x V that are not in A x B. To do this, we need to know the universal sets U and V for A and B, respectively. Since they are not given, we cannot find the exact (A x B)'.\n\nNext, let's find the complements of sets A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively. Again, we need to know the universal sets U and V for A and B to find their complements. Since they are not given, we cannot find the exact A' and B'.\n\nFinally, let's prove that (A x B)' is not equal to A' x B'. \n\nAssume that (A x B)' = A' x B'. Then, for any ordered pair (a, b) in (A x B)', a must be in A' and b must be in B'. However, this is not true for all ordered pairs in (A x B)'. For example, consider an ordered pair (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B'. This ordered pair is not in A x B, so it must be in (A x B)'. However, it cannot be in A' x B' because a is not in A'. This contradicts our assumption that (A x B)' = A' x B', so they must not be equal."
