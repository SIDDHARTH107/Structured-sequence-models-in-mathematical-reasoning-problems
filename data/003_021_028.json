    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors u and v is given by:\n\nu • v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the given vectors u and v:\n\nu • v = (-3)(4) + (5)(2) = -12 + 10 = -2\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √((-3)^2 + (5)^2) = √(9 + 25) = √34\n\n|v| = √((4)^2 + (2)^2) = √(16 + 4) = √20\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n-2 = (√34)(√20)cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = -2 / (√34 * √20)\n\nθ = arccos(-2 / (√34 * √20))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 1.8235 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the following formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 1.8235 * (180 / π) ≈ 104.48°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 104.48°, correct to two decimal places."
