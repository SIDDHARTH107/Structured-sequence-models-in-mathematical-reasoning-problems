    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by:\n\nArea = π - (sum of angles)\n\nIn this case, the sum of angles is:\n\n120° + 90° + 50° = 260°\n\nTo convert this to radians, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 radian = 180° / π\n\nSo, the sum of angles in radians is:\n\n260° * (π / 180°) = (260/180)π ≈ 4.5379 radians\n\nNow, we can find the area using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\nArea = π - 4.5379 ≈ 1.3963 square units\n\nHowever, we are given that the side opposite the 90° angle is 6 cm. To find the area in terms of this side length, we need to use the hyperbolic law of cosines. For a hyperbolic triangle with angles A, B, and C and side lengths a, b, and c, the hyperbolic law of cosines states:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\ncosh(a) = cosh(6) (since the side opposite the 90° angle is 6 cm)\ncosh(b) = cosh(b) (unknown)\ncos(C) = cos(120°) = -1/2\n\nWe can rearrange the hyperbolic law of cosines equation to solve for cosh(b):\n\ncosh(b) = (cosh(6) + sinh(6) * sinh(b) * (-1/2)) / cosh(6)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is 1.3963 square units to find the relationship between sinh(a) and sinh(b). The area of a hyperbolic triangle can also be expressed as:\n\nArea = (1/2) * sinh(a) * sinh(b) * sin(C)\n\nPlugging in the values we know:\n\n1.3963 = (1/2) * sinh(6) * sinh(b) * sin(120°)\n\nSolving for sinh(b):\n\nsinh(b) = (1.3963 * 2) / (sinh(6) * sin(120°))\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for sinh(b) back into the equation for cosh(b):\n\ncosh(b) = (cosh(6) + sinh(6) * ((1.3963 * 2) / (sinh(6) * sin(120°))) * (-1/2)) / cosh(6)\n\nSimplifying:\n\ncosh(b) ≈ 1.5431\n\nNow that we have cosh(b), we can find the length of side b using the inverse hyperbolic cosine function:\n\nb ≈ arccosh(1.5431) ≈ 1.1315 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the triangle in terms of the given side length:\n\nArea = (1/2) * sinh(6) * sinh(1.1315) * sin(120°) ≈ 9.2378 square cm\n\nSo, the area of the hyperbolic triangle is approximately 9.2378 square cm."
