    "message_2": "To determine if the set S is connected or not, we need to analyze the two subsets that form S.\n\nThe first subset is {(x,y) ∈ ℝ² : x² + y² ≤ 1}, which represents all points (x,y) inside a circle with radius 1 and centered at the origin (0,0). This subset is connected because any two points within this circle can be connected by a continuous path without leaving the circle.\n\nThe second subset is {(x,y) ∈ ℝ² : (x-2)² + y² ≤ 1}, which represents all points (x,y) inside a circle with radius 1 and centered at the point (2,0). This subset is also connected because any two points within this circle can be connected by a continuous path without leaving the circle.\n\nNow, we need to check if there is any intersection between these two subsets. If there is an intersection, then the union of the two subsets will be connected. If there is no intersection, then the union will not be connected.\n\nThe distance between the centers of the two circles is given by the Euclidean distance formula:\n\nd = √((2-0)² + (0-0)²) = √(4) = 2\n\nSince the distance between the centers of the two circles (2) is greater than the sum of their radii (1+1=2), there is no intersection between the two circles.\n\nTherefore, the set S is not connected, as there is no continuous path that can connect points from the first subset to points from the second subset without leaving the set S."
