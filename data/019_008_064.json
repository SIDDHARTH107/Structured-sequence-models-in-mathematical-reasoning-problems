Suppose the following rules apply:\n\n- If the wear and tear level is 0%, the discount is 0%.\n- If the wear and tear level is 25%, the discount is 10%.\n- If the wear and tear level is 50%, the discount is 20%.\n- If the wear and tear level is 75%, the discount is 30%.\n- If the wear and tear level is 100%, the discount is 50%.\n\nIf you want to buy a jacket that originally costs $80, and its wear and tear level is 60%, what will be the final price you have to pay after the discount is applied?",
    "message_2": "To determine the discount for a wear and tear level of 60%, we can interpolate between the 50% and 75% wear and tear levels. \n\nThe difference in wear and tear levels between 50% and 75% is 25%, and the difference in discounts between 20% and 30% is 10%. \n\nSince the wear and tear level of the jacket you want to buy is 60%, it is 10% higher than the 50% wear and tear level. To find the corresponding discount, we can calculate the proportion of the 10% difference in discounts:\n\n(10% wear and tear difference / 25% wear and tear difference) * 10% discount difference = (10/25) * 10% = 0.4 * 10% = 4%\n\nNow, add this 4% to the 20% discount for the 50% wear and tear level:\n\n20% + 4% = 24%\n\nSo, the discount for a 60% wear and tear level is 24%. \n\nNow, apply this discount to the original price of the jacket:\n\n$80 * (1 - 24%) = $80 * (1 - 0.24) = $80 * 0.76 = $60.80\n\nThe final price you have to pay after the discount is applied is $60.80."
