    "message_1": "Suppose there are two bidders who are interested in buying a rare manuscript. Each bidder has a privately known valuation for the manuscript. The auctioneer decides to use a second-price sealed-bid auction with a reserve price of $1000. Bidder 1 estimates the manuscript to be worth $2000 and Bidder 2 estimates it to be worth $3000. What is the expected revenue for the auctioneer if the manuscript is sold?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. In this case, there are two bidders with valuations of $2000 and $3000. Since there is a reserve price of $1000, both bidders will bid at least $1000.\n\nBidder 1 will bid $2000, and Bidder 2 will bid $3000. Bidder 2 will win the auction, but they will pay the second-highest bid, which is $2000. Therefore, the expected revenue for the auctioneer if the manuscript is sold is $2000."
