The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Thus, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G, say P_5.\n\n2) For the 2-Sylow subgroup, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5^1 = 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. \n\nNow, we consider the cases for G:\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40.\nIn this case, G is abelian, and there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. This corresponds to the case n_2 = 1.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20.\nIn this case, G is non-abelian, and there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups, which corresponds to the case n_2 = 5.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\nThese groups are also non-abelian, and they have 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups, which corresponds to the case n_2 = 5.\n\nTo determine which of these cases G falls into, we need more information about G. If G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to C40. If G is non-abelian and has 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups, then it could be isomorphic to D20 or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. Without further information about G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
