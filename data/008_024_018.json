    "message_2": "We can start by simplifying the system of linear equations. Notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent and represent the same plane in 3D space.\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 10\n\n2(x + 2y + 3z) = 2(10) => 2x + 4y + 6z = 20\n\n3(x + 2y + 3z) = 3(10) => 3x + 6y + 9z = 30\n\nSince all three equations represent the same plane, there are infinitely many solutions for (x, y, z) that satisfy the system of equations. To find a general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve for x in the first equation:\n\nx = 10 - 2y - 3z\n\nNow, we can express any solution (x, y, z) in terms of y and z:\n\n(x, y, z) = (10 - 2y - 3z, y, z)\n\nThis is the general solution for the system of linear equations, where y and z can be any real numbers."
