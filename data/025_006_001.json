    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{C})$, we will use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. First, we need to find a smooth hyperplane section of $X$. Consider the following linear equation:\n\n$F_3(x,y,z,w) = x + y + z + w = 0$\n\nWe can check that the intersection of $X$ with the hyperplane $F_3 = 0$ is transverse, i.e., the gradients of $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ are linearly independent at the intersection points. This implies that the intersection $Y = X \\cap \\{F_3 = 0\\}$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension 1.\n\nNow, we can apply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, which states that for $0 \\leq i \\leq \\dim X - 1 = 1$, the restriction map\n\n$$H^i(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\to H^i(Y, \\mathbb{C})$$\n\nis an isomorphism, and for $0 \\leq i \\leq \\dim X - 2 = 0$, the restriction map\n\n$$H^i(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\to H^{i+1}(Y, \\mathbb{C})$$\n\nis an injection.\n\nSince $Y$ is a smooth projective curve, we have the following cohomology groups:\n\n$H^0(Y, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\n$H^1(Y, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of $Y$\n\n$H^2(Y, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\nNow, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to compute the cohomology groups of $X$:\n\n$H^0(X, \\mathbb{C}) = H^0(Y, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\n$H^1(X, \\mathbb{C}) = H^1(Y, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}^{2g}$\n\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{C}) = H^1(Y, \\mathbb{C}) \\oplus \\mathbb{C} = \\mathbb{C}^{2g+1}$\n\n$H^3(X, \\mathbb{C}) = H^2(Y, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\nSo, the cohomology groups of $X$ are:\n\n$H^0(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\n$H^1(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}^{2g}$\n\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}^{2g+1}$\n\n$H^3(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$"
