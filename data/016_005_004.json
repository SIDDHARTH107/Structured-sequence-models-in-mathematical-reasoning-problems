    "message_2": "The Cantor Set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each interval in the previous iteration. Let's analyze the number of intervals after each iteration:\n\n1. Initial interval: 1 interval\n2. First iteration: 2 intervals (each of the remaining two-thirds)\n3. Second iteration: 2 * 2 = 4 intervals (each of the remaining two-thirds is divided into two intervals)\n4. Third iteration: 2 * 4 = 8 intervals\n5. Fourth iteration: 2 * 8 = 16 intervals\n\nAfter 4 iterations, there are a total of 16 intervals in the construction of the Cantor Set."
