    "message_1": "A rollercoaster ride has 15 seats. There are 7 boys and 8 girls in the queue. If the ride operator randomly selects the passengers, what is the probability that 4 boys and 11 girls will be on the rollercoaster?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 boys out of 7 and 11 girls out of 8, and then divide that by the total number of ways to choose 15 passengers out of the 15 people in the queue.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to choose 4 boys out of 7. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nFor the boys, we have:\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!)\n= 7! / (4!3!)\n= (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n= (7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 35\n\nSo there are 35 ways to choose 4 boys out of 7.\n\nHowever, since there are only 8 girls and we need to choose 11, it is impossible to choose 11 girls out of 8. Therefore, the probability of having 4 boys and 11 girls on the rollercoaster is 0."
