C12: The cyclic group of order 12.\nC12 has one element of order 1 (the identity), and eleven elements of order 2, 3, 4, or 6. If G is isomorphic to C12, then G must have an element of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G is either 1 or 4, and the number of 2-Sylow subgroups is either 1 or 3. If G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup and a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, then these subgroups are normal in G, and their intersection is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element). In this case, G would be the internal direct product of its 3-Sylow and 2-Sylow subgroups, and thus G would be isomorphic to C12. However, if G has more than one 3-Sylow or 2-Sylow subgroup, then G cannot be isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. A4: The alternating group of order 12.\nA4 is the group of even permutations of 4 elements, and it has 12 elements: the identity, 8 3-cycles, and 3 2-cycles. If G is isomorphic to A4, then G must have the same structure. In particular, G must have 8 elements of order 3 and 3 elements of order 2. By the Sylow theorems, G has either 1 or 4 3-Sylow subgroups. If G has 4 3-Sylow subgroups, then G has 8 elements of order 3, which matches the structure of A4. However, if G has only 1 3-Sylow subgroup, then G cannot be isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. D6: The dihedral group of order 12.\nD6 is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon, and it has 12 elements: 6 rotations and 6 reflections. If G is isomorphic to D6, then G must have the same structure. In particular, G must have 1 element of order 1, 1 element of order 2, 2 elements of order 3, and 6 elements of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, G has either 1 or 4 3-Sylow subgroups. If G has only 1 3-Sylow subgroup, then G has 2 elements of order 3, which matches the structure of D6. However, if G has 4 3-Sylow subgroups, then G cannot be isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, depending on the number of 3-Sylow and 2-Sylow subgroups it has. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, one would need to examine the specific structure of G and its subgroups."
