    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function can be found by analyzing the horizontal shift of the function. The general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function y = 3sin(2x + 3) + 2, we can rewrite it in the general form by factoring out the 2 from the argument of the sine function:\n\ny = 3sin(2(x + 3/2)) + 2\n\nNow, we can see that the phase shift C is equal to -3/2. The phase shift of the function is -3/2 or -1.5 units to the right."
