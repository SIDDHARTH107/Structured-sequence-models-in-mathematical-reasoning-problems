    "message_2": "To solve the linear equation 2x + 5 = 11 for x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n2x = 6\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n2x / 2 = 6 / 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution for the linear equation 2x + 5 = 11 is x = 3."
