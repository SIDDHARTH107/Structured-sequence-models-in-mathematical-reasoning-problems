    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and h be the height of the box. The volume V of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * h\n\nSince we want the volume to be 250 cubic inches, we have:\n\n250 = x^2 * h\n\nNow, we want to minimize the surface area S of the box, which is given by:\n\nS = x^2 + 4xh\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of x from the volume equation:\n\nh = 250 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nS(x) = x^2 + 4x(250 / x^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nS(x) = x^2 + 1000 / x\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of S(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndS/dx = 2x - 1000 / x^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2x^3 - 1000 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x^3 = 1000\nx^3 = 500\nx = (500)^(1/3)\n\nx ≈ 7.94 inches\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 250 / x^2\nh ≈ 250 / (7.94^2)\nh ≈ 3.97 inches\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will use the least amount of material are approximately 7.94 inches by 7.94 inches for the square base and a height of approximately 3.97 inches."
