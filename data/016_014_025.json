    "message_2": "To find the length of the Lévy C curve after 10 iterations, we can use the given formula:\n\nL(n) = (2^(n/2))/(3^(n/2-1))\n\nSubstitute n with 10:\n\nL(10) = (2^(10/2))/(3^(10/2-1))\n\nL(10) = (2^5)/(3^4)\n\nL(10) = 32/81\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after 10 iterations is 32/81."
