    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n|B| = √(3² + (-7)²) = √(9 + 49) = √58\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of vectors A and B. To find A · B, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y)\n\nwhere A_x and A_y are the components of vector A, and B_x and B_y are the components of vector B.\n\nA · B = (5 * 3) + (2 * -7) = 15 - 14 = 1\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (1) / (√29 * √58)\n\nFinally, we can find the dot product of vectors A and B using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = √29 * √58 * (1) / (√29 * √58) = 1\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors A and B is 1."
