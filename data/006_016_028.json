    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.12. \n\nWhat is the probability that out of 1000 products produced, exactly 120 will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (defects) in n trials (products),\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 1000 products),\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 120 defects),\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.12), and\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(120) = (1000C120) * (0.12^120) * (1-0.12)^(1000-120)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 1000C120:\n\n1000! / (120! * (1000-120)!)\n\n= 1000! / (120! * 880!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(120) = (1000C120) * (0.12^120) * (0.88^880)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(120) â‰ˆ 0.0424\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 120 out of 1000 products will have this type of defect is approximately 0.0424 or 4.24%."
