    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting 8 or more heads in 10 flips of a fair coin, we need to consider the probabilities of getting exactly 8, 9, and 10 heads. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), q is the probability of failure (1-p, also 0.5 for a fair coin), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of getting exactly 8 heads:\n\nP(X = 8) = (10C8) * (0.5^8) * (0.5^2)\n10C8 = 10! / (8!(10-8)!) = 45\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.5^8) * (0.5^2) = 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25 = 0.0439453125\n\nNext, let's find the probability of getting exactly 9 heads:\n\nP(X = 9) = (10C9) * (0.5^9) * (0.5^1)\n10C9 = 10! / (9!(10-9)!) = 10\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.5^9) * (0.5^1) = 10 * 0.001953125 * 0.5 = 0.009765625\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of getting exactly 10 heads:\n\nP(X = 10) = (10C10) * (0.5^10) * (0.5^0)\n10C10 = 10! / (10!(10-10)!) = 1\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.5^10) * (0.5^0) = 1 * 0.0009765625 * 1 = 0.0009765625\n\nNow, we can add these probabilities to find the probability of getting 8 or more heads:\n\nP(X â‰¥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) = 0.0439453125 + 0.009765625 + 0.0009765625 = 0.0546875\n\nSo, the probability of getting 8 or more heads in 10 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.0547 or 5.47%."
