    "message_2": "To show that $\\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} = 2g + n - 1$, we will use the Morse inequalities and the fact that the Euler characteristic of a compact, orientable, connected 2-dimensional surface $S$ with genus $g$ and $n$ boundary components is given by $\\chi(S) = 2 - 2g - n$.\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that for a Morse complex $M$ associated with a smooth Morse function $f$ on a manifold $S$, we have:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k \\mathrm{dim(H_k(M))} \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k \\mathrm{dim(C_k(M))} \\geq \\chi(S),$$\n\nwhere $C_k(M)$ are the Morse chain groups and $H_k(M)$ are the Morse homology groups.\n\nSince $S$ is a 2-dimensional surface, we only need to consider the Morse homology groups $H_0(M)$, $H_1(M)$, and $H_2(M)$. The Morse inequalities then become:\n\n$$\\mathrm{dim(H_0(M))} - \\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} + \\mathrm{dim(H_2(M))} \\geq 2 - 2g - n.$$\n\nFor a connected surface, we have $\\mathrm{dim(H_0(M))} = 1$. Moreover, since $S$ is orientable, we have $\\mathrm{dim(H_2(M))} = 0$. Therefore, the Morse inequalities reduce to:\n\n$$1 - \\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} \\geq 2 - 2g - n.$$\n\nRearranging this inequality, we get:\n\n$$\\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} \\leq 2g + n - 1.$$\n\nHowever, since the Morse complex is a chain complex, we also have that $\\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} \\geq 2g + n - 1$. Combining these inequalities, we obtain:\n\n$$\\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} = 2g + n - 1.$$\n\nNow, let $f:S\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be defined as $f(x,y)=x^2-y^2$ on the surface $S$ which has genus $2$ and $3$ boundary components. To find the rank of the Morse homology groups $\\mathrm{H}_1(M)$ for this particular Morse function, we can use the formula we just derived:\n\n$$\\mathrm{dim(H_1(M))} = 2g + n - 1 = 2(2) + 3 - 1 = 6.$$\n\nTherefore, the rank of the Morse homology groups $\\mathrm{H}_1(M)$ for this particular Morse function is 6."
