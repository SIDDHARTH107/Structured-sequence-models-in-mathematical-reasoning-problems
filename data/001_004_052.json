    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial expression 2x^3 - 10x^2 + 12x, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms.\n\nThe GCF of 2x^3, -10x^2, and 12x is 2x. We factor out the GCF from the polynomial:\n\n2x(x^2 - 5x + 6)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses (x^2 - 5x + 6). We look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3. So, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the factored polynomial expression:\n\n2x(x^2 - 5x + 6) = 2x(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the complete factorization of the polynomial expression 2x^3 - 10x^2 + 12x is:\n\n2x(x - 2)(x - 3)"
