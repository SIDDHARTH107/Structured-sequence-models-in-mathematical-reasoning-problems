Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row echelon form.\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  6 |\n| 2 -3  1 | -5 |\n| 3 -1  2 |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into its row echelon form.\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the 2 in the second row, first column, and the 3 in the third row, first column.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  6  |\n| 0 -7  7 | -17 |\n| 0 -7 11 | -17 |\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the -7 in the third row, second column.\n\nR3 = R3 - R2\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  6  |\n| 0 -7  7 | -17 |\n| 0  0  4 |  0  |\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row echelon form, we can perform back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n4z = 0\nz = 0\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-7y + 7z = -17\n-7y = -17\ny = 17/7\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 6\nx + 2(17/7) - 3(0) = 6\nx = 6 - 34/7\nx = 8/7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 8/7, y = 17/7, z = 0"
