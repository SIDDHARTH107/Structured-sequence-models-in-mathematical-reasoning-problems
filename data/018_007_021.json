    "message_1": "Let's say you have a set A with 4 elements. What is the cardinality of the power set of A and how does it compare to the cardinality of A itself?",
    "message_2": "The cardinality of a power set of a set A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in set A. In this case, set A has 4 elements, so the cardinality of the power set of A is 2^4 = 16.\n\nComparing the cardinality of the power set of A to the cardinality of A itself, we can see that the power set has significantly more elements (16) than the original set A (4)."
