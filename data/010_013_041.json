    "message_2": "To determine the homotopy group $\\pi_1(X)$ of the compact space X, we need to consider the properties of the vector bundle and the rank of the bundle. Since the rank of the vector bundle is 2, we have a 2-dimensional vector bundle over the compact space X.\n\nLet E be the total space of the vector bundle, and let B be the base space, which is X in this case. The fiber F is a 2-dimensional vector space. According to the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for a fibration, we have:\n\n$\\cdots \\to \\pi_1(F) \\to \\pi_1(E) \\to \\pi_1(B) \\to \\pi_0(F) \\to \\cdots$\n\nSince F is a 2-dimensional vector space, it is homotopy equivalent to a point, and thus $\\pi_1(F) = 0$ and $\\pi_0(F) = 0$. This simplifies the long exact sequence to:\n\n$\\cdots \\to 0 \\to \\pi_1(E) \\to \\pi_1(B) \\to 0 \\to \\cdots$\n\nNow, we know that the compact space X is the base space B, so we are interested in finding $\\pi_1(X) = \\pi_1(B)$. From the simplified long exact sequence, we can see that $\\pi_1(E) \\cong \\pi_1(B)$, which means the first homotopy group of the total space E is isomorphic to the first homotopy group of the base space X.\n\nHowever, without more information about the total space E or the compact space X, we cannot determine the specific homotopy group $\\pi_1(X)$."
