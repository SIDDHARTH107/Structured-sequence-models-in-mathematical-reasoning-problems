    "message_2": "We can model this situation using the exponential distribution, which is used to describe the time between events in a Poisson process. The probability density function (pdf) of the exponential distribution is given by:\n\nf(t) = λ * e^(-λt)\n\nwhere λ is the rate parameter (the reciprocal of the mean time between events), t is the time, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, the mean time between breakdowns is 15 days, so the rate parameter λ = 1/15.\n\nTo find the probability that a machine will break down in the next 2 days, we need to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution, which is given by:\n\nF(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe want to find the probability that a machine will break down in the next 2 days, so we need to find F(2):\n\nF(2) = 1 - e^(-λ * 2)\nF(2) = 1 - e^(-(1/15) * 2)\nF(2) = 1 - e^(-2/15)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nF(2) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.1333) ≈ 1 - 0.8753 ≈ 0.1247\n\nSo, the probability that a machine will break down in the next 2 days is approximately 12.47%."
