    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges in the given graph, we can use depth-first search (DFS) and keep track of the discovery time and the lowest reachable vertex for each node.\n\nPerforming DFS on the given graph, we get the following discovery times and lowest reachable vertices:\n\n```\nVertex | Discovery Time | Lowest Reachable\n------------------------------------------\n   A   |       1        |        1\n   B   |       2        |        1\n   C   |       3        |        1\n   D   |       4        |        4\n   E   |       5        |        4\n   F   |       6        |        6\n```\n\nNow, we can determine the cut vertices and bridges:\n\n1. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components. In this graph, the cut vertices are B and C. Removing B or C would disconnect the graph into two separate components.\n\n2. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components. In this graph, there are two bridges: the edge between B and C, and the edge between E and F. Removing either of these edges would disconnect the graph into two separate components.\n\nSo, the cut vertices in this graph are B and C, and the bridges are the edges (B, C) and (E, F)."
