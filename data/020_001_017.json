    "message_1": "Suppose you own a factory that produces two products: Product A and Product B. The factory has 150 units of raw material available and can operate for a maximum of 40 hours per week. The production of one unit of Product A requires 2 units of raw material and 4 hours of factory operation time, while the production of one unit of Product B requires 3 units of raw material and 5 hours of factory operation time. \n\nEach unit of Product A brings in a profit of $15 and each unit of Product B brings in a profit of $20. Determine the maximum profit that can be earned by the factory each week subject to the available resources and production constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 150\n2. Factory operation time constraint: 4x + 5y ≤ 40 * 60 (converting hours to minutes)\n\nOur objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 15x + 20y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ (150 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 2400\n   y ≤ (2400 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. To find the maximum profit, we will check the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nVertices:\nA. Intersection of y-axis and constraint 1: (0, 50)\nB. Intersection of x-axis and constraint 1: (75, 0)\nC. Intersection of y-axis and constraint 2: (0, 480/5)\nD. Intersection of x-axis and constraint 2: (600/4, 0)\nE. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2: (x, y)\n\nTo find the intersection point E, we can solve the system of equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 150\n4x + 5y = 2400\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n4x + 5y - (4x + 6y) = 2400 - 300\n-y = 2100 - 300\ny = 300 - 2100\ny = 30\n\nNow, we can substitute y back into the first equation to find x:\n\n2x + 3(30) = 150\n2x + 90 = 150\n2x = 60\nx = 30\n\nSo, the intersection point E is (30, 30).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nA. P(0, 50) = 15(0) + 20(50) = $1000\nB. P(75, 0) = 15(75) + 20(0) = $1125\nC. P(0, 480/5) = 15(0) + 20(480/5) = $1920\nD. P(600/4, 0) = 15(600/4) + 20(0) = $2250\nE. P(30, 30) = 15(30) + 20(30) = $1050\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at vertex D, where 150 units of Product A are produced and no units of Product B are produced. The maximum profit that can be earned by the factory each week is $2250."
