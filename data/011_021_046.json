    "message_1": "A salesman has to visit 5 cities, but he wants to visit each city only once and then return to the first city. The distances between the cities are:\nCity 1 to City 2: 6 km\nCity 1 to City 3: 8 km\nCity 1 to City 4: 10 km\nCity 1 to City 5: 7 km\nCity 2 to City 3: 5 km\nCity 2 to City 4: 9 km\nCity 2 to City 5: 6 km\nCity 3 to City 4: 7 km\nCity 3 to City 5: 9 km\nCity 4 to City 5: 8 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance that the salesman can travel to visit all the 5 cities and return to the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate their total distances. There are 4! (4 factorial) possible routes since the salesman starts at City 1 and must return to City 1. The 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 possible routes are:\n\n1.
