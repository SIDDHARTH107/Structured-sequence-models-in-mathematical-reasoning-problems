    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 4 -3  2 | -1 ]\n[ 3  2  1 |  4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 3 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[ 3  2  1 |  4 ]\n[ 4 -3  2 | -1 ]\n[ 2  3 -1 |  7 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the pivot (3) in the first row:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (4/3) * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (2/3) * Row 1\n\n```\n[  3   2   1  |   4  ]\n[  0  -5   2/3|  -9/3]\n[  0   5/3 -5/3|   5/3]\n```\n\nStep 3: Swap row 2 and row 3 to have the largest absolute value in the second column:\n\n```\n[  3   2    1  |   4  ]\n[  0   5/3 -5/3|   5/3]\n[  0  -5   2/3 |  -9/3]\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below the pivot (5/3) in the second row:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 3 * Row 2\n\n```\n[  3   2    1  |   4  ]\n[  0   5/3 -5/3|   5/3]\n[  0   0    1  |   0  ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We will perform back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 5: Solve for z:\n\n1 * z = 0 => z = 0\n\nStep 6: Solve for y:\n\n(5/3) * y - (5/3) * z = 5/3 => y = 1\n\nStep 7: Solve for x:\n\n3 * x + 2 * y + z = 4 => x = 2/3\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 2/3, y = 1, and z = 0."
