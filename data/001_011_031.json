    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (5/3) = (7/x) - (1/6), we will first find a common denominator for all the fractions involved. The common denominator for x, 3, and 6 is 6x. \n\nNow, we will rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n(2/x) * (6/6) = 12/6x\n(5/3) * (2x/2x) = 10x/6x\n(7/x) * (6/6) = 42/6x\n(1/6) * (x/x) = x/6x\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation with the new fractions:\n\n(12/6x) + (10x/6x) = (42/6x) - (x/6x)\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions on each side of the equation:\n\n(12 + 10x)/6x = (42 - x)/6x\n\nSince the denominators are the same, we can set the numerators equal to each other:\n\n12 + 10x = 42 - x\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n11x = 30\nx = 30/11"
