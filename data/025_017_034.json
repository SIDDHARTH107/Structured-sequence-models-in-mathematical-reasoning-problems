    "message_2": "We are given that X is a smooth projective curve of genus 3, and f: X -> P^1 is a non-constant morphism of degree 2. We want to calculate the arithmetic genus of X.\n\nThe arithmetic genus (p_a) of a smooth projective curve X is given by the formula:\n\np_a = (g - 1),\n\nwhere g is the geometric genus of X.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the geometric genus of X is 3. Therefore, the arithmetic genus of X is:\n\np_a = (3 - 1) = 2.\n\nSo, the arithmetic genus of X is 2."
