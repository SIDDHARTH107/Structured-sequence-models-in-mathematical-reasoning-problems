    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(5x + 2π), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet u = 5x + 2π. Then, y = cos(u).\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\ndy/du = -sin(u)\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\ndu/dx = 5\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = dy/du * du/dx\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\ndy/dx = -sin(u) * 5\n\nFinally, substitute u back in terms of x:\ndy/dx = -5sin(5x + 2π)"
