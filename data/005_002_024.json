    "message_1": "A car manufacturer claims that its new sedan model has an average fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon (mpg) with a standard deviation of 2.5 mpg. A sample of 50 sedan cars is taken to test this claim. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean fuel efficiency of the sedan model based on the sample data.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean fuel efficiency of the sedan model based on the sample data, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = X̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere:\nX̄ = sample mean (in this case, the claimed average fuel efficiency of 30 mpg)\nZ = Z-score for the desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96)\nσ = population standard deviation (2.5 mpg)\nn = sample size (50 sedans)\n\nConfidence Interval = 30 ± 1.96 * (2.5 / √50)\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard Error = 2.5 / √50 ≈ 0.3536\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error (Z * Standard Error):\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.3536 ≈ 0.6926\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 30 ± 0.6926\nLower Limit = 30 - 0.6926 ≈ 29.3074\nUpper Limit = 30 + 0.6926 ≈ 30.6926\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean fuel efficiency of the sedan model based on the sample data is approximately (29.3074, 30.6926) mpg."
