    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\alpha$, we need to take the partial derivatives of the coefficients $f(x,y)$, $g(x,y)$, and $h(x,y)$ with respect to the local coordinates $(x,y,z)$ and then wedge the results with the corresponding basis 1-forms. \n\nRecall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form, so we need to compute the following:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}dx \\wedge dx = 0$ (since $dx \\wedge dx = 0$)\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}dx \\wedge dy$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}dx \\wedge dz = 0$ (since $f$ does not depend on $z$)\n4. $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}dy \\wedge dx = -\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}dx \\wedge dy$ (since $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$)\n5. $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}dy \\wedge dy = 0$ (since $dy \\wedge dy = 0$)\n6. $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}dy \\wedge dz = 0$ (since $g$ does not depend on $z$)\n7. $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}dz \\wedge dx = -\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}dx \\wedge dz$ (since $dz \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dz$)\n8. $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}dz \\wedge dy = -\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}dy \\wedge dz$ (since $dz \\wedge dy = -dy \\wedge dz$)\n9. $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z}dz \\wedge dz = 0$ (since $dz \\wedge dz = 0$)\n\nNow, we can sum up the non-zero terms to get the exterior derivative $d\\alpha$:\n\n$d\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right)dx \\wedge dy + \\left(-\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\\right)dx \\wedge dz + \\left(-\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\right)dy \\wedge dz$."
