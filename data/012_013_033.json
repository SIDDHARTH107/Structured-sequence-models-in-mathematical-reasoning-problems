    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G, we need to determine the number of ways to color the graph using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Let P(G, k) represent the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors.\n\nSince the graph G has 5 vertices and 7 edges, we can start by analyzing its structure. A connected graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges must contain a cycle. There are three possible cases for the structure of G:\n\n1. G has a 3-cycle (triangle) and a 4-cycle.\n2. G has a 4-cycle and a 5-cycle.\n3. G has two 5-cycles.\n\nFor each case, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm to find the chromatic polynomial. The deletion-contraction algorithm states that for any edge e in G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n\nwhere G - e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e (merging the two vertices connected by e and removing any resulting loops).\n\nCase 1: G has a 3-cycle (triangle) and a 4-cycle.\nLet's label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, and the vertices of the 4-cycle as D, E, F, and G. The graph G has the following edges: AB, BC, CA, AD, DE, EF, and FG.\n\nWe can apply the deletion-contraction algorithm to edge AB:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - AB, k) - P(G / AB, k)\n\nG - AB has the edges BC, CA, AD, DE, EF, and FG. Since G - AB has a 4-cycle, we can use the chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an even number of vertices:\n\nP(G - AB, k) = (k-1)^4 - (k-1)^2\n\nG / AB has the vertices A', C, D, E, F, and G, where A' is the merged vertex of A and B. The edges are A'C, CD, DE, EF, and FG. This graph is a tree, so we can use the chromatic polynomial of a tree:\n\nP(G / AB, k) = k(k-1)^(n-1) = k(k-1)^4\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - AB, k) - P(G / AB, k) = (k-1)^4 - (k-1)^2 - k(k-1)^4\n\nCase 2 and Case 3 can be analyzed similarly, but they will result in more complex chromatic polynomials. The chromatic polynomial of G depends on its specific structure, and without more information about the graph, we cannot determine a unique chromatic polynomial. However, the above example demonstrates how to find the chromatic polynomial for a specific case."
