    "message_1": "How many ways can a group of 8 people be divided into 3 smaller groups, where each group has at least 1 person? (Hint: Use Stirling numbers of the second kind)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), which represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 8 people and k = 3 groups. So, we need to find the value of S(8, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(8, 3), we need to know the values of S(7, 3), S(7, 2), S(6, 3), S(6, 2), and so on. We can build a table of Stirling numbers to find these values:\n\nn\\k | 1   2    3    4\n----------------------\n1   | 1   0    0    0\n2   | 1   1    0    0\n3   | 1   3    1    0\n4   | 1   7    6    1\n5   | 1  15   25    10\n6   | 1  31   90    65\n7   | 1  63  301   350\n8   | 1 127  966  1701\n\nNow we can find the value of S(8, 3) from the table, which is 966.\n\nSo, there are 966 ways to divide a group of 8 people into 3 smaller groups, where each group has at least 1 person."
