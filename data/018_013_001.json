    "message_2": "To solve these problems, we first need to find the Cartesian products AxB and BxB, and then find the union of the sets.\n\n1. AxB: The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. In this case, A = {1} and B = {2}, so AxB = {(1, 2)}.\n\n2. BxB: Similarly, BxB is the set of all ordered pairs (b1, b2) where b1 is in B and b2 is in B. Since B = {2}, BxB = {(2, 2)}.\n\nNow, we can find the unions:\n\n1. (AxB) U B: The union of two sets A and B, denoted A U B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, (AxB) = {(1, 2)} and B = {2}, so (AxB) U B = {(1, 2), 2}.\n\n2. A U (BxB): Using the same definition of union, A = {1} and (BxB) = {(2, 2)}, so A U (BxB) = {1, (2, 2)}."
