    "message_2": "Mersenne primes are prime numbers that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. As of now, there are only 51 known Mersenne primes. The 50th Mersenne prime was discovered on November 17, 2016, and it has an exponent of 74,207,281. Therefore, the 50th Mersenne prime is:\n\n2^74,207,281 - 1\n\nThis number has 22,338,618 digits, so it's not feasible to write it out in its entirety here. However, you can use software like GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search) to calculate and verify Mersenne primes if you're interested in working with such large numbers."
