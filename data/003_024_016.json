    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector AC onto vector AB, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection = (AC · AB) / ||AB||\n\nwhere AC and AB are the vectors, and ||AB|| is the magnitude of vector AB.\n\nFirst, let's represent the vectors AC and AB in terms of their components. We can consider point A as the origin (0, 0), and then the coordinates of points B and C can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet B = (x, 0) and C = (x', y'). Since AB = 8 cm and AC = 17 cm, we have:\n\nx^2 = 8^2 = 64\nx'^2 + y'^2 = 17^2 = 289\n\nNow, we use the distance formula for BC = 15 cm:\n\n(x' - x)^2 + y'^2 = 15^2 = 225\n\nSubstituting x^2 = 64, we get:\n\n(x' - 8)^2 + y'^2 = 225\n\nNow, we know x'^2 + y'^2 = 289, so we can substitute:\n\n(x' - 8)^2 + 289 - x'^2 = 225\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n64 - 16x' + x'^2 = 225 - 289\nx'^2 - 16x' + 64 = -64\nx'^2 - 16x' + 128 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x' using the quadratic formula:\n\nx' = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -16, and c = 128:\n\nx' = (16 ± √((-16)^2 - 4(1)(128))) / 2(1)\nx' = (16 ± √(256 - 512)) / 2\nx' = (16 ± √(-256)) / 2\n\nSince we cannot have a negative value inside the square root, there is no real solution for x'. This means that the triangle ABC cannot exist with the given side lengths. Therefore, it is not possible to find the projection of vector AC onto vector AB for this triangle."
