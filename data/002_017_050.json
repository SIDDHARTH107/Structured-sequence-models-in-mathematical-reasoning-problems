    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply by the number of triangles.\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so the side length of the triangle is also 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side^2 * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length:\n\nArea = (8^2 * √3) / 4\nArea = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea = 16√3 cm²\n\nNow, since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a regular hexagon, we can find the total area by multiplying the area of one triangle by 6:\n\nTotal area = 6 * (16√3 cm²)\nTotal area = 96√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is 96√3 cm²."
