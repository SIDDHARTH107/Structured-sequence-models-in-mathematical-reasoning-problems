Find the fundamental frequency of the string when it is plucked. (Assume the string is a perfect cylinder with a uniform density of 7800 kg/m³ and a diameter of 1 mm)",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the string, we can use the formula:\n\nf = (1/2L) * √(T/μ)\n\nwhere f is the fundamental frequency, L is the length of the string, T is the tension in the string, and μ is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. We can use the formula:\n\nμ = m / L\n\nwhere m is the mass of the string and L is the length of the string.\n\nGiven the mass (m) of the string is 10 g, we need to convert it to kg:\n\nm = 10 g * (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.01 kg\n\nNow, we can find the linear mass density (μ):\n\nμ = 0.01 kg / 1.2 m = 0.008333 kg/m\n\nNow that we have the linear mass density, we can find the fundamental frequency (f) using the formula:\n\nf = (1/2L) * √(T/μ)\n\nf = (1/(2 * 1.2 m)) * √(100 N / 0.008333 kg/m)\n\nf = (1/2.4) * √(12000)\n\nf ≈ 0.4167 * √(12000)\n\nf ≈ 0.4167 * 109.54\n\nf ≈ 45.65 Hz\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the string when it is plucked is approximately 45.65 Hz."
