    "message_1": "Two people, Amy and Bob, are trying to decide what movie to watch tonight. Amy wants to watch a romantic comedy while Bob prefers an action movie. They both rank the movies in the following order: \n\nAmy: (1) Romantic Comedy (2) Action Movie \nBob: (1) Action Movie (2) Romantic Comedy \n\nIf they don't communicate and independently choose a movie, what is the probability that they will end up watching the same movie?",
    "message_2": "Since there are two movie options, each person has a 1/2 chance of choosing each movie. To find the probability that they both choose the same movie, we can calculate the probability that they both choose the romantic comedy and the probability that they both choose the action movie, and then add those probabilities together.\n\nProbability that both choose Romantic Comedy:\nAmy chooses Romantic Comedy: 1/2\nBob chooses Romantic Comedy: 1/2\nProbability (Amy and Bob choose Romantic Comedy) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nProbability that both choose Action Movie:\nAmy chooses Action Movie: 1/2\nBob chooses Action Movie: 1/2\nProbability (Amy and Bob choose Action Movie) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nProbability that they choose the same movie = Probability (Romantic Comedy) + Probability (Action Movie) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability that Amy and Bob will end up watching the same movie is 1/2 or 50%."
