    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 3  2 -1 | 5\n| 1 -4  2 | 8\n| 2  1  3 | 2\n```\n\nStep 1: Find the pivot in the first column. The pivot is the element with the largest absolute value in the first column. In this case, the pivot is 3, which is already in the first row. So, no row swapping is needed.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the pivot. To do this, we perform the following row operations:\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - (1/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (2/3)R1\n```\n\nThe updated augmented matrix is:\n\n```\n|  3   2  -1 |  5\n|  0  -6   2 |  6\n|  0  -1   7/3 | -2/3\n```\n\nStep 3: Find the pivot in the second column. The pivot is the element with the largest absolute value in the second column below the first row. In this case, the pivot is -6, which is in the second row. So, no row swapping is needed.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below the pivot. To do this, we perform the following row operation:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 - (-1/6)R2\n```\n\nThe updated augmented matrix is:\n\n```\n|  3   2  -1   |  5\n|  0  -6   2   |  6\n|  0   0   4/3 |  4/3\n```\n\nStep 5: Back-substitution. We start by solving for z:\n\n```\n(4/3)z = 4/3\nz = 1\n```\n\nNow we solve for y:\n\n```\n-6y + 2(1) = 6\n-6y = 4\ny = -2/3\n```\n\nFinally, we solve for x:\n\n```\n3x + 2(-2/3) - 1 = 5\n3x - 4/3 = 5\n3x = 19/3\nx = 19/9\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 19/9\ny = -2/3\nz = 1\n```"
