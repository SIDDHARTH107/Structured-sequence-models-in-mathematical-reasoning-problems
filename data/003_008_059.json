    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine function. First, we need to find the angle between the base and the height. Let's call this angle θ. We can use the right triangle formed by the base, the height, and the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\nLet's call half of the base a (so a = 5 cm) and the height b (b = 5 cm). Then, we can use the tangent function to find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = b/a = 5/5 = 1\n\nθ = arctan(1) = 45 degrees\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can use the sine function to find the area of the triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(θ)\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 5 * sin(45 degrees)\n\nSince sin(45 degrees) = √2/2, we have:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 5 * (√2/2)\n\nArea = 25 * (√2/2)\n\nArea = 25√2/2\n\nArea ≈ 17.68 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 17.68 cm²."
