    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or a non-abelian group of order 9, we will first show that G must be abelian, and then we will find the explicit multiplication table for G.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we know that G is a p-group. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C9, C3 × C3. We will show that G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3, and therefore must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nSuppose G is isomorphic to C3 × C3. Then G has elements of order 1, 3, and 9. However, since the order of G is 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 9. Thus, G cannot have an element of order 9, which contradicts our assumption that G is isomorphic to C3 × C3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nNow, let's find the explicit multiplication table for G. Since G is isomorphic to C9, we can represent the elements of G as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, where the operation is addition modulo 9. The multiplication table for G is as follows:\n\n```\n+ | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n--+------------------\n0 | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n1 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0\n2 | 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1\n3 | 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2\n4 | 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3\n5 | 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4\n6 | 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 5\n7 | 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n8 | 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\nThis multiplication table shows that G is indeed isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. Since we have shown that G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or a non-abelian group of order 9. However, since we have found the explicit multiplication table for G, we can see that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
