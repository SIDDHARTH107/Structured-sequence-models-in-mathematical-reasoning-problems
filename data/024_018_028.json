    "message_2": "To calculate the sectional curvature of a cylinder at a point where the normal vector is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, we can use the formula for the sectional curvature of a surface in terms of the principal curvatures:\n\nK = k1 * k2\n\nwhere K is the sectional curvature, and k1 and k2 are the principal curvatures. \n\nFor a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures (k1) is equal to the reciprocal of the radius (1/R), and the other principal curvature (k2) is zero, as there is no curvature along the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius R is 2 cm. Therefore, k1 = 1/2 and k2 = 0.\n\nNow, we can calculate the sectional curvature:\n\nK = k1 * k2 = (1/2) * 0 = 0\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface at a point where the normal vector is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder is 0."
