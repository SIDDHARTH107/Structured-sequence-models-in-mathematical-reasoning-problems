    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the function y = 2sin(3x + π/4), we need to analyze the coefficients and constants in the sine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. Therefore, the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of the basic sine function is 2π. To find the period of the given function, we divide the basic period by the coefficient of x:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function y = 2sin(3x + π/4) is 2, and the period is (2π) / 3."
