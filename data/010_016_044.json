    "message_2": "Since H1(X) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, it has only two elements: the identity element (0) and a non-trivial element, which we can denote as [α], the homology class represented by the curve α. Since β is also a non-trivial element of H1(X), it must be the case that [β] = [α].\n\nThe intersection number of two curves α and β in X is defined as the algebraic count of the intersection points of α and β, taking into account the orientation of the curves. We can compute the intersection number by considering the cup product in the cohomology ring of X.\n\nLet ω1 and ω2 be the dual cohomology classes of α and β, respectively, in H^1(X). Since [α] = [β], we have ω1 = ω2. The cup product of ω1 and ω2 is an element of H^2(X), which is isomorphic to the second homology group H_2(X). Since X is a closed oriented 2-dimensional manifold, H_2(X) is isomorphic to Z.\n\nNow, let's compute the cup product ω1 ∪ ω2. Since ω1 = ω2, we have:\n\nω1 ∪ ω2 = ω1 ∪ ω1\n\nThe cup product is bilinear, so the result is twice the cup product of ω1 with itself:\n\n2(ω1 ∪ ω1)\n\nHowever, since H1(X) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, the coefficients are taken modulo 2. Therefore, the factor of 2 in the cup product becomes 0:\n\n0(ω1 ∪ ω1) = 0\n\nThus, the intersection number of α and β in X is 0."
