    "message_1": "A coffee shop claims that the average wait time in their line is less than 4 minutes. To test this claim, a random sample of 36 customers was selected and the wait times were recorded. The sample mean wait time was 3.5 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.9 minutes. \n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the coffee shop's claim that their average wait time is less than 4 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To test the coffee shop's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average wait time is equal to 4 minutes, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average wait time is less than 4 minutes.\n\nH0: μ = 4\nH1: μ < 4\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample mean (x̄) = 3.5 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 0.9 minutes\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (3.5 - 4) / (0.9 / √36)\nt = (-0.5) / (0.9 / 6)\nt = -0.5 / 0.15\nt = -3.33\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with 35 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.69.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.33) is less than the critical t-value (-1.69), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Therefore, we have enough evidence to support the coffee shop's claim that their average wait time is less than 4 minutes at a 0.05 significance level."
