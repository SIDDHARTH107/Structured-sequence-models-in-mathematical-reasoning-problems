    "message_1": "Suppose there are 1000 students in a school, and we know that the probability of a student getting an A in Mathematics is 0.3, and the probability of a student getting an A in Science is 0.2. What is the probability that a student chosen at random will get an A in both Mathematics and Science?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a student getting an A in both Mathematics and Science, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together, assuming that the events are independent (i.e., getting an A in Mathematics does not affect the probability of getting an A in Science).\n\nProbability of getting an A in both subjects = (Probability of getting an A in Mathematics) × (Probability of getting an A in Science)\n\nProbability of getting an A in both subjects = 0.3 × 0.2 = 0.06\n\nSo, the probability that a student chosen at random will get an A in both Mathematics and Science is 0.06 or 6%."
