    "message_2": "A Sierpinski carpet is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the central square at each step. In the order 3 Sierpinski carpet, this process is repeated 3 times.\n\nLet's first find the total length of the sides of the small squares in the order 3 Sierpinski carpet.\n\nAt each step, the length of the side of the smaller squares is 1/3 of the length of the side of the square at the previous step. So, for an original square with side length 81 units:\n\n1. After the first step, the side length of the smaller squares is 81/3 = 27 units.\n2. After the second step, the side length of the smaller squares is 27/3 = 9 units.\n3. After the third step, the side length of the smaller squares is 9/3 = 3 units.\n\nNow let's find the number of small squares at each step:\n\n1. After the first step, there are 8 small squares (since the central square is removed).\n2. After the second step, each of the 8 small squares from the first step is replaced by 8 smaller squares, so there are 8 * 8 = 64 small squares.\n3. After the third step, each of the 64 small squares from the second step is replaced by 8 smaller squares, so there are 64 * 8 = 512 small squares.\n\nNow we can find the total length of the sides of the small squares in the order 3 Sierpinski carpet:\n\nTotal length = (number of small squares) * (length of the side of each small square) * 4 (since each square has 4 sides)\n\nTotal length = 512 * 3 * 4 = 6144 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the order 3 Sierpinski carpet is 6144 units."
