    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, there must exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, |P| = 2^2 = 4 and |Q| = 3.\n\nSince |P| = 4, P is isomorphic to either C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein four-group). If P is isomorphic to C4, then there exists an element of order 4 in G, which is also an element of order 2. If P is isomorphic to V4, then it contains three elements of order 2. In either case, G has at least one element of order 2.\n\nSince |Q| = 3, Q is isomorphic to C3 (cyclic group of order 3), and thus there exists an element of order 3 in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G using this information:\n\n1. If G has an element of order 12, then G is a cyclic group, and G is isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. If G does not have an element of order 12, then G must have elements of order 2 and 3. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3. Since the orders of a and b are coprime, the order of ab is 6. Thus, G has an element of order 6. Since |G| = 12, G must have a subgroup of order 6, which is isomorphic to C6 (cyclic group of order 6). Let H be this subgroup.\n\nNow, consider the left cosets of H in G. There are two distinct left cosets, H and aH, since |G:H| = 2. Therefore, G is the disjoint union of H and aH. Since a has order 2, a^2 = e (the identity element), and (ab)^2 = abab = a(bab)a. This implies that bab is an element of order 2 in H. Since H is isomorphic to C6, the only element of order 2 in H is the inverse of b, which is b^2. Thus, bab = b^2, and G is generated by a and b with the relations a^2 = b^3 = e and bab = b^2.\n\nThis presentation of G is the presentation of the dihedral group D6. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D6.\n\n3. If G is not isomorphic to C12 or D6, then G must be isomorphic to A4. This can be shown by constructing an explicit isomorphism between G and A4, using the fact that A4 is the group of even permutations of 4 elements, and G has elements of order 2 and 3.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 12 must have at least one element of order 2 and at least one element of order 3, and it must be isomorphic to either C12, D6, or A4."
