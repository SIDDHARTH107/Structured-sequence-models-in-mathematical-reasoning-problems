    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA = {1, 2}\nB = {3, 4}\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A × B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. To find the complement, we need to define the universal set. Let's assume the universal set U is the set of all ordered pairs of integers between 1 and 4, inclusive.\n\nU = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nThe complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A × B.\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} - {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively.\n\nA' = {3, 4}\nB' = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A' and B', denoted as A' × B'.\n\nA' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A' × B', denoted as (A' × B')'.\n\n(A' × B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} - {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(A' × B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, we can see that the complement of the Cartesian product of A complement and B complement, (A' × B')', is not equal to the Cartesian product of A complement and B complement, A' × B'.\n\n(A' × B')' ≠ A' × B'\n\nTherefore, we have proved that the complement of the Cartesian product of A complement and B complement is not equal to the Cartesian product of A complement and B complement."
