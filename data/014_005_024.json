    "message_1": "Suppose you want to generate a digital signature for a message using the RSA algorithm. The hash function output for the message is 3456. The prime numbers used in the RSA algorithm are p = 11 and q = 17. The public key exponent is e = 7. Calculate the private key exponent d and the digital signature for the message.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the private key exponent d and the digital signature for the message, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Calculate the private key exponent d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n4. Calculate the digital signature S = H^d mod n, where H is the hash function output for the message.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. n = p * q = 11 * 17 = 187\n2. φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (11-1) * (17-1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n3. To find d, we need to solve the equation d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)). In our case, e = 7 and φ(n) = 160. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e:\n\n   Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n   gcd(7, 160) = 1 = 7 * 23 - 160 * 1\n\n   Therefore, d = 23 (mod 160).\n\n4. Now, we can calculate the digital signature S:\n   S = H^d mod n = 3456^23 mod 187\n\n   Using modular exponentiation, we get:\n   S = 102\n\nSo, the private key exponent d is 23, and the digital signature for the message is 102."
