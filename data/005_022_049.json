    "message_1": "The problem is: \n\nA group of students took a math test and the results were as follows: 65, 72, 63, 80, 82, 95, 78, 71, 50, 68. \n\nCalculate the median score and the interquartile range. Identify any outliers using the Tukey's rule with a multiplier M=1.5.",
    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the scores in ascending order: 50, 63, 65, 68, 71, 72, 78, 80, 82, 95.\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value. Since there are 10 scores (an even number), we will take the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th).\n\nMedian = (71 + 72) / 2 = 143 / 2 = 71.5\n\nNow, let's find the interquartile range (IQR). We need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, the lower half is: 50, 63, 65, 68, 71. Since there are 5 scores (an odd number), the median is the middle value, which is 65.\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the overall median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, the upper half is: 72, 78, 80, 82, 95. The median is the middle value, which is 80.\n\nNow we can calculate the IQR:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 80 - 65 = 15\n\nTo identify any outliers using Tukey's rule with a multiplier M=1.5, we need to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - (M * IQR) = 65 - (1.5 * 15) = 65 - 22.5 = 42.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + (M * IQR) = 80 + (1.5 * 15) = 80 + 22.5 = 102.5\n\nNow, let's check if there are any outliers in the data:\n\n50, 63, 65, 68, 71, 72, 78, 80, 82, 95\n\nAll the scores are within the lower and upper bounds (42.5 and 102.5), so there are no outliers using Tukey's rule with a multiplier of 1.5.\n\nIn summary, the median score is 71.5, the interquartile range is 15, and there are no outliers using Tukey's rule with a multiplier of 1.5."
