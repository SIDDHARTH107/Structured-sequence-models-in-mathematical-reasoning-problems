    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces a certain type of electronic device, and 2% of the devices produced have a defect. If a sample of 300 devices is selected at random, what is the probability that at least 5 of them will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective devices\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a single device being defective (0.02)\n- n is the total number of devices in the sample (300)\n- k is the number of defective devices\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 5 defective devices, which means we need to find the probability of having 5, 6, 7, ..., 300 defective devices. To do this, we can find the probability of having 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 defective devices and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(300, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (0.98)^300\nP(X = 1) = C(300, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^299\nP(X = 2) = C(300, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (0.98)^298\nP(X = 3) = C(300, 3) * (0.02)^3 * (0.98)^297\nP(X = 4) = C(300, 4) * (0.02)^4 * (0.98)^296\n\nAfter calculating these probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.016\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.080\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.191\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.254\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.225\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 5 defective devices:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - [0.016 + 0.080 + 0.191 + 0.254 + 0.225] ≈ 1 - 0.766 = 0.234\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 5 defective devices in a sample of 300 is approximately 23.4%."
