    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve in game theory:\n\nTwo players, A and B, play a game where each player chooses a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive). If the sum of the chosen numbers is an even number, then player A wins and if the sum is an odd number, then player B wins. What is the probability that player A wins if he chooses 7?",
    "message_2": "If player A chooses 7, in order for the sum to be even, player B must choose an odd number. There are 5 odd numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive): 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nSince player B has 10 choices in total, the probability that player A wins if he chooses 7 is the probability that player B chooses an odd number, which is:\n\n(number of odd numbers) / (total number of choices) = 5/10 = 1/2 or 50%."
