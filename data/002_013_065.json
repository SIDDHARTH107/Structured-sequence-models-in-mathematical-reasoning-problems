    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 10 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 15 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the height is 15 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 10 * 8 * 15\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 1200\n\nVolume = 400 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 400 cubic centimeters."
