The chairman is to form a committee consisting of a chairman, a vice-chairman and a treasurer, with the chairman being elected first, the vice-chairman being elected second and the treasurer being elected last. Assume that no member of the board is allowed to hold more than one position. How many ways can the committee be formed if:\n1. No restrictions are placed on who can hold which position?\n2. The chairman must be chosen from a pool of 2 members who are interested in the position?",
    "message_2": "1. No restrictions are placed on who can hold which position:\n\nThere are 5 members on the board. For the chairman position, there are 5 choices. After the chairman is elected, there are 4 remaining members for the vice-chairman position. Finally, there are 3 remaining members for the treasurer position.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form the committee without any restrictions is:\n\n5 (choices for chairman) * 4 (choices for vice-chairman) * 3 (choices for treasurer) = 60 ways.\n\n2. The chairman must be chosen from a pool of 2 members who are interested in the position:\n\nSince there are only 2 members interested in the chairman position, there are 2 choices for the chairman. After the chairman is elected, there are 4 remaining members for the vice-chairman position. Finally, there are 3 remaining members for the treasurer position.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form the committee with the restriction on the chairman position is:\n\n2 (choices for chairman) * 4 (choices for vice-chairman) * 3 (choices for treasurer) = 24 ways."
