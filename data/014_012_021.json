    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Vigenere Cipher with the key \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the message. In this case, the repeated key is \"MATHM\".\n\nNow, we will use the Vigenere table to encrypt each letter of the message. The table consists of 26 rows and columns, each representing the English alphabet (A-Z). To encrypt a letter, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the message letter and the column corresponding to the key letter.\n\nEncryption process:\n1. H (message) and M (key): Row H, Column M -> Z\n2. E (message) and A (key): Row E, Column A -> E\n3. L (message) and T (key): Row L, Column T -> P\n4. L (message) and H (key): Row L, Column H -> X\n5. O (message) and M (key): Row O, Column M -> F\n\nThe encrypted message is \"ZEPXF\"."
