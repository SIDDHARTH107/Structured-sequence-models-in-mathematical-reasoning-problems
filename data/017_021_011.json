    "message_2": "Using the Sylow theorems, we can narrow down the possibilities for the group of order 48. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which implies that G is the direct product of these subgroups. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the abelian group Z_16 x Z_3, which contradicts the fact that G is non-abelian.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G would be a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_3, the Sylow 2-subgroup must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_16, Z_8 x Z_2, Z_4 x Z_4, or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. However, none of these possibilities lead to a non-abelian group when taking the semi-direct product with Z_3.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G would be a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_16, the Sylow 3-subgroup must be isomorphic to Z_3. The semi-direct product of Z_16 and Z_3 is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 48 called the generalized quaternion group Q_48.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G could be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 48 called the dihedral group D_48.\n\nBased on the given multiplication table, we can see that the group G is non-abelian, and it has elements of order 2, 3, 4, and 6. This information is consistent with the structure of the dihedral group D_48. Therefore, we conclude that the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_48."
