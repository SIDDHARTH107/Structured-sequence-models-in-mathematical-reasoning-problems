    "message_2": "We will use the Cauchy's integral formula for the derivative of a holomorphic function. Let C be a circle centered at the origin with radius R. Then, for any z inside C,\n\nf'(z) = (1 / 2πi) ∫(C) (f(w) / (w - z)^2) dw.\n\nIn particular, for z = 0,\n\nf'(0) = (1 / 2πi) ∫(C) (f(w) / w^2) dw.\n\nTaking the absolute value of both sides, we get\n\n|f'(0)| = |(1 / 2πi) ∫(C) (f(w) / w^2) dw| ≤ (1 / 2π) ∫(C) |f(w) / w^2| |dw|.\n\nNow, we know that |f(w)| ≤ 4|w|^3 for all w in the complex plane. Thus,\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (1 / 2π) ∫(C) (4|w|^3 / |w|^2) |dw| = (4 / 2π) ∫(C) |w| |dw|.\n\nSince w lies on the circle C with radius R, |w| = R. Therefore,\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ (4 / 2π) ∫(C) R |dw| = 2R ∫(C) |dw|.\n\nThe integral ∫(C) |dw| is equal to the circumference of the circle C, which is 2πR. Thus,\n\n|f'(0)| ≤ 2R * 2πR = 4πR^2.\n\nNow, we want to find the largest possible value of |f'(0)|. To do this, we need to find the largest possible value of R^2. Since f(z) is entire, it is holomorphic in the entire complex plane, and there is no upper bound on R. Therefore, the largest possible value of |f'(0)| is unbounded."
