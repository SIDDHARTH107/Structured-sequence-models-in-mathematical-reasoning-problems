    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products - X and Y. Both the products require resources such as labor, raw materials, and machines. The company wants to maximize its profit through proper resource allocation. It has the following information:\n\n- Product X requires 2 units of labor, 3 units of raw materials, and 1 unit of machine time per unit produced\n- Product Y requires 1 unit of labor, 2 units of raw materials, and 2 units of machine time per unit produced\n\nThe company has 100 units of labor, 120 units of raw materials, and 80 units of machine time available per day. The profit per unit of product X is $8 and the profit per unit of product Y is $10.\n\nWhat should be the number of units of products X and Y produced per day to maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced per day and y be the number of units of product Y produced per day. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 8x + 10y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + y ≤ 100\n2. Raw materials constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 120\n3. Machine time constraint: x + 2y ≤ 80\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y ≤ -2x + 100\n2. Raw materials constraint: y ≤ -1.5x + 60\n3. Machine time constraint: y ≤ -0.5x + 40\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points A(0, 0), B(0, 40), C(20, 30), D(40, 20), and E(50, 0). We'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nA(0, 0): P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = $0\nB(0, 40): P(0, 40) = 8(0) + 10(40) = $400\nC(20, 30): P(20, 30) = 8(20) + 10(30) = $500\nD(40, 20): P(40, 20) = 8(40) + 10(20) = $560\nE(50, 0): P(50, 0) = 8(50) + 10(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point D(40, 20), with a profit of $560. Therefore, the company should produce 40 units of product X and 20 units of product Y per day to maximize its profit."
