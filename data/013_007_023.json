    "message_1": "In a town, there is a single park that can be used by all residents. However, the park can only accommodate a maximum of 100 people at a time. If the number of people using the park exceeds 100, the park becomes overcrowded, leading to a tragedy of the commons. There are 1500 residents in the town, and each person has a utility value of 10 for using the park. Using game theory, what is the optimal number of people to use the park at any given time to maximize the total utility value for all residents?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total utility value for all residents, the optimal number of people to use the park at any given time should be 100. This is because the park can only accommodate a maximum of 100 people without becoming overcrowded.\n\nIf there are 100 people using the park, the total utility value for those 100 people would be 100 * 10 = 1000. If more than 100 people use the park, the utility value for each person would decrease due to overcrowding, and the total utility value would be less than 1000.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of people to use the park at any given time to maximize the total utility value for all residents is 100."
