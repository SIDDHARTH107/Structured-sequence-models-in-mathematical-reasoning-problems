    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 4 elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c, d}. The power set of A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nTo calculate the size of the power set of A, we can use the formula: |P(A)| = 2^|A|, where |A| is the size of set A.\n\nSince A has 4 elements, |A| = 4. Therefore, the size of the power set of A is:\n\n|P(A)| = 2^|A| = 2^4 = 16\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A with the size of A:\n\n|P(A)| = 16\n|A| = 4\n\nClearly, the size of the power set of A (16) is larger than the size of A (4).\n\nTo show that the power set of A is always larger than A, let's consider a set B with n elements, where n is a positive integer. The size of the power set of B, denoted by |P(B)|, can be calculated using the formula:\n\n|P(B)| = 2^|B| = 2^n\n\nSince n is a positive integer, 2^n will always be greater than n. This is because the function 2^n is an exponential function, which grows much faster than the linear function n.\n\nTherefore, the power set of any set A with n elements will always be larger than A."
