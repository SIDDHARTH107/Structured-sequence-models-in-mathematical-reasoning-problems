    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal curve that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of the curve refers to the number of times the folding process is repeated.\n\nThe perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Length of the first segment * (2^(Order/2))\n\nIn this case, the order is 10 and the length of the first segment is 1 unit. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^5)\nPerimeter = 1 * 32\nPerimeter = 32 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve of order 10 with the first segment having a length of 1 unit is 32 units."
