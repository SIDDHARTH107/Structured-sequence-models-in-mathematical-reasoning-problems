    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either one of the sets but not in both. In this case, the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ is:\n\n$A \\triangle B = \\{1, 2, 5, 6\\}$\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of $A$ and $B$. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is:\n\n$A \\cap B = \\{3, 4\\}$\n\nNow, we need to prove that the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ is not commutative with respect to intersection. In other words, we need to show that $(A \\triangle B) \\cap A \\neq (A \\triangle B) \\cap B$.\n\nLet's find $(A \\triangle B) \\cap A$:\n\n$(A \\triangle B) \\cap A = \\{1, 2, 5, 6\\} \\cap \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} = \\{1, 2\\}$\n\nNow, let's find $(A \\triangle B) \\cap B$:\n\n$(A \\triangle B) \\cap B = \\{1, 2, 5, 6\\} \\cap \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\} = \\{5, 6\\}$\n\nSince $(A \\triangle B) \\cap A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $(A \\triangle B) \\cap B = \\{5, 6\\}$, we can see that $(A \\triangle B) \\cap A \\neq (A \\triangle B) \\cap B$. Therefore, the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ is not commutative with respect to intersection."
