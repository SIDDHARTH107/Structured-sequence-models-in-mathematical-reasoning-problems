Find the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, 1):\n\nLet the equation of the elliptic curve be y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B. We know that the point (0, 1) lies on the curve, so we can plug in the coordinates to find B:\n\n1^2 = 0^3 + A(0) + B\n1 = B\n\nNow the equation of the elliptic curve is y^2 = x^3 + Ax + 1.\n\n2. Find the derivative of the elliptic curve equation:\n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, 1), we need to find the derivative of the elliptic curve equation with respect to x:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + 1\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 + A\n\nNow, we can plug in the point (0, 1) to find the slope (dy/dx) at that point:\n\n2(1)(dy/dx) = 3(0)^2 + A\n2(dy/dx) = A\n\n3. Find the equation of the tangent line:\n\nWe know that the tangent line passes through the points (0, 1) and (2, 3). We can use the point-slope form to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - 1 = m(x - 0)\n\nwhere m is the slope of the tangent line. We can find the slope using the two points:\n\nm = (3 - 1) / (2 - 0)\nm = 2 / 2\nm = 1\n\nNow we can plug the slope back into the point-slope form:\n\ny - 1 = 1(x - 0)\ny = x + 1\n\n4. Use the tangent line equation to find the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\nNow that we have the equation of the tangent line, we can use it to find the equation of the elliptic curve. We know that the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, 1) is equal to A:\n\n2(dy/dx) = A\n2(1) = A\nA = 2\n\nNow we can plug A back into the equation of the elliptic curve:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1\n\nSo, the equation of the elliptic curve is y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1."
