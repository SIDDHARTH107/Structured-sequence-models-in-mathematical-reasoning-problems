    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of $x^5$ in the expansion of $(1+x+x^2)^3$, we can use the multinomial theorem. The multinomial theorem states that for any positive integer $n$ and any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$:\n\n$(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k)^n = \\sum_{n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k = n} \\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k} a_1^{n_1} a_2^{n_2} \\cdots a_k^{n_k}$,\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all nonnegative integer solutions $(n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k)$ to the equation $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k = n$, and $\\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\cdots n_k!}$ is the multinomial coefficient.\n\nIn our case, we have $n = 3$, $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = x$, and $a_3 = x^2$. We want to find the coefficient of $x^5$ in the expansion, so we need to find the sum of all multinomial coefficients for which $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k = n$ and $a_1^{n_1} a_2^{n_2} \\cdots a_k^{n_k} = x^5$. We can rewrite this as:\n\n$1^{n_1} x^{n_2} (x^2)^{n_3} = x^5$.\n\nWe need to find all nonnegative integer solutions $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ to the equation $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 3$ for which $n_2 + 2n_3 = 5$. There are two such solutions:\n\n1. $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (0, 1, 2)$, which corresponds to the term $\\binom{3}{0, 1, 2} 1^0 x^1 (x^2)^2 = \\frac{3!}{0!1!2!} x^5 = 3x^5$.\n2. $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (1, 3, 0)$, which corresponds to the term $\\binom{3}{1, 3, 0} 1^1 x^3 (x^2)^0 = \\frac{3!}{1!3!0!} x^5 = 1x^5$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^5$ in the expansion of $(1+x+x^2)^3$ is $3 + 1 = \\boxed{4}$."
