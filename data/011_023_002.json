The list of incompatible tasks is as follows:\n\nTask 1 cannot be done with Task 4.\nTask 2 cannot be done with Task 3 or Task 4.\nTask 3 cannot be done with Task 2.\nTask 5 cannot be done with Task 6.\nTask 7 cannot be done with Task 8.\n\nHow many different ways can the company assign the tasks to the workers such that no worker is assigned to incompatible tasks?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. Task 1 cannot be done with Task 4.\n2. Task 2 cannot be done with Task 3 or Task 4.\n3. Task 3 cannot be done with Task 2.\n4. Task 5 cannot be done with Task 6.\n5. Task 7 cannot be done with Task 8.\n\nWe can divide the tasks into groups based on their incompatibilities:\n\nGroup A: Task 1, Task 4\nGroup B: Task 2, Task 3\nGroup C: Task 5, Task 6\nGroup D: Task 7, Task 8\n\nNow, let's consider the different ways to assign the tasks to the workers:\n\n1. One worker takes one task from each group (A, B, C, D). There are 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16 ways to do this. The remaining worker can take any of the remaining 4 tasks, so there are 16 * 4 = 64 ways in this case.\n\n2. One worker takes two tasks from one group, and the other three workers take one task from the remaining three groups. There are 4 groups to choose from, and for each group, there are 2 ways to choose the two tasks. Then, for the remaining three groups, there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 ways to assign the tasks. So, there are 4 * 2 * 8 = 64 ways in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 64 + 64 = 128 different ways to assign the tasks to the workers such that no worker is assigned to incompatible tasks."
