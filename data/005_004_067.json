They weigh a sample of 10 products from each type and record the weights in grams. Using ANOVA, determine if there is a significant difference in the average weight between the three types of products. \n\nHere are the weights for each product type: \n\nType 1: 56, 60, 58, 55, 57, 59, 61, 62, 58, 60 \n\nType 2: 53, 54, 51, 55, 50, 54, 52, 55, 52, 57 \n\nType 3: 59, 61, 64, 62, 63, 61, 60, 62, 64, 63",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the average weight between the three types of products, we will perform a one-way ANOVA test. First, we need to calculate the means and variances for each product type.\n\nType 1: \nMean (M1) = (56+60+58+55+57+59+61+62+58+60)/10 = 586/10 = 58.6\nVariance (V1) = [(56-58.6)^2 + (60-58.6)^2 + ... + (60-58.6)^2]/(10-1) = 54.4/9 = 6.044\n\nType 2:\nMean (M2) = (53+54+51+55+50+54+52+55+52+57)/10 = 533/10 = 53.3\nVariance (V2) = [(53-53.3)^2 + (54-53.3)^2 + ... + (57-53.3)^2]/(10-1) = 36.9/9 = 4.1\n\nType 3:\nMean (M3) = (59+61+64+62+63+61+60+62+64+63)/10 = 619/10 = 61.9\nVariance (V3) = [(59-61.9)^2 + (61-61.9)^2 + ... + (63-61.9)^2]/(10-1) = 44.9/9 = 4.989\n\nNow, we need to calculate the overall mean (M) and the between-group variance (MSG) and within-group variance (MSE).\n\nM = (58.6 + 53.3 + 61.9)/3 = 173.8/3 = 57.933\n\nMSG = [(58.6-57.933)^2 + (53.3-57.933)^2 + (61.9-57.933)^2]/(3-1) = 139.573/2 = 69.787\n\nMSE = (6.044 + 4.1 + 4.989)/(3-1) = 15.133/2 = 7.567\n\nNow, we calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSG/MSE = 69.787/7.567 = 9.222\n\nNext, we need to find the critical F-value for a 95% confidence level (Î± = 0.05) with degrees of freedom for between-group (df1 = 3-1 = 2) and within-group (df2 = 30-3 = 27). Using an F-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical F-value to be approximately 3.354.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (9.222) is greater than the critical F-value (3.354), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the average weight between the three types of products. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the average weight between the three types of products."
