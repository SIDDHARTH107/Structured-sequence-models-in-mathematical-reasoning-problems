    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that expands with each iteration. The perimeter of the Gosper curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (length of starting curve) * (multiplier)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and the multiplier for the Gosper curve is approximately 2.10457.\n\nFor the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve with a starting curve length of 1 unit, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2.10457)^4\nPerimeter ≈ 1 * 19.49521\nPerimeter ≈ 19.49521 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve with a starting curve length of 1 unit is approximately 19.49521 units."
