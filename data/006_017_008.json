    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (car accidents) in n trials (hours)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (car accident) in a single trial (hour)\n- n is the number of trials (hours)\n- k is the number of successes (car accidents)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 2 car accidents, which means we need to find the probability of 2, 3, 4, or 5 car accidents and then sum those probabilities. However, it's easier to find the probability of 0 or 1 car accidents and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probabilities for 0 and 1 car accidents:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(5, 0) * 0.2^0 * (1-0.2)^(5-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.8^5 ≈ 0.32768\n\nP(X = 1) = C(5, 1) * 0.2^1 * (1-0.2)^(5-1) = 5 * 0.2 * 0.8^4 ≈ 0.4096\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of at least 2 car accidents by subtracting the probabilities of 0 and 1 car accidents from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) ≈ 1 - 0.32768 - 0.4096 ≈ 0.26272\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 car accidents will occur during the 5 hours is approximately 26.27%."
