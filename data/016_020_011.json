    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral tetrahedron into four smaller congruent tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of equilateral triangles increases.\n\nLet's analyze the number of equilateral triangles at each iteration:\n\n1. 0th iteration: The original tetrahedron has 4 equilateral triangles (base case).\n2. 1st iteration: Each of the 4 original triangles is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n3. 2nd iteration: Each of the 16 triangles from the 1st iteration is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 16 * 4 = 64 triangles.\n4. 3rd iteration: Each of the 64 triangles from the 2nd iteration is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 64 * 4 = 256 triangles.\n\nSo, a Sierpinski tetrahedron up to the 3rd iteration requires 256 equilateral triangles."
