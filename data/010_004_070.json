    "message_1": "Here's a potential question for a math student on compactness:\n\nLet X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} be a set equipped with the discrete topology (where all subsets are open). Define a subset A âŠ† X to be \"almost compact\" if A is not compact but every proper subset of A is compact. \n\nFind all subsets of X that are almost compact.",
    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, a set is compact if and only if it is finite. Since X is a finite set, it is compact. Now, we need to find all subsets A of X that are almost compact, i.e., A is not compact but every proper subset of A is compact.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction. Since every subset of X is finite in the discrete topology, every subset of X is compact. Therefore, there cannot be any subset A of X that is not compact. Consequently, there are no almost compact subsets of X in the discrete topology."
