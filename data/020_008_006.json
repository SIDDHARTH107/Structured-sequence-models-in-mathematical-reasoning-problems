The transportation costs per unit of product between the warehouse and the cities are as follows:\n\n- City A: $4/unit\n- City B: $5/unit\n- City C: $7/unit\n- City D: $6/unit\n\nThe warehouse has 1000 units of the product available for distribution. Each city has a demand of 300 units. Determine the optimal distribution plan that minimizes the transportation costs while meeting the demand of each city.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the transportation costs, we should send the products to the cities with the lowest transportation costs first. In this case, the order of priority should be City A, City B, City D, and City C.\n\nSince each city has a demand of 300 units, and there are 1000 units available in the warehouse, we can distribute the products as follows:\n\n1. Send 300 units to City A: 300 units * $4/unit = $1200\n2. Send 300 units to City B: 300 units * $5/unit = $1500\n3. Send 300 units to City D: 300 units * $6/unit = $1800\n\nAt this point, we have distributed 900 units and have 100 units left in the warehouse. The remaining 100 units should be sent to City C, which has the highest transportation cost but still has a demand of 200 units.\n\n4. Send 100 units to City C: 100 units * $7/unit = $700\n\nThe total transportation cost for this distribution plan is:\n\n$1200 (City A) + $1500 (City B) + $1800 (City D) + $700 (City C) = $5200\n\nThis is the optimal distribution plan that minimizes the transportation costs while meeting the demand of each city. Note that City C's demand is not fully met in this plan, but this is the best we can do given the limited supply of 1000 units."
