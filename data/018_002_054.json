A subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if C is a subset of D, then every element in C is also an element in D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of A.\n3 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A, so A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of B.\n3 ∈ B and 4 ∈ B, so A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the intersection of A and B, A ∩ B = {3, 4}, is a subset of both A and B."
