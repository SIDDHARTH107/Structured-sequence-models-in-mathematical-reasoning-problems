    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem on the Principal-Agent Problem in Game Theory:\n \nA company hires an agent to sell its products. The agent has two effort levels: high effort, which results in a sale with probability 0.8, and low effort, which results in a sale with probability 0.4. If the agent exerts high effort, the company would benefit by $12,000. If the agent exerts low effort, the company would only benefit by $5,000. However, the agent prefers to exert low effort, as it is less costly for him. It costs the agent $4,000 to exert high effort and $2,500 to exert low effort.\n\na) What should be the agent’s optimal effort level if he is risk neutral?\nb) What is the expected payoff for the agent in each case? \nc) What is the expected payoff for the company in each case?",
    "message_2": "a) To determine the agent's optimal effort level, we need to compare the expected payoffs for both high and low effort levels. Let's denote the agent's share of the benefit as x.\n\nExpected payoff for high effort = 0.8 * (12,000 * x - 4,000)\nExpected payoff for low effort = 0.4 * (5,000 * x - 2,500)\n\nSince the agent is risk-neutral, he will choose the effort level that maximizes his expected payoff.\n\nb) To find the expected payoff for the agent in each case, we need to determine the value of x that makes the agent indifferent between high and low effort levels. We can do this by setting the expected payoffs equal to each other:\n\n0.8 * (12,000 * x - 4,000) = 0.4 * (5,000 * x - 2,500)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n9,600x - 3,200 = 2,000x - 1,000\n7,600x = 2,200\nx ≈ 0.289\n\nSo, the agent's share of the benefit should be approximately 28.9%.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected payoffs for the agent in each case:\n\nExpected payoff for high effort = 0.8 * (12,000 * 0.289 - 4,000) ≈ $1,388.80\nExpected payoff for low effort = 0.4 * (5,000 * 0.289 - 2,500) ≈ $1,388.80\n\nc) To find the expected payoff for the company in each case, we need to calculate the company's share of the benefit (1 - x) and multiply it by the probability of a sale:\n\nExpected payoff for high effort (company) = 0.8 * (12,000 * (1 - 0.289)) ≈ $6,835.20\nExpected payoff for low effort (company) = 0.4 * (5,000 * (1 - 0.289)) ≈ $2,555.00"
