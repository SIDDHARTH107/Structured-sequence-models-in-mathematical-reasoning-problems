    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence {fn} converges pointwise on X, we need to check if there exists a function f: X → Y such that for every x in X and for every ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, ρ(fn(x), f(x)) < ε.\n\nLet's consider the function f(x) = 0 for all x in X. We will show that the sequence {fn} converges pointwise to this function.\n\nFix x in X and ε > 0. We want to find N such that for all n ≥ N, ρ(fn(x), f(x)) < ε. Since fn(x) = x/n and f(x) = 0, we have:\n\nρ(fn(x), f(x)) = ρ(x/n, 0).\n\nNow, since (Y,ρ) is a metric space, there exists a function d': Y × Y → ℝ such that d'(y1, y2) = ρ(y1, y2) for all y1, y2 in Y. Therefore, we can rewrite the above expression as:\n\nd'(x/n, 0) < ε.\n\nSince x is a fixed element in X and n is a variable, we can treat x/n as a sequence of elements in Y. As n goes to infinity, the sequence x/n converges to 0 in Y. Thus, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, d'(x/n, 0) < ε.\n\nHence, the sequence {fn} converges pointwise to the function f: X → Y, where f(x) = 0 for all x in X."
