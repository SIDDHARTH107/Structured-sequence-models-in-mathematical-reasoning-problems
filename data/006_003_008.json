    "message_2": "There is only one King of Hearts in a standard 52-card deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing the King of Hearts is 1 (the number of King of Hearts) divided by 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = 1/52 â‰ˆ 0.01923 or 1.923%\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a King of Hearts from a standard 52-card deck is approximately 1.923%."
