    "message_1": "Consider two curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ given by the equations $C_1: y = x^2 - 3x + 2$ and $C_2: y = x^2 + 2x + 1$. What is the intersection number $C_1 \\cdot C_2$?",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$, we need to solve the system of equations given by:\n\n$$y = x^2 - 3x + 2$$\n$$y = x^2 + 2x + 1$$\n\nSince both equations are equal to $y$, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n$$x^2 - 3x + 2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$$-3x + 2 = 2x + 1$$\n$$5x = 1$$\n$$x = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nNow that we have the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point, we can plug it back into either equation to find the $y$-coordinate. We'll use the first equation:\n\n$$y = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + 2$$\n$$y = \\frac{1}{25} - \\frac{3}{5} + 2$$\n$$y = \\frac{1}{25} - \\frac{15}{25} + \\frac{50}{25}$$\n$$y = \\frac{36}{25}$$\n\nSo the intersection point is $\\left(\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{36}{25}\\right)$. Since there is only one intersection point, the intersection number $C_1 \\cdot C_2 = 1$."
