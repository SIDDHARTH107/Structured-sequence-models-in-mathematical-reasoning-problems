    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, the curve $C$ is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = 2$. The divisor we are interested in is $D = nP$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $P$ is any point on $C$. The degree of this divisor is $\\deg(nP) = n$. The canonical divisor $K_C$ has degree $2g - 2 = 2$.\n\nNow, we apply the Riemann-Roch theorem to the divisor $D = nP$:\n\n$l(nP) - l(K_C - nP) = n + 1 - g$.\n\nSince $g = 2$, we have:\n\n$l(nP) - l(K_C - nP) = n - 1$.\n\nWe want to find $l(nP) = \\dim H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(nP))$. To do this, we need to analyze the term $l(K_C - nP)$.\n\nIf $n \\geq 3$, then the degree of the divisor $K_C - nP$ is negative, i.e., $\\deg(K_C - nP) = 2 - n < 0$. In this case, we have $l(K_C - nP) = 0$ by definition, since there are no non-zero holomorphic functions with negative degree divisor.\n\nTherefore, for $n \\geq 3$, we have:\n\n$l(nP) = n - 1$.\n\nFor $n = 1$ and $n = 2$, we can directly compute the dimensions of the corresponding vector spaces. For $n = 1$, we have $D = P$, and it is well-known that $l(P) = 1$ for any point $P$ on a curve. For $n = 2$, we have $D = 2P$, and since $C$ is a hyperelliptic curve, we know that $l(2P) = 2$.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that for any positive integer $n$, the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(nP))$ is equal to $n+1$."
