    "message_2": "A closed oriented surface with genus g has an Euler characteristic χ given by the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nIn this case, we are given that the Euler characteristic χ is -5 and the genus g is 3. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n-5 = 2 - 2(3)\n\nNow, let's consider a Morse function on the surface. A Morse function has critical points of three types: minima, saddles, and maxima. Let's denote the number of minima as m, the number of saddles as s, and the number of maxima as M. According to the Morse inequalities, the Euler characteristic χ can also be expressed as:\n\nχ = m - s + M\n\nWe already know that χ = -5, so we have:\n\n-5 = m - s + M\n\nOur goal is to find the total number of critical points, which is given by the sum of minima, saddles, and maxima:\n\nTotal critical points = m + s + M\n\nTo find this sum, we can rearrange the equation involving the Euler characteristic:\n\nm - s + M = -5\nm + M = s - 5\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for s into the equation for the total number of critical points:\n\nTotal critical points = m + (m + M - 5) + M\nTotal critical points = 2m + 2M - 5\n\nSince the surface is closed and oriented, it must have at least one minimum and one maximum. Therefore, m ≥ 1 and M ≥ 1. Additionally, the surface has genus 3, which implies that it has at least 6 saddle points (as each handle contributes two saddle points). Thus, s ≥ 6.\n\nUsing these facts, we can rewrite the inequality involving the total number of critical points as:\n\nTotal critical points = 2m + 2M - 5 ≥ 2(1) + 2(1) - 5\nTotal critical points ≥ -1\n\nHowever, this inequality does not make sense, as the total number of critical points must be a positive integer. This indicates that our initial assumption about the minimum number of saddles was incorrect. Since each handle contributes two saddle points, and we have 3 handles, we must have at least 6 saddles. Therefore, s ≥ 6.\n\nNow, let's reconsider the equation involving the Euler characteristic:\n\n-5 = m - s + M\nm + M = s - 5\n\nSince s ≥ 6, we have:\n\nm + M ≥ 6 - 5\nm + M ≥ 1\n\nThis inequality makes more sense, as it indicates that there must be at least one minimum and one maximum. Now, let's substitute this expression for s back into the equation for the total number of critical points:\n\nTotal critical points = m + s + M\nTotal critical points = m + (m + M - 5) + M\nTotal critical points = 2m + 2M - 5\n\nSince m + M ≥ 1, we have:\n\nTotal critical points = 2m + 2M - 5 ≥ 2(1) + 2(1) - 5\nTotal critical points ≥ -1\n\nHowever, we know that the total number of critical points must be a positive integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value for the total number of critical points is 1. This implies that there must be at least one minimum, one maximum, and six saddles on the surface.\n\nThus, the total number of critical points of a Morse function on the surface is:\n\nTotal critical points = m + s + M = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8"
