    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing exactly k successes (in this case, k malfunctions) in n trials (in this case, n machines)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of observing a malfunction, which is 0.3)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of machines, which is 10)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of malfunctions we want to observe, which is 3)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * 0.3^3 * (1-0.3)^(10-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(10, 3):\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 120 * 0.3^3 * 0.7^7\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n0.3^3 = 0.027\n0.7^7 = 0.0823543\n\nNow, multiplying everything together:\n\nP(X = 3) = 120 * 0.027 * 0.0823543 â‰ˆ 0.2668\n\nSo, the probability that the safety inspector will observe a malfunction in exactly 3 machines is approximately 0.2668, or 26.68%."
