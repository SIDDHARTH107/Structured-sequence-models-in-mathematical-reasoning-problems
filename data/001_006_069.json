    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 3x + 1, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = -3, and c = 1.\n\nx = -(-3) / (2 * 2)\nx = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(3/4)^2 - 3(3/4) + 1\ny = 2(9/16) - 9/4 + 1\ny = 9/8 - 9/4 + 1\ny = 9/8 - 18/8 + 8/8\ny = -1/8\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point (3/4, -1/8).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the x-coordinate of the vertex. In this case, the axis of symmetry is:\n\nx = 3/4\n\nSince the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is positive (2), the parabola opens upwards, which means the vertex is a minimum value of the function."
