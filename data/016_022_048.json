    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure that is formed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedra from a larger one. The number of visible triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVisible faces = 4 * (3^(n-1))\n\nwhere n is the number of layers.\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid with 6 layers:\n\nVisible faces = 4 * (3^(6-1))\nVisible faces = 4 * (3^5)\nVisible faces = 4 * 243\nVisible faces = 972\n\nSo, there are 972 visible triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of 6 layers."
