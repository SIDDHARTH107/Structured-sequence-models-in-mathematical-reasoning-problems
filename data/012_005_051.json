    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex directly by an edge. Therefore, the shortest path between any two vertices in a complete graph is always 1.\n\nSo, the diameter of a complete graph K8 is 1."
