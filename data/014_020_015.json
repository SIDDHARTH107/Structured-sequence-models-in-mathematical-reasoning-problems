    "message_1": "Suppose that you intercepted a Vigenere encrypted message with the following ciphertext: \"XQGJL\". You know that the key used was a 3-letter English word. Using cryptanalysis techniques, determine the key and decrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Vigenere cipher, we will use the Kasiski examination and frequency analysis. First, let's group the ciphertext by the length of the key, which is 3:\n\nX Q G\nJ L\n\nNow, we will perform frequency analysis on each group. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. We will compare the frequency of the letters in the ciphertext to the frequency of these common letters.\n\nGroup 1: X, J\nGroup 2: Q\nGroup 3: G, L\n\nSince we have very few letters in each group, we will have to make some educated guesses. Let's assume that the most frequent letter in each group corresponds to the most frequent letter in English, which is 'E'. We will now find the key by shifting the letters in the ciphertext to match 'E'.\n\nGroup 1: X -> E (shift by 5 positions), J -> E (shift by 9 positions)\nGroup 2: Q -> E (shift by 12 positions)\nGroup 3: G -> E (shift by 2 positions), L -> E (shift by 7 positions)\n\nNow we have several possible keys:\n1. Key: FMC (shifts: 5, 12, 2)\n2. Key: JMC (shifts: 9, 12, 2)\n3. Key: FMC (shifts: 5, 12, 7)\n4. Key: JMC (shifts: 9, 12, 7)\n\nWe will now decrypt the ciphertext using each of these keys:\n\n1. FMC: XQGJL -> THEFT\n2. JMC: XQGJL -> BOMBI\n3. FMC: XQGJL -> THETA\n4. JMC: XQGJL -> BOMBA\n\nConsidering that the key is a 3-letter English word, we can eliminate options 2 and 4. Now we have two possible decrypted messages: \"THEFT\" and \"THETA\". Both are valid English words, but \"THEFT\" seems more likely to be a message. Therefore, the key is likely \"FMC\" and the decrypted message is \"THEFT\"."
