    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn our case, p = 7 (which is a prime number) and a = 17. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, 17^7 ≡ 17 (mod 7). \n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 17^8 is divided by 7. We can rewrite 17^8 as (17^7) * 17. \n\nSince 17^7 ≡ 17 (mod 7), we can substitute this into our expression:\n\n17^8 ≡ (17^7) * 17 ≡ 17 * 17 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we just need to find the remainder when 17 * 17 is divided by 7:\n\n17 * 17 = 289\n\n289 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 41 and a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the remainder when 17^8 is divided by 7 is 2."
