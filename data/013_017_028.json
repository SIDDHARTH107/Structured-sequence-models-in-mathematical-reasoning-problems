    "message_1": "Suppose a seller is trying to sell a used car. The seller knows the car's true value, which is $10,000, but the buyer does not. Instead, the buyer believes there is a 50% chance the car is worth $8,000 and a 50% chance it is worth $12,000. If the seller prices the car at $9,000, what is the expected profit for the seller?",
    "message_2": "The expected profit for the seller can be calculated by finding the difference between the selling price and the true value of the car, and then multiplying that by the probability of each scenario.\n\nIn this case, the seller prices the car at $9,000, and the true value is $10,000. The buyer believes there is a 50% chance the car is worth $8,000 and a 50% chance it is worth $12,000. \n\nSince the car is actually worth $10,000, the seller will make a profit of $1,000 if the buyer believes the car is worth $8,000 and a profit of $1,000 if the buyer believes the car is worth $12,000. \n\nTo find the expected profit, we multiply the profit by the probability of each scenario:\n\nExpected profit = (profit if buyer believes car is worth $8,000 * probability) + (profit if buyer believes car is worth $12,000 * probability)\n\nExpected profit = ($1,000 * 0.5) + ($1,000 * 0.5)\n\nExpected profit = $500 + $500\n\nExpected profit = $1,000\n\nSo, the expected profit for the seller if they price the car at $9,000 is $1,000."
