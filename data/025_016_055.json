    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to C at P, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z. Then, we will evaluate these partial derivatives at the point P = [1, i, 0].\n\nThe given equation is:\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point P = [1, i, 0]:\n∂F/∂x(P) = 3(1)^2 = 3\n∂F/∂y(P) = 3(i)^2 = 3(-1) = -3\n∂F/∂z(P) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n\nThe tangent line to the curve C at the point P can be represented as a linear combination of these partial derivatives:\nL(x, y, z) = 3(x - 1) - 3(y - i) + 0(z - 0)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nL(x, y, z) = 3x - 3y - 3i(y - i)\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent line to the curve C at the point P = [1, i, 0] in the complex projective plane."
