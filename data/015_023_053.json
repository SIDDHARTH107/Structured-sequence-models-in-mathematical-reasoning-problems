Find the value of $k$ such that the map exhibits chaotic behavior for the initial condition $(x_0, y_0) = (0.2, 0.5)$.",
    "message_2": "The Chirikov-Taylor map exhibits chaotic behavior when the standard map's parameter $k$ is above a certain critical value, which is approximately $k_c \\approx 0.9716$. This critical value is derived from the Chirikov standard map, which is a simplified version of the Chirikov-Taylor map.\n\nThe Chirikov standard map is given by the equations:\n$x_{n+1} = x_n + y_n \\mod 1$\n$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{k}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi x_n) \\mod 1$\n\nThe Chirikov-Taylor map is a generalization of the Chirikov standard map, and it is expected to exhibit chaotic behavior for similar values of $k$. Therefore, for the Chirikov-Taylor map to exhibit chaotic behavior for the initial condition $(x_0, y_0) = (0.2, 0.5)$, we can use the critical value $k_c \\approx 0.9716$."
