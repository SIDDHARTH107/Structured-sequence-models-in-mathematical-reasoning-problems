    "message_1": "A hot air balloon is rising vertically above the ground. At a height of 80 meters, the angle of elevation to the balloon from a person standing on the ground is decreasing at a rate of 0.1 radians per minute. How fast is the balloon rising when the angle of elevation is pi/4 radians? (Hint: Use the tangent function to represent the relationship between the height of the balloon and the angle of elevation.)",
    "message_2": "Let h be the height of the balloon above the ground, and let θ be the angle of elevation from the person to the balloon. We are given that dh/dt = ? and dθ/dt = -0.1 radians per minute when h = 80 meters and θ = π/4 radians.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to represent the relationship between the height of the balloon and the angle of elevation:\n\ntan(θ) = h/x\n\nwhere x is the horizontal distance between the person and the point on the ground directly below the balloon.\n\nWe are interested in finding dh/dt, so we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd/dt(tan(θ)) = d/dt(h/x)\n\n(sec^2(θ)) * dθ/dt = (x * dh/dt - h * dx/dt) / x^2\n\nNow, we need to find x when θ = π/4 and h = 80 meters. Since tan(π/4) = 1, we have:\n\n1 = 80/x\n\nx = 80 meters\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for dh/dt:\n\n(sec^2(π/4)) * (-0.1) = (80 * dh/dt - 80 * 0) / 80^2\n\n(2) * (-0.1) = (80 * dh/dt) / 6400\n\n-0.2 = 80 * dh/dt / 6400\n\ndh/dt = -0.2 * 6400 / 80\n\ndh/dt = -16 meters per minute\n\nSo, the balloon is rising at a rate of 16 meters per minute when the angle of elevation is π/4 radians."
