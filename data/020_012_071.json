    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 10 over the interval [0, 3], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at those points and the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x - 7\n\nNow, we find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to 0:\n\n12x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x - 7 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solutions. Using a numerical solver, we find that there are two critical points in the interval [0, 3]:\n\nx ≈ 0.535 and x ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we evaluate the function f(x) at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^4 - 4(0)^3 + 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 10 = 10\nf(0.535) ≈ 3(0.535)^4 - 4(0.535)^3 + 2(0.535)^2 - 7(0.535) + 10 ≈ 9.018\nf(1.732) ≈ 3(1.732)^4 - 4(1.732)^3 + 2(1.732)^2 - 7(1.732) + 10 ≈ 12.982\nf(3) = 3(3)^4 - 4(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 - 7(3) + 10 = 98\n\nThe global minimum value of the function over the interval [0, 3] is approximately 9.018, which occurs at x ≈ 0.535."
