    "message_2": "To split the group of 8 friends into two groups of 4, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (8) and k is the number of friends in each group (4).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n= (8 × 7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 70\n\nSo, there are 70 different ways to split the group of 8 friends into two groups of 4.\n\nNow, let's use Polya's enumeration theorem to find the number of distinct ways under rotation and reflection. We will consider the group of friends as vertices of an octagon, and we will count the number of distinct colorings of the vertices, where each vertex can be colored in 2 ways (representing the two groups).\n\nThe symmetry group of an octagon has 8 rotations (including the identity) and 8 reflections. We will compute the cycle index polynomial for each of these symmetries and average them.\n\n1. Identity (1 rotation): 8 cycles of length 1\nCycle index: (a_1)^8\n\n2. 45-degree rotation (1 rotation): 1 cycle of length 8\nCycle index: a_8\n\n3. 90-degree rotation (2 rotations): 2 cycles of length 4\nCycle index: (a_4)^2\n\n4. 135-degree rotation (1 rotation): 1 cycle of length 8\nCycle index: a_8\n\n5. 180-degree rotation (2 rotations): 4 cycles of length 2\nCycle index: (a_2)^4\n\n6. Reflections (8 reflections): 2 cycles of length 4\nCycle index: (a_4)^2\n\nNow, we average the cycle indices:\n\nZ = (1/16)[(a_1)^8 + a_8 + 2(a_4)^2 + a_8 + 2(a_2)^4 + 8(a_4)^2]\n\nZ = (1/16)[(a_1)^8 + 2a_8 + 10(a_4)^2 + 2(a_2)^4]\n\nNow, we substitute a_i = 2^i for i = 1, 2, 4, 8:\n\nZ = (1/16)[(2^1)^8 + 2(2^8) + 10(2^4)^2 + 2(2^2)^4]\n= (1/16)[256 + 512 + 10(256) + 2(16)]\n= (1/16)[256 + 512 + 2560 + 32]\n= (1/16)[3360]\n\nSo, there are 210 distinct ways to split the group of 8 friends into two groups of 4 under rotation and reflection."
