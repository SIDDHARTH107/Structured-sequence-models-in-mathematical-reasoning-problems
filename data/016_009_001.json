    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The total length of the Dragon Curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (2^(Number of iterations))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve after 5 iterations is 32 units."
