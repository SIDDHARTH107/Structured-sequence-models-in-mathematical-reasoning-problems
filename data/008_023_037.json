    "message_1": "Suppose you have the following system of linear equations: \n\n$x + 2y - 3z = 4$ \n\n$2x - y + z = -1$ \n\n$3x + 4y - 2z = 7$ \n\nHowever, due to measurement errors, the values in the system are not exact but have a small amount of noise. For example, the first equation could be $1.9x + 2.1y - 2.8z = 4.2$ instead of $x + 2y - 3z = 4$. \n\nUsing the method of least squares, find the best estimates for the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that solve the noisy system of equations.",
    "message_2": "To use the method of least squares, we first need to rewrite the system of equations in matrix form. Let A be the matrix of coefficients, X be the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B be the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 1  2 -3 |\n    | 2 -1  1 |\n    | 3  4 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  4  |\n    | -1  |\n    |  7  |\n\nNow, we have the equation AX = B. Since the system is noisy, we want to find the best estimate for X, which we'll call X_hat, that minimizes the residual vector R = B - AX_hat. The method of least squares minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, which is R^T * R.\n\nTo find X_hat, we'll use the normal equation: A^T * A * X_hat = A^T * B. First, let's compute A^T * A and A^T * B:\n\nA^T * A = | 1  2  3 |   | 1  2 -3 |   | 14   8  -8 |\n          | 2 -1  4 | * | 2 -1  1 | = |  8  21 -10 |\n          |-3  1 -2 |   | 3  4 -2 |   |-8 -10  14 |\n\nA^T * B = | 1  2  3 |   |  4  |\n          | 2 -1  4 | * | -1  |\n          |-3  1 -2 |   |  7  |\n\n          = |  19 |\n            | -12 |\n            |  13 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the linear system (A^T * A) * X_hat = A^T * B:\n\n| 14   8  -8 |   | x |   |  19 |\n|  8  21 -10 | * | y | = | -12 |\n| -8 -10  14 |   | z |   |  13 |\n\nWe can solve this system using any method, such as Gaussian elimination, Cramer's rule, or matrix inversion. For simplicity, we'll use a calculator or software to solve this system:\n\nX_hat = | x | = |  1.0 |\n        | y |   | -0.5 |\n        | z |   |  0.0 |\n\nSo, the best estimates for the values of x, y, and z that solve the noisy system of equations are x = 1.0, y = -0.5, and z = 0.0."
