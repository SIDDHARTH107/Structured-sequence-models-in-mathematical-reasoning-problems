    "message_2": "To find a meromorphic function $f(z)$ that satisfies the given conditions, we can start by constructing a function with the desired singularities. Since $f(z)$ has simple poles at $z=2$ and $z=-1$, we can write the function in the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{A}{z-2} + \\frac{B}{z+1} + g(z)$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants and $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function in the entire complex plane. We are given the residues at the poles, so we have:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 2) = 3 \\Rightarrow A = 3$$\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), -1) = -1 \\Rightarrow B = -1$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{3}{z-2} - \\frac{1}{z+1} + g(z)$$\n\nNow, we need to ensure that $f(z)$ has a removable singularity at $z=0$. This means that $f(z)$ must be bounded near $z=0$. To achieve this, we can set $g(z)$ to be the function that cancels out the singularities of the first two terms at $z=0$. We can write:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{C}{z}$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant. Now, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{3}{z-2} - \\frac{1}{z+1} + \\frac{C}{z}$$\n\nTo find the value of $C$, we can take the limit as $z$ approaches $0$:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\left(\\frac{3}{z-2} - \\frac{1}{z+1} + \\frac{C}{z}\\right)$$\n\nFor the limit to exist and be finite, we must have:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\left(\\frac{3}{z-2} - \\frac{1}{z+1}\\right) = -C$$\n\nWe can find this limit using L'HÃ´pital's rule:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\left(\\frac{3}{z-2} - \\frac{1}{z+1}\\right) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\left(\\frac{-3}{(z-2)^2} - \\frac{-1}{(z+1)^2}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{4} - 1 = -\\frac{7}{4}$$\n\nSo, we have $C = \\frac{7}{4}$. Therefore, the meromorphic function $f(z)$ that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{3}{z-2} - \\frac{1}{z+1} + \\frac{7/4}{z}$$"
