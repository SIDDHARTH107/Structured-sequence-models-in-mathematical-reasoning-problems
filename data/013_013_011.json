    "message_1": "Suppose there are three bidders in an auction for a painting. The valuations of the painting for each of the bidders are as follows: Bidder 1 has a valuation of $1000, Bidder 2 has a valuation of $2000, and Bidder 3 has a valuation of $3000. The auction follows a second-price rule, which means that the highest bidder wins the painting, but pays the second-highest bid. If each bidder bids truthfully, what will be the outcome of the auction? How much will the winning bidder pay for the painting?",
    "message_2": "If each bidder bids truthfully according to their valuations, the bids will be as follows: Bidder 1 bids $1000, Bidder 2 bids $2000, and Bidder 3 bids $3000. Since the auction follows a second-price rule, the highest bidder, Bidder 3, will win the painting. However, they will pay the second-highest bid, which is $2000. So, the outcome of the auction is that Bidder 3 wins the painting and pays $2000 for it."
