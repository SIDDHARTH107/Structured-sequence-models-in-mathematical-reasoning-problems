    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms producing identical products. The inverse demand function for the product is given by p = 100 - Q, where Q is the total quantity of the product produced in the market. Each firm has a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit. Using the Cournot model, what will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the corresponding equilibrium price in the market?",
    "message_2": "In the Cournot model, each firm chooses its quantity to maximize its profit, taking the other firm's quantity as given. Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. The inverse demand function is p = 100 - Q, and each firm has a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit.\n\nThe profit function for each firm is given by:\n\nπ1 = (p - MC) * q1 = (100 - Q - 10) * q1 = (90 - q1 - q2) * q1\nπ2 = (p - MC) * q2 = (100 - Q - 10) * q2 = (90 - q1 - q2) * q2\n\nTo find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm, we need to find the Nash equilibrium, which is the point where each firm is maximizing its profit given the other firm's quantity. To do this, we will find the first-order conditions for each firm's profit function and then solve the system of equations.\n\nFirst-order conditions:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = 90 - 2q1 - q2 = 0\n∂π2/∂q2 = 90 - 2q2 - q1 = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\n90 - 2q1 - q2 = 0\n90 - 2q2 - q1 = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for q2, we get:\n\nq2 = 90 - 2q1\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n90 - 2(90 - 2q1) - q1 = 0\n90 - 180 + 4q1 - q1 = 0\n-90 + 3q1 = 0\n\nNow, solving for q1:\n\n3q1 = 90\nq1 = 30\n\nNow, substituting q1 back into the equation for q2:\n\nq2 = 90 - 2(30)\nq2 = 90 - 60\nq2 = 30\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm is 30 units. To find the equilibrium price, we can substitute the equilibrium quantities back into the inverse demand function:\n\np = 100 - Q\np = 100 - (q1 + q2)\np = 100 - (30 + 30)\np = 100 - 60\np = 40\n\nThus, the equilibrium price in the market is $40. In summary, in the Cournot model, each firm will produce 30 units, and the equilibrium price will be $40."
