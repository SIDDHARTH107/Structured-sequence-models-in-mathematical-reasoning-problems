    "message_2": "To find the number of employees likely to have accidents while operating heavy machinery, we can multiply the total number of employees by the percentage of employees who have accidents.\n\nPercentage of employees with accidents = 5% = 0.05\nTotal number of employees = 400\n\nNumber of employees likely to have accidents = 0.05 * 400 = 20 employees"
