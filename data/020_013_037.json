    "message_1": "A telecommunications company wants to allocate their limited resources between two projects for maximum profit. The profit for project 1 is $10,000 and for project 2 is $12,000. However, they also have constraints on how much they can invest in each project. For project 1, they can invest a maximum of $50,000 and for project 2 they can invest a maximum of $80,000. The company also wants to achieve a specific rate of return of 10% on their investment. Formulate this problem as a semi-definite programming problem and find the optimal investment amount for each project.",
    "message_2": "Let x1 be the investment amount for project 1 and x2 be the investment amount for project 2. The company wants to maximize their profit, which can be represented as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 10000x1 + 12000x2\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Investment constraints:\n   x1 <= 50000\n   x2 <= 80000\n\n2. Rate of return constraint:\n   (10000x1 + 12000x2) / (x1 + x2) >= 0.10 * (x1 + x2)\n\nTo solve this problem, we can first simplify the rate of return constraint:\n\n10000x1 + 12000x2 >= 0.10 * (x1 + x2) * (x1 + x2)\n\n10000x1 + 12000x2 >= 0.10 * (x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the problem as a semi-definite programming problem:\n\nMaximize P = 10000x1 + 12000x2\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x1 <= 50000\n2. x2 <= 80000\n3. 10000x1 + 12000x2 - 0.10 * (x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2) >= 0\n\nTo solve this semi-definite programming problem, we can use optimization software such as CVXPY or other optimization tools. However, it is important to note that this problem can also be solved using linear programming techniques by making some assumptions or approximations. For instance, we can assume that the rate of return constraint is linear and solve the problem accordingly."
