    "message_2": "To find the order of point P on the elliptic curve E, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that nP = O (the point at infinity), where nP is the result of adding P to itself n times.\n\nWe will use the point doubling and point addition formulas for elliptic curves over finite fields. Let Fp be the finite field with p elements, where p is a prime number. In our case, p = 17.\n\nThe point doubling formula for a point P = (x1, y1) on an elliptic curve E is:\n\nx3 = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) mod p\ny3 = (2x1^3 - x3) - y1 mod p\n\nThe point addition formula for two points P1 = (x1, y1) and P2 = (x2, y2) on an elliptic curve E is:\n\nx3 = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p\ny3 = (y1(x1 - x3) - x1y2) * (x1 - x2)^(-1) mod p\n\nNow, let's find the order of point P = (5, 1) on the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over F17.\n\n1. Calculate 2P:\nx3 = (3 * 5^2 + 2) * (2 * 1)^(-1) mod 17\nx3 = (75 + 2) * 2^(-1) mod 17\nx3 = 77 * 9 mod 17\nx3 = 693 mod 17\nx3 = 8\n\ny3 = (2 * 5^3 - 8) - 1 mod 17\ny3 = (250 - 8) - 1 mod 17\ny3 = 241 mod 17\ny3 = 3\n\nSo, 2P = (8, 3).\n\n2. Calculate 3P = P + 2P:\nx3 = (3 - 1) * (8 - 5)^(-1) mod 17\nx3 = 2 * 3^(-1) mod 17\nx3 = 2 * 6 mod 17\nx3 = 12\n\ny3 = (1 * (5 - 12) - 5 * 3) * (5 - 8)^(-1) mod 17\ny3 = (-7 - 15) * (-3)^(-1) mod 17\ny3 = -22 * 12 mod 17\ny3 = -264 mod 17\ny3 = 6\n\nSo, 3P = (12, 6).\n\n3. Calculate 4P = 2P + 2P:\nx3 = (3 - 3) * (8 - 8)^(-1) mod 17\nSince the denominator is 0, we have reached the point at infinity (O).\n\nThus, the order of point P = (5, 1) on the elliptic curve E is 4."
