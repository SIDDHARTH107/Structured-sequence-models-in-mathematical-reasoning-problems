    "message_1": "A company wants to predict whether a customer will buy their product or not based on their age and income. Using discriminant analysis, they obtained the following discriminant function: \n\nD = 0.5(age) + 0.8(income) - 20 \n\nIf a customer is 25 years old and earns $45,000 per year, will they likely buy the product?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the customer will likely buy the product or not, we need to calculate the discriminant score (D) using the given discriminant function and the customer's age and income.\n\nD = 0.5(age) + 0.8(income) - 20\n\nThe customer's age is 25 years old, and their income is $45,000 per year. Plug these values into the discriminant function:\n\nD = 0.5(25) + 0.8(45,000) - 20\n\nD = 12.5 + 36,000 - 20\n\nD = 36,012.5 - 20\n\nD = 35,992.5\n\nSince the discriminant score (D) is positive, it indicates that the customer will likely buy the product."
