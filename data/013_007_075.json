    "message_1": "A fishing village has a common lake where every fisherman can catch fish for free. The lake can only support a maximum of 100 fish. Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 5 fish per day. There are 10 fishermen in the village. If each fisherman catches 5 fish every day, how many days will it take for the fish to be depleted entirely?",
    "message_2": "If each of the 10 fishermen catches 5 fish per day, they will catch a total of 10 * 5 = 50 fish per day. The lake has 100 fish, so it will take 100 / 50 = 2 days for the fish to be depleted entirely."
