    "message_2": "To find the average value of the function over one period, we can simply take the average of the maximum and minimum values.\n\nAverage value = (Maximum value + Minimum value) / 2\n\nAverage value = (4 + (-2)) / 2\n\nAverage value = (4 - 2) / 2\n\nAverage value = 2 / 2\n\nAverage value = 1\n\nThe average value of the function over one period is 1."
