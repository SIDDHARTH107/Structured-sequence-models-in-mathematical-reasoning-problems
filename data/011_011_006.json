    "message_1": "In how many distinct ways can 10 identical apples be distributed among three different baskets, such that each basket contains at least one apple?",
    "message_2": "Since each basket must contain at least one apple, we can start by placing one apple in each basket. Now we have 7 apples left to distribute among the three baskets. \n\nWe can use the \"stars and bars\" method to solve this problem. We have 7 \"stars\" (apples) and 2 \"bars\" to separate the apples into three groups (baskets). We need to find the number of ways to arrange these stars and bars.\n\nThere are a total of 9 positions (7 stars + 2 bars), and we need to choose 2 of these positions for the bars. This can be done in C(9,2) ways, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(9,2) = 9! / (2! * (9-2)!) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36\n\nSo there are 36 distinct ways to distribute the 10 identical apples among the three different baskets, such that each basket contains at least one apple."
