    "message_2": "To find the sum of the first 10 terms in the Mandelbrot set sequence, we will calculate each term and then add them together. The first term is given as 0.25. The subsequent terms are obtained by squaring the previous term and adding the complex number -0.124 + 0.755i.\n\nTerm 1: 0.25\nTerm 2: (0.25)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = 0.0625 - 0.124 + 0.755i\nTerm 3: (0.0625 - 0.124 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i)\nTerm 4: ...\n...\nTerm 10: ...\n\nTo calculate the terms, we will use the formula for squaring a complex number (a + bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + 2ab*i.\n\nTerm 3: (0.0625 - 0.124 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = (-0.0615 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i)\n= (-0.0615^2 - 0.755^2) + 2*(-0.0615)*0.755i + (-0.124 + 0.755i)\n= (-0.00377625 - 0.570025) + (-0.092725i) + (-0.124 + 0.755i)\n= (-0.57380125) + 0.662275i\n\nContinuing this process for the remaining terms, we get:\n\nTerm 4: (-0.57380125 + 0.662275i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = 0.235543 + 0.758924i\nTerm 5: (0.235543 + 0.758924i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = -0.335622 + 0.759329i\nTerm 6: (-0.335622 + 0.759329i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = 0.017705 + 0.755i\nTerm 7: (0.017705 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = -0.123 + 0.755i\nTerm 8: (-0.123 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = -0.124 + 0.755i\nTerm 9: (-0.124 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = -0.124 + 0.755i\nTerm 10: (-0.124 + 0.755i)^2 + (-0.124 + 0.755i) = -0.124 + 0.755i\n\nNow, we can add all the terms together:\n\nSum = 0.25 + (0.0625 - 0.124 + 0.755i) + (-0.57380125 + 0.662275i) + (0.235543 + 0.758924i) + (-0.335622 + 0.759329i) + (0.017705 + 0.755i) + (-0.123 + 0.755i) + (-0.124 + 0.755i) + (-0.124 + 0.755i) + (-0.124 + 0.755i)\n\nSum = -0.715175 + 6.747528i\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms in the Mandelbrot set sequence is approximately -0.715 + 6.748i."
