    "message_2": "The T1 separation axiom states that for any two distinct points x and y in a topological space, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nLet's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: One of the points is 2.\nWithout loss of generality, let x = 2 and y ≠ 2. Since any subset containing 2 is open, we can choose an open set U = {2} and an open set V = A - {2} (which contains y). Then, U ∩ V = ∅, and the T1 separation axiom is satisfied for this case.\n\nCase 2: Neither of the points is 2.\nLet x ≠ 2 and y ≠ 2, and x ≠ y. In this case, we cannot find open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. This is because any open set containing x or y must also contain 2, and thus their intersection will always contain 2, i.e., U ∩ V ≠ ∅.\n\nTherefore, the given topology does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom."
