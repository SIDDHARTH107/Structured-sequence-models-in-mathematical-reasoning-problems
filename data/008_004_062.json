    "message_2": "Yes, I can solve this system of linear equations using Linear Algebra methods. We can represent the given system of equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  1 | 0 ]\n[ 2  1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 3  1 -1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n```\n[ 2  1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 1 -2  1 | 0 ]\n[ 3  1 -1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-1/2) * Row 1 + Row 2:\n```\n[  2   1   1 | 0 ]\n[  0  -3   3/2 | 0 ]\n[  3   1  -1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (-3/2) * Row 1 + Row 3:\n```\n[  2   1    1  | 0 ]\n[  0  -3   3/2 | 0 ]\n[  0  -1/2 -1/2 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Multiply Row 2 by (-1/3):\n```\n[  2   1    1  | 0 ]\n[  0   1  -1/2 | 0 ]\n[  0  -1/2 -1/2 | 0 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 3 with Row 2 + Row 3:\n```\n[  2   1    1  | 0 ]\n[  0   1  -1/2 | 0 ]\n[  0   0    0  | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. The last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. So, we have two non-trivial equations:\n\n```\n2x + y + z = 0\ny - (1/2)z = 0\n```\n\nLet's express y and z in terms of a parameter t:\n\n```\ny = (1/2)z\nz = t\n```\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the first equation:\n\n```\n2x + (1/2)t + t = 0\n```\n\nSolve for x:\n\n```\nx = -(3/4)t\n```\n\nSo, the general solution for this system of equations is:\n\n```\nx = -(3/4)t\ny = (1/2)t\nz = t\n```\n\nWhere t is any real number."
