    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 8 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(8)\n\nC ≈ 3.14(8)\n\nC ≈ 25.12 cm\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 25.12 cm."
