    "message_1": "What is the probability of a fatal traffic accident occurring on a specific road with a length of 5 miles, given that there is an average of 1 fatal accident per mile on this type of road?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, fatal traffic accidents) occurring in a fixed interval (in this case, the 5-mile road).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (fatal accidents) in the interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (fatal accidents) per interval (in this case, the 5-mile road)\n- k is the number of events (fatal accidents) we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of λ for the 5-mile road. Since there is an average of 1 fatal accident per mile, and the road is 5 miles long, λ = 1 * 5 = 5.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one fatal accident occurring on the 5-mile road. To do this, we can find the probability of no fatal accidents occurring (k = 0) and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-5) * 5^0) / 0! = (e^(-5) * 1) / 1 = e^(-5)\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least one fatal accident:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-5) ≈ 1 - 0.0067 ≈ 0.9933\n\nSo, the probability of a fatal traffic accident occurring on the 5-mile road is approximately 0.9933, or 99.33%."
