    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\nGCF of 6x^2 and 9x is 3x.\nSo, we can factor out 3x from the numerator:\n(6x^2 + 9x) = 3x(2x + 3)\n\nDenominator:\nGCF of 15x^3 and 10x^2 is 5x^2.\nSo, we can factor out 5x^2 from the denominator:\n(15x^3 - 10x^2) = 5x^2(3x - 2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the rational expression as:\n(3x(2x + 3)) / (5x^2(3x - 2))\n\nSince there are no common factors in the numerator and denominator other than 1, the rational expression is already in its simplest form:\n\n(3x(2x + 3)) / (5x^2(3x - 2))"
