    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nGiven system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n4x - y  = 4\n\nMatrix A (coefficients):\n[2, 3]\n[4, -1]\n\nMatrix X (variables):\n[x]\n[y]\n\nMatrix B (constants):\n[13]\n[ 4]\n\nNow, we have AX = B, and we need to find X. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)):\n\nA^(-1)AX = A^(-1)B\nX = A^(-1)B\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)). The formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix is:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of matrix A and adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[ 2,  3]\n[ 4, -1]\n\nDeterminant of A (det(A)):\ndet(A) = (2 * -1) - (3 * 4) = -2 - 12 = -14\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of matrix A (adj(A)):\nTo find adj(A), we swap the elements in the main diagonal and change the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = [ -1, -3]\n         [ -4,  2]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)):\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A) = (-1/14) * [ -1, -3]\n                                      [ -4,  2]\n\nA^(-1) = [ 1/14,  3/14]\n         [ 4/14, -2/14]\n\nNow, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A^(-1) with matrix B:\n\nX = A^(-1)B = [ 1/14,  3/14] [13]\n              [ 4/14, -2/14] [ 4]\n\nX = [ (1/14)*13 + (3/14)*4 ]\n    [ (4/14)*13 + (-2/14)*4 ]\n\nX = [ 13/14 + 12/14 ]\n    [ 52/14 -  8/14 ]\n\nX = [ 25/14 ]\n    [ 44/14 ]\n\nX = [ 1.7857 ]\n    [ 3.1429 ]\n\nSo, the solution in column matrix form is:\n\nX = [ x ]\n    [ y ]\n\nX = [ 1.7857 ]\n    [ 3.1429 ]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x ≈ 1.79 and y ≈ 3.14."
