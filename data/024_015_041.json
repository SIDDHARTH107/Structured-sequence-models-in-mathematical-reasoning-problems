    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the 2-form $\\alpha$, we need to apply the exterior derivative operator $d$ to each term in $\\alpha$ and then sum the results. Recall that the exterior derivative operator acts on a function by taking its partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate and then wedging the result with the corresponding differential form. \n\nLet's compute the exterior derivative of each term in $\\alpha$:\n\n1. For the term $x^2 dy \\wedge dz$, we have:\n$$\nd(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = d(x^2) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\n2. For the term $xyz dx \\wedge dy$, we have:\n$$\nd(xyz dx \\wedge dy) = d(xyz) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = (xz dy + yz dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\n3. For the term $z^3 dy \\wedge dx$, we have:\n$$\nd(z^3 dy \\wedge dx) = d(z^3) \\wedge dy \\wedge dx = (3z^2 dz) \\wedge dy \\wedge dx\n$$\n\nNow, we sum the results:\n\n$$\nd\\alpha = (2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) + (xz dy + yz dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + (3z^2 dz) \\wedge dy \\wedge dx\n$$\n\nHowever, we need to simplify this expression by noting that the wedge product is alternating, meaning that if any two forms in the product are the same, the product is zero. So, the term $(yz dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$ is zero, and we are left with:\n\n$$\nd\\alpha = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + xz dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + 3z^2 dz \\wedge dy \\wedge dx\n$$\n\nFinally, we can rewrite the expression by reordering the wedge products using the antisymmetry property:\n\n$$\nd\\alpha = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz - xz dy \\wedge dy \\wedge dx - 3z^2 dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nSince $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, the second term vanishes, and we obtain the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\nd\\alpha = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz - 3z^2 dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$"
