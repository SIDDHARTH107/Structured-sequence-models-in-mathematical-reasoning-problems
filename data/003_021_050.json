    "message_2": "To find the angle between the plane's velocity and the resultant velocity of the plane due to the wind, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. First, let's find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe plane's velocity is 400 km/hr towards the East (let's call this vector A), and the wind's velocity is 100 km/hr towards the North (let's call this vector B). The resultant velocity (vector R) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nR = √(A^2 + B^2)\nR = √(400^2 + 100^2)\nR = √(160000 + 10000)\nR = √170000\nR ≈ 412.31 km/hr\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ between the plane's velocity (vector A) and the resultant velocity (vector R) using the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the wind's velocity (vector B) and the adjacent side is the plane's velocity (vector A):\n\ntan(θ) = 100 / 400\ntan(θ) = 0.25\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 0.25:\n\nθ = arctan(0.25)\nθ ≈ 14.04 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the plane's velocity and the resultant velocity of the plane due to the wind is approximately 14.04 degrees."
