    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a specific numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic as it deals with contradictions and inconsistent information. It is not based on numerical calculations but on logical reasoning. However, here's a possible question related to paraconsistent logic that a math student can solve:\n\nSuppose p is a statement that is both true and false at the same time due to inconsistent information. Using paraconsistent logic, how can you determine the truth value of the statement q = (p AND NOT p)?",
    "message_2": "In paraconsistent logic, a statement can be both true and false simultaneously. To determine the truth value of the statement q = (p AND NOT p), we need to consider the possible truth values of p and NOT p.\n\nSince p is both true and false, we can represent its truth value as (T, F). The truth value of NOT p would be the opposite, which is (F, T).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the statement q = (p AND NOT p) using these truth values. In paraconsistent logic, the AND operator is evaluated as follows:\n\n(T, F) AND (F, T) = (T*F, F*T) = (F, F)\n\nSo, the truth value of the statement q = (p AND NOT p) in paraconsistent logic is (F, F), which means it is false."
