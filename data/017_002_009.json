Since G is a cyclic group generated by 5, we know that the order of G must be a divisor of the order of the element 5.\n\nLet's find the order of the element 5. We are looking for the smallest positive integer n such that 5^n = 1. Since we are not given any additional information about the group G, we cannot determine the exact order of the element 5 or the group G. However, we can still discuss the subgroups of G in a general form.\n\nLet n be the order of the element 5. Then, G has order n, and G = {1, 5, 5^2, ..., 5^(n-1)}. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must be a divisor of the order of G, which is n. Let d be a divisor of n. Then, there exists a subgroup H_d of G with order d.\n\nTo show that H_d is cyclic, we need to find an element in H_d that generates H_d. Let's consider the element 5^(n/d) in G. We have:\n\n(5^(n/d))^d = (5^n)^(1/d) = 5^n = 1 (since 5 has order n).\n\nThus, the order of the element 5^(n/d) is d. Now, let's show that H_d = ⟨5^(n/d)⟩. Since the order of 5^(n/d) is d, we know that ⟨5^(n/d)⟩ is a subgroup of G with order d. Moreover, any element in H_d can be written as (5^(n/d))^k for some integer k, where 0 ≤ k < d. Therefore, H_d = ⟨5^(n/d)⟩, and H_d is a cyclic subgroup of G.\n\nIn conclusion, for each divisor d of n, there exists a cyclic subgroup H_d of G with order d, generated by the element 5^(n/d). These are all the subgroups of G, and they are all cyclic."
