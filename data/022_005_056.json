    "message_2": "To determine the residue of the function f(z) = (1/z^3) * e^(1/z) at the point z=0, we first need to find the Laurent series expansion of the function around z=0.\n\nThe Laurent series expansion of e^(1/z) is given by:\n\ne^(1/z) = 1 + (1/z) + (1/2!)(1/z)^2 + (1/3!)(1/z)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we multiply this series by (1/z^3):\n\nf(z) = (1/z^3) * e^(1/z) = (1/z^3) + (1/z^4) + (1/2!)(1/z^5) + (1/3!)(1/z^6) + ...\n\nThe residue of a function at a point is the coefficient of the (1/z) term in its Laurent series expansion. In this case, there is no (1/z) term in the expansion of f(z), so the residue of f(z) at z=0 is 0."
