    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid with a base of length 10 cm and width of 6 cm has a height of 8 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and the width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width\nBase Area = 10 cm * 6 cm\nBase Area = 60 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\nVolume = (1/3) * 60 cm² * 8 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 480 cm³\nVolume = 160 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
