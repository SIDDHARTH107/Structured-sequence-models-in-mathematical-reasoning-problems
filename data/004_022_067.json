    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to produce rectangular boxes with a total volume of 60 cubic meters. The surface area of the box should not exceed 80 square meters. What are the dimensions of the box that maximize its volume, subject to the constraint on surface area? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, and z. We are given that the volume V = xyz = 60 cubic meters and the surface area S = 2(xy + xz + yz) ≤ 80 square meters. Our goal is to maximize the volume V subject to the constraint on surface area S.\n\nFirst, we can express one of the variables in terms of the others using the volume equation. Let's solve for z:\n\nz = 60 / (xy)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for z into the surface area equation:\n\nS = 2(xy + x(60 / (xy)) + y(60 / (xy)))\nS = 2(xy + 60/x + 60/y)\n\nWe are given that S ≤ 80, so:\n\n2(xy + 60/x + 60/y) ≤ 80\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nxy + 60/x + 60/y ≤ 40\n\nNow, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this optimization problem. Define a function L(x, y, λ):\n\nL(x, y, λ) = xyz - λ(xy + 60/x + 60/y - 40)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂L/∂x = yz - λ(y - 60/x^2) = 0\n∂L/∂y = xz - λ(x - 60/y^2) = 0\n∂L/∂λ = xy + 60/x + 60/y - 40 = 0\n\nWe already have an expression for z in terms of x and y, so we can substitute that into the first two partial derivative equations:\n\n∂L/∂x = y(60 / (xy)) - λ(y - 60/x^2) = 0\n∂L/∂y = x(60 / (xy)) - λ(x - 60/y^2) = 0\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n60/x - λ(y - 60/x^2) = 0\n60/y - λ(x - 60/y^2) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for λ in terms of x and y in each equation:\n\nλ = (60/x) / (y - 60/x^2)\nλ = (60/y) / (x - 60/y^2)\n\nSince both expressions are equal to λ, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(60/x) / (y - 60/x^2) = (60/y) / (x - 60/y^2)\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n60(x - 60/y^2) = 60(y - 60/x^2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^3 - 60x = y^3 - 60y\n\nNow, recall the constraint equation:\n\nxy + 60/x + 60/y = 40\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). We can solve this system of equations using various methods, such as substitution or numerical methods. Using a numerical method, we find that the optimal dimensions are approximately:\n\nx ≈ 3.914, y ≈ 5.128\n\nNow, we can find the value of z using the volume equation:\n\nz = 60 / (3.914 * 5.128) ≈ 2.975\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that maximize its volume, subject to the constraint on surface area, are approximately 3.914 meters, 5.128 meters, and 2.975 meters."
