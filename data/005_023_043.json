The data collected is as follows:\n$20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $50,000, $75,000, $80,000, $100,000, $120,000.\n\nCalculate the outlier boundary using the interquartile range (IQR) method and identify if any salary is considered an outlier according to this method.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the median, lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3) of the data set.\n\nThe data set is already sorted in ascending order:\n$20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $50,000, $75,000, $80,000, $100,000, $120,000.\n\nThere are 10 data points, so the median is the average of the 5th and 6th data points:\nMedian = ($40,000 + $50,000) / 2 = $45,000\n\nNow, we need to find Q1 and Q3. Since the median is between the 5th and 6th data points, we can find Q1 by taking the median of the first 5 data points and Q3 by taking the median of the last 5 data points.\n\nQ1 = Median of $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000\nQ1 = $30,000 (the middle value)\n\nQ3 = Median of $50,000, $75,000, $80,000, $100,000, $120,000\nQ3 = $80,000 (the middle value)\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = $80,000 - $30,000 = $50,000\n\nNext, we need to find the outlier boundaries. We'll use the 1.5 * IQR rule to determine the boundaries.\n\nLower boundary = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = $30,000 - 1.5 * $50,000 = $30,000 - $75,000 = -$45,000\nUpper boundary = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = $80,000 + 1.5 * $50,000 = $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000\n\nNow we can check if any of the salaries are considered outliers according to the IQR method. Since the lower boundary is -$45,000 and the upper boundary is $155,000, none of the salaries in the data set are considered outliers."
