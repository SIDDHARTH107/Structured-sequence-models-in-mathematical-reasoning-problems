    "message_1": "A travel agent has found that on trips to a popular tourist destination, 80% of the time the weather is sunny, 15% of the time it is cloudy, and 5% of the time it rains. If a traveler went on 10 trips to this destination, what is the probability that on exactly 3 trips it will rain?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, rain) in n trials (trips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (trip)\n- n is the number of trials (trips)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy trips)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 10 trips\n- k = 3 rainy trips\n- p = 0.05 (5% probability of rain)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (1-0.05)^(10-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(10, 3):\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\nC(10, 3) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(10, 3) = 720 / 6\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 120 * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^7\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 120 * 0.000125 * 0.69834\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.01047\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 3 rainy trips out of 10 is approximately 0.01047, or 1.047%."
