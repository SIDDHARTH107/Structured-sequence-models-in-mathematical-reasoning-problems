    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has an initial mass of 600 grams and its half-life is 10 days. How much of the substance remains after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 600 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 600 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 600 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 600 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 75 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, 75 grams of the radioactive substance remains."
