    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 18: 2 × 3^2\nPrime factorization of 24: 2^3 × 3\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of each prime factor present in the factorizations and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(18, 24) = 2^3 × 3^2 = 8 × 9 = 72\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 18 and 24 is 72."
