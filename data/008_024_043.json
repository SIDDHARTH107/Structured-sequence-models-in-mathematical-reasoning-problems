    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, let's observe the given equations:\n\n1) 3x + 4y - 2z = 8\n2) 6x + 8y - 4z = 16\n3) 9x + 12y - 6z = 24\n\nWe can see that equation (2) is just equation (1) multiplied by 2, and equation (3) is equation (1) multiplied by 3. This means that all three equations are linearly dependent, and they represent the same plane in three-dimensional space. \n\nSince all three equations represent the same plane, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of linear equations. To find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's express x in terms of y and z using equation (1):\n\n3x + 4y - 2z = 8\n3x = 8 - 4y + 2z\nx = (8 - 4y + 2z)/3\n\nNow we have x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = (8 - 4y + 2z)/3\n\nSince there are infinitely many solutions, we cannot find specific values for x, y, and z. However, the general solution is given by the equation above, where x can be expressed in terms of y and z."
