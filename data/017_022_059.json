    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we will analyze the Sylow subgroups of G and use the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 60, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3 * 5. Thus, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 15. In this case, G would be non-abelian.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 * 5 = 20, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, or 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 20. In this case, G would be non-abelian.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^2 * 3 = 12, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 12. In this case, G would be non-abelian.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of the Sylow subgroups:\n\n- If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of these subgroups, and G is non-abelian.\n\n- If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, but not a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup, and G is non-abelian.\n\n- If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, but not a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, and G is non-abelian.\n\n- If G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, but not a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, and G is non-abelian.\n\n- If G does not have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, or a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is not a semi-direct product of any of these subgroups, and G is non-abelian.\n\nIn all cases, G is non-abelian. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, which is abelian. Moreover, G cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, which is also abelian. Thus, G must be isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
