    "message_1": "A student is planning her vacation trip to Hawaii. According to the weather forecast, the probability of having at least one rainy day during her trip is 0.4. If her trip lasts for 7 days, what is the probability that she will have at least one day of rain during her trip?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of having at least one rainy day is the probability of having no rainy days at all. \n\nLet P(rain) = 0.4, which means the probability of having rain on any given day is 0.4. Therefore, the probability of not having rain on any given day, P(no rain), is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nSince the trip lasts for 7 days, the probability of having no rainy days at all during the trip is the product of the probabilities of not having rain on each day:\n\nP(no rain for 7 days) = P(no rain)^7 = (0.6)^7 ≈ 0.02799.\n\nNow, to find the probability of having at least one rainy day during the trip, we can use the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least one rainy day) = 1 - P(no rain for 7 days) = 1 - 0.02799 ≈ 0.97201.\n\nSo, the probability that the student will have at least one day of rain during her 7-day trip is approximately 0.97201 or 97.2%."
