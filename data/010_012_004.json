    "message_2": "To determine whether the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$ is continuous and differentiable on $\\mathbb{R},$ we will first check for continuity and then for differentiability.\n\nContinuity:\nA function is continuous if the limit of the function as x approaches a point c exists and is equal to the function's value at that point, i.e., $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)$ for all $c \\in \\mathbb{R}.$\n\nSince $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$ is a polynomial function, it is continuous on its entire domain, which is $\\mathbb{R}.$ Polynomial functions are continuous because they can be represented as a sum of continuous functions (monomials), and the sum of continuous functions is also continuous.\n\nDifferentiability:\nA function is differentiable at a point c if its derivative exists at that point. To check for differentiability, we will find the derivative of the function and check if it exists for all $c \\in \\mathbb{R}.$\n\nUsing the power rule, we can find the derivative of $f(x):$\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x) = 3x^2 - 3.$\n\nSince $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3$ is also a polynomial function, it exists for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}.$ Polynomial functions are differentiable on their entire domain because they can be represented as a sum of differentiable functions (monomials), and the sum of differentiable functions is also differentiable.\n\nTherefore, the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$ is both continuous and differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}.$"
