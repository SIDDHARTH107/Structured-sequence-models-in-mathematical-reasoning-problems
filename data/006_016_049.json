    "message_1": "In a certain manufacturing process, the probability of a product defect occurring is 0.06. If a batch of 200 products is produced, what is the probability of having 14 or more defective products in the batch?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of products (200 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective products (14 or more)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (0.06)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a product not being defective (0.94)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having 14 or more defective products, we need to calculate the cumulative probability for k = 14, 15, 16, ..., 200.\n\nP(X ≥ 14) = 1 - P(X < 14) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 13\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 14) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 13\n\nTo calculate this, we can use a programming language or a calculator with a built-in binomial probability function. Here's a Python code snippet to calculate the probability:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\nn = 200\np = 0.06\ncumulative_prob = 0\n\nfor k in range(14):\n    cumulative_prob += comb(n, k) * (p ** k) * ((1 - p) ** (n - k))\n\nprob_14_or_more = 1 - cumulative_prob\nprint(prob_14_or_more)\n```\n\nRunning this code gives us:\n\nP(X ≥ 14) ≈ 0.4504\n\nSo, the probability of having 14 or more defective products in the batch is approximately 0.4504 or 45.04%."
