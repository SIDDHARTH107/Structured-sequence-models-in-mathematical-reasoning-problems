    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products - Product A and Product B. For each unit of Product A, the company spends $8 on raw materials and $2 on labour, and sells the product for $20. For each unit of Product B, the company spends $10 on raw materials and $5 on labour, and sells the product for $25. If the company has $500 to spend on raw materials and $250 to spend on labour, how many units of each product should they produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe cost of raw materials for Product A is 8x, and for Product B is 10y. The total cost of raw materials is 8x + 10y, which should be less than or equal to $500.\n8x + 10y ≤ 500\n\nThe cost of labour for Product A is 2x, and for Product B is 5y. The total cost of labour is 2x + 5y, which should be less than or equal to $250.\n2x + 5y ≤ 250\n\nThe profit for Product A is (20 - 8 - 2)x = 10x, and for Product B is (25 - 10 - 5)y = 10y. The total profit is 10x + 10y.\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function 10x + 10y subject to the constraints 8x + 10y ≤ 500 and 2x + 5y ≤ 250.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the profit function by dividing by 10:\nx + y = P (where P is the profit)\n\nNow, we can solve the constraint equations for y:\ny ≤ (500 - 8x)/10\ny ≤ (250 - 2x)/5\n\nWe can find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph. The feasible region will be a polygon, and the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of this polygon. We can find the vertices by finding the points where the constraint lines intersect.\n\nIntersection of 8x + 10y = 500 and 2x + 5y = 250:\n8x + 10y = 500\n2x + 5y = 250\n\nMultiply the second equation by 4 to match the coefficients of x:\n8x + 20y = 1000\n\nSubtract the first equation from the modified second equation:\n10y = 500\ny = 50\n\nSubstitute y back into the second original equation:\n2x + 5(50) = 250\n2x + 250 = 250\n2x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, one vertex is at (0, 50).\n\nIntersection of 8x + 10y = 500 and x-axis (y = 0):\n8x + 10(0) = 500\n8x = 500\nx = 62.5\n\nIntersection of 2x + 5y = 250 and y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 5y = 250\n5y = 250\ny = 50\n\nNow we have three vertices: (0, 50), (62.5, 0), and (0, 50). Since (0, 50) is repeated, we only need to consider two vertices.\n\nCalculate the profit at each vertex:\nP(0, 50) = 0 + 50 = 50\nP(62.5, 0) = 62.5 + 0 = 62.5\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 62.5 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, they should produce 62 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
