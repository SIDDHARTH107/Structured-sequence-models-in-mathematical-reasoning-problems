    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the area of auction theory:\n\nIn a sealed-bid second price auction, there are two bidders bidding on a painting. Bidder 1 bids $2,000 and Bidder 2 bids $3,500. What price does Bidder 2 pay for the painting if the auctioneer charges the second highest bid?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second price auction, the winner pays the second highest bid. In this case, Bidder 1 bids $2,000 and Bidder 2 bids $3,500. Since Bidder 2 has the highest bid, they win the auction. However, they will pay the second highest bid, which is $2,000. So, Bidder 2 pays $2,000 for the painting."
