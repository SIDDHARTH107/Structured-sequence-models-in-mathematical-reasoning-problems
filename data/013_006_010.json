    "message_1": "Suppose two hunters are hunting in a forest. They both have to decide whether to hunt a stag or a rabbit. If they both hunt a stag, their payoff is 10 units each. If one hunter hunts a stag and the other hunts a rabbit, the hunter who hunts the stag gets 8 units and the hunter who hunts the rabbit gets 0 units. If they both hunt rabbits, their payoff is 3 units each. If the probability that a randomly chosen hunter wants to hunt a stag is 0.6, what is the probability that they will both hunt a stag?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both hunters will hunt a stag, we simply multiply the probability that a randomly chosen hunter wants to hunt a stag by itself, since the events are independent.\n\nProbability(both hunters hunt a stag) = Probability(hunter 1 hunts a stag) * Probability(hunter 2 hunts a stag)\n\nProbability(both hunters hunt a stag) = 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n\nSo, the probability that both hunters will hunt a stag is 0.36 or 36%."
