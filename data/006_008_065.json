    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will not rain for the next 3 consecutive days, we need to find the probability of no rain on each day and then multiply these probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of no rain on any given day is 1 - the probability of rain, which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of no rain for 3 consecutive days. We do this by multiplying the probabilities of no rain on each day:\n\n0.7 (day 1) * 0.7 (day 2) * 0.7 (day 3) = 0.7^3 = 0.343\n\nSo, the probability that it will not rain for the next 3 consecutive days in this city is 0.343 or 34.3%."
