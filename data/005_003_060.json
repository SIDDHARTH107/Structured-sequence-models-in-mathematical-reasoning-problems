They collected data for 30 days, finding that when the temperature was 25°C the sales were $5000 and when the temperature was 30°C the sales were $6000. Using regression analysis, what is the predicted sales when the temperature is 28°C?",
    "message_2": "To predict the sales when the temperature is 28°C, we can use the linear regression equation:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y is the predicted sales, m is the slope of the line, x is the temperature, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) using the given data points (25, 5000) and (30, 6000):\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (6000 - 5000) / (30 - 25)\nm = 1000 / 5\nm = 200\n\nNow we need to find the y-intercept (b). We can use one of the given data points, for example, (25, 5000):\n\n5000 = 200 * 25 + b\n5000 = 5000 + b\nb = 0\n\nNow we have the linear regression equation:\n\ny = 200x\n\nTo predict the sales when the temperature is 28°C, we plug in x = 28:\n\ny = 200 * 28\ny = 5600\n\nSo, the predicted sales when the temperature is 28°C is $5600."
