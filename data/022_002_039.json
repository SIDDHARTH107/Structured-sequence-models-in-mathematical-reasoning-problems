    "message_2": "To find the conformal map, we will use the Möbius transformation, which is a bijective and conformal map between the upper half-plane and the unit disk. The general form of a Möbius transformation is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. We need to find the coefficients $a, b, c,$ and $d$ such that the given conditions are satisfied.\n\n1. The map sends $i$ to the origin:\n\n$$f(i) = \\frac{ai + b}{ci + d} = 0$$\n\nSince $f(i) = 0$, we have $ai + b = 0$. Thus, $b = -ai$.\n\n2. The map sends $-i$ to the point $(1,0)$:\n\n$$f(-i) = \\frac{a(-i) - ai}{c(-i) + d} = 1$$\n\nSubstituting $b = -ai$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{-2ai}{-ci + d} = 1$$\n\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns, $a$ and $c$. We can solve for $a$ and $c$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator and rearranging terms:\n\n$$-2ai = -ci + d$$\n$$d - ci = 2ai$$\n\nSince $d - ci$ and $2ai$ are both real, we can equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: $d = 2a$\nImaginary part: $-c = 2a$\n\nNow we have $c = -2a$ and $d = 2a$. The Möbius transformation becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az - ai}{-2az + 2a}$$\n\nTo simplify, we can factor out $a$ from the denominator:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i}{-2z + 2}$$\n\nThis is the conformal map that maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk, sending $i$ to the origin and $-i$ to the point $(1,0)$."
