    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the product of two functions, we can use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of the product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n(h(x) = f(x) * g(x))\nh'(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x)\n\nIn this case, f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = cos(x). First, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\ng'(x) = d(cos(x))/dx = -sin(x)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nh'(x) = (2x) * (cos(x)) + (x^2) * (-sin(x))\n\nWe want to find the derivative at x = π/2:\n\nh'(π/2) = (2(π/2)) * (cos(π/2)) + ((π/2)^2) * (-sin(π/2))\nh'(π/2) = (π) * (0) + ((π^2)/4) * (-1)\nh'(π/2) = 0 - (π^2)/4\nh'(π/2) = -(π^2)/4\n\nSo, the derivative of the product of the two functions at x = π/2 is -(π^2)/4."
