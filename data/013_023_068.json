    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, player A is given $10 and must decide how much money to send to player B. Player B receives that amount, and then must decide how much money to return to player A. If player B returns $x to player A, then player A's total earnings become $10 - the amount sent to player B + 3x. What should player A send to player B in order to maximize their earnings, assuming player B will return an equal amount?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount player A sends to player B as y. Since player B will return an equal amount, x = y. Player A's total earnings can be represented as:\n\nEarnings = 10 - y + 3x\n\nSince x = y, we can substitute x with y:\n\nEarnings = 10 - y + 3y\n\nNow, we simplify the equation:\n\nEarnings = 10 + 2y\n\nTo maximize player A's earnings, we need to find the maximum value of y. Since player A has $10, the maximum amount they can send is $10. So, y = 10.\n\nNow, we substitute y with 10:\n\nEarnings = 10 + 2(10)\n\nEarnings = 10 + 20\n\nEarnings = $30\n\nTherefore, to maximize their earnings, player A should send all $10 to player B, assuming player B will return an equal amount."
