    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function f(x) = (5x^2 - 1)^3 using the chain rule, we first identify the inner function and the outer function. In this case, the inner function is g(x) = 5x^2 - 1, and the outer function is h(u) = u^3, where u = g(x).\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of the inner and outer functions:\n\ng'(x) = d(5x^2 - 1)/dx = 10x\nh'(u) = d(u^3)/du = 3u^2\n\nNext, we apply the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composite function is the product of the derivatives of the inner and outer functions:\n\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for h'(u) and g'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (3(5x^2 - 1)^2) * (10x)\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 30x(5x^2 - 1)^2\n\nSo, the derivative of the composite function f(x) = (5x^2 - 1)^3 is f'(x) = 30x(5x^2 - 1)^2."
