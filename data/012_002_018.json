    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of colors required to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's try to color the graph using the greedy coloring algorithm, which colors the vertices in a sequence, assigning the smallest available color to each vertex.\n\n1. Color vertex A with color 1.\n2. Color vertex B with color 2 (since it is adjacent to A).\n3. Color vertex C with color 2 (since it is adjacent to A, but not B).\n4. Color vertex D with color 3 (since it is adjacent to A, B, and C).\n5. Color vertex E with color 1 (since it is adjacent to B and D, but not A).\n6. Color vertex F with color 3 (since it is adjacent to B and E, but not D).\n7. Color vertex G with color 1 (since it is adjacent to D, but not A or E).\n8. Color vertex H with color 2 (since it is adjacent to D, E, and G).\n\nThe graph G can be colored using 3 colors, and no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph G is 3."
