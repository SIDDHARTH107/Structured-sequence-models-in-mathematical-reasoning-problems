    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves with no common components is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity and including points at infinity.\n\nThe given equations are:\n\n$$\nx^3 + y^3 = 16 \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 = 8\n$$\n\nThe first equation represents a curve of degree 3, and the second equation represents a curve of degree 2. They do not share any common components.\n\nApplying Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points is the product of their degrees:\n\n$$\n3 \\times 2 = 6\n$$\n\nSo, there are 6 intersection points for these two curves, counted with multiplicity and including points at infinity."
