    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2$, we will use the Cauchy's estimates for the derivatives of an entire function.\n\nLet $f(z)$ be an entire function, and let $M(r) = \\max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|$. Then, for any positive integer $n$ and any $z$ with $|z|=r$, we have the following estimate for the $n$-th derivative of $f$:\n\n$$|f^{(n)}(z)| \\leq \\frac{n!M(r)}{r^n}.$$\n\nNow, let's apply this to our function $f(z)$ with the given condition $|f(z)| \\leq 3|z|^2$. This implies that $M(r) \\leq 3r^2$ for all $r > 0$. Using the Cauchy's estimate for the $n$-th derivative, we get:\n\n$$|f^{(n)}(z)| \\leq \\frac{n!3r^2}{r^n} = \\frac{n!3}{r^{n-2}}.$$\n\nNow, let's consider the limit as $r \\to \\infty$:\n\n$$\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{n!3}{r^{n-2}} = 0$$\n\nfor all $n \\geq 3$. This means that the third and higher derivatives of $f(z)$ are identically zero. Since $f(z)$ is entire, it can be represented by its Taylor series:\n\n$$f(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nHowever, since the third and higher derivatives are zero, we have $a_3 = a_4 = \\cdots = 0$. Thus, $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2$:\n\n$$f(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2.$$"
