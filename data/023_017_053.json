    "message_2": "To find the maximum velocity of the fluid in the pipe, we need to find the maximum value of the velocity function v(x) = 2cos(3x) + 4sin(5x). We can do this by finding the amplitude of the combined sinusoidal functions.\n\nLet's represent the given function as a sum of two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies:\n\nv(x) = A1cos(3x + φ1) + A2sin(5x + φ2)\n\nHere, A1 = 2, A2 = 4, φ1 = 0, and φ2 = 0.\n\nNow, we'll use the Fourier analysis to combine these two sinusoidal functions into a single sinusoidal function:\n\nv(x) = Acos(kx + φ)\n\nTo find the amplitude A and phase φ, we can use the following equations:\n\nA = sqrt(A1^2 + A2^2)\nφ = arctan(-A2sin(φ2) / (A1cos(φ1) + A2cos(φ2)))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA = sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(4 + 16) = sqrt(20)\nφ = arctan(-4sin(0) / (2cos(0) + 4cos(0))) = arctan(0) = 0\n\nSo, the combined sinusoidal function is:\n\nv(x) = sqrt(20)cos(3x)\n\nThe maximum velocity of the fluid in the pipe is equal to the amplitude of the combined sinusoidal function, which is:\n\nMaximum velocity = A = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.47 units."
