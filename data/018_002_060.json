    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and set B, we need to show that every element in the intersection of A and B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nLet's find the intersection of set A and set B:\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of set A and set B, we can see that the elements 3, 4, and 5 are common to both sets. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B is:\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set A and set B.\n\n1. A ∩ B ⊆ A: For every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of A.\nSince A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, we can see that all elements in A ∩ B are also elements of A = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\n2. A ∩ B ⊆ B: For every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of B.\nSince A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, we can see that all elements in A ∩ B are also elements of B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nSince A ∩ B is a subset of both set A and set B, we have proven that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and set B."
