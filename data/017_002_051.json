    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we need to consider the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding subgroup generated by a^k, where k is a divisor of 12.\n\n1. The subgroup of order 1 is {e}, where e is the identity element. This subgroup is trivially cyclic.\n\n2. The subgroup of order 2 is generated by a^(12/2) = a^6. So, the subgroup is {e, a^6}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^6.\n\n3. The subgroup of order 3 is generated by a^(12/3) = a^4. So, the subgroup is {e, a^4, a^8}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^4.\n\n4. The subgroup of order 4 is generated by a^(12/4) = a^3. So, the subgroup is {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^3.\n\n5. The subgroup of order 6 is generated by a^(12/6) = a^2. So, the subgroup is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^2.\n\n6. The subgroup of order 12 is generated by a. So, the subgroup is {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a.\n\nIn conclusion, the subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, a^6}\n3. {e, a^4, a^8}\n4. {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\n6. {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}\n\nEach of these subgroups is cyclic, as they are all generated by a single element."
