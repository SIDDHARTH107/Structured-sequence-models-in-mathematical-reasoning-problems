    "message_1": "A wire carrying current of 2 A is bent into a rectangle as shown below. The sides of the rectangle measure 2 m and 4 m. Find the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangle if the wire is located in free space.\n\n![Wire carrying current](https://i.imgur.com/R9oFvq8.png)\n\n(Note: You may assume that the wire is thin and the magnetic field at one edge of the wire is negligible compared to the other edge.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the rectangle, we will use the Biot-Savart law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small segment of wire carrying current I is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ * I * dl * sinθ) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the length of the small segment of wire, θ is the angle between the wire segment and the line connecting the wire segment to the point where we want to find the magnetic field, and r is the distance from the wire segment to that point.\n\nSince the magnetic field is a vector, we need to find the magnetic field due to each side of the rectangle and then add them up vectorially. Let's label the sides of the rectangle as follows: AB = 2 m, BC = 4 m, CD = 2 m, and DA = 4 m.\n\nFor sides AB and CD, the magnetic field at the center will be perpendicular to the plane of the rectangle and have the same magnitude but opposite directions. Therefore, they will cancel each other out.\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field due to sides BC and DA at the center. Let's call the center point O. Since the magnetic field is symmetrical, the magnetic field due to side BC will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the magnetic field due to side DA. Therefore, we only need to find the magnetic field due to one of these sides and then double it.\n\nLet's find the magnetic field due to side BC at point O. The distance from any point on side BC to point O is 1 m (half of the 2 m width). The angle θ between the wire segment and the line connecting the wire segment to point O is 90°, so sinθ = 1.\n\nNow, we can integrate the Biot-Savart law along side BC:\n\nB = ∫(μ₀ * I * dl) / (4 * π * r²)\n\nSince μ₀, I, and r are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²) * ∫dl\n\nIntegrating dl along side BC gives us the length of side BC, which is 4 m:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (4 * π * r²) * 4\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A * 2 A) / (4 * π * 1² m²) * 4 m\n\nB = (8π × 10⁻⁷ Tm) / π\n\nB = 8 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nSince the magnetic field due to side DA is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the total magnetic field at point O is double this value:\n\nB_total = 2 * B = 2 * 8 × 10⁻⁷ T = 16 × 10⁻⁷ T\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field due to side BC is into the plane of the rectangle (using the right-hand rule), and the direction of the magnetic field due to side DA is out of the plane of the rectangle. Since they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the net magnetic field at the center of the rectangle is zero.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangle is 0 T, and there is no specific direction since the magnetic field is zero."
