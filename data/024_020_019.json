    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted by h: S^3 → S^2, is a continuous map from the 3-sphere (S^3) to the 2-sphere (S^2). It is a well-known example of a nontrivial fiber bundle, and it plays an important role in the study of topology and geometry.\n\nTo define the Hopf map, we first identify S^3 as a subset of C^2 (the space of complex 2-tuples) by considering points (z1, z2) ∈ C^2 such that |z1|^2 + |z2|^2 = 1. Then, the Hopf map h: S^3 → S^2 is given by the following formula:\n\nh(z1, z2) = (2 * Re(z1 * conjugate(z2)), 2 * Im(z1 * conjugate(z2)), |z1|^2 - |z2|^2)\n\nwhere Re and Im denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and conjugate(z) denotes the complex conjugate of z.\n\nTo see that this map is well-defined and continuous, we can check that the image of h lies in S^2 and that h is continuous with respect to the standard topologies on S^3 and S^2.\n\nFirst, let (z1, z2) ∈ S^3, so |z1|^2 + |z2|^2 = 1. Then, the image of h is given by:\n\nh(z1, z2) = (x, y, z) where\nx = 2 * Re(z1 * conjugate(z2))\ny = 2 * Im(z1 * conjugate(z2))\nz = |z1|^2 - |z2|^2\n\nWe need to show that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. Note that:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = (2 * Re(z1 * conjugate(z2)))^2 + (2 * Im(z1 * conjugate(z2)))^2\n= 4 * (Re(z1 * conjugate(z2))^2 + Im(z1 * conjugate(z2))^2)\n= 4 * |z1 * conjugate(z2)|^2\n= 4 * |z1|^2 * |z2|^2\n\nNow, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 * |z1|^2 * |z2|^2 + (|z1|^2 - |z2|^2)^2\n= (2 * |z1|^2)^2 - 4 * |z1|^2 * |z2|^2 + (2 * |z2|^2)^2\n= (2 * |z1|^2 - 2 * |z2|^2)^2\n= (2 * (|z1|^2 + |z2|^2))^2\n= (2 * 1)^2\n= 1\n\nThus, the image of h lies in S^2. Since the components of h are continuous functions of z1 and z2, the Hopf map h is continuous.\n\nIn summary, the Hopf map h: S^3 → S^2 is given by the formula:\n\nh(z1, z2) = (2 * Re(z1 * conjugate(z2)), 2 * Im(z1 * conjugate(z2)), |z1|^2 - |z2|^2)\n\nwhere (z1, z2) ∈ S^3 ⊂ C^2 with |z1|^2 + |z2|^2 = 1."
