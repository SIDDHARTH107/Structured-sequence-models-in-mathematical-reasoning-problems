    "message_1": "Here's an example problem:\n\nIn modal logic, \"necessarily\" is represented by the symbol $\\Box$. Let $P$ be a proposition such that $\\Box P$ is true. If $\\Box(P \\rightarrow Q)$ is true, what can we say about the truth value of $\\Box Q$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the properties of modal logic and the given information.\n\nGiven: \n1. $\\Box P$ is true.\n2. $\\Box(P \\rightarrow Q)$ is true.\n\nWe want to find the truth value of $\\Box Q$.\n\nSince $\\Box(P \\rightarrow Q)$ is true, we know that the implication $(P \\rightarrow Q)$ is necessarily true. In other words, if $P$ is true, then $Q$ must also be true.\n\nNow, we are given that $\\Box P$ is true, which means that $P$ is necessarily true.\n\nSince $P$ is necessarily true and $(P \\rightarrow Q)$ is necessarily true, we can conclude that $Q$ must also be necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of $\\Box Q$ is true."
