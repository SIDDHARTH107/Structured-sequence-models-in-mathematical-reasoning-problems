    "message_2": "The given function f(z) = ∑(n=0 to ∞) z^n/n! is actually the well-known exponential function, which can be written as f(z) = e^z. The exponential function is entire, meaning it is analytic on the entire complex plane. Therefore, there is no need to analytically continue the function beyond its radius of convergence, as it is already convergent everywhere."
