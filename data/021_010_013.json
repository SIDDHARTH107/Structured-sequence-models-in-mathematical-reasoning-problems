    "message_1": "Here is a numerical optimization problem using Newton's method for a math student to solve:\n\nA company manufactures two products A and B. The revenue generated per unit of A and B is $10 and $15, respectively. The company has a production capacity of 500 units per month. The production process for A and B requires 2 and 3 hours, respectively, and there are only 100 hours available per month. Find the optimal number of units of A and B that the company should manufacture to maximize its revenue.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the revenue function R(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n1. Production capacity: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Production time: 2x + 3y ≤ 100\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for this problem. We can rewrite the constraints as follows:\n1. y ≤ 500 - x\n2. y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraints:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n500 - x = (100 - 2x) / 3\n3(500 - x) = 100 - 2x\n1500 - 3x = 100 - 2x\nx = 1400 / 1\nx = 400\n\ny = 500 - 400 = 100\n\nSo, the critical point is (400, 100).\n\nNow, we need to check the revenue at the vertices of the feasible region:\n1. (0, 0): R(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\n2. (0, 100): R(0, 100) = 10(0) + 15(100) = 1500\n3. (400, 100): R(400, 100) = 10(400) + 15(100) = 7000\n4. (500, 0): R(500, 0) = 10(500) + 15(0) = 5000\n\nThe maximum revenue is achieved at the point (400, 100), with a revenue of $7000. Therefore, the company should manufacture 400 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize its revenue."
