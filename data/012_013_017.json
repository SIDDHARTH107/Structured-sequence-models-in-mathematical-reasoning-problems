    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of graph G with k colors. We will use the edge connecting vertices 1 and 2 for the deletion-contraction process.\n\n1. Delete the edge between vertices 1 and 2. The resulting graph is a cycle with 5 vertices (C5). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an odd number of vertices is P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1) for n = 5. So, P(C5, k) = (k-1)^5 + (-1)^5(k-1).\n\n2. Contract the edge between vertices 1 and 2. The resulting graph is a cycle with 4 vertices (C4). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an even number of vertices is P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1) for n = 4. So, P(C4, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1).\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G*e, k), where G-e is the graph after deleting the edge, and G*e is the graph after contracting the edge.\n\nP(G, k) = P(C5, k) - P(C4, k)\nP(G, k) = [(k-1)^5 + (-1)^5(k-1)] - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1) - (k-1)\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4."
