    "message_1": "A coffee shop sells cups of coffee with a mean weight of 8 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. If a customer buys 5 cups of coffee, what is the probability that the total weight of those cups is between 38 and 42 ounces?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables will be approximately normal, regardless of the underlying distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the weight of a single cup of coffee. We want to find the probability that the total weight of 5 cups of coffee (n = 5) is between 38 and 42 ounces.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the total weight of 5 cups of coffee. Since the weights of the cups are independent and identically distributed, the mean of the total weight will be the sum of the means of the individual weights:\n\nMean of total weight (μ_total) = n * μ = 5 * 8 = 40 ounces\n\nNext, we need to find the standard deviation of the total weight. The standard deviation of the sum of independent variables is the square root of the sum of their variances. In this case, the variance of a single cup of coffee is σ^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25. So, the variance of the total weight is:\n\nVariance of total weight (σ_total^2) = n * σ^2 = 5 * 0.25 = 1.25\n\nNow, we find the standard deviation of the total weight:\n\nStandard deviation of total weight (σ_total) = √(σ_total^2) = √(1.25) ≈ 1.118\n\nNow, we can find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the total weight (38 and 42 ounces, respectively):\n\nz_lower = (38 - μ_total) / σ_total = (38 - 40) / 1.118 ≈ -1.79\nz_upper = (42 - μ_total) / σ_total = (42 - 40) / 1.118 ≈ 1.79\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table (or a calculator with a built-in z-table function) to find the probability that the total weight of the 5 cups of coffee is between 38 and 42 ounces:\n\nP(38 < total weight < 42) = P(-1.79 < z < 1.79)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find:\n\nP(z < 1.79) ≈ 0.9633\nP(z < -1.79) ≈ 0.0367\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the total weight is between 38 and 42 ounces:\n\nP(38 < total weight < 42) = P(z < 1.79) - P(z < -1.79) = 0.9633 - 0.0367 = 0.9266\n\nSo, the probability that the total weight of the 5 cups of coffee is between 38 and 42 ounces is approximately 0.9266, or 92.66%."
