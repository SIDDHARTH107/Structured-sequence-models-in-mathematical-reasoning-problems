    "message_1": "A city has two main roads leading to a central business district. The probability of an accident occurring on Road A is 0.03 and the probability of an accident occurring on Road B is 0.05. If both roads are equally popular, what is the probability of a certain type of traffic accident occurring on at least one of the roads?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a certain type of traffic accident occurring on at least one of the roads, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the event not happening. In this case, we will find the probability of no accidents occurring on either road and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring on Road A is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\nThe probability of no accident occurring on Road B is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince both roads are equally popular and the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of no accidents occurring on each road to find the probability of no accidents occurring on both roads:\n\n0.97 * 0.95 = 0.9215\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring on either road:\n\n1 - 0.9215 = 0.0785\n\nSo, the probability of a certain type of traffic accident occurring on at least one of the roads is 0.0785 or 7.85%."
