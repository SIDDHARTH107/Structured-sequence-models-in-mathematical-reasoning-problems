What is the predicted salary for someone with 14 years of education?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we first need to calculate the mean of x (years of education) and y (salary).\n\nMean of x (years of education):\n(8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17) / 10 = 125 / 10 = 12.5\n\nMean of y (salary):\n(35 + 39 + 42 + 46 + 50 + 55 + 60 + 65 + 70 + 75) / 10 = 537 / 10 = 53.7\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the regression line using the following formulas:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / Σ(xi - x_mean)^2\na = y_mean - b * x_mean\n\nFirst, we calculate the values needed for the slope (b):\n\n(xi - x_mean) = (-4.5, -3.5, -2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5)\n(yi - y_mean) = (-18.7, -14.7, -11.7, -7.7, -3.7, 1.3, 6.3, 11.3, 16.3, 21.3)\n\nNow, we find the products of (xi - x_mean) and (yi - y_mean):\n\n(-4.5 * -18.7, -3.5 * -14.7, -2.5 * -11.7, -1.5 * -7.7, -0.5 * -3.7, 0.5 * 1.3, 1.5 * 6.3, 2.5 * 11.3, 3.5 * 16.3, 4.5 * 21.3) = (84.15, 51.45, 29.25, 11.55, 1.85, 0.65, 9.45, 28.25, 57.05, 95.85)\n\nSum of these products: Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] = 369.5\n\nNow, we find the square of (xi - x_mean):\n\n(-4.5^2, -3.5^2, -2.5^2, -1.5^2, -0.5^2, 0.5^2, 1.5^2, 2.5^2, 3.5^2, 4.5^2) = (20.25, 12.25, 6.25, 2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, 6.25, 12.25, 20.25)\n\nSum of these squares: Σ(xi - x_mean)^2 = 82.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b):\n\nb = 369.5 / 82.5 = 4.48\n\nNext, we calculate the y-intercept (a):\n\na = y_mean - b * x_mean = 53.7 - 4.48 * 12.5 = 53.7 - 56 = -2.3\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line is:\n\ny = 4.48x - 2.3\n\nNow, we can predict the salary for someone with 14 years of education:\n\ny = 4.48 * 14 - 2.3 = 60.58\n\nThe predicted salary for someone with 14 years of education is approximately $60.58 (in thousands)."
