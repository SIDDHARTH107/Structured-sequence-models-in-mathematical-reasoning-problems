    "message_1": "A ladder that leans against a wall forms a 60-degree angle with the ground. If the ladder is 12 feet long, how far is the base of the ladder from the wall?",
    "message_2": "We can use the trigonometric function cosine to solve this problem. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse. In this case, the angle is 60 degrees, the adjacent side is the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall (which we'll call x), and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder (12 feet).\n\ncos(60) = x / 12\n\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is equal to 1/2:\n\n(1/2) = x / 12\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 12:\n\nx = 12 * (1/2)\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the base of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall."
