    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 + y^3$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\nf_x(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2\n$$\n\n$$\nf_y(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy + 3y^2\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$\nf_x(x, y) = 0 \\Rightarrow 3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y^2\n$$\n\n$$\nf_y(x, y) = 0 \\Rightarrow -6xy + 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y(2x - y) = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) $y = 0$: In this case, from the first equation, we have $x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$. So, we have a critical point at $(0, 0)$.\n\n2) $y = 2x$: In this case, substituting into the first equation, we have $x^2 = (2x)^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 4x^2 \\Rightarrow 3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$. So, we have a critical point at $(0, 0)$, which we already found.\n\nThus, there is only one critical point at $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, to classify this critical point, we need to find the second partial derivatives and compute the Hessian determinant:\n\n$$\nf_{xx}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{yy}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -6x + 6y\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{xy}(x, y) = f_{yx}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -6y\n$$\n\nAt the critical point $(0, 0)$, we have:\n\n$$\nf_{xx}(0, 0) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{yy}(0, 0) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nf_{xy}(0, 0) = 0\n$$\n\nThe Hessian determinant is given by:\n\n$$\nD(x, y) = f_{xx}(x, y) f_{yy}(x, y) - f_{xy}(x, y)^2\n$$\n\nAt the critical point $(0, 0)$, we have:\n\n$$\nD(0, 0) = 0 * 0 - 0^2 = 0\n$$\n\nSince the Hessian determinant is equal to zero, we cannot classify the critical point $(0, 0)$ as a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point using the second derivative test."
