    "message_1": "A group of 10 people are participating in a Public Goods Game. Each person can choose to contribute any amount between 0 and 10 dollars towards a public good. The total contributions will be multiplied by 1.5, and then evenly distributed among all the participants, regardless of whether or not they contributed. If everyone contributes the maximum amount of 10 dollars, each participant will receive $15. However, if someone decides not to contribute anything, they will still receive a share of the total contributions.\n\nIf player A contributes $8 and everyone else contributes the maximum amount, what will be the final payout for player A?",
    "message_2": "If player A contributes $8 and everyone else contributes the maximum amount of $10, the total contributions will be:\n\n8 (from player A) + 9 * 10 (from the other 9 players) = 8 + 90 = 98 dollars.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the total contributions by 1.5:\n\n98 * 1.5 = 147 dollars.\n\nFinally, we need to evenly distribute the 147 dollars among all 10 participants:\n\n147 / 10 = 14.7 dollars.\n\nSo, the final payout for player A will be $14.7."
