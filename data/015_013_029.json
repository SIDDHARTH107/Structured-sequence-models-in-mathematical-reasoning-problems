    "message_2": "The logistic equation is given by:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K/P0 - 1) * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate parameter, and t is the number of generations.\n\nIn this problem, we have K = 5000, P0 = 100, r = 3.6, and t = 10. Plugging these values into the logistic equation, we get:\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + (5000/100 - 1) * e^(-3.6*10))\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + (50 - 1) * e^(-36))\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 49 * e^(-36))\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of e^(-36) and then solve for P(10).\n\ne^(-36) ≈ 1.9388 × 10^(-16)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 49 * 1.9388 × 10^(-16))\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 9.5003 × 10^(-15))\n\nP(10) = 5000 / 1.0000000000095003\n\nP(10) ≈ 4999.99\n\nSo, the population after 10 generations is approximately 4999.99, correct to two decimal places."
