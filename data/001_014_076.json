    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(27), we need to find the prime factors of 27 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n27 can be factored as 3 × 3 × 3, which is 3^3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the radical expression as √(3^3). Since there are three factors of 3, we can take one factor out of the square root:\n\n√(3^3) = 3√(3^2) = 3√(9)\n\nThe simplest radical form of √(27) is 3√(3)."
