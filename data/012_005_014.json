    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. Since we don't have the specific graph, we can only find an upper bound for the diameter.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum number of edges required to connect all 8 vertices. This can be achieved by creating a tree with 7 edges (n-1 edges for n vertices). In this case, the diameter of the tree would be at most 7 (a straight line of 8 vertices).\n\nNow, we have 3 additional edges to add to the graph. Adding these edges will only decrease the diameter, as they will create shortcuts between vertices. Therefore, the diameter of the graph G with 8 vertices and 10 edges will be at most 7, but it could be smaller depending on the specific connections between vertices."
