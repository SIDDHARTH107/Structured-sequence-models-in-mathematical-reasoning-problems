    "message_1": "Suppose we consider a Morse-Smale complex on a closed surface with seven critical points, where four of them are saddles and the other three are local minima. If the indices of the minima are $1$, $2$, and $3$, and the indices of the saddles are $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively, then what is the Euler characteristic of this Morse-Smale complex?",
    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex, we use the Morse inequalities. The Euler characteristic is given by the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index:\n\nχ = (# of index 0 critical points) - (# of index 1 critical points) + (# of index 2 critical points) - (# of index 3 critical points)\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following critical points:\n\n- 1 saddle of index 0\n- 1 saddle and 1 minimum of index 1\n- 1 saddle and 1 minimum of index 2\n- 1 saddle and 1 minimum of index 3\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = (1) - (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) - (1 + 1) = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 = -1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this Morse-Smale complex is -1."
