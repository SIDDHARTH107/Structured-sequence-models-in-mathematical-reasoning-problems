    "message_2": "Using the power rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), we can find the derivative of the given function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 1.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), can be found by differentiating each term of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^4)/dx - d(2x^3)/dx + d(5x^2)/dx - d(7x)/dx + d(1)/dx\n\nNow, applying the power rule to each term:\n\nf'(x) = (4)(3)x^(4-1) - (3)(2)x^(3-1) + (2)(5)x^(2-1) - (1)(7)x^(1-1) + 0\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 1 is f'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7."
