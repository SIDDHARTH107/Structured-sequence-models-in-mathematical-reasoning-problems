    "message_2": "First, we will prove that the number of critical points of index $m$ is less than or equal to the $m$-th Betti number of the surface $S$. \n\nRecall that the $m$-th Betti number $b_m$ of a topological space is the rank of its $m$-th homology group. For a compact, connected, and orientable surface $S$ with genus $g$ and $n$ boundary components, the Betti numbers are given by $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2g + n - 1$, and $b_m = 0$ for $m \\geq 2$. \n\nBy Morse theory, we know that the Morse inequalities hold for the Morse function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we have\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i \\text{number of critical points of index } i \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i b_i.$$\n\nSince $b_m = 0$ for $m \\geq 2$, we can rewrite the inequality as\n$$\\text{number of critical points of index } m \\leq b_m - \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (-1)^i \\text{number of critical points of index } i.$$\n\nFor $m \\geq 1$, the right-hand side is non-negative, so the inequality holds.\n\nNow, consider the surface $S$ of genus $2$ with $3$ boundary components. The Betti numbers for this surface are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2(2) + 3 - 1 = 6$, and $b_m = 0$ for $m \\geq 2$. \n\nSuppose $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Morse function with exactly $6$ critical points which are all non-degenerate. Let $p$ and $q$ be the two critical points of $f$ which are connected by a gradient path passing through all other critical points. We want to find the maximum possible value of the sum of indices of $p$ and $q$. \n\nSince there are $6$ critical points and the Morse function is non-degenerate, we know that there must be at least one critical point of each index from $0$ to $5$. Let $p_i$ denote the critical point of index $i$. Then the gradient path connecting $p$ and $q$ must pass through $p_0$, $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $p_4$ in some order. \n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the gradient path starts at $p$ and ends at $q$. Then the sum of indices of $p$ and $q$ is at most the sum of indices of $p_1$ and $p_4$, which is $1 + 4 = 5$. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of the sum of indices of the two critical points of $f$ which are connected by a gradient path passing through all other critical points is $5$."
