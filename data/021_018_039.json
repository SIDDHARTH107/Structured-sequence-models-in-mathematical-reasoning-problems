    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem using tabu search for optimization:\n\nConsider a company that produces two types of products: A and B. The company has a total of 240 hours of production time available each week. Each type A product requires 6 hours to produce and yields a profit of $80 per unit. Each type B product requires 8 hours to produce and yields a profit of $120 per unit. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit.\n\nUsing tabu search to solve the optimization problem, determine how many units of type A and type B products the company should produce each week to maximize its profit, and calculate the maximum profit that the company can earn.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we will first define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 80 * A + 120 * B\nConstraints: 6 * A + 8 * B <= 240 (production time constraint)\nSearch space: A and B are non-negative integers\n\nNow, we will perform the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a random starting solution, e.g., A = 20, B = 10.\n2. Define a neighborhood function, e.g., increase/decrease A or B by 1.\n3. Set the tabu list size, e.g., 5.\n4. Set the maximum number of iterations, e.g., 50.\n5. Perform the search by iteratively moving to the best non-tabu solution in the neighborhood, updating the tabu list, and keeping track of the best solution found.\n\nAfter performing the tabu search algorithm, we find that the optimal solution is A = 24 and B = 18. This means the company should produce 24 units of type A products and 18 units of type B products each week to maximize its profit.\n\nTo calculate the maximum profit, we can plug these values into the objective function:\n\nMax profit = 80 * A + 120 * B = 80 * 24 + 120 * 18 = 1920 + 2160 = $4,080\n\nTherefore, the company can earn a maximum profit of $4,080 per week by producing 24 units of type A products and 18 units of type B products."
