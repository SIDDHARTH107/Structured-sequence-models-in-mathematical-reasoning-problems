    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangular garden, we simply need to add the lengths of all three sides. In this case, we don't actually need to use trigonometry, as the problem can be solved using basic arithmetic.\n\nPerimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3\nPerimeter = 8m + 10m + 12m\nPerimeter = 30m\n\nThe perimeter of the triangular garden is 30 meters."
