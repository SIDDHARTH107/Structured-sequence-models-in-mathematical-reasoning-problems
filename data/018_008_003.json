    "message_2": "The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Similarly, the Cartesian product B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nWe can see that A x B and B x A are not equal because the ordered pairs in each set are different. In A x B, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set A, while in B x A, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set B."
