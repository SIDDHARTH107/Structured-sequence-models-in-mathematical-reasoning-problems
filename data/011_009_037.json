    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of different ways to partition a set with n elements.\n\nFor a set with 7 distinct elements, we want to find the Bell number B(7). The Bell numbers can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£[k=0 to n-1] C(n-1, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can compute the Bell numbers for n = 1 to 7:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\nB(7) = 877\n\nSo there are 877 ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into non-empty subsets if the order of the subsets does not matter."
