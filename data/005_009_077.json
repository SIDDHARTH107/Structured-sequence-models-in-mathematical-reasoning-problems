    "message_2": "To find the median of the given set of data, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order:\n\n12, 22, 23, 23, 34, 43, 44, 45, 56, 63, 65, 67, 78, 89\n\nSince there are 14 numbers in the dataset (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle numbers. The two middle numbers are 43 and 44.\n\nThe median is (43 + 44) / 2 = 87 / 2 = 43.5."
