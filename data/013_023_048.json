    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, Player 1 starts with $10 and can choose to send any amount between $0 and $10 to Player 2. The amount sent is tripled, and Player 2 decides how much to return to Player 1 from the tripled amount. For example, if Player 1 sends $4, then Player 2 receives $12 and can choose to return any amount between $0 and $12 to Player 1. If Player 2 keeps the entire tripled amount, then Player 1 receives nothing in return. What amount should Player 1 send to maximize their payoff if they believe that Player 2 will return at least half of the tripled amount?",
    "message_2": "If Player 1 believes that Player 2 will return at least half of the tripled amount, then Player 1 should send the entire $10 to maximize their payoff. \n\nHere's why:\n\nIf Player 1 sends $10, the amount is tripled, and Player 2 receives $30. If Player 2 returns at least half of the $30, which is $15, then Player 1 will have a total of $15, which is more than their initial $10.\n\nIn this scenario, sending the entire $10 maximizes Player 1's payoff, as they will receive at least $15 in return, which is greater than any other possible outcome."
