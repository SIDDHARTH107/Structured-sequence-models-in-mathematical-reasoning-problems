    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^3 + 5)^4 using the chain rule, we need to differentiate the outer function and then multiply it by the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's denote the inner function as g(x) = 2x^3 + 5. Then, f(x) = (g(x))^4.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function, which is f'(x) = 4(g(x))^3. \n\nNext, we find the derivative of the inner function, which is g'(x) = d(2x^3 + 5)/dx = 6x^2.\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule: f'(x) = 4(g(x))^3 * g'(x).\n\nSubstitute g(x) and g'(x) back into the equation:\n\nf'(x) = 4(2x^3 + 5)^3 * 6x^2.\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 1:\n\nf'(1) = 4(2(1)^3 + 5)^3 * 6(1)^2\nf'(1) = 4(2 + 5)^3 * 6\nf'(1) = 4(7)^3 * 6\nf'(1) = 4(343) * 6\nf'(1) = 1372 * 6\nf'(1) = 8232\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (2x^3 + 5)^4 at x = 1 is 8232."
