    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 using variational optimization, we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by taking the first derivative of the function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 4x + 5)\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, we set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the critical point x = 2, we need to determine if this point corresponds to a minimum or maximum value of the function. We do this by analyzing the second derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^2 - 4x + 5)\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive (f''(x) = 2 > 0), the critical point x = 2 corresponds to a minimum value of the function.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging the critical point x = 2 back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 5\nf(2) = 4 - 8 + 5\nf(2) = 1\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 is 1."
