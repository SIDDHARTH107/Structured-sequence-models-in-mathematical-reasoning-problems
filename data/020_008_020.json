The following table shows the quantity of resources needed for each product and the cost per unit of each resource:\n\n| Product | Resource X | Resource Y | Resource Z |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 5 units   | 3 units   | 2 units   |\n| B       | 1 unit   | 4 units   | 7 units   |\n| C       | 2 units   | 6 units   | 3 units   |\n| Cost per unit | $4 | $6 | $5 |\n\nIf the factory can purchase at most 60 units of resource X, 50 units of resource Y, and 40 units of resource Z, what is the optimal production plan to maximize profit if product A sells for $10 per unit, product B for $15 per unit, and product C for $20 per unit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we first need to calculate the profit per unit for each product. We do this by subtracting the total cost of resources needed for each product from the selling price.\n\nProfit per unit of product A:\nSelling price: $10\nCost: (5 units * $4) + (3 units * $6) + (2 units * $5) = $20 + $18 + $10 = $48\nProfit: $10 - $48 = -$38\n\nProfit per unit of product B:\nSelling price: $15\nCost: (1 unit * $4) + (4 units * $6) + (7 units * $5) = $4 + $24 + $35 = $63\nProfit: $15 - $63 = -$48\n\nProfit per unit of product C:\nSelling price: $20\nCost: (2 units * $4) + (6 units * $6) + (3 units * $5) = $8 + $36 + $15 = $59\nProfit: $20 - $59 = -$39\n\nSince all products have a negative profit per unit, it is not profitable to produce any of the products under the given conditions. The optimal production plan would be to not produce any units of products A, B, or C."
