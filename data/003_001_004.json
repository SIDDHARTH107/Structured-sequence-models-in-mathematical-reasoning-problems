    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. We know that c = 10 cm and one of the other sides, let's say a, is 6 cm. We need to find the length of the third side, b. Plugging in the known values, we get:\n\n10² = 6² + b²\n100 = 36 + b²\n\nNow, we can solve for b²:\n\nb² = 100 - 36\nb² = 64\n\nFinally, we find the length of the third side, b, by taking the square root of 64:\n\nb = √64\nb = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 8 cm."
