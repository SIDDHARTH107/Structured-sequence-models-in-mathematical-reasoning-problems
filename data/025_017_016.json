    "message_2": "To find the minimal resolution of singularities on the algebraic variety given by the equation $y^2z - x^3 + xz^2 = 0$, we first need to find the singular points of the variety. We do this by computing the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and setting them equal to zero.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + z^2 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2yz = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = y^2 + 2xz = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) $y = 0$. In this case, from the third equation, we get $z = 0$. Substituting these values into the first equation, we get $x = 0$. So, one singular point is $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\n2) $z = 0$. In this case, from the first equation, we get $x = 0$. Substituting these values into the third equation, we get $y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, the singular point is again $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we perform a blow-up at the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$. We introduce new coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ such that:\n\n$x = x_1z_1 = x_2y_2$\n\n$y = y_1z_1 = y_2z_2$\n\n$z = z_1y_2 = z_2x_2$\n\nThe equation of the variety in the new coordinates is:\n\n$y_1^2z_1^3 - x_1^3z_1^3 + x_1z_1^5 = 0$\n\n$y_2^2z_2^3 - x_2^3z_2^3 + x_2z_2^5 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the singular points in the new coordinates. We compute the partial derivatives and set them equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = -3x_1^2z_1^3 + z_1^5 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_1} = 2y_1z_1^3 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1} = 5x_1z_1^4 - 3x_1^3z_1^2 + 6y_1^2z_1^2 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = -3x_2^2z_2^3 + z_2^5 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_2} = 2y_2z_2^3 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_2} = 5x_2z_2^4 - 3x_2^3z_2^2 + 6y_2^2z_2^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second and fifth equations, we have two cases:\n\n1) $y_1 = 0$. In this case, from the third equation, we get $z_1 = 0$. So, one singular point is $(x_1, 0, 0)$.\n\n2) $y_2 = 0$. In this case, from the sixth equation, we get $z_2 = 0$. So, one singular point is $(x_2, 0, 0)$.\n\nHowever, these singular points are not in the exceptional divisor of the blow-up, so they do not correspond to singular points on the original variety. Therefore, the minimal resolution of singularities on the algebraic variety given by the equation $y^2z - x^3 + xz^2 = 0$ is obtained by performing a single blow-up at the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$."
