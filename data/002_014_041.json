    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. Find its surface area in square centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 10 cm x 6 cm = 60 square centimeters\n2. Length x Height: 10 cm x 4 cm = 40 square centimeters\n3. Width x Height: 6 cm x 4 cm = 24 square centimeters\n\nNow, we add the areas of each type of face together, remembering that there are 2 of each type:\n\n(2 x 60) + (2 x 40) + (2 x 24) = 120 + 80 + 48 = 248 square centimeters\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 248 square centimeters."
