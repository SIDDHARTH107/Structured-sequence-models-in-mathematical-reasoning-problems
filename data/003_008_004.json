    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine function. First, we need to find one of the angles of the triangle. Let's call the base angle A and the other angle B. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n8^2 + 12^2 = c^2\n64 + 144 = c^2\n208 = c^2\nc = √208 ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow we have all three sides of the triangle: a = 8 cm, b = 12 cm, and c ≈ 14.42 cm.\n\nNext, we can use the sine function to find the angle A. We can use the sine formula:\n\nsin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse\nsin(A) = a/c\nsin(A) = 8/14.42\nA = arcsin(8/14.42) ≈ 34.07°\n\nNow we can use the area formula for a triangle using trigonometry:\n\nArea = (1/2)ab * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the sides of the triangle and C is the angle between them. In our case, a = 8 cm, b = 12 cm, and C = 180° - 90° - 34.07° = 55.93°.\n\nArea = (1/2)(8)(12) * sin(55.93°)\nArea ≈ 48 * 0.833\nArea ≈ 39.984 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 39.984 cm²."
