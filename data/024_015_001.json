    "message_2": "First, let's compute the exterior derivative of the given differential form $ω$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 2-form is a 3-form. We have:\n\n$dω = d(x\\, dy \\wedge dz + y\\, dz \\wedge dx + z\\, dx \\wedge dy)$.\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivative of each term:\n\n$d(x\\, dy \\wedge dz) = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$,\n\n$d(y\\, dz \\wedge dx) = dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$,\n\n$d(z\\, dx \\wedge dy) = dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$dω = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$.\n\nNow, we need to restrict this 3-form to the 2-dimensional manifold $M$ defined by $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. To do this, we can use the fact that the exterior derivative of a function is the gradient of that function. Let $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1$. Then, $M$ is the level set of $f$ where $f(x, y, z) = 0$. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$∇f = (\\frac{∂f}{∂x}, \\frac{∂f}{∂y}, \\frac{∂f}{∂z}) = (2x, 2y, 2z)$.\n\nNow, we can restrict $dω$ to $M$ by taking the interior product of $dω$ with the gradient of $f$:\n\n$(∇f) \\lrcorner\\, dω = (2x, 2y, 2z) \\lrcorner\\, (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy)$.\n\nComputing the interior product, we get:\n\n$(∇f) \\lrcorner\\, dω = 2x(dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) + 2y(dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx) + 2z(dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy)$.\n\nSince the interior product of a vector with a 3-form is a 2-form, we can see that the result is zero:\n\n$(∇f) \\lrcorner\\, dω = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of the form $ω$ on the manifold $M$ is zero:\n\n$dω |_M = 0$."
