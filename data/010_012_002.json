Suppose that f: M -> N is a smooth map. \n\nConsider the subset S = {x ∈ M | df_x is not surjective}. Prove that S is a closed subset of M. Moreover, show that if S is non-empty, then it has measure zero with respect to the volume form of M.",
    "message_2": "To prove that S is a closed subset of M, we will show that its complement, M \\ S, is an open subset of M.\n\nLet x ∈ M \\ S, which means that df_x is surjective. Since N is connected, we can apply the Constant Rank Theorem. The theorem states that there exist local coordinates around x in M and around f(x) in N such that the differential df_x is represented by a surjective linear map. In these local coordinates, the map f can be written as (x_1, ..., x_m) ↦ (x_1, ..., x_n, 0, ..., 0), where m = dim(M) and n = dim(N).\n\nNow, consider a small open neighborhood U of x in M such that f(U) is contained in the coordinate neighborhood of f(x) in N. For any point y ∈ U, the differential df_y is also surjective, as it can be represented by the same surjective linear map in the local coordinates. Therefore, U ⊆ M \\ S, and M \\ S is open.\n\nSince M \\ S is open, its complement S is a closed subset of M.\n\nNow, let's show that if S is non-empty, then it has measure zero with respect to the volume form of M. Since df_x is not surjective for x ∈ S, the rank of df_x is less than n. By Sard's theorem, the set of critical values of f, which is the image of S under f, has measure zero in N. \n\nLet V be a coordinate neighborhood of a point in N, and let W = f^(-1)(V) be its preimage in M. Since f is smooth, it is locally Lipschitz, and thus the preimage W is a compact subset of M. We can cover W with finitely many coordinate charts (U_i, φ_i) of M, where i = 1, ..., k.\n\nNow, consider the restriction of f to each U_i, denoted by f_i = f|U_i. The set of critical points of f_i is S ∩ U_i. Since the critical values of f_i have measure zero in N, we can apply the Preimage Theorem for Lipschitz maps, which states that the preimage of a set of measure zero under a Lipschitz map also has measure zero. Therefore, the set S ∩ U_i has measure zero in M with respect to the volume form of M.\n\nSince S is the union of the sets S ∩ U_i for i = 1, ..., k, and each of these sets has measure zero, their union S also has measure zero in M."
