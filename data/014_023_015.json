    "message_1": "Suppose the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted using a Rail fence cipher with 3 rails. What is the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "A Rail fence cipher with 3 rails arranges the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows. For the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\", the arrangement would look like this:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A H M T I T\n  T   C\n\nNow, we read the letters row by row to get the ciphertext. The resulting ciphertext is \"MEASAHMTITTC\"."
