    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series of f(z) = exp(z) / (z-1) centered at z=2, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-2) and then expand it using the Taylor series for exp(z) and geometric series for 1/(z-1).\n\nLet w = z - 2, then z = w + 2. Now, rewrite f(z) in terms of w:\n\nf(w) = exp(w + 2) / (w + 1)\n\nNow, we expand exp(w + 2) using the Taylor series:\n\nexp(w + 2) = exp(2) * exp(w) = exp(2) * (1 + w + w^2/2! + w^3/3! + ...)\n\nNext, we expand 1/(w + 1) using the geometric series:\n\n1/(w + 1) = 1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...\n\nNow, we multiply the two series together:\n\nf(w) = exp(2) * (1 + w + w^2/2! + w^3/3! + ...) * (1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...)\n\nTo find the Laurent series, we multiply the terms and collect the coefficients of each power of w:\n\nf(w) = exp(2) * (1 - w + 2w + w^2/2! - 2w^2 + 2w^3 + w^3/3! - 2w^4 + ...)\n\nf(w) = exp(2) * (1 + w + (1/2! - 2)w^2 + (2 + 1/3!)w^3 - 2w^4 + ...)\n\nNow, we substitute z back in place of w:\n\nf(z) = exp(2) * (1 + (z-2) + (1/2! - 2)(z-2)^2 + (2 + 1/3!)(z-2)^3 - 2(z-2)^4 + ...)\n\nThis is the Laurent series of f(z) centered at z=2.\n\nTo determine the convergence of the series, we need to find the region where the geometric series converges. The geometric series converges when |w| < 1, which is equivalent to |z-2| < 1. Therefore, the Laurent series converges in the annulus 0 < |z-2| < 1."
