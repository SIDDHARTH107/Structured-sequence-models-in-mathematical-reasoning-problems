    "message_1": "What is the probability of at least one employee getting injured out of a group of 20 employees, given that the probability of any one employee getting injured is 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability concept. Instead of finding the probability of at least one employee getting injured, we will find the probability of none of the employees getting injured and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of one employee not getting injured is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the employees' injuries are independent events, the probability of all 20 employees not getting injured is (0.95)^20.\n\nNow, we will find the probability of at least one employee getting injured by subtracting the probability of none of them getting injured from 1:\n\nP(at least one employee getting injured) = 1 - P(no employees getting injured)\nP(at least one employee getting injured) = 1 - (0.95)^20\n\nNow, calculate the result:\n\nP(at least one employee getting injured) ≈ 1 - 0.3584859224 ≈ 0.6415140776\n\nSo, the probability of at least one employee getting injured out of a group of 20 employees is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
