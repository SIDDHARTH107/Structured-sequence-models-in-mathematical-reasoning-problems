    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of a function over a simple closed curve in the complex plane, we can use the Cauchy-Goursat theorem. The Cauchy-Goursat theorem states that if a function is analytic (i.e., holomorphic) inside and on a simple closed curve C, then the integral of the function over C is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 + 4z - 3 is a polynomial, and polynomials are holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is holomorphic inside and on the circle |z - 1 + i| = 2.\n\nApplying the Cauchy-Goursat theorem, we find that the integral of f(z) over the circle C is zero:\n\nâˆ®[C] (z^2 + 4z - 3) dz = 0"
