    "message_1": "A math student needs to calculate the sectional curvature of a surface with the following parameters: \n\n- Gaussian curvature (K) = 2\n- Maximum curvature (k1) = 4\n- Minimum curvature (k2) = 1\n\nWhat is the sectional curvature of this surface at a point where the tangent plane intersects with a plane that contains two orthogonal unit vectors?",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at a point where the tangent plane intersects with a plane containing two orthogonal unit vectors, we can use the formula for sectional curvature:\n\nSectional curvature (Ks) = (k1 * k2) / (k1^2 * sin^2(θ) + k2^2 * cos^2(θ))\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the principal directions corresponding to the maximum and minimum curvatures (k1 and k2).\n\nSince the plane contains two orthogonal unit vectors, the angle between the principal directions is 90 degrees (π/2 radians). Therefore, sin(θ) = 1 and cos(θ) = 0.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of k1, k2, and θ into the formula:\n\nKs = (4 * 1) / (4^2 * 1^2 + 1^2 * 0^2) = 4 / (16 + 0) = 4 / 16 = 1/4\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface at the given point is 1/4."
