    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence {x_n} converges in X, we need to show that there exists a limit L such that for any ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, d(x_n, L) < ε.\n\nLet's first guess the limit L. As n goes to infinity, 1/n goes to 0. So, we will consider L = 0 as the potential limit.\n\nNow, let ε > 0 be given. We need to find a natural number N such that for all n > N, d(x_n, L) = |x_n - 0| = |1/n| < ε.\n\nSince 1/n > 0 for all n ∈ ℕ, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n1/n < ε\n\nNow, we need to find N such that the inequality holds for all n > N. We can do this by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nn > 1/ε\n\nSince n is a natural number, we can choose N to be the smallest integer greater than 1/ε. That is, N = ⌈1/ε⌉.\n\nNow, for all n > N, we have:\n\nn > ⌈1/ε⌉ ≥ 1/ε\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\n1/n ≤ ε\n\nThus, d(x_n, L) = |1/n| ≤ ε for all n > N.\n\nWe have shown that for any ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, d(x_n, L) < ε. Therefore, the sequence {x_n} converges in X, and its limit is L = 0."
