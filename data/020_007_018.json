    "message_1": "A college offers 6 elective courses for next semester. A student needs to choose 3 of them for credit. How many ways can a student choose their courses?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways a student can choose 3 elective courses out of 6, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of elective courses (6 in this case), k is the number of courses the student needs to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6 × 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 different ways a student can choose 3 elective courses out of the 6 offered."
