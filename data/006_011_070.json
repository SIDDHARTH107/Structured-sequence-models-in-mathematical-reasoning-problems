    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 100 employees working with machines. The probability of an accident occurring on any given day is 0.02. What is the probability that at least two accidents will happen on the same day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two accidents happening on the same day, we can use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability of no accidents and the probability of exactly one accident happening on a given day, and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1.\n\n1. Probability of no accidents:\nThe probability of an employee not having an accident on a given day is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98. Since there are 100 employees, the probability of no accidents occurring on a given day is (0.98)^100.\n\n2. Probability of exactly one accident:\nThere are 100 employees, so there are 100 ways for exactly one employee to have an accident. The probability of one employee having an accident is 0.02, and the probability of the other 99 employees not having an accident is (0.98)^99. Therefore, the probability of exactly one accident happening on a given day is 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99.\n\n3. Probability of at least two accidents:\nNow, we will find the complementary probability by subtracting the sum of the probabilities of no accidents and exactly one accident from 1:\n\nP(at least two accidents) = 1 - P(no accidents) - P(exactly one accident)\nP(at least two accidents) = 1 - (0.98)^100 - [100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99]\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(at least two accidents) ≈ 1 - 0.1326 - 0.2707\nP(at least two accidents) ≈ 0.5967\n\nSo, the probability of at least two accidents happening on the same day is approximately 0.5967 or 59.67%."
