    "message_2": "We are given that $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{2}{5}$, and we want to find the value of $\\cos(\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{2}{5}))$. Since $\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{2}{5})$ is just another way of writing $\\theta$, we are actually looking for the value of $\\cos \\theta$.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$ to find the value of $\\cos \\theta$. We know that $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{2}{5}$, so we can substitute this into the identity:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$\n\n$\\frac{4}{25} + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\cos^2 \\theta$:\n\n$\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\frac{4}{25}$\n\n$\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{21}{25}$\n\nSince $\\theta$ is in the first quadrant, $\\cos \\theta$ will be positive. Therefore, we can take the square root of both sides to find the value of $\\cos \\theta$:\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{21}{25}}$\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}$\n\nSo, the value of $\\cos(\\sin^{-1}(\\frac{2}{5}))$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}$."
