    "message_2": "There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 27.\n\nTo justify this answer, we will use the Sylow theorems and the fact that 27 = 3^3. Let G be a group of order 27. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possible values for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal 3-Sylow subgroup. Then G is a semi-direct product of P by itself, G = P ⋊ P. Since P is an abelian group of order 27, G must be abelian as well. Thus, G is isomorphic to either Z_27 (cyclic group of order 27) or Z_3 × Z_9 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 9).\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, let P_1, P_2, and P_3 be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups is trivial, the union of these subgroups contains 3 * (3^2 - 1) = 24 non-identity elements. Thus, there are only three elements left to form a normal subgroup N of order 3. Since N is normal, G/N is a group of order 9, which must be abelian (either Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3). In either case, G must have a normal subgroup of order 9, say M. Then G is a semi-direct product of M and N, G = M ⋊ N. Since M is abelian, there is only one non-trivial semi-direct product, which corresponds to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three non-isomorphic groups of order 27: Z_27, Z_3 × Z_9, and the non-abelian group of order 27."
