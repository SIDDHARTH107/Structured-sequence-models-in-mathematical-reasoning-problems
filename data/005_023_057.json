    "message_1": "In a dataset of 25 values, the mean is 45 and the standard deviation is 5. Determine if the value 60 is an outlier according to the 3-sigma rule.",
    "message_2": "The 3-sigma rule states that in a normal distribution, approximately 99.7% of the data points lie within three standard deviations of the mean. Any data point that falls outside this range can be considered an outlier.\n\nGiven the mean (μ) is 45 and the standard deviation (σ) is 5, we can calculate the range within which 99.7% of the data points lie:\n\nLower limit: μ - 3σ = 45 - 3(5) = 45 - 15 = 30\nUpper limit: μ + 3σ = 45 + 3(5) = 45 + 15 = 60\n\nAccording to the 3-sigma rule, the value 60 is exactly on the upper limit. It is not considered an outlier, but it is very close to being one."
