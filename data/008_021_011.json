    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system of linear equations.\n\nWe have the following system:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nNotice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. This means that these two equations are not independent, and they represent the same line. In this case, the system has infinitely many solutions, and the matrix is singular.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n3y = 7 - 2x\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nSo, the general solution is given by:\n\nx = x\ny = (7 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe matrix of the system is singular because it does not have a unique solution."
