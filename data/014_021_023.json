    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a Hill Cipher coded message using a key matrix K = [3 1; 4 2], and the blocks of plaintext were converted to numbers modulo 26. If the coded message is \"QNDP\", decode it and find the corresponding plaintext.",
    "message_2": "To decode the Hill Cipher coded message \"QNDP\" with the key matrix K = [3 1; 4 2], we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26.\n\nK = | 3  1 |\n      | 4  2 |\n\nThe determinant of K is det(K) = (3 * 2) - (1 * 4) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of the determinant modulo 26. In other words, we need to find a number x such that (2 * x) % 26 = 1.\n\nWe can see that x = 13 satisfies this condition, as (2 * 13) % 26 = 26 % 26 = 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the adjugate of K:\n\nadj(K) = |  2  -1 |\n              | -4   3 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of K modulo 26 by multiplying the adjugate of K by the modular inverse of the determinant:\n\nK_inv = 13 * adj(K) = | (13 * 2) % 26  (13 * -1) % 26 |\n                             | (13 * -4) % 26  (13 * 3) % 26 |\n\nK_inv = |  1  25 |\n              |  8  13 |\n\nNow that we have the inverse key matrix, we can decode the message \"QNDP\". First, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nQNDP -> 16 13 3 15\n\nWe will now multiply the inverse key matrix by the numerical values of the coded message in blocks of 2:\n\n|  1  25 |  | 16 |   | (1 * 16) + (25 * 13) |   |  0  |\n|  8  13 |  | 13 | = | (8 * 16) + (13 * 13) | = | 17 |\n\n|  1  25 |  |  3 |   | (1 * 3) + (25 * 15) |   |  4  |\n|  8  13 |  | 15 | = | (8 * 3) + (13 * 15) | = |  4 |\n\nNow, we convert the numerical values back to letters:\n\n0 17 4 4 -> A R E E\n\nSo, the decoded plaintext message is \"AREE\"."
