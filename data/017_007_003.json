    "message_2": "To verify this statement, we will first find the two possible group tables for G and then show that they correspond to the group tables for either C6 or D3.\n\nSince G has order 6, it has 6 elements, which we can denote as {e, a, b, c, d, f}. Here, e is the identity element. We will consider two cases for the group structure of G.\n\nCase 1: G is a cyclic group generated by a single element, say a.\nIn this case, the group elements can be written as {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}, and the group operation is simply multiplication of the powers of a. The group table for G in this case is:\n\n```\n   e  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\ne  e  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\na  a a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5   e\na^2 a^3  a^4  a^5   e   a  a^2\na^3 a^4  a^5   e   a  a^2  a^3\na^4 a^5   e   a  a^2  a^3  a^4\na^5  e   a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\n```\n\nThis group table corresponds to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: G is not a cyclic group.\nIn this case, we can assume that no element in G has order 6. Since the order of any element must divide the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem), the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, or 3. The identity element e has order 1, and we can assume that a has order 2 (otherwise, if a has order 3, then G would be cyclic). Therefore, a^2 = e.\n\nNow, let b be an element of order 3. Then, the elements {e, b, b^2} form a subgroup of G. Since a is not in this subgroup, we can consider the product ab. Let's denote ab = c. Note that c cannot be equal to e, a, b, or b^2, as this would imply that a or b are not distinct elements or have different orders than assumed. Therefore, c must be a new element, and we can denote the remaining element in G as d.\n\nNow, let's find the products of these elements:\n\n- (ab)(ab) = a(ba)b, since a^2 = e.\n- (ab)b = a(bb) = a(b^2), since b has order 3.\n- (ab)b^2 = a(b^2b) = a(e) = a, since b has order 3.\n\nNow, we can construct the group table for G:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  b^2  c  d\ne  e  a  b  b^2  c  d\na  a  e  c   d   b b^2\nb  b  d  b^2  e   a  c\nb^2 b^2 c  e   d   a  b\nc  c  b  a  b^2  d  e\nd  d  b^2 a  c   e  b\n```\n\nThis group table corresponds to the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the two possible group tables for G, and they correspond to the group tables for either C6 or D3. Therefore, if G is not isomorphic to the cyclic group C6, then it must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D3."
