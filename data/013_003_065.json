    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A proposes a division of $100 between themselves and Player B. If Player B accepts, the money is divided as proposed, but if Player B rejects the proposal, both players get nothing.\nIf Player A proposes to keep 80 dollars for themselves and offer 20 dollars to Player B, what is the minimum amount of money that Player B would likely accept to avoid getting nothing?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount of money that Player B would likely accept to avoid getting nothing depends on their individual preferences and rationality. In a purely rational scenario, Player B would accept any amount greater than $0, as it is better than getting nothing. However, in reality, people tend to have fairness concerns and may reject offers that they perceive as too low or unfair.\n\nThere is no specific minimum amount that can be universally applied to all Player B's, as it depends on their individual preferences and perceptions of fairness. However, it is generally observed that offers below 20-30% of the total amount are more likely to be rejected. In this case, since Player A is offering $20 (20% of $100), it is possible that some Player B's would accept this offer, while others may reject it as unfair."
