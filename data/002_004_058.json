    "message_1": "A rectangular field has a length of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. What is the perimeter of the field in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length L is 25 meters and the width W is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(25 + 10)\nP = 2(35)\nP = 70\n\nSo the perimeter of the field is 70 meters."
