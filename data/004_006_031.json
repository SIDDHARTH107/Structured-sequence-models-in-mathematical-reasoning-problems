    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find the first derivative of the function, which will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x where the first derivative is equal to zero or undefined, as these are the critical points of the function.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first factor out a common factor of 3:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x:\n\nx = 3 and x = 1\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 are x = 1 and x = 3."
