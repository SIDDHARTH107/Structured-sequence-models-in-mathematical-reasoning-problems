    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic models of the given sentence, we need to analyze the structure of the models that satisfy the sentence.\n\nThe sentence states that for every element x in the model, there exists an element y such that x < y, and both x and y satisfy the unary relation P. This implies that there must be an infinite number of elements in the model that satisfy P, as for every element x, there must be a greater element y that also satisfies P.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible models:\n\n1. A model where all elements satisfy P: In this case, the sentence is satisfied, as for every element x, there exists a greater element y, and both x and y satisfy P. There is only one such model up to isomorphism.\n\n2. A model where some elements satisfy P and some do not: In this case, we can have models with different cardinalities of elements that satisfy P. However, since the sentence requires an infinite number of elements that satisfy P, the cardinality of the set of elements that satisfy P must be infinite. There are two possibilities for the cardinality of the set of elements that do not satisfy P: finite or infinite. Thus, there are two non-isomorphic models in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 = 3 non-isomorphic models of the given sentence."
