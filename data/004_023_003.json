    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we first need to find the points where the curves intersect. We can do this by setting y = x^2 - 3x + 2 equal to y = -x^2 + x + 6:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = -x^2 + x + 6\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n2x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 2 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -2:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(12)) / 2\nx = 1 ± √3\n\nNow we have the two intersection points, x = 1 - √3 and x = 1 + √3. Since we are only interested in the interval [0, 2], we can ignore the point x = 1 - √3, as it is not in the interval.\n\nNow we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. We will integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(y1 - y2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nArea = ∫((-x^2 + x + 6) - (x^2 - 3x + 2)) dx from 0 to 2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nArea = ∫(-2x^2 + 4x + 4) dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow integrate:\n\nArea = [-2(x^3/3) + 4(x^2/2) + 4x] from 0 to 2\n\nEvaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\nArea = [-2(2^3/3) + 4(2^2/2) + 4(2)] - [-2(0^3/3) + 4(0^2/2) + 4(0)]\n\nArea = [-16/3 + 8 + 8] - [0]\n\nArea = (8/3) + 8\n\nArea = 32/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 - 3x + 2 and y = -x^2 + x + 6 over the interval [0, 2] is 32/3 square units."
