    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. We are looking for the smallest Sophie Germain prime that can be written as the difference of two non-zero perfect squares, i.e., p = a^2 - b^2, where a and b are integers.\n\nUsing the difference of squares factorization, we can rewrite p as:\n\np = (a + b)(a - b)\n\nSince p is prime, either (a + b) = p and (a - b) = 1, or (a + b) = 1 and (a - b) = p. The second case is not possible since a and b are non-negative integers. So, we have:\n\na + b = p\na - b = 1\n\nSolving for a and b, we get:\n\na = (p + 1)/2\nb = (p - 1)/2\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest Sophie Germain prime that satisfies this condition. The first few Sophie Germain primes are 2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, 113, ... (sequence A005384 in the OEIS).\n\nLet's try these primes:\n\n1. p = 2: a = (2 + 1)/2 = 1.5, b = (2 - 1)/2 = 0.5 (not integers)\n2. p = 3: a = (3 + 1)/2 = 2, b = (3 - 1)/2 = 1 (works)\n\nSo, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that can be written as the difference of two non-zero perfect squares is 3, as 3 = 2^2 - 1^2."
