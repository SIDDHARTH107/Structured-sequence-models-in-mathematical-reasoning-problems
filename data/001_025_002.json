    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2z^2 + 4z + 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\n\nz = (-4 ± √(16 - 24)) / 4\n\nz = (-4 ± √(-8)) / 4\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, we will have complex solutions. We can rewrite √(-8) as 2i√2, where i is the imaginary unit. Now, the equation becomes:\n\nz = (-4 ± 2i√2) / 4\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nz = (2(-2 ± i√2)) / 4\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\nz = (-2 ± i√2) / 2\n\nSo, the two complex solutions for the given equation are:\n\nz1 = (-2 + i√2) / 2\nz2 = (-2 - i√2) / 2"
