If $f(z)$ has exactly one pole of order two in the complex plane, what is its residue at this pole?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the pole of order two as $z_0$. Since $f(z)$ has a pole of order two at $z_0$, we can write $f(z)$ in the following form near $z_0$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{A}{(z - z_0)^2} + \\frac{B}{z - z_0} + g(z),$$\n\nwhere $A, B \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and $g(z)$ is analytic near $z_0$. The residue of $f(z)$ at $z_0$ is the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{z - z_0}$ term, which is $B$.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = (z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)f(z)$. Since $f(z)$ has simple poles at $z = 1, 2, 3$, and a pole of order two at $z_0$, the function $h(z)$ is analytic everywhere except at $z_0$. Moreover, $h(z)$ has a simple pole at $z_0$ with residue:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(h, z_0) = (z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3)B.$$\n\nBy the residue theorem, the sum of residues of $h(z)$ is equal to zero. Since $h(z)$ is analytic everywhere except at $z_0$, we have:\n\n$$(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3)B + a_1(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3) + a_2(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 3) + a_3(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2) = 0.$$\n\nSolving for $B$, we get:\n\n$$B = \\frac{-a_1(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3) - a_2(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 3) - a_3(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2)}{(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3)}.$$\n\nThus, the residue of $f(z)$ at its pole of order two is:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f, z_0) = B = \\frac{-a_1(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3) - a_2(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 3) - a_3(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2)}{(z_0 - 1)(z_0 - 2)(z_0 - 3)}.$$"
