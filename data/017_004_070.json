    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 121. Since 121 = 11^2, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 11-subgroup P of G. The number of Sylow 11-subgroups of G is given by n_11 ≡ 1 (mod 11) and n_11 divides 121/11 = 11. Thus, n_11 can be either 1 or 11.\n\nCase 1: n_11 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 11-subgroup, which is P. Since P is the unique Sylow 11-subgroup, it is normal in G. Since |P| = 11^2 = |G|, we have P = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 121, as it is generated by any element of order 121 in P.\n\nCase 2: n_11 = 11\nIn this case, there are 11 Sylow 11-subgroups. Let P and Q be two distinct Sylow 11-subgroups. Since the order of P and Q is 11, which is prime, both P and Q are cyclic. Let x be a generator of P and y be a generator of Q. Then, |x| = 11 and |y| = 11.\n\nNow, consider the element xy in G. Since P and Q are distinct, they intersect trivially, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, the order of xy cannot be 1, as that would imply xy = e, and x and y would not generate distinct subgroups.\n\nWe claim that the order of xy is 121. Suppose, for contradiction, that the order of xy is less than 121. Then, the order of xy must divide 121, which implies that the order of xy is either 1, 11, or 121. We have already ruled out the case where the order of xy is 1. If the order of xy is 11, then xy belongs to a Sylow 11-subgroup, say P. But this would mean that y = x^{-1}(xy) belongs to P, which contradicts the fact that P and Q are distinct Sylow 11-subgroups. Thus, the order of xy must be 121.\n\nSince the order of xy is 121, G is generated by the element xy, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups generated by x and y, i.e., G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 11.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 11."
