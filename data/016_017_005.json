    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal curve that can be constructed through a recursive process. Each iteration or order of the curve doubles the length of the previous order. The initial curve (order 0) is a straight line segment with a length of 1 unit.\n\nTo find the total length of the Heighway dragon curve of order 10, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (2 ^ Order)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and the order is 10.\n\nLength = 1 * (2 ^ 10) = 1 * 1024 = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve of order 10 is 1024 units."
