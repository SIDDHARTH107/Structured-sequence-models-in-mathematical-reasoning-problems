    "message_2": "To find the order of the point $P$ in the group of points on $E$ modulo torsion, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity and $nP$ denotes the sum of the point $P$ added to itself $n$ times.\n\nWe will use the point doubling and point addition formulas for elliptic curves. For an elliptic curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, the point doubling formula is:\n\n$P + P = (x_3, y_3)$, where\n$x_3 = \\frac{(3x_1^2 + A)^2}{4y_1^2} - 2x_1$\n$y_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 + A}{2y_1}(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n\nAnd the point addition formula for $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ is:\n\n$P_1 + P_2 = (x_3, y_3)$, where\n$x_3 = \\frac{(y_2 - y_1)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2} - x_1 - x_2$\n$y_3 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n\nNow, let's compute the multiples of $P = (0, 1)$ on the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7$.\n\n1. $2P = P + P$:\n$x_3 = \\frac{(3(0)^2 - 5)^2}{4(1)^2} - 2(0) = \\frac{25}{4}$\n$y_3 = \\frac{3(0)^2 - 5}{2(1)}(0 - \\frac{25}{4}) - 1 = -\\frac{15}{4}$\nSo, $2P = (\\frac{25}{4}, -\\frac{15}{4})$.\n\n2. $3P = 2P + P$:\n$x_3 = \\frac{(-\\frac{15}{4} - 1)^2}{(\\frac{25}{4} - 0)^2} - \\frac{25}{4} - 0 = \\frac{9}{25}$\n$y_3 = \\frac{-\\frac{15}{4} - 1}{\\frac{25}{4} - 0}(\\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{9}{25}) - (-\\frac{15}{4}) = \\frac{27}{25}$\nSo, $3P = (\\frac{9}{25}, \\frac{27}{25})$.\n\n3. $4P = 3P + P$:\n$x_3 = \\frac{(\\frac{27}{25} - 1)^2}{(\\frac{9}{25} - 0)^2} - \\frac{9}{25} - 0 = 0$\n$y_3 = \\frac{\\frac{27}{25} - 1}{\\frac{9}{25} - 0}(0 - \\frac{9}{25}) - 1 = -1$\nSo, $4P = (0, -1)$.\n\n4. $5P = 4P + P$:\n$x_3 = \\frac{(-1 - 1)^2}{(0 - 0)^2} - 0 - 0$ is undefined, since the denominator is zero.\n$y_3$ is also undefined for the same reason.\n\nSince $5P$ is undefined, it means that $4P$ and $P$ are inverses of each other, and their sum is the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$. Therefore, the order of the point $P$ in the group of points on $E$ modulo torsion is $4$."
