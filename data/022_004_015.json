    "message_2": "To determine the nature of the singularity of the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^3 + 1) at z = -1, we first need to find the limit of the function as z approaches -1.\n\nLet's rewrite the function f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z^3 + 1) = [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]/[(z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1)]\n\nNow, we can see that there is a removable singularity at z = -1, since the factor (z + 1) cancels out:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)/(z^2 - z + 1)\n\nNow, let's find the limit of f(z) as z approaches -1:\n\nlim (z -> -1) [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]/(z^2 - z + 1)\n\nPlugging in z = -1, we get:\n\nlim (z -> -1) [(-2)(1 - 1 + 1)]/(1 + 1 + 1) = (-2 * 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nSince the limit exists and is finite, the singularity at z = -1 is a removable singularity."
