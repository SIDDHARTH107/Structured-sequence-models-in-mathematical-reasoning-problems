    "message_1": "Assume that we have an encrypted message using Vigenere cipher with a key of length 6. The message contains only lowercase English alphabets. The frequency analysis shows that the most frequently occurring letter in the message is 'g'. What is the most likely length of the repeating sequence of the key?",
    "message_2": "The most likely length of the repeating sequence of the key is 6. \n\nSince the message is encrypted using a Vigenere cipher with a key of length 6, the key repeats every 6 characters. The frequency analysis shows that the most frequently occurring letter in the message is 'g'. In English, the most common letter is 'e'. It is likely that 'g' corresponds to 'e' in the plaintext message. \n\nIf we assume that 'g' is encrypted from 'e', the shift between 'g' and 'e' is 2 (g -> f -> e). This means that the key character at the corresponding position in the repeating sequence is 'c' (a -> b -> c). Since the key has a length of 6, the repeating sequence of the key is also 6."
