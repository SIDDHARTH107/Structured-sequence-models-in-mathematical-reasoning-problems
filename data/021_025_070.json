Product B has a production cost of $16 per unit and sells for $25 per unit. The company has a production capacity of 500 units per day. Using the whale optimization algorithm, maximize the company's daily profit.",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the humpback whale's bubble-net hunting strategy. However, for this problem, we can solve it using linear programming, which is more suitable and efficient.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced daily.\n\nObjective function (daily profit to maximize):\nP = 8x + 9y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production capacity: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can use the graphical method to solve this linear programming problem.\n\nFirst, we'll plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x + y = 500 (boundary of the production capacity constraint)\n2. x = 0 (boundary of the non-negativity constraint for x)\n3. y = 0 (boundary of the non-negativity constraint for y)\n\nNext, we'll find the feasible region, which is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 500), and (500, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 9(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 500) = 8(0) + 9(500) = $4,500\n3. P(500, 0) = 8(500) + 9(0) = $4,000\n\nThe maximum daily profit occurs at vertex (0, 500), where the company produces 0 units of product A and 500 units of product B, resulting in a daily profit of $4,500."
