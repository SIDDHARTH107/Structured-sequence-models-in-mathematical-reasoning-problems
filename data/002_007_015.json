    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 units and the length of its two parallel sides are 4 units and 12 units respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 units, and the lengths of the parallel sides are 4 units and 12 units. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (4 + 12) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (16) * 8\n\nArea = 8 * 8\n\nArea = 64 square units\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 64 square units."
