    "message_1": "A manufacturing company intends to produce cylindrical tubes with a volume of 200 cubic centimeters from a rectangular piece of sheet metal of length 40 centimeters and width 20 centimeters. A rectangular piece of length x centimeters and width y centimeters is removed from each corner of the sheet, and the remaining sheet is folded into a cylindrical tube. \n\nWhat dimensions of the rectangular piece should be removed from the corners in order to minimize the cost of materials used? Assume that the cost of materials is proportional to the area of the sheet metal used. Round the answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the dimensions of the cylindrical tube. The volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. We are given that the volume is 200 cubic centimeters.\n\nWhen the rectangular piece is removed from each corner and the sheet is folded, the height of the cylinder will be equal to the width of the sheet minus 2y (since y is removed from both the top and bottom), so h = 20 - 2y. The circumference of the cylinder will be equal to the length of the sheet minus 2x (since x is removed from both the left and right sides), so 2πr = 40 - 2x, and r = (40 - 2x) / (2π).\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for r and h into the volume formula:\n\n200 = π((40 - 2x) / (2π))²(20 - 2y)\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 10 - (5x² - 40x + 200) / (20 - 2x)\n\nNow we need to minimize the area of the sheet metal used. The area A of the sheet metal is given by the formula A = (40 - 2x)(20 - 2y). Substituting the expression for y from above, we get:\n\nA(x) = (40 - 2x)(20 - 2(10 - (5x² - 40x + 200) / (20 - 2x)))\n\nTo minimize the area, we need to find the critical points of A(x) by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nA'(x) = 0\n\nIt's quite complex to find the derivative of A(x) directly, so we can use a numerical method or a calculator to find the minimum value of x. Using a calculator, we find that the minimum area occurs when x ≈ 2.45 cm.\n\nNow we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 10 - (5(2.45)² - 40(2.45) + 200) / (20 - 2(2.45))\ny ≈ 5.23 cm\n\nSo, to minimize the cost of materials used, the dimensions of the rectangular piece to be removed from the corners should be approximately 2.45 cm by 5.23 cm."
