Each route has a maximum capacity limit, and the company needs to determine how much of the product should be sent through each route in order to minimize cost. The network flow problem is given by the following table:\n\n| Route | Maximum Capacity | Cost/Unit | Demand |\n|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------|\n|   1   |      7          |     3     |   5    |\n|   2   |      4          |     6     |   4    |\n|   3   |      5          |     4     |   6    |\n|   4   |      5          |     5     |   5    |\n| Source|      -          |     -     |   8    |\n| Sink  |      -          |     -     |   -    |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of transporting the required amount of the product through this network of transportation routes?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of transporting the required amount of the product, we need to determine the optimal flow through each route while satisfying the demand and capacity constraints.\n\nFirst, let's find the total demand that needs to be satisfied: 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 20 units.\n\nThe source can supply 8 units, so we need to find a way to distribute these 8 units among the routes to satisfy the demand as much as possible.\n\nLet's start by sending the maximum capacity through the cheapest route, which is Route 1 with a cost of 3 per unit. We can send 7 units through Route 1, satisfying the demand for that route and leaving 1 unit to be sent through other routes.\n\nNow, we have 1 unit left to send and the remaining demand is 15 units (4 + 6 + 5). The next cheapest route is Route 3 with a cost of 4 per unit. We can send the remaining 1 unit through Route 3, leaving 4 units of demand for that route.\n\nAt this point, we have used up all the supply from the source, and the remaining demand is 14 units (4 + 4 + 5). We cannot satisfy the remaining demand with the given supply, so we will focus on minimizing the cost of the 8 units we have sent.\n\nThe cost of sending 7 units through Route 1 is 7 * 3 = 21.\nThe cost of sending 1 unit through Route 3 is 1 * 4 = 4.\n\nThe total minimum cost of transporting the required amount of the product through this network of transportation routes is 21 + 4 = 25."
