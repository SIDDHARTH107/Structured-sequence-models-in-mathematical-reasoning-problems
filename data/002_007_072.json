    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and the bottom base is 12 cm. The top base is 8 cm and the two sides are of equal length, measuring 5 cm each. Find the area of the trapezoid.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the sum of the bases is the length of the top base (8 cm) plus the length of the bottom base (12 cm), which equals 20 cm. The height is given as 10 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (20 cm) * (10 cm)\n\nArea = 10 * 20\n\nArea = 200 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 200 square centimeters."
