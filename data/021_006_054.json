    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with a time-discretization scheme, we first need to discretize the spatial domain and time domain. Let's use $N$ equally spaced nodes in the spatial domain $[0, 1]$ and $M$ equally spaced time steps in the time domain $[0, T]$. Let $x_i = i\\Delta x$ and $t_j = j\\Delta t$ where $\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{N-1}$ and $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{M-1}$.\n\nNow, let's approximate the solution $u(x, t)$ by a linear combination of basis functions $\\phi_i(x)$:\n\n$u(x, t) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} U_i(t) \\phi_i(x)$\n\nWe can use the Galerkin method to obtain the weak form of the PDE. Multiply the PDE by a test function $\\phi_j(x)$ and integrate over the spatial domain:\n\n$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\phi_j(x) dx = k \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\phi_j(x) dx$\n\nSubstitute the approximation of $u(x, t)$:\n\n$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} U_i(t) \\phi_i(x)\\right) \\phi_j(x) dx = k \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} U_i(t) \\phi_i(x)\\right) \\phi_j(x) dx$\n\nNow, we can use a time-discretization scheme, such as the implicit Euler method, to discretize the time derivative:\n\n$\\int_0^1 \\frac{U_i^{j+1} - U_i^j}{\\Delta t} \\phi_i(x) \\phi_j(x) dx = k \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} U_i^{j+1} \\phi_i(x)\\right) \\phi_j(x) dx$\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations for the unknown coefficients $U_i^{j+1}$ at each time step $j$. The initial condition is given by:\n\n$u(x, 0) = f(x) = 2\\sin(\\pi x) - \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\nWe can project this initial condition onto the basis functions to obtain the initial coefficients $U_i^0$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the solution $u(x, t)$ at $t = 0.5$ by evaluating the approximation at the desired time step:\n\n$u(x, 0.5) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} U_i^{j=0.5/\\Delta t} \\phi_i(x)$\n\nNote that the actual solution of the coefficients $U_i^j$ and the basis functions $\\phi_i(x)$ depend on the choice of the finite element space and the numerical method used to solve the linear system."
