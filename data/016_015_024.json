    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The total length of a Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = n * (4^(k-1))\n\nwhere n is the length of each line segment and k is the order of the curve.\n\nIn this case, n = 1 unit and k = 3.\n\nLength = 1 * (4^(3-1))\nLength = 1 * (4^2)\nLength = 1 * 16\nLength = 16 units\n\nSo, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order 3 with each line segment having a length of 1 unit is 16 units."
