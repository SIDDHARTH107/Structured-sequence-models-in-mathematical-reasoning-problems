    "message_1": "Suppose you have a rectangular sheet of metal that is 10 cm long and 6 cm wide. You need to cut out a square from each corner so that the sheet can be folded into an open-topped box. What is the length of the side of the square that should be cut out so that the box will have the largest possible volume?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the side of the square that needs to be cut out from each corner. After cutting out the squares and folding the sheet, the dimensions of the open-topped box will be:\n\nLength: 10 - 2x\nWidth: 6 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be calculated as:\n\nV = length * width * height\nV = (10 - 2x)(6 - 2x)(x)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 32x^2 + 60x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the volume equation with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 64x + 60\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 64x + 60 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 12, b = -64, and c = 60. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (64 ± √((-64)^2 - 4(12)(60))) / (2 * 12)\nx = (64 ± √(4096 - 2880)) / 24\nx = (64 ± √1216) / 24\nx = (64 ± 34.8) / 24\n\nWe have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (64 + 34.8) / 24 ≈ 4.12 (This value is not valid, as it would result in negative dimensions for the box)\nx = (64 - 34.8) / 24 ≈ 1.22\n\nSo, the length of the side of the square that should be cut out to maximize the volume of the open-topped box is approximately 1.22 cm."
