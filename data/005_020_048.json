    "message_1": "A company is planning to launch a new product in the market. In order to estimate the demand for the product, they have conducted a market survey and have found out that the demand varies between 50,000 to 70,000 units per month with a standard deviation of 5,000 units. Using Monte Carlo simulation, estimate the probability that the demand for the new product will be more than 60,000 units per month.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the probability using Monte Carlo simulation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Assume the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). In this case, µ = (50,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 60,000 units, and σ = 5,000 units.\n\n2. Generate a large number of random samples (N) from the normal distribution with the given mean and standard deviation. For this example, let's use N = 10,000.\n\n3. Count the number of samples that have a demand greater than 60,000 units (let's call this M).\n\n4. Calculate the probability by dividing M by N.\n\nLet's perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nmean = 60000\nstd_dev = 5000\nnum_samples = 10000\n\n# Generate random samples from the normal distribution\nsamples = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, num_samples)\n\n# Count the number of samples with demand greater than 60,000 units\nM = np.sum(samples > 60000)\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = M / num_samples\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, we get the probability of the demand being more than 60,000 units per month. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the process."
