    "message_1": "A force of 50 Newtons is applied at an angle of 30 degrees to a horizontal surface. What is the magnitude and direction of the force vector?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the force vector, we need to resolve the force into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components.\n\nThe horizontal component (Fx) can be found using the formula:\nFx = F * cos(θ)\nwhere F is the force (50 N) and θ is the angle (30 degrees).\n\nThe vertical component (Fy) can be found using the formula:\nFy = F * sin(θ)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal and vertical components:\n\nFx = 50 * cos(π / 6) = 50 * (√3 / 2) = 25√3 N\nFy = 50 * sin(π / 6) = 50 * (1 / 2) = 25 N\n\nSo, the force vector can be represented as:\nF = (25√3 N, 25 N)\n\nThe magnitude of the force vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n|F| = √(Fx^2 + Fy^2) = √((25√3)^2 + (25)^2) = √(1875 + 625) = √2500 = 50 N\n\nThe direction of the force vector can be found using the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(Fy / Fx) = arctan(25 / 25√3) = arctan(1 / √3)\n\nConverting the angle back to degrees:\nθ = (arctan(1 / √3)) * (180 / π) ≈ 30 degrees\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the force vector are 50 N and 30 degrees, respectively."
