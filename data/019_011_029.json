    "message_2": "To prove that the truth value must be true, we can use the given information and the properties of relevance logic.\n\n1. (P ⊨ Q) ∧ (Q ⊨ P) ∧ (P ↔ Q) ∧ (P = Q) (Given)\n\n2. P ⊨ Q (From 1, by conjunction elimination)\n\n3. Q ⊨ P (From 1, by conjunction elimination)\n\n4. P ↔ Q (From 1, by conjunction elimination)\n\n5. P = Q (From 1, by conjunction elimination)\n\nNow, let's use the properties of relevance logic:\n\n6. If P ⊨ Q, then P → Q (By definition of relevance)\n\n7. P → Q (From 2, by applying 6)\n\n8. Q → P (From 3, by applying 6)\n\n9. P → Q ∧ Q → P (From 7 and 8, by conjunction introduction)\n\n10. P ↔ Q (From 9, by definition of biconditional)\n\nSince we have P ↔ Q from both step 4 and step 10, we can conclude that:\n\n11. P (From 4 and 10, by the property of biconditional)\n\nThus, we have proven that if P and Q are logically relevant to each other and have the same truth value, this truth value must be true."
