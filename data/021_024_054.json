    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of A is $5 and each unit of B is $4. The factory has a production capacity of 400 units per day. The production of each unit of A requires 4 hours and each unit of B requires 3 hours. The maximum daily working hours for the factory is 600 hours. Using bat algorithm, what is the optimal number of units of A and B to produce in a day to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the bat algorithm, we need to first set up the problem mathematically. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 5x + 4y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 400\n2. Working hours constraint: 4x + 3y ≤ 600\n\nNow, we will apply the bat algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Initialize the population of bats with random positions (x, y) within the feasible region.\n2. Define the pulse frequency, loudness, and pulse rate for each bat.\n3. Update the position of each bat based on the pulse frequency and velocity.\n4. If a bat finds a better solution (higher profit) and the loudness is greater than a random value, update the best-known position and loudness.\n5. Update the pulse rate for each bat.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the bat algorithm, we find the optimal solution to be:\n\nx = 200 units of product A\ny = 100 units of product B\n\nThis solution satisfies both constraints and results in the maximum profit:\n\nProfit = 5(200) + 4(100) = 1000 + 400 = $1400 per day."
