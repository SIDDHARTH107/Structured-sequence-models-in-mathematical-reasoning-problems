    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. A group of order n is isomorphic to a group of order m if and only if n = m.\n3. The number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number, is given by the number of partitions of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 36. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. Now, we need to find the number of partitions of the exponents 2 and 2. The partitions of 2 are {2} and {1, 1}, so there are two partitions for each exponent.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups of order 36 = (number of partitions of 2) * (number of partitions of 2) = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
