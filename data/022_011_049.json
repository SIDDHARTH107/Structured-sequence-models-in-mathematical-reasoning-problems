    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^3 - 8 = 0$\n\nThis is a difference of cubes, which can be factored as:\n\n$(z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0$\n\nSo, the zeros of the function are:\n\n$z = 2$ (with order 1, since it is a simple root)\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 + 2z + 1 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$(z + 1)^2 = 0$\n\nSo, the poles of the function are:\n\n$z = -1$ (with order 2, since it is a double root)\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3-8}{z^2+2z+1}$ has:\n\n- A zero at $z = 2$ with order 1\n- A pole at $z = -1$ with order 2"
