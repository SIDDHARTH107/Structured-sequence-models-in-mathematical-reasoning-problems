    "message_1": "Consider the following linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize the objective function Z = 3x1 + 5x2 subject to the constraints:\n\n- x1 + x2 ≤ 6\n- 9x1 + 5x2 ≤ 45\n- x1, x2 ≥ 0\n\nWrite the constraints in matrix form, solve the problem using matrix methods, and determine the values of the decision variables (x1 and x2) at the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To write the constraints in matrix form, we can represent the inequality constraints as Ax ≤ b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants. In this case, we have:\n\nA = | 1  1 |\n    | 9  5 |\n\nx = | x1 |\n    | x2 |\n\nb = |  6  |\n    | 45  |\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region. The constraints are:\n\n1. x1 + x2 ≤ 6\n2. 9x1 + 5x2 ≤ 45\n3. x1 ≥ 0\n4. x2 ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraints intersect. The vertices are (0,0), (0,6), (5,0), and (1,5).\n\nNext, we will evaluate the objective function Z = 3x1 + 5x2 at each vertex to find the maximum value:\n\n1. Z(0,0) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0\n2. Z(0,6) = 3(0) + 5(6) = 30\n3. Z(5,0) = 3(5) + 5(0) = 15\n4. Z(1,5) = 3(1) + 5(5) = 28\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 30, which occurs at the vertex (0,6). Therefore, the optimal solution is x1 = 0 and x2 = 6."
