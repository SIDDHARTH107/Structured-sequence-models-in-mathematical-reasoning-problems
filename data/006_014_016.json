    "message_1": "A certain type of technological system has a probability of failure of 0.05 in any given year. What is the probability that there will be at least one failure in the next three years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that there will be no failures in the next three years and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one failure.\n\nThe probability of no failure in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no failures in three consecutive years, we multiply the probabilities for each year:\n\n0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one failure in the next three years:\n\n1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one failure in the next three years is approximately 0.142625 or 14.26%."
