    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to find the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ(aₙcos(nωx) + bₙsin(nωx))\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, and T is the period of the function.\n\nFor the given function, the period T = 6, so ω = 2π/6 = π/3.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients:\n\na₀ = (1/T) * ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to T\naₙ = (2/T) * ∫[f(x)cos(nωx)dx] from 0 to T\nbₙ = (2/T) * ∫[f(x)sin(nωx)dx] from 0 to T\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/6) * [∫(1dx) from 0 to 2 + ∫(-1dx) from 2 to 4 + ∫(0dx) from 4 to 6]\na₀ = (1/6) * [2 - 2 + 0] = 0\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/3) * [∫(1cos(nπ/3x)dx) from 0 to 2 + ∫(-1cos(nπ/3x)dx) from 2 to 4 + ∫(0cos(nπ/3x)dx) from 4 to 6]\n\naₙ = (1/3) * [(1/(nπ/3))sin(nπ/3x) from 0 to 2 - (1/(nπ/3))sin(nπ/3x) from 2 to 4]\n\naₙ = (1/nπ) * [sin(nπ/3 * 2) - sin(nπ/3 * 4)]\n\nSince the function is odd, all aₙ coefficients will be zero.\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/3) * [∫(1sin(nπ/3x)dx) from 0 to 2 + ∫(-1sin(nπ/3x)dx) from 2 to 4 + ∫(0sin(nπ/3x)dx) from 4 to 6]\n\nbₙ = (1/3) * [(-1/(nπ/3))cos(nπ/3x) from 0 to 2 + (1/(nπ/3))cos(nπ/3x) from 2 to 4]\n\nbₙ = (-1/nπ) * [cos(nπ/3 * 2) - cos(nπ/3 * 4) - cos(0) + cos(nπ/3 * 2)]\n\nbₙ = (-1/nπ) * [2cos(nπ/3 * 2) - 1]\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ((-1/nπ) * [2cos(nπ/3 * 2) - 1] * sin(nπ/3x))\n\nwhere the summation is over all positive odd integers n."
