    "message_2": "To find the order and type of singularity at z=0 for the function f(z) = sin(z)/z^3, we can use the Laurent series expansion of sin(z) around z=0.\n\nThe Laurent series expansion of sin(z) is given by:\n\nsin(z) = z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...\n\nNow, we can divide this series by z^3 to find the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = sin(z)/z^3 = (z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...)/z^3\n\nf(z) = 1/z^2 - 1/6 + z^2/5! - z^4/7! + ...\n\nThe Laurent series expansion of f(z) has a non-zero term with a negative power of z (1/z^2), which means that the function f(z) has a pole at z=0. The order of the pole is determined by the highest power of z in the denominator, which in this case is 2. Therefore, the function f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z=0."
