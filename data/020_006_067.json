    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, which require two types of raw materials. Material 1 costs $10 per unit and material 2 costs $15 per unit. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of material 1 and 3 units of material 2, while each unit of product B requires 4 units of material 1 and 1 unit of material 2. The company has a budget of $3000 for raw materials. \nThe company wants to determine the optimal production levels for products A and B in order to maximize profit. The profit for each unit of product A is $20 and for each unit of product B is $30. What is the optimal production plan for products A and B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe cost of raw materials for product A is 2 * $10 (material 1) + 3 * $15 (material 2) = $20 + $45 = $65 per unit.\nThe cost of raw materials for product B is 4 * $10 (material 1) + 1 * $15 (material 2) = $40 + $15 = $55 per unit.\n\nThe company's budget constraint is given by the following equation:\n65x + 55y ≤ $3000\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = $20x + $30y\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we need to find the maximum value of P(x, y) subject to the constraint 65x + 55y ≤ $3000.\n\nFirst, let's find the points where the budget constraint is binding (i.e., where the inequality becomes an equality):\n65x + 55y = $3000\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of x:\ny = (3000 - 65x) / 55\n\nNow, we need to find the integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation and maximize the profit function. We can do this by trying different integer values of x and finding the corresponding integer values of y:\n\n1. If x = 0, y = 3000 / 55 ≈ 54.55, so y = 54 (rounding down to the nearest integer).\n2. If x = 1, y = (3000 - 65) / 55 ≈ 53.27, so y = 53.\n3. If x = 2, y = (3000 - 130) / 55 ≈ 52, so y = 52.\n4. If x = 3, y = (3000 - 195) / 55 ≈ 50.91, so y = 50.\n\nWe can continue this process, but we can already see that the profit function will start to decrease as we increase x and decrease y. So, we can compare the profit values for the above combinations:\n\n1. P(0, 54) = $20 * 0 + $30 * 54 = $1620\n2. P(1, 53) = $20 * 1 + $30 * 53 = $1600 + $1590 = $3190\n3. P(2, 52) = $20 * 2 + $30 * 52 = $40 + $1560 = $1600\n4. P(3, 50) = $20 * 3 + $30 * 50 = $60 + $1500 = $1560\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved when producing 1 unit of product A and 53 units of product B, with a total profit of $3190. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 1 unit of product A and 53 units of product B."
