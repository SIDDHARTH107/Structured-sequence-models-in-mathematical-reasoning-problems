    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 10 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (10 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 100 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 400 * π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 1256.64 cm^2 (using π ≈ 3.1416)."
