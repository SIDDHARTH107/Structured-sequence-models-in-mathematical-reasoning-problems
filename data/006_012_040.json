    "message_1": "What is the probability of a burglary occurring in a particular neighborhood within the next 30 days given that the neighborhood has experienced an average of 5 burglaries per month in the past year? Round your answer to three decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, burglaries) occurring in a fixed interval of time (30 days). The formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (burglaries), k is the specific number of events we want to find the probability for, λ (lambda) is the average number of events (burglaries) per interval (30 days), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the next 30 days, we can find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nGiven that there are an average of 5 burglaries per month (30 days), λ = 5.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula to find the probability of no burglaries (k = 0) occurring in the next 30 days:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-5) * 5^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (0.00674 * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = 0.00674\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one burglary occurring by subtracting the probability of no burglaries from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.00674\nP(X ≥ 1) = 0.99326\n\nRounded to three decimal places, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood within the next 30 days is 0.993."
