    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's Triangle, we need to find the binomial coefficient, which is represented as C(n, k) or \"n choose k.\" In this case, we want to choose 5 members from a group of 10 people, so we need to find C(10, 5).\n\nPascal's Triangle is constructed by starting with 1 at the top and adding the two numbers above to get the number below. The binomial coefficients can be found along the diagonals of Pascal's Triangle. Here are the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle:\n\n```\n          1\n         1 1\n        1 2 1\n       1 3 3 1\n      1 4 6 4 1\n     1 5 10 10 5 1\n    1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n   1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n  1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1\n 1 9 36 84 126 126 84 36 9 1\n1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1\n```\n\nTo find C(10, 5), we look at the 11th row (since we start counting from 0) and the 5th number in that row (again, counting from 0). In this case, C(10, 5) = 252.\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people using Pascal's Triangle."
