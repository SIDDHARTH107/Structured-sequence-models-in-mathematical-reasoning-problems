    "message_2": "To find the number of possible isomorphisms between the two graphs, we need to find the number of ways to map the vertices of the first graph to the vertices of the second graph such that the edge relationships are preserved.\n\nLet's start by mapping vertex A from the first graph to a vertex in the second graph. We have 4 choices: W, X, Y, or Z.\n\n1. If we map A to W, then B must be mapped to either X or Z since there is an edge between A and B. If B is mapped to X, then C must be mapped to Y and D to Z. If B is mapped to Z, then C must be mapped to Y and D to X. So, there are 2 possible isomorphisms in this case.\n\n2. If we map A to X, then B must be mapped to either W or Y. If B is mapped to W, then C must be mapped to Z and D to Y. If B is mapped to Y, then C must be mapped to Z and D to W. So, there are 2 possible isomorphisms in this case as well.\n\n3. If we map A to Y, the situation is symmetric to the case where A is mapped to X, so there are also 2 possible isomorphisms in this case.\n\n4. If we map A to Z, the situation is symmetric to the case where A is mapped to W, so there are also 2 possible isomorphisms in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 possible isomorphisms between the two graphs."
