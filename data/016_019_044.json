    "message_2": "The perimeter of the Koch island after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial perimeter is 12 units, and we want to find the perimeter after the 5th iteration (n = 5).\n\nPerimeter = 12 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter ≈ 12 * 1024/243\nPerimeter ≈ 50.960\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is approximately 50.960 units."
