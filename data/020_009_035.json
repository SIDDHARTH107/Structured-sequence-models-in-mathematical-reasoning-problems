    "message_1": "A company is manufacturing a product with three possible machines: Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C. The production time on each machine follows a normal distribution with Machine A taking an average of 10 minutes with a standard deviation of 2 minutes, Machine B taking an average of 12 minutes with a standard deviation of 3 minutes, and Machine C taking an average of 15 minutes with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. \n\nThe company wants to determine the optimal production schedule for making 100 units of the product, given that they need to prioritize minimizing the total production time.\n\nWhat is the optimal production schedule, and how long will it take to produce 100 units?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total production time, the company should use the machine with the lowest average production time. In this case, Machine A has the lowest average production time of 10 minutes per unit.\n\nTo produce 100 units using Machine A, the total production time can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal production time = Number of units * Average production time per unit\nTotal production time = 100 units * 10 minutes/unit\nTotal production time = 1000 minutes\n\nThe optimal production schedule is to use Machine A to produce all 100 units, and it will take 1000 minutes to complete the production."
