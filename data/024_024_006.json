    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection on a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g), we first need to define the frame bundle FM, which is the principal bundle of orthonormal frames on M. The Cartan connection is a connection 1-form on FM with values in the Lie algebra so(3) of the rotation group SO(3).\n\nLet (e_1, e_2, e_3) be a local orthonormal frame on M, and let (ω^1, ω^2, ω^3) be the dual coframe, i.e., ω^i(e_j) = δ^i_j. The Cartan connection 1-forms are given by the Levi-Civita connection 1-forms ω^i_j, which satisfy the structure equations:\n\ndω^i = -ω^i_j ∧ ω^j,\n\nwhere ∧ denotes the wedge product of differential forms.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection 1-forms can be computed from the metric g using the Koszul formula:\n\nω^i_j(e_k) = 1/2 (g(e_j, ∇_k e_i) - g(e_i, ∇_k e_j) + g(e_k, ∇_j e_i)),\n\nwhere ∇ denotes the Levi-Civita connection on M.\n\nOnce we have the connection 1-forms ω^i_j, we can compute the curvature 2-forms Ω^i_j by the equation:\n\nΩ^i_j = dω^i_j + ω^i_k ∧ ω^k_j.\n\nThe curvature tensor R can then be obtained from the curvature 2-forms by the relation:\n\nR(e_i, e_j) e_k = Ω^l_k(e_i, e_j) e_l.\n\nNow let's consider the specific example of the 3-sphere S^3 with the standard round metric. We can parametrize S^3 by the Euler angles (θ, φ, ψ) with the metric:\n\ng = dθ^2 + sin^2(θ) dφ^2 + sin^2(θ) sin^2(φ) dψ^2.\n\nThe orthonormal frame (e_1, e_2, e_3) and the dual coframe (ω^1, ω^2, ω^3) are given by:\n\ne_1 = ∂/∂θ,\ne_2 = 1/sin(θ) ∂/∂φ,\ne_3 = 1/(sin(θ) sin(φ)) ∂/∂ψ,\n\nω^1 = dθ,\nω^2 = sin(θ) dφ,\nω^3 = sin(θ) sin(φ) dψ.\n\nUsing the Koszul formula, we compute the Levi-Civita connection 1-forms:\n\nω^1_2 = cos(θ) dφ,\nω^1_3 = cos(θ) sin(φ) dψ,\nω^2_3 = cos(φ) dψ,\n\nand all other ω^i_j are zero.\n\nNow we compute the curvature 2-forms:\n\nΩ^1_2 = dω^1_2 = -sin(θ) dθ ∧ dφ,\nΩ^1_3 = dω^1_3 = -sin(θ) cos(φ) dθ ∧ dψ,\nΩ^2_3 = dω^2_3 = -sin(θ) sin(φ) dφ ∧ dψ.\n\nFinally, we obtain the curvature tensor components:\n\nR(e_1, e_2) e_1 = Ω^1_1(e_1, e_2) e_1 = 0,\nR(e_1, e_2) e_2 = Ω^2_1(e_1, e_2) e_2 = sin^2(θ) e_2,\nR(e_1, e_2) e_3 = Ω^3_1(e_1, e_2) e_3 = sin^2(θ) sin^2(φ) e_3,\n\nand similarly for the other components. The non-zero components of the curvature tensor are:\n\nR(e_1, e_2) e_2 = R(e_2, e_1) e_1 = sin^2(θ),\nR(e_1, e_3) e_3 = R(e_3, e_1) e_1 = sin^2(θ) sin^2(φ),\nR(e_2, e_3) e_3 = R(e_3, e_2) e_2 = sin^2(θ) sin^2(φ).\n\nThis shows that the 3-sphere S^3 with the standard round metric has constant sectional curvature equal to 1, as expected."
