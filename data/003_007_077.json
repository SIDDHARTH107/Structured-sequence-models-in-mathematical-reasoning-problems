    "message_2": "Let's label the sides of the triangle as follows: a = 7, b = 10, and c = 12. We want to find the largest angle, which is the angle opposite the longest side (c). Let's call this angle C.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c:\n\ncos(C) = (7^2 + 10^2 - 12^2) / (2 * 7 * 10)\ncos(C) = (49 + 100 - 144) / 140\ncos(C) = 5 / 140\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(5/140)\n\nC ≈ 78.46°\n\nSo, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 78.46°."
