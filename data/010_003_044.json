    "message_2": "1) 0: Limit point\nTo determine if 0 is a limit point, we need to check if every open set containing 0 also contains a point in A other than 0. Consider an open set U containing 0. Since U is open in the topology generated by B, there exists an interval [a, b) in B such that 0 ∈ [a, b) ⊆ U. Since a < 0 < b, there exists a rational number q in the interval (0, b). Thus, q ∈ A and q ∈ U. Since q ≠ 0, 0 is a limit point of A.\n\n2) 1: Limit point\nTo determine if 1 is a limit point, we need to check if every open set containing 1 also contains a point in A other than 1. Consider an open set U containing 1. Since U is open in the topology generated by B, there exists an interval [a, b) in B such that 1 ∈ [a, b) ⊆ U. Since a < 1 < b, there exists a rational number q in the interval (a, 1). Thus, q ∈ A and q ∈ U. Since q ≠ 1, 1 is a limit point of A.\n\n3) 2: Isolated point\nTo determine if 2 is an isolated point, we need to check if there exists an open set containing 2 that does not contain any other points of A. Consider the open set U = [2, 3) in the topology generated by B. U contains 2, but no other points in A, since A = (0, 1] ∪ {2} and U does not intersect (0, 1]. Therefore, 2 is an isolated point of A."
