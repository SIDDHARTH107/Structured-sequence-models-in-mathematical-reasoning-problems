    "message_2": "Since f(z) is a harmonic function, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nGiven that the real part of f(z) on the boundary of the circle is u(cosθ) = 5cosθ, we can write u(x, y) = 5x, where x = cosθ and y = sinθ. Now we need to find the corresponding imaginary part v(x, y) of f(z).\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we have:\n\n∂u/∂x = 5 = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = 0 = -∂v/∂x\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to y, we get:\n\nv(x, y) = 5y + g(x)\n\nwhere g(x) is an arbitrary function of x.\n\nNow, we use the second equation:\n\n-∂v/∂x = 0\n\nThis implies that g'(x) = 0, which means g(x) is a constant. Let's call this constant C.\n\nSo, v(x, y) = 5y + C.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of C. Since f(z) is harmonic, it must satisfy the Laplace equation:\n\n∇²f(z) = ∇²(u + iv) = 0\n\nThe Laplace equation in terms of u and v is:\n\n(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²) + i(∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y²) = 0\n\nFor f(z) to be harmonic, both the real and imaginary parts must satisfy the Laplace equation:\n\n∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² = 0\n\nWe already know that u(x, y) = 5x, so:\n\n∂²u/∂x² = 0\n∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nThus, the real part u(x, y) satisfies the Laplace equation.\n\nNow, let's check the imaginary part v(x, y) = 5y + C:\n\n∂²v/∂x² = 0\n∂²v/∂y² = 0\n\nThus, the imaginary part v(x, y) also satisfies the Laplace equation, and f(z) is indeed harmonic.\n\nNow, we can find the imaginary part of f(1 + i) using v(x, y) = 5y + C:\n\nv(1, 1) = 5(1) + C\n\nSince f(z) is harmonic, the constant C can be set to 0 without affecting the harmonicity of the function. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(1 + i) is:\n\nv(1, 1) = 5(1) = 5"
