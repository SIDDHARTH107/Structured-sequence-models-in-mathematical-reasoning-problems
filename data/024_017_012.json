    "message_1": "A particle moves along a curve in 3D space. At the point (1,1,1) on the curve, a vector v = (2,3,-1) is specified. If the curve is defined by the function r(t) = (t^2, t, t^3), find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve to the point (4, 2, 64).",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve to the point (4, 2, 64), we first need to find the tangent vector at each point on the curve. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve function r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (2t, 1, 3t^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t at the initial point (1,1,1) and the final point (4, 2, 64). From the curve function r(t), we can see that:\n\nt^2 = 1 => t = 1 (initial point)\nt^2 = 4 => t = 2 (final point)\n\nNext, we find the tangent vectors at these points:\n\nr'(1) = (2, 1, 3)\nr'(2) = (4, 1, 12)\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector v from the initial tangent vector to the final tangent vector. We can do this by projecting v onto the plane perpendicular to the tangent vector at each point and then scaling the projected vector to maintain its length.\n\nFirst, let's find the projection of v onto the plane perpendicular to r'(1):\n\nv_proj1 = v - (v · r'(1)) / ||r'(1)||^2 * r'(1)\nv_proj1 = (2, 3, -1) - ((2, 3, -1) · (2, 1, 3)) / ||(2, 1, 3)||^2 * (2, 1, 3)\nv_proj1 = (2, 3, -1) - (1/14) * (2, 1, 3)\nv_proj1 ≈ (1.857, 2.929, -1.214)\n\nNow, let's find the projection of v_proj1 onto the plane perpendicular to r'(2):\n\nv_proj2 = v_proj1 - (v_proj1 · r'(2)) / ||r'(2)||^2 * r'(2)\nv_proj2 ≈ (1.857, 2.929, -1.214) - ((1.857, 2.929, -1.214) · (4, 1, 12)) / ||(4, 1, 12)||^2 * (4, 1, 12)\nv_proj2 ≈ (1.857, 2.929, -1.214) - (1/161) * (4, 1, 12)\nv_proj2 ≈ (1.824, 2.935, -1.260)\n\nFinally, we need to scale v_proj2 to maintain the length of the original vector v:\n\nv_parallel_transport = ||v|| / ||v_proj2|| * v_proj2\nv_parallel_transport ≈ (3.741 / 3.779) * (1.824, 2.935, -1.260)\nv_parallel_transport ≈ (1.990, 3.052, -1.308)\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve to the point (4, 2, 64) is approximately (1.990, 3.052, -1.308)."
