    "message_2": "To find the value of angle 'x' in radians, we will use the inverse sine function, also known as arcsin or sin^(-1).\n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nThe arcsin function gives us the angle whose sine is the given value. In this case, we want to find the angle whose sine is 0.5. We know that:\n\nsin(π/6) = 0.5\n\nTherefore, the value of angle 'x' in radians is:\n\nx = π/6"
