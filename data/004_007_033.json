    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)) using the chain rule, we first need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) separately.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 3x - 1 with respect to x is:\nf'(x) = 3\n\nThe derivative of g(x) = x^2 with respect to x is:\ng'(x) = 2x\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of f(g(x)). The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative of h(x) with respect to x is:\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nIn our case, f(g(x)) is the composite function, so we have:\n\nf'(g(x)) * g'(x) = f'(x^2) * 2x\n\nSince f'(x) = 3, we can substitute x^2 into f'(x):\n\nf'(x^2) = 3\n\nNow, we can multiply f'(x^2) and g'(x) together:\n\nf'(g(x)) * g'(x) = 3 * 2x = 6x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x is 6x."
