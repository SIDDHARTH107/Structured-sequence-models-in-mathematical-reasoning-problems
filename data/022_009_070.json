    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{\\frac{(-3)^{n+1}}{n+2}z^{n+2}}{\\frac{(-3)^n}{n+1}z^{n+1}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(-3)^{n+1}(n+1)z^{n+1}}{(-3)^n(n+2)z^{n+2}}\\right|$$\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(-3)(n+1)}{(n+2)}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we want this limit to be less than 1 for convergence:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{(-3)(n+1)}{(n+2)}\\right| < 1$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the limit becomes:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{-3}{1}\\right| = 3$$\n\nSince the limit is greater than 1, the series diverges for all z. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 0.\n\nThe interval of convergence is the set of all z values for which the series converges. Since the radius of convergence is 0, the interval of convergence is the empty set, meaning there are no values of z for which the series converges."
