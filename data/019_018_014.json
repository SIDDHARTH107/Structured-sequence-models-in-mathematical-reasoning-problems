By definition, an odd number can be expressed in the form 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let A = 2n1 + 1 and B = 2n2 + 1, where n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the difference between A and B. Without loss of generality, we can assume A > B (if B > A, we can just swap their roles).\n\nDifference = A - B = (2n1 + 1) - (2n2 + 1)\n\nDifference = 2n1 + 1 - 2n2 - 1\n\nDifference = 2n1 - 2n2\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor of 2:\n\nDifference = 2(n1 - n2)\n\nSince n1 and n2 are integers, their difference (n1 - n2) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\nDifference = 2k\n\nBy definition, a number in the form 2k, where k is an integer, is an even number. Therefore, the difference between any two odd numbers is an even number."
