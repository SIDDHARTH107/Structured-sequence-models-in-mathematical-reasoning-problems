    "message_2": "A group G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30 if there exists a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function between the elements of G and C30 that preserves the group operation. In this case, G is also a cyclic group of order 30.\n\nThe number of generators of a cyclic group of order n is given by the Euler's totient function φ(n), which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nFor n = 30, we can find the prime factors of 30: 30 = 2 × 3 × 5. Now, we can compute the Euler's totient function φ(30) using the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn our case, φ(30) = 30 × (1 - 1/2) × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/5) = 30 × (1/2) × (2/3) × (4/5) = 8.\n\nSo, the group G has 8 generators."
