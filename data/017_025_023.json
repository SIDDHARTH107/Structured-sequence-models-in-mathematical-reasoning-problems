    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 120. We know that 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of G.\n\n1. Sylow's First Theorem: There exist subgroups of G of order 2^3, 3, and 5 (Sylow p-subgroups).\n\n2. Sylow's Second Theorem: All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate.\n\n3. Sylow's Third Theorem: The number of Sylow p-subgroups (n_p) divides the order of G and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nLet's find the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime dividing the order of G:\n\nFor p = 2, n_2 divides 120/2^3 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nFor p = 3, n_3 divides 120/3 = 40, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nFor p = 5, n_5 divides 120/5 = 24, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). So, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2, P_3, and P_5 of orders 8, 3, and 5, respectively. By Sylow's Second Theorem, these subgroups are normal in G. Since their orders are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which has order 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120. This is the cyclic group C120.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has multiple Sylow subgroups for each prime. We know that the intersection of different Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, so |G| ≥ 3 * (8 - 1) + 4 * (3 - 1) + 6 * (5 - 1) = 21 + 8 + 24 = 53. However, this is a contradiction since |G| = 120. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: Other combinations of n_2, n_3, and n_5\nIn all other cases, at least one of the Sylow subgroups is normal in G. We can analyze these cases similarly to Case 1, but instead of getting a cyclic group, we will obtain a semi-direct product of groups. These cases correspond to the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 120, it can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 (which is one of the non-abelian groups), or one of the other 486 non-abelian groups of order 120. To determine the specific isomorphism type of G, we would need more information about its structure, subgroups, and automorphisms."
