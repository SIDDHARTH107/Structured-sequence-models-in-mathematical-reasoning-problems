    "message_2": "A group of order 20 has the form G = p^a * q^b, where p and q are prime numbers, and a and b are positive integers. In this case, 20 = 2^2 * 5^1, so p = 2, q = 5, a = 2, and b = 1.\n\nAccording to Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow p-subgroups is equal to 1 mod p and divides the order of the group. In this case, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) is 1 mod 2 and divides 20, so n_2 can be 1 or 5. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) is 1 mod 5 and divides 20, so n_5 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's classify the groups of order 20 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, G is the direct product of these subgroups, and G is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_20.\n\n2. If n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, G is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup. There are two possibilities for the action of the Sylow 5-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup, which correspond to the two non-isomorphic groups of order 20: the dihedral group D_20 and the dicyclic group Q_20.\n\nSo, there are three groups of order 20 up to isomorphism: Z_20, D_20, and Q_20.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of elements of each isomorphism class:\n\n1. Z_20 has 1 element of order 1, 2 elements of order 2, 4 elements of order 4, 5 elements of order 5, and 8 elements of order 10.\n\n2. D_20 has 1 element of order 1, 10 elements of order 2, and 9 elements of order 4.\n\n3. Q_20 has 1 element of order 1, 10 elements of order 2, 4 elements of order 4, and 5 elements of order 5.\n\nIn summary, there are three groups of order 20 up to isomorphism, with the following number of elements in each isomorphism class:\n\n- Z_20: 1 (order 1), 2 (order 2), 4 (order 4), 5 (order 5), 8 (order 10)\n- D_20: 1 (order 1), 10 (order 2), 9 (order 4)\n- Q_20: 1 (order 1), 10 (order 2), 4 (order 4), 5 (order 5)"
