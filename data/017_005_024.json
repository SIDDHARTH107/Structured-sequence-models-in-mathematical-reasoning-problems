    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 27. However, since n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we must have n_3 = 1. Thus, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, say P, which is of order 27. Since P is the unique 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\nIf G is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 27, Z_27. In this case, we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic\nIf G is not cyclic, then it must have an element of order 3 and an element of order 9. Let a be an element of order 3 and b be an element of order 9 in G. Since the order of G is 27, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since G is not cyclic, there is no element of order 27.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by a and b, i.e., H = ⟨a, b⟩. Since a and b are both in G, H is a subgroup of G. The order of H is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b, which is lcm(3, 9) = 9. Thus, H is a subgroup of G of order 9.\n\nSince H is of order 9, it is a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. But we know that P is the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, so H must be equal to P. Therefore, G = ⟨a, b⟩, and the order of G is the product of the orders of a and b, which is 3 * 9 = 27.\n\nNow, let's show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9. Since a has order 3 and b has order 9, we have a^3 = e and b^9 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Also, since G is abelian (as every group of order p^3 is abelian for p prime), we have ab = ba.\n\nConsider the external direct product of the cyclic group of order 3, Z_3, and the group of order 9, Z_9. Let's denote this direct product as Z_3 × Z_9. Define a homomorphism φ: G → Z_3 × Z_9 by φ(a^i b^j) = (i, j) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 8.\n\nWe will show that φ is an isomorphism:\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since G is generated by a and b, every element in G can be written as a^i b^j for some i and j. Thus, φ is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x = a^i b^j and y = a^k b^l be elements in G. Then, φ(xy) = φ(a^(i+k) b^(j+l)) = ((i+k) mod 3, (j+l) mod 9). On the other hand, φ(x)φ(y) = (i, j)(k, l) = (i+k, j+l). Since both expressions are equal, φ is a homomorphism.\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(x) = φ(y) for some x, y in G. Then, x = a^i b^j and y = a^k b^l for some i, j, k, l. If φ(x) = φ(y), then (i, j) = (k, l), which implies i = k and j = l. Thus, x = y, and φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any (i, j) in Z_3 × Z_9, there exists an element a^i b^j in G such that φ(a^i b^j) = (i, j). Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism that is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, which is Z_3 × Z_9."
