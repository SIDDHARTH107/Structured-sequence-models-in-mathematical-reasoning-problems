    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(x - 5))^2 = 3^2\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\nx - 5 = 9\n\nNext, we need to isolate x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 9 + 5\n\nFinally, we can simplify to find the value of x:\n\nx = 14"
