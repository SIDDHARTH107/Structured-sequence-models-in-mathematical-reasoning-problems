    "message_2": "The Rail Fence Cipher arranges the letters of the message in a zigzag pattern with a specific number of rows, in this case, 4 rows. To find out how many rows are required to encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\", we need to see how the message is arranged in the zigzag pattern.\n\nHere's the arrangement of the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Rail Fence Cipher with a key of 4:\n\nM---A---S\n-T--M-T-C\n--H---I--\n---E-A---\n\nAs we can see, the message is arranged in 4 rows. So, the required number of rows to encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Rail Fence Cipher with a key of 4 is 4 rows."
