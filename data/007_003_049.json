    "message_2": "To solve the linear congruence 3x ≡ 5 (mod 7), we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the modular inverse of 3 modulo 7.\nWe need to find a number y such that 3y ≡ 1 (mod 7). By trying different values of y, we find that y = 5 satisfies this condition, since 3 * 5 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7).\n\nStep 2: Multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse.\nNow we multiply both sides of the original congruence by 5 (the modular inverse of 3 modulo 7):\n5 * (3x) ≡ 5 * 5 (mod 7)\n15x ≡ 25 (mod 7)\n\nStep 3: Simplify the congruence.\nSince 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7) and 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7), we can simplify the congruence as follows:\n1x ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nStep 4: Find the solution in the given range.\nThe simplified congruence tells us that x ≡ 4 (mod 7). Since 4 is in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 6, the solution is x = 4."
