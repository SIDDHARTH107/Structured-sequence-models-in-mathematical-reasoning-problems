    "message_1": "A signal is given by the equation: f(t) = 2sin(3t) + 5cos(7t). Using the Fourier transform, determine the frequency content of the signal and calculate the amplitude and phase angle for each frequency present in the signal.",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of the signal, we can analyze the given equation: f(t) = 2sin(3t) + 5cos(7t). We can see that there are two frequencies present in the signal: one with angular frequency ω1 = 3 rad/s and the other with angular frequency ω2 = 7 rad/s.\n\nNow, let's calculate the amplitude and phase angle for each frequency.\n\nFor the first frequency (ω1 = 3 rad/s):\n\nThe given function can be written as: A1 * sin(ω1*t + φ1), where A1 is the amplitude and φ1 is the phase angle.\n\nComparing this with the given function, we have A1 = 2 and the function is already in the form of sin(ω1*t), so φ1 = 0.\n\nThus, for the first frequency, the amplitude is A1 = 2 and the phase angle is φ1 = 0.\n\nFor the second frequency (ω2 = 7 rad/s):\n\nThe given function can be written as: A2 * cos(ω2*t + φ2), where A2 is the amplitude and φ2 is the phase angle.\n\nComparing this with the given function, we have A2 = 5 and the function is already in the form of cos(ω2*t), so φ2 = 0.\n\nThus, for the second frequency, the amplitude is A2 = 5 and the phase angle is φ2 = 0.\n\nIn summary, the signal f(t) has two frequency components:\n\n1. Frequency ω1 = 3 rad/s with amplitude A1 = 2 and phase angle φ1 = 0.\n2. Frequency ω2 = 7 rad/s with amplitude A2 = 5 and phase angle φ2 = 0."
