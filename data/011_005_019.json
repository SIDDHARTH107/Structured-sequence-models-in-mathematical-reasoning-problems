    "message_1": "How many ways can 2 men and 3 women be arranged in a line such that the women are standing next to each other?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can treat the group of 3 women as a single unit. So, we have 2 men and 1 group of women to arrange in a line.\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the 3 women within their group.\n\nThere are 3 positions (or slots) in the line for the group of women to be placed: either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. In each of these positions, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the 2 men.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange 2 men and 3 women in a line such that the women are standing next to each other is:\n\n3! (ways to arrange women within their group) × 3 (positions for the group of women) × 2! (ways to arrange men) = 6 × 3 × 2 = 36 ways."
