    "message_2": "The function f(z) is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{(z-1-i)^3}$$\n\nA pole of a function is a point where the function becomes infinite. In this case, the function becomes infinite when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$$(z-1-i)^3 = 0$$\n\nSolving for z, we find that the pole is at:\n\n$$z = 1+i$$\n\nThe order of the pole is the exponent of the factor in the denominator that causes the function to become infinite. In this case, the exponent is 3. Therefore, the order of the pole at $z=1+i$ is 3.\n\nA simple pole is a pole with order 1. Since the order of the pole at $z=1+i$ is 3, it is not a simple pole."
