    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nIn this case, the side length is 8 cm. So, the area of one equilateral triangle is:\n\nArea = (8² * √3) / 4\nArea = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea = 16√3 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the total area of the hexagon:\n\nTotal area = 6 * 16√3\nTotal area = 96√3 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is 96√3 square centimeters."
