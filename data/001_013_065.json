    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(3x+5) = 2x-1, we will first square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(3x+5))^2 = (2x-1)^2\n\nNow, simplify both sides:\n\n3x + 5 = 4x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nNext, rearrange the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n4x^2 - 4x - 3x + 1 - 5 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0\n\nNow, we will attempt to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(4x + 1)(x - 4) = 0\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n4x + 1 = 0\n4x = -1\nx = -1/4\n\nx - 4 = 0\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solutions to the radical equation are x = -1/4 and x = 4."
