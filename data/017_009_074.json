    "message_1": "Find all possible group tables for groups of order 9 and determine which tables correspond to the cyclic group C9 and which correspond to the non-abelian group of order 9.",
    "message_2": "Since the order of the group is 9, there are two possibilities for the group structure: either the group is cyclic (isomorphic to C9) or it is the non-abelian group of order 9. However, since 9 is a prime power (3^2), there are no non-abelian groups of order 9. Therefore, the only possible group of order 9 is the cyclic group C9.\n\nNow, let's construct the group table for C9. The elements of C9 can be represented as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, where the operation is addition modulo 9. The group table for C9 is as follows:\n\n```\n  + | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n----+-------------------\n  0 | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n  1 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0\n  2 | 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1\n  3 | 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2\n  4 | 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3\n  5 | 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4\n  6 | 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 5\n  7 | 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n  8 | 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\nSince there are no non-abelian groups of order 9, all group tables of order 9 correspond to the cyclic group C9."
