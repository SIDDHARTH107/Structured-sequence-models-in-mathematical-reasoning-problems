    "message_2": "To determine the exact diameter of G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. First, let's analyze the given information.\n\nA simple connected graph G has 10 vertices and 15 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple connected graph with n vertices can be found using the formula:\n\nmax_edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor our graph with 10 vertices:\n\nmax_edges = 10 * (10 - 1) / 2 = 10 * 9 / 2 = 45\n\nSince our graph has 15 edges, it is not a complete graph (which would have 45 edges). Now, let's consider the minimum degree of any vertex in the graph. By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nsum_degrees = 2 * 15 = 30\n\nSince there are 10 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is 3. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more.\n\nNow, let's consider the diameter of the graph. The diameter is the longest shortest path between any two vertices. In the worst case, the graph could be a tree (i.e., no cycles) with one vertex having a degree of 3 and the other vertices having a degree of 1 or 2. In this case, the longest shortest path would be between the two vertices that are farthest apart in the tree.\n\nLet's construct a tree with 10 vertices and 15 edges that has the longest possible diameter. We can start with a central vertex (vertex A) connected to three other vertices (B, C, and D). Each of these vertices can be connected to two other vertices (E, F, G, H, I, and J). This tree has 10 vertices and 9 edges, as shown below:\n\n```\n    E       F\n     \\     /\n      B - A - C\n     /     \\\n    G       H\n```\n\nThe longest shortest path in this tree is between vertices E and F, E and G, E and H, F and G, F and H, or G and H. The shortest path between any of these pairs of vertices is through vertex A, so the diameter of this tree is 3.\n\nSince this tree has fewer than 15 edges, we can add more edges to the graph without changing the diameter. For example, we can add edges between vertices B and C, B and D, and C and D. This would result in a graph with 10 vertices and 12 edges, but the diameter would still be 3.\n\nTherefore, the exact diameter of the simple connected graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges is 3."
