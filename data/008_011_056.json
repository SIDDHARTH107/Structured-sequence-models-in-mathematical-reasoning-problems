    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constant terms (Dx, Dy, Dz).\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  1 -1 |\n| 1 -1  3 |\n| 3  4  2 |\n\nLet's find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):\nD = 2((-1)(2) - (3)(4)) - 1((1)(2) - (3)(3)) + (-1)((1)(4) - (-1)(3))\nD = 2(-2 - 12) - 1(2 - 9) - (4 + 3)\nD = 2(-14) + 1(7) - 7\nD = -28 + 7 - 7\nD = -28\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column with the constant terms (Dx):\n| 5  1 -1 |\n| 4 -1  3 |\n| 7  4  2 |\n\nDx = 5((-1)(2) - (3)(4)) - 1((4)(2) - (3)(7)) + (-1)((4)(4) - (-1)(7))\nDx = 5(-2 - 12) - 1(8 - 21) + (16 + 7)\nDx = 5(-14) + 1(13) + 23\nDx = -70 + 13 + 23\nDx = -34\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column with the constant terms (Dy):\n| 2  5 -1 |\n| 1  4  3 |\n| 3  7  2 |\n\nDy = 2((4)(2) - (3)(7)) - 5((1)(2) - (3)(3)) + (-1)((1)(7) - (4)(3))\nDy = 2(8 - 21) - 5(2 - 9) + (3 - 12)\nDy = 2(-13) + 5(7) - 9\nDy = -26 + 35 - 9\nDy = 0\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the third column with the constant terms (Dz):\n| 2  1  5 |\n| 1 -1  4 |\n| 3  4  7 |\n\nDz = 2((-1)(7) - (4)(4)) - 1((1)(7) - (-1)(3)) + 5((1)(4) - (-1)(3))\nDz = 2(-7 - 16) - 1(7 + 3) + 5(4 + 3)\nDz = 2(-23) - 1(10) + 5(7)\nDz = -46 - 10 + 35\nDz = -21\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z using the determinants:\n\nx = Dx / D = -34 / -28 = 17/14\ny = Dy / D = 0 / -28 = 0\nz = Dz / D = -21 / -28 = 3/4\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\nx = 17/14, y = 0, z = 3/4"
