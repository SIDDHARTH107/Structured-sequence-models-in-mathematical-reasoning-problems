    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the plaintext message \"101110\" using Feistel cipher structure with the key \"010101\". Each round of the Feistel cipher involves the use of two functions, F and XOR. The F function takes in a 4-bit input and outputs a 4-bit output, and the XOR operation returns the exclusive OR of the two inputs. \n\nAssuming that the Feistel cipher will be implemented with 4 rounds, what will be the ciphertext produced by the Feistel cipher structure for this given plaintext message and key?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the Feistel cipher structure for 4 rounds. The plaintext message \"101110\" is 6 bits long, so we will split it into two equal parts, L0 and R0, each of 3 bits. The key \"010101\" is also 6 bits long, so we will split it into two equal parts, K1 and K2, each of 3 bits.\n\nL0 = \"101\"\nR0 = \"110\"\nK1 = \"010\"\nK2 = \"101\"\n\nNow, let's perform the 4 rounds of the Feistel cipher:\n\nRound 1:\nL1 = R0\nR1 = L0 XOR F(R0, K1)\n\nRound 2:\nL2 = R1\nR2 = L1 XOR F(R1, K2)\n\nRound 3:\nL3 = R2\nR3 = L2 XOR F(R2, K1)\n\nRound 4:\nL4 = R3\nR4 = L3 XOR F(R3, K2)\n\nSince we don't have the F function, we can't compute the exact ciphertext. However, if you provide the F function, we can compute the ciphertext for the given plaintext message and key."
