    "message_2": "To find the determinant of a 2x2 matrix A, we use the formula:\n\ndet(A) = ad - bc\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the elements of the matrix A:\n\n```\n[a b]\n[c d]\n```\n\nIn this case, the matrix A is:\n\n```\n[5 3]\n[2 7]\n```\n\nSo, a = 5, b = 3, c = 2, and d = 7.\n\nNow, we can calculate the determinant:\n\ndet(A) = (5 * 7) - (3 * 2)\ndet(A) = 35 - 6\ndet(A) = 29\n\nTherefore, the determinant of the matrix A is 29."
