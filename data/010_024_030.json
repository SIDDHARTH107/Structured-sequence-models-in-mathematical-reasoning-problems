    "message_2": "To find the hyperbolic area of a triangle in a hyperbolic plane, we can use the hyperbolic version of the Law of Cosines and the Lobachevsky formula.\n\nThe hyperbolic Law of Cosines states:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle C. Rearranging the formula to solve for cos(C), we get:\n\ncos(C) = (cosh(c) - cosh(a) * cosh(b)) / (sinh(a) * sinh(b))\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths (a = 3, b = 4, c = 5):\n\ncos(C) = (cosh(5) - cosh(3) * cosh(4)) / (sinh(3) * sinh(4))\n\ncos(C) ≈ -0.015192246\n\nNow that we have the angle C, we can use the Lobachevsky formula to find the hyperbolic area of the triangle:\n\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\n\nSince we only have the angle C, we need to find angles A and B using the hyperbolic Law of Cosines:\n\ncos(A) = (cosh(a) - cosh(b) * cosh(c)) / (sinh(b) * sinh(c))\ncos(B) = (cosh(b) - cosh(a) * cosh(c)) / (sinh(a) * sinh(c))\n\ncos(A) ≈ 0.367879441\ncos(B) ≈ 0.018315639\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (arccos) of these values to get the angles A and B:\n\nA ≈ arccos(0.367879441) ≈ 1.190289949\nB ≈ arccos(0.018315639) ≈ 1.552703507\n\nFinally, we can plug these angles into the Lobachevsky formula:\n\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\nArea ≈ 3.141592653 - (1.190289949 + 1.552703507 + arccos(-0.015192246))\nArea ≈ 3.141592653 - (1.190289949 + 1.552703507 + 1.586430206)\nArea ≈ 3.141592653 - 4.329423662\n\nArea ≈ -1.187830009\n\nHowever, the area of a triangle cannot be negative. This indicates that the given side lengths do not form a valid hyperbolic triangle. In a hyperbolic plane, the sum of the angles in a triangle is always less than π, and the side lengths must satisfy certain conditions. In this case, the given side lengths do not form a valid hyperbolic triangle, so the problem cannot be solved."
