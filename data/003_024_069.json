    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v||\n\nwhere \"•\" denotes the dot product and \"||v||\" denotes the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the components of vectors u and v:\n\nu_x = 5 * cos(30°) = 5 * (√3 / 2) = (5√3) / 2\nu_y = 5 * sin(30°) = 5 * (1 / 2) = 5 / 2\n\nv_x = 3 * cos(60°) = 3 * (1 / 2) = 3 / 2\nv_y = 3 * sin(60°) = 3 * (√3 / 2) = (3√3) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = u_x * v_x + u_y * v_y = (5√3 / 2) * (3 / 2) + (5 / 2) * (3√3 / 2) = (15√3 / 4) + (15√3 / 4) = 15√3 / 2\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of vector v:\n\n||v|| = √(v_x^2 + v_y^2) = √((3 / 2)^2 + (3√3 / 2)^2) = √(9 / 4 + 27 / 4) = √(36 / 4) = √9 = 3\n\nFinally, let's find the projection of vector u onto vector v:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v|| = (15√3 / 2) / 3 = 5√3 / 2\n\nSo, the projection of vector u onto vector v is (5√3 / 2) units."
