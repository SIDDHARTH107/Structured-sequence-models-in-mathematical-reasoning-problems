    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism type of the group G with the given presentation, we can first analyze the relations given.\n\n1. a^5 = e and b^2 = e: This tells us that the order of a is 5 and the order of b is 2.\n\n2. ba = a^2b: This is a commutation relation between a and b.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isomorphism types for a group of order 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. The possible isomorphism types for a group of order 40 are:\n\n1. C_40 (cyclic group of order 40)\n2. C_5 x C_8 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 5 and 8)\n3. C_5 x C_2 x C_4 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 5, 2, and 4)\n4. C_5 x D_4 (direct product of cyclic group of order 5 and dihedral group of order 8)\n5. C_5 x Q_8 (direct product of cyclic group of order 5 and quaternion group of order 8)\n\nNow, let's analyze which of these possibilities can be eliminated based on the given presentation:\n\n1. C_40: In this case, there would be only one generator, but we have two generators a and b in the presentation. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C_40.\n\n2. C_5 x C_8: In this case, the generators a and b would commute (ab = ba), but the given relation is ba = a^2b, which means they do not commute. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C_5 x C_8.\n\n3. C_5 x C_2 x C_4: In this case, the generators a and b would also commute (ab = ba), but the given relation is ba = a^2b. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C_5 x C_2 x C_4.\n\n4. C_5 x D_4: In this case, the generator a would have order 5, and the generator b would have order 2. The relation ba = a^2b is consistent with the dihedral group D_4. So, G can be isomorphic to C_5 x D_4.\n\n5. C_5 x Q_8: In this case, the generator a would have order 5, and the generator b would have order 2. However, the relation ba = a^2b is not consistent with the quaternion group Q_8. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C_5 x Q_8.\n\nBased on the analysis, the group G with the given presentation is isomorphic to C_5 x D_4."
