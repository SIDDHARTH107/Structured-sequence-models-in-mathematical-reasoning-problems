    "message_1": "A basketball coach has seven players on his team. He wants to divide them into two teams for a scrimmage game. However, he wants to make sure that no player plays on the same team as someone they don't get along with. \n\nAssuming there are two players who don't get along with each other, how many ways can the coach divide his team into two teams so that these two players are not on the same team?",
    "message_2": "Let's label the players A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, with A and B being the two players who don't get along. We need to divide the remaining five players (C, D, E, F, and G) into two teams, with A and B each being on separate teams.\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n1. A and B are each on a team with at least one other player.\n2. One of A or B is on a team by themselves.\n\nCase 1: A and B are each on a team with at least one other player.\nWe can divide the remaining five players into two non-empty teams in the following ways:\n- 1 player with A, 4 players with B: There are 5 ways to choose which player goes with A.\n- 2 players with A, 3 players with B: There are 5 choose 2 = 10 ways to choose which two players go with A.\n- 3 players with A, 2 players with B: This is symmetric to the previous case, so there are also 10 ways.\n- 4 players with A, 1 player with B: This is symmetric to the first case, so there are 5 ways.\n\nIn total, there are 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30 ways for case 1.\n\nCase 2: One of A or B is on a team by themselves.\nThere are two ways this can happen: either A is alone and all five other players are with B, or B is alone and all five other players are with A. So, there are 2 ways for case 2.\n\nAdding the possibilities from both cases, there are 30 + 2 = 32 ways to divide the team into two teams so that A and B are not on the same team."
