    "message_1": "A basketball coach has 10 players on his team. He wants to choose 5 players to form a starting lineup. How many different starting lineups can he choose if he wants to have a point guard, a shooting guard, a small forward, a power forward, and a center on the court?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different starting lineups, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of players (10) and k is the number of players to choose (5).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, the coach can choose 252 different starting lineups with a point guard, a shooting guard, a small forward, a power forward, and a center on the court."
