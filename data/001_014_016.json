    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √108, we need to find the prime factors of 108 and look for pairs of the same factors.\n\n108 can be factored as follows:\n\n108 = 2 × 54\n54 = 2 × 27\n27 = 3 × 9\n9 = 3 × 3\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 108 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n\nNow, we group the factors in pairs:\n\n√(2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3) = √(2² × 3³)\n\nSince there is a pair of 2s and a pair of 3s, we can take them out of the square root:\n\n2 × 3 × √3 = 6√3\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 6√3."
