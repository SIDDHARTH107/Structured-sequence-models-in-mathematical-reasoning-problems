    "message_1": "A math student wants to form a committee of 4 members from a group of 10 people. How many different committees can be formed if 2 specific individuals must be included in the committee?",
    "message_2": "Since 2 specific individuals must be included in the committee, we need to choose the remaining 2 members from the remaining 8 people (10 people in total minus the 2 specific individuals). We can use the combination formula to determine the number of ways to choose 2 members from 8 people:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people and k is the number of people we want to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 and k = 2:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\n= 8! / (2!6!)\n= (8 × 7 × 6!)/(2 × 6!)\n= (8 × 7)/2\n= 28\n\nSo, there are 28 different committees that can be formed with the 2 specific individuals included."
