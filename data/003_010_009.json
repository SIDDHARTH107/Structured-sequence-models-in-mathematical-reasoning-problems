    "message_1": "A building is 100 meters tall. From a distance of 50 meters away from the building's base, you measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 60 degrees. What is the height of the building as measured from your line of sight?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have the angle of elevation (60 degrees), the distance from the building (50 meters), and we want to find the height of the building as measured from the line of sight.\n\nLet h be the height of the building as measured from the line of sight. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60) = h / 50\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so we have:\n\n√3 = h / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 50 * √3\n\nh ≈ 50 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building as measured from the line of sight is approximately 86.6 meters."
