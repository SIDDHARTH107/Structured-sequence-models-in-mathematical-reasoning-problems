    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = x^3 between the limits x = 0 and x = 1, we need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the given interval.\n\nThe area A can be found using the formula:\n\nA = âˆ«(x^2 - x^3) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we integrate the function:\n\nA = [ (1/3)x^3 - (1/4)x^4 ] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we substitute the limits:\n\nA = ( (1/3)(1)^3 - (1/4)(1)^4 ) - ( (1/3)(0)^3 - (1/4)(0)^4 )\n\nA = (1/3 - 1/4) - (0)\n\nA = 1/12\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = x^3 between the limits x = 0 and x = 1 is 1/12 square units."
