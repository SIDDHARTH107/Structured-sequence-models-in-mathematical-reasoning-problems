    "message_2": "The central finite difference method is a numerical method to approximate the first derivative of a function. The formula for the central finite difference method is:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nGiven the function f(x) = cos(x), x = pi/4, and h = 0.1, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(pi/4) ≈ (cos(pi/4 + 0.1) - cos(pi/4 - 0.1)) / (2 * 0.1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n\ncos(pi/4 + 0.1) ≈ cos(0.886) ≈ 0.636396\ncos(pi/4 - 0.1) ≈ cos(0.686) ≈ 0.769286\n\nPlugging these values back into the formula:\n\nf'(pi/4) ≈ (0.636396 - 0.769286) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ -0.13289 / 0.2 ≈ -0.66445\n\nSo, the first derivative of the function f(x) = cos(x) at x = pi/4 using the central finite difference method is approximately -0.66445.\n\nNow, let's approximate the error using the formula for the truncation error. The truncation error for the central finite difference method is given by:\n\nError ≈ (h^2 / 6) * f'''(c)\n\nwhere c is a value between x - h and x + h. Since the third derivative of cos(x) is sin(x), we can write:\n\nError ≈ (h^2 / 6) * sin(c)\n\nWe know that h = 0.1 and sin(c) is bounded by -1 and 1, so the maximum error can be:\n\nError ≈ (0.1^2 / 6) * 1 ≈ 0.001667\n\nThus, the approximate error in our answer using the central finite difference method is 0.001667."
