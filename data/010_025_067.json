    "message_2": "To calculate the dimension of the vector space assigned to the entire surface by this TQFT, we can use the Atiyah-Segal axioms for TQFTs. In particular, we will use the following properties:\n\n1. The TQFT assigns a vector space V(Σ) to each closed, oriented surface Σ.\n2. The TQFT assigns a linear map Z(M): V(Σ₁) → V(Σ₂) to each cobordism M between Σ₁ and Σ₂.\n3. The TQFT satisfies the composition law: if M₁ is a cobordism from Σ₁ to Σ₂ and M₂ is a cobordism from Σ₂ to Σ₃, then Z(M₂ ∘ M₁) = Z(M₂) ∘ Z(M₁).\n\nNow, let's consider the genus 2 surface, which can be obtained by gluing two tori along a common circle. Let T be a torus and C be the common circle. According to the given TQFT properties, we have:\n\n- V(T) is a 4-dimensional vector space, since the TQFT assigns a vector space of dimension 4 to any point on the surface.\n- Z(C): V(T) → V(T) is a linear map of determinant 1, since the TQFT assigns a linear map of determinant 1 to any one-dimensional oriented manifold embedded in the surface.\n\nNow, let's glue two tori along the common circle C. By the gluing property, the TQFT structure on the glued surface is unique. Let Σ be the resulting genus 2 surface. Then, we have a cobordism M from T to Σ, and the TQFT assigns a linear map Z(M): V(T) → V(Σ).\n\nSince Z(C) is a linear map of determinant 1, it is invertible. Therefore, we can compose Z(M) with the inverse of Z(C) to obtain a new linear map Z(M ∘ C⁻¹): V(T) → V(Σ). By the composition law, we have:\n\nZ(M ∘ C⁻¹) = Z(M) ∘ Z(C⁻¹)\n\nSince Z(C⁻¹) is also a linear map of determinant 1, the composition Z(M) ∘ Z(C⁻¹) is a linear map from a 4-dimensional vector space to V(Σ) with determinant 1. This implies that the dimension of V(Σ) must also be 4.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the vector space assigned to the entire genus 2 surface by this TQFT is 4."
