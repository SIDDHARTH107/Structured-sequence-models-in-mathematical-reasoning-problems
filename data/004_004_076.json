    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 - 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral between the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 - 2x + 3.\n\nFirst, we find the indefinite integral of the function:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 - 2x + 3) dx = (1/3)x^3 - x^2 + 3x + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral between the limits x = 0 and x = 4:\n\nArea = [(1/3)(4)^3 - (4)^2 + 3(4)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 - (0)^2 + 3(0)]\n\nArea = [(1/3)(64) - 16 + 12] - [0]\n\nArea = [21.333 - 4] = 17.333 square units.\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve y = x^2 - 2x + 3 and the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 4 is approximately 17.333 square units."
