    "message_1": "Suppose the probability that a certain company's stock price increases is 0.6 and the probability that it decreases is 0.4. If the stock price increases, the average increase is $5, but if it decreases, the average decrease is $2.50. What is the expected value of the stock price change?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the stock price change, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding value of that outcome and then sum the results.\n\nExpected value = (Probability of increase * Average increase) + (Probability of decrease * Average decrease)\n\nExpected value = (0.6 * $5) + (0.4 * -$2.50)\n\nExpected value = ($3) + (-$1)\n\nExpected value = $2\n\nSo, the expected value of the stock price change is $2."
