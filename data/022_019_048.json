    "message_2": "We will use the residue theorem to compute the integral. Consider the contour integral\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}dz$$\nwhere $C$ is a semicircle in the upper half-plane with radius $R$ and centered at the origin, and the contour is oriented counterclockwise. As $R\\to\\infty$, the integral over the circular part of the contour goes to zero, since $|f(z)|\\leq e^{\\pi|z|}$ and $|z^2+1|\\geq |z|^2-1$. Thus, we have\n$$\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{x^2+1}dx$$\n\nNow, we need to find the residues of the function $\\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}$ at its poles. The poles are the solutions of $z^2+1=0$, which are $z=i$ and $z=-i$. Since the contour is in the upper half-plane, we only need to consider the pole at $z=i$. \n\nBy the residue theorem, we have\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{x^2+1}dx = 2\\pi i \\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}, z=i\\right)$$\n\nTo find the residue, we can use the formula\n$$\\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}, z=i\\right) = \\lim_{z\\to i} (z-i)\\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is entire, we can evaluate the limit directly:\n$$\\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\frac{f(z)}{z^2+1}, z=i\\right) = \\frac{f(i)}{(i+1)(i-1)} = \\frac{f(i)}{2i}$$\n\nTherefore, we have\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{x^2+1}dx = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\frac{f(i)}{2i} = \\pi f(i)$$"
