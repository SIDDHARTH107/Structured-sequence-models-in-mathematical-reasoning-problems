    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve of level n makes a total of 4^n turns.\n\nFor level 1, there are 4 turns, as mentioned in the example.\n\nFor level 2, each of the 4 segments from level 1 is replaced by a scaled-down version of the level 1 curve, which has 4 turns each. So, there are 4 * 4 = 4^2 = 16 turns.\n\nFor level 3, each of the 16 segments from level 2 is replaced by a scaled-down version of the level 1 curve, which has 4 turns each. So, there are 16 * 4 = 4^3 = 64 turns.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the total number of turns made by the Hilbert curve of level n is 4^n."
