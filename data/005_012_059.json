    "message_1": "A company produces a large number of light bulbs and the standard deviation of their lifespan is 100 hours. If a sample of 25 bulbs is selected at random and their mean lifespan is calculated, what is the probability that the sample mean lifespan is more than 1500 hours? Assume that the lifespan of the bulbs is normally distributed.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of z-scores and the standard normal distribution. First, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ_population / √n\n\nwhere σ_population is the standard deviation of the population (in this case, the lifespan of the bulbs), n is the sample size, and σ_sample_mean is the standard deviation of the sample mean.\n\nGiven that the standard deviation of the population is 100 hours and the sample size is 25, we can calculate the standard deviation of the sample mean:\n\nσ_sample_mean = 100 / √25 = 100 / 5 = 20 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score corresponding to a sample mean of 1500 hours. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the value of interest (in this case, the sample mean of 1500 hours), μ is the population mean, and σ is the standard deviation of the sample mean.\n\nWe are not given the population mean (μ) in the problem, so we cannot directly calculate the z-score. However, we can still express the z-score in terms of the population mean:\n\nz = (1500 - μ) / 20\n\nTo find the probability that the sample mean lifespan is more than 1500 hours, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve to the right of this z-score. This can be done using a standard normal table or a calculator with a built-in normal distribution function.\n\nSince we don't have the population mean (μ), we cannot provide an exact probability. However, if you are given the population mean or can estimate it from other information, you can use the z-score formula and a standard normal table or calculator to find the probability."
