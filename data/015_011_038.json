    "message_1": "Consider a double pendulum consisting of two rods of length 1m each. Assume that the mass of each pendulum is evenly distributed along its corresponding rod. If the initial angles of the two rods are 45 degrees and 60 degrees with respect to the vertical, what is the final angle of the second pendulum after 100 iterations of its movement, assuming the gravitational acceleration is 9.81 m/sÂ² and there is no air resistance?",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum is a complex system with chaotic behavior, which means that it is highly sensitive to initial conditions and difficult to predict its motion analytically. To find the final angle of the second pendulum after 100 iterations, we need to use numerical methods to simulate the motion of the double pendulum.\n\nHere, we will use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum. The equations of motion for a double pendulum can be derived using the Lagrangian method, which results in a set of coupled second-order differential equations. These equations can be found in many classical mechanics textbooks or online resources.\n\nTo implement the Runge-Kutta method, we first need to convert the second-order differential equations into a set of first-order differential equations. Then, we can use a programming language (such as Python) to implement the Runge-Kutta method and simulate the motion of the double pendulum.\n\nAfter simulating the motion for 100 iterations (or any other desired number of iterations), we can obtain the final angle of the second pendulum. Note that the result will depend on the time step used in the simulation and the number of iterations. The smaller the time step and the larger the number of iterations, the more accurate the result will be.\n\nHowever, due to the chaotic nature of the double pendulum, it is impossible to provide an exact final angle without running the simulation."
