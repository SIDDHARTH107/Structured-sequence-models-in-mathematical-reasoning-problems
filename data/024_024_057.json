    "message_2": "To find the Cartan connection 1-forms ω^i_j, we first need to compute the dual coframe θ^i, which is the dual basis to the orthonormal frame v_i. In our case, we have:\n\nθ^1 = dr\nθ^2 = γ(θ) dθ\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivatives of the coframe:\n\ndθ^1 = 0\ndθ^2 = γ'(θ) dθ ∧ dr\n\nNext, we need to express the exterior derivatives in terms of the coframe:\n\ndθ^1 = 0 = ω^1_2 ∧ θ^2\ndθ^2 = γ'(θ) dθ ∧ dr = ω^2_1 ∧ θ^1\n\nComparing the coefficients, we obtain the Cartan connection 1-forms:\n\nω^1_2 = 0\nω^2_1 = γ'(θ) θ^2\n\nThus, the Cartan connection 1-forms with respect to the orthonormal frame v_1 = ∂r and v_2 = 1/γ(θ) ∂θ on M are:\n\nω^1_2 = 0\nω^2_1 = γ'(θ) θ^2"
