    "message_2": "A graph with six vertices in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge is called a complete graph, denoted by K_6. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nA complete subgraph (or clique) is a subgraph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph.\n\nIn the case of K_6, the largest complete subgraph is the graph itself, as every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, the clique number of the graph G (K_6) is 6."
