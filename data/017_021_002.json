    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16, and they are not normal.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. If n_3 = 4, then there are four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3, and they are not normal.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup Q. The group G is the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G = P x Q. Since P has order 16 and Q has order 3, G is isomorphic to Z_16 x Z_3. There is only one group of this type.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup P and four non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups. The group G is a semidirect product of P and one of the Sylow 3-subgroups Q, i.e., G = P ⋊ Q. There are two non-isomorphic groups of this type: the dihedral group D_48 and the quaternion group Q_48.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup Q. The group G is a semidirect product of one of the Sylow 2-subgroups P and Q, i.e., G = P ⋊ Q. There is only one group of this type, which is the semidirect product of Z_16 and Z_3, denoted as Z_16 ⋊ Z_3.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there are three non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups and four non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups. However, there are no non-isomorphic groups of this type.\n\nIn summary, there are five non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. Z_16 x Z_3\n2. D_48 (dihedral group)\n3. Q_48 (quaternion group)\n4. Z_16 ⋊ Z_3 (semidirect product)"
