    "message_1": "Suppose a researcher collects data from 100 participants on their responses to 10 different survey questions. Using factor analysis, the researcher wants to determine whether the questions can be grouped into distinct factors. The researcher can use the eigenvalue criterion to determine how many factors to retain. If the researcher finds that the first three factors have eigenvalues of 3.71, 2.81, and 1.48, respectively, what is the total variance explained by these three factors?",
    "message_2": "To find the total variance explained by the first three factors, we simply add their eigenvalues together:\n\nTotal variance = 3.71 + 2.81 + 1.48 = 8.00\n\nSo, the total variance explained by the first three factors is 8.00."
