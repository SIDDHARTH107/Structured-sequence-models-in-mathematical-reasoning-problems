    "message_2": "To find the number of second-order definable subsets of the Cartesian product A × B, we first need to find the cardinality of A × B. Since A has 3 elements and B has 4 elements, the cardinality of A × B is 3 × 4 = 12.\n\nNow, a second-order definable subset is a subset that can be defined by a second-order formula. In this case, we are looking for the number of subsets of A × B. The number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. So, the number of subsets of A × B is 2^(12) = 4096.\n\nTherefore, there are 4096 second-order definable subsets of the Cartesian product A × B."
