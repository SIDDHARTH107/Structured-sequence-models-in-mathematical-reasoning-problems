    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the system, we first need to apply the Fourier transform to both the input and output signals. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nF{f(t)} = F(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nwhere F{f(t)} is the Fourier transform of the function f(t), and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nLet's first find the Fourier transform of the input signal u(t) = 5cos(2πt):\n\nF{u(t)} = F{5cos(2πt)} = 5/2 [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal y(t) = sin(2πt) + 3cos(4πt):\n\nF{y(t)} = F{sin(2πt) + 3cos(4πt)} = (1/2j) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + (3/2) [δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nNow that we have the Fourier transforms of both the input and output signals, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing the output transform by the input transform:\n\nH(ω) = F{y(t)} / F{u(t)} = [(1/2j) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + (3/2) [δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π)]] / [5/2 [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]]\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can analyze the transfer function at the frequencies where the Dirac delta functions are non-zero:\n\n1. At ω = 2π:\nH(2π) = [(1/2j) (1 - 1) + (3/2) (0 + 0)] / [5/2 (1 + 1)] = 0\n\n2. At ω = -2π:\nH(-2π) = [(1/2j) (-1 + 1) + (3/2) (0 + 0)] / [5/2 (1 + 1)] = 0\n\n3. At ω = 4π:\nH(4π) = [(1/2j) (0 - 0) + (3/2) (1 + 1)] / [5/2 (0 + 0)] = undefined\n\n4. At ω = -4π:\nH(-4π) = [(1/2j) (0 - 0) + (3/2) (1 + 1)] / [5/2 (0 + 0)] = undefined\n\nThe transfer function H(ω) is only defined at ω = 2π and ω = -2π, and its value is 0 at these frequencies. Therefore, the transfer function of the system is:\n\nH(ω) = 0 for ω = ±2π\nH(ω) = undefined for ω = ±4π"
