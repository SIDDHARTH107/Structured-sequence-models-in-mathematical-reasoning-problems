    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y. To produce one unit of X, the company requires 5 units of raw material A and 2 units of raw material B. To produce one unit of Y, the company requires 3 units of raw material A and 4 units of raw material B. The company has 60 units of raw material A and 40 units of raw material B available. The profit from one unit of X is $10 and the profit from one unit of Y is $15. Using the Firefly algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of X and Y that should be produced to maximize the company's profit, and find the maximum profit the company can earn.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is not suitable for solving this linear programming problem directly. Instead, we can solve this problem using a more appropriate method, such as the simplex method or graphical method.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. The constraints for raw materials A and B can be written as:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 60 (raw material A constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 40 (raw material B constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nUsing the graphical method, we can plot the constraints and find the feasible region:\n\n1. For the raw material A constraint: y ≤ (60 - 5x) / 3\n2. For the raw material B constraint: y ≤ (40 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 10), (12, 0), and (6, 8). We can now evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 10) = 10(0) + 15(10) = $150\n3. P(12, 0) = 10(12) + 15(0) = $120\n4. P(6, 8) = 10(6) + 15(8) = $180\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (6, 8), with a profit of $180. Therefore, the company should produce 6 units of product X and 8 units of product Y to maximize its profit."
