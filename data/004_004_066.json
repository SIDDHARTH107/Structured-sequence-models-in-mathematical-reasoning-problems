    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 3.\n\nThe integral of x^2 with respect to x is (x^3)/3 + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, since we are finding a definite integral, we don't need to worry about the constant.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the given limits:\n\nâˆ«(x^2)dx from 0 to 3 = [(3^3)/3] - [(0^3)/3]\n= (27/3) - (0/3)\n= 9\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 3 is 9 square units."
