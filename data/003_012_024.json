    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on a hill. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is 40 degrees. If the distance from the point on the ground to the foot of the flagpole is 25 meters, find the height of the flagpole (rounded to the nearest meter).",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We have a right triangle with the angle of elevation (40 degrees), the distance from the point on the ground to the foot of the flagpole (25 meters), and the height of the flagpole (h meters).\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(40°) = h / 25\n\nTo find the height h, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nh = 25 * tan(40°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 40 degrees and multiply it by 25:\n\nh ≈ 25 * 0.8391\nh ≈ 20.9775\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 21 meters."
