    "message_1": "A communication system transmits a signal with a frequency of 1 GHz and an amplitude of 10 V. This signal is sent through a medium with a frequency-dependent attenuation factor given by the equation:\n\nAttenuation (dB) = 10log(1 + (f/f_c)^2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the signal in Hz and f_c is the cutoff frequency in Hz. If the cutoff frequency is 2 GHz, what is the amplitude of the transmitted signal after passing through the medium? Use the Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the transmitted signal after passing through the medium, we first need to calculate the attenuation at the given frequency (1 GHz) using the provided equation:\n\nAttenuation (dB) = 10log(1 + (f/f_c)^2)\n\nwhere f = 1 GHz = 1 * 10^9 Hz and f_c = 2 GHz = 2 * 10^9 Hz.\n\nAttenuation (dB) = 10log(1 + (1 * 10^9 / 2 * 10^9)^2)\nAttenuation (dB) = 10log(1 + (1/2)^2)\nAttenuation (dB) = 10log(1 + 1/4)\nAttenuation (dB) = 10log(5/4)\nAttenuation (dB) ≈ 0.9691 dB\n\nNow, we need to convert the attenuation in dB to a linear scale. The formula for converting dB to a linear scale is:\n\nLinear Attenuation = 10^(Attenuation (dB) / 20)\n\nLinear Attenuation = 10^(0.9691 / 20)\nLinear Attenuation ≈ 1.0548\n\nThe linear attenuation represents the factor by which the amplitude of the signal is reduced. To find the amplitude of the transmitted signal after passing through the medium, we multiply the initial amplitude by the linear attenuation:\n\nAmplitude_after = Amplitude_initial * Linear Attenuation\nAmplitude_after = 10 V * 1.0548\nAmplitude_after ≈ 10.548 V\n\nSo, the amplitude of the transmitted signal after passing through the medium is approximately 10.548 V."
