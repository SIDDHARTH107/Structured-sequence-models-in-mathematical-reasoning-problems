    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, player 1 is given $100 and needs to offer a split to player 2. Player 2 can either accept the split and both players keep their designated amounts, or reject it and both players receive nothing. If player 2 would accept any offer greater than $10, but refuses any offer less than that amount, what would be the optimal offer for player 1 to make?",
    "message_2": "The optimal offer for player 1 to make would be $10, as player 2 would accept any offer greater than $10. By offering $10, player 1 maximizes their own share of the $100, keeping $90 for themselves."
