    "message_1": "A factory produces smartphone batteries and wants to test the quality of the batteries by selecting a sample. The factory is divided into 5 sections and the production process in each section is believed to have a different quality of output. If the factory wants to select a sample of 15 batteries for testing, how many batteries should be taken from each section to make sure that the sample is representative of the production process in each section? \n\nAssume that the factory produces 300 batteries in total, and that each section produces a different number of batteries as follows:\n\nSection A: 60 batteries\n\nSection B: 80 batteries\n\nSection C: 40 batteries\n\nSection D: 70 batteries\n\nSection E: 50 batteries",
    "message_2": "To make sure the sample is representative of the production process in each section, we need to select batteries from each section in proportion to the number of batteries produced in that section. We can calculate the proportion for each section and then multiply it by the total sample size (15 batteries) to find out how many batteries should be taken from each section.\n\nSection A:\nProportion: 60 batteries / 300 total batteries = 1/5\nBatteries to sample: (1/5) * 15 = 3 batteries\n\nSection B:\nProportion: 80 batteries / 300 total batteries = 4/15\nBatteries to sample: (4/15) * 15 = 4 batteries\n\nSection C:\nProportion: 40 batteries / 300 total batteries = 2/15\nBatteries to sample: (2/15) * 15 = 2 batteries\n\nSection D:\nProportion: 70 batteries / 300 total batteries = 7/30\nBatteries to sample: (7/30) * 15 = 3.5 batteries\n\nSection E:\nProportion: 50 batteries / 300 total batteries = 1/6\nBatteries to sample: (1/6) * 15 = 2.5 batteries\n\nSince we cannot take a fraction of a battery, we can round the numbers for sections D and E. We can round up for section D and round down for section E to maintain the total sample size of 15 batteries.\n\nSo, the factory should take:\n- 3 batteries from Section A\n- 4 batteries from Section B\n- 2 batteries from Section C\n- 4 batteries from Section D (rounded up from 3.5)\n- 2 batteries from Section E (rounded down from 2.5)"
