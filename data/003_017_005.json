    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of a point on the edge of the wheel, we first need to find the circumference of the wheel, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = 2 * π * radius\n\nGiven the radius is 12 inches, we can calculate the circumference:\n\nC = 2 * π * 12\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 12\nC ≈ 75.39822 inches\n\nSince the wheel rotates 50 times in one minute, we can find the total distance traveled by a point on the edge of the wheel in one minute:\n\nTotal distance = Circumference * Number of rotations\nTotal distance ≈ 75.39822 * 50\nTotal distance ≈ 3769.911 inches\n\nThe average velocity of a point on the edge of the wheel in inches per minute is equal to the total distance traveled in one minute:\n\nAverage velocity ≈ 3769.911 inches/minute"
