    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{8}$, we can break down the number 8 into its prime factors.\n\n$8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 2 \\times 2}$\n\nSince we have a pair of 2's, we can take one 2 out of the square root:\n\n$\\sqrt{2 \\times 2 \\times 2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n$2\\sqrt{2}$"
