    "message_1": "A communication network transmits data through a cable. The signal passing through the cable can be represented as a voltage over time, which is periodic with a period of 0.01 seconds. The voltage signal has a Fourier transform given by:\n\nF(ω) = 2(δ(ω-1000π) + δ(ω+1000π))\n\nwhere δ represents the Dirac delta function. What is the frequency of the signal being transmitted through the cable?",
    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of the signal is given by:\n\nF(ω) = 2(δ(ω-1000π) + δ(ω+1000π))\n\nThe Dirac delta function, δ(x), is non-zero only when x = 0. In this case, the two delta functions are non-zero when:\n\nω - 1000π = 0  => ω = 1000π\nand\nω + 1000π = 0  => ω = -1000π\n\nSince the frequency cannot be negative, we consider only the positive value:\n\nω = 1000π\n\nThe angular frequency, ω, is related to the frequency, f, by the equation:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nSo, we can solve for the frequency, f:\n\nf = ω / (2π) = (1000π) / (2π) = 500 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the signal being transmitted through the cable is 500 Hz."
