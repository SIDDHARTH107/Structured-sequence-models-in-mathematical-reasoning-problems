    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of f(z) on the boundary of the disk, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle. The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) inside and on the boundary of a closed region, then the maximum and minimum of the modulus of the function occur on the boundary.\n\nIn this case, f(z) = 3z^2 - 2z + 1 is a polynomial and thus holomorphic everywhere. So, we only need to consider the boundary of the disk, which is given by |z| = 1.\n\nOn the boundary, we can write z = e^(iθ) for θ in the range [0, 2π]. Then, we can substitute this into f(z) and find the modulus:\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = 3(e^(iθ))^2 - 2e^(iθ) + 1\n= 3e^(2iθ) - 2e^(iθ) + 1\n\nNow, we find the modulus of f(e^(iθ)):\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |3e^(2iθ) - 2e^(iθ) + 1|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum of this expression, we can look for critical points by taking the derivative with respect to θ and setting it to zero:\n\nd( |f(e^(iθ))| )/dθ = 0\n\nHowever, finding the derivative of the modulus directly can be difficult. Instead, we can consider the squared modulus, which will have the same critical points:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))|^2 = (3e^(2iθ) - 2e^(iθ) + 1)(3e^(-2iθ) - 2e^(-iθ) + 1)\n= 9 - 6e^(iθ) - 6e^(-iθ) + 4\n= 13 - 6(cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)) - 6(cos(θ) - i*sin(θ))\n= 13 - 12cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative with respect to θ and setting it to zero:\n\nd( |f(e^(iθ))|^2 )/dθ = 12sin(θ) = 0\n\nThis gives us θ = 0, π as critical points. We can now evaluate the squared modulus at these points:\n\n|f(e^(i*0))|^2 = 13 - 12cos(0) = 1\n|f(e^(i*π))|^2 = 13 - 12cos(π) = 25\n\nThus, the minimum squared modulus is 1 and the maximum squared modulus is 25. Taking the square root of these values, we find that the minimum modulus of f(z) on the boundary of the disk is 1 and the maximum modulus is 5."
