    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation x^2 + y^2 = 169, we can start by noting that 169 = 13^2. Since x and y are integers, their squares must be non-negative. Therefore, the possible values for x^2 and y^2 are between 0 and 169.\n\nNow, we can try different values for x^2 and see if we can find a corresponding y^2 that satisfies the equation:\n\n1. If x^2 = 0, then y^2 = 169, which means y = ±13. So, we have two solutions: (x, y) = (0, 13) and (x, y) = (0, -13).\n\n2. If x^2 = 1, then y^2 = 168, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n3. If x^2 = 4, then y^2 = 165, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n4. If x^2 = 9, then y^2 = 160, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n5. If x^2 = 16, then y^2 = 153, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n6. If x^2 = 25, then y^2 = 144, which means y = ±12. So, we have two solutions: (x, y) = (5, 12) and (x, y) = (5, -12).\n\n7. If x^2 = 36, then y^2 = 133, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n8. If x^2 = 49, then y^2 = 120, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n9. If x^2 = 64, then y^2 = 105, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n10. If x^2 = 81, then y^2 = 88, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n11. If x^2 = 100, then y^2 = 69, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n12. If x^2 = 121, then y^2 = 48, which has no integer solutions for y.\n\n13. If x^2 = 144, then y^2 = 25, which means y = ±5. So, we have two solutions: (x, y) = (12, 5) and (x, y) = (12, -5).\n\nSince x and y are interchangeable in the equation, we also have the corresponding solutions with x and y swapped: (x, y) = (13, 0), (x, y) = (-13, 0), (x, y) = (12, -5), (x, y) = (-12, -5), (x, y) = (5, 12), and (x, y) = (-5, 12).\n\nIn summary, the integer solutions to the Diophantine equation x^2 + y^2 = 169 are:\n\n(0, 13), (0, -13), (5, 12), (5, -12), (12, 5), (12, -5), (13, 0), (-13, 0), (-5, 12), (-5, -12), (-12, 5), and (-12, -5)."
