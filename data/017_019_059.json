    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. We can list them along with their respective group structures as follows:\n\n1. C_36: The cyclic group of order 36. It has the structure C_36 = ⟨a | a^36 = 1⟩.\n\n2. C_9 × C_4: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has the structure C_9 × C_4 = ⟨a, b | a^9 = b^4 = 1, ab = ba⟩.\n\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_4: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has the structure C_3 × C_3 × C_4 = ⟨a, b, c | a^3 = b^3 = c^4 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb⟩.\n\n4. C_3 × (C_3 ⋊ C_4): The semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 12, which is itself a semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has the structure C_3 × (C_3 ⋊ C_4) = ⟨a, b, c | a^3 = b^3 = c^4 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb^2⟩.\n\nTo prove that there are no additional isomorphism classes of groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n- n_2 divides 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), so n_2 = 1 or 3.\n- n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must also be normal. In this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and its Sylow 3-subgroup, which gives us the groups C_36 and C_9 × C_4.\n\nIf n_3 = 4, then there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, and G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. In this case, G is the semi-direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and its Sylow 3-subgroup, which gives us the groups C_3 × C_3 × C_4 and C_3 × (C_3 ⋊ C_4).\n\nWe have now exhausted all possibilities for the number of Sylow subgroups, and we have found four distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 36. Therefore, there are no additional isomorphism classes of groups of order 36."
