    "message_1": "A pyramid has a rectangular base with a length of 10 cm and a width of 8 cm. The height of the pyramid is 6 cm. Find the volume of the rectangular pyramid in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a pyramid with a rectangular base, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width\nBase Area = 10 cm * 8 cm\nBase Area = 80 square centimeters\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the volume formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 80 cmÂ² * 6 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 480 cubic centimeters\nVolume = 160 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
