    "message_2": "To find the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 18, we first note that 18 = 2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 18.\n\nLet G be a group of order 18. By Sylow's first theorem, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then |P| = 2 and |Q| = 9.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can only be 1.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, both P and Q are normal in G since they are unique. By the second isomorphism theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since |P| = 2 and |Q| = 9, we have G ≅ Z_2 × Z_9. This is the first isomorphism class.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, Q is normal in G, but P is not. We can form the semidirect product of P and Q. Let φ: P → Aut(Q) be a homomorphism. Since |P| = 2, there are only two possible homomorphisms: the trivial homomorphism and the one that sends the non-identity element of P to the automorphism of Q that inverts all elements.\n\nIf we choose the trivial homomorphism, we get the direct product G ≅ Z_2 × Z_9, which we already considered in Case 1.\n\nIf we choose the non-trivial homomorphism, we get a non-abelian group G. Since |Q| = 9, Q is isomorphic to either Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. However, the automorphism that inverts all elements is only possible for Q ≅ Z_9. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_2 and Z_9, denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_2. This is the second isomorphism class.\n\nIn summary, there are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 18:\n\n1. G ≅ Z_2 × Z_9 (abelian)\n2. G ≅ Z_9 ⋊ Z_2 (non-abelian)\n\nSpecific examples of groups belonging to these classes are:\n\n1. The direct product of Z_2 and Z_9, which can be represented as the set of ordered pairs {(a, b) | a ∈ Z_2, b ∈ Z_9} with component-wise addition modulo 2 and 9, respectively.\n2. The dihedral group D_9, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 9-gon, including rotations and reflections."
