    "message_1": "Let X be a complex projective variety of dimension 3 and let Y be an algebraic subvariety of X defined by the equations:\n\n$y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 = 0$ and $y_1 y_3 - y_2 y_4 = 0$\n\nFind the intersection cohomology groups $IH^k(Y)$ for all k.",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups $IH^k(Y)$, we first need to determine the dimension and singularities of the subvariety Y.\n\nThe first equation defines a quadric hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. Since it is a non-degenerate quadric, it is smooth and has dimension 2.\n\nThe second equation is a bilinear form, which defines a linear space in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The intersection of a quadric hypersurface with a linear space is a complete intersection, and its dimension is the difference of the dimensions of the quadric and the linear space.\n\nIn this case, the dimension of Y is $2 - 1 = 1$. Thus, Y is a curve in $\\mathbb{P}^3$.\n\nNow, we compute the intersection cohomology groups $IH^k(Y)$. Since Y is a curve, the only non-trivial intersection cohomology groups are $IH^0(Y)$, $IH^1(Y)$, and $IH^2(Y)$.\n\n$IH^0(Y)$ is the constant sheaf on Y, which corresponds to the global sections of the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_Y$. Since Y is a projective variety, it has a unique global section, so $IH^0(Y) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n$IH^1(Y)$ is the first cohomology group of the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_Y$. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have $H^1(Y, \\mathcal{O}_Y) = H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, so $IH^1(Y) = 0$.\n\n$IH^2(Y)$ is the second cohomology group of the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_Y$. Since Y is a curve, this corresponds to the dualizing sheaf $\\omega_Y$. By the adjunction formula, we have $\\omega_Y = \\omega_X|_Y \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_Y(D)$, where D is the divisor corresponding to the linear space defined by the second equation. In this case, $\\omega_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(-4)$, so $\\omega_Y = \\mathcal{O}_Y(-4)|_Y$. Thus, $IH^2(Y) = H^0(Y, \\omega_Y) = H^0(Y, \\mathcal{O}_Y(-4)|_Y)$.\n\nIn summary, we have:\n\n$IH^0(Y) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$IH^1(Y) = 0$, and\n$IH^2(Y) = H^0(Y, \\mathcal{O}_Y(-4)|_Y)$.\n\nThe remaining intersection cohomology groups $IH^k(Y)$ for $k > 2$ are trivial since Y is a curve."
