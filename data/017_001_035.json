We will construct their group tables and show that these are the only possible group tables for groups of order 4.\n\n1. Cyclic group C4:\nLet's denote the elements of C4 as {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a has order 4. The group table for C4 is:\n\n```\n   |  e  |  a  | a^2 | a^3\n-------------------------\n e |  e  |  a  | a^2 | a^3\n a |  a  | a^2 | a^3 |  e\na^2| a^2 | a^3 |  e  |  a\na^3| a^3 |  e  |  a  | a^2\n```\n\n2. Klein four-group V4:\nLet's denote the elements of V4 as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c have order 2. The group table for V4 is:\n\n```\n   |  e  |  a  |  b  |  c\n-------------------------\n e |  e  |  a  |  b  |  c\n a |  a  |  e  |  c  |  b\n b |  b  |  c  |  e  |  a\n c |  c  |  b  |  a  |  e\n```\n\nNow, let's prove that these are the only possible group tables for groups of order 4.\n\nLet G be a group of order 4. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. Since there must be an identity element, let e be the element of order 1.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIf G has an element of order 4, say a, then G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then G = {e, a, b, ab} (since ab cannot be equal to a or b, as a and b have order 2). Since a, b, and ab all have order 2, the group table of G must be the same as the group table of V4, and G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nTherefore, the only possible group tables for a group of order 4 are those of C4 and V4."
