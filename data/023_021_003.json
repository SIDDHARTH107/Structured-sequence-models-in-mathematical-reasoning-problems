    "message_2": "i) To find the frequency-domain representation F(ω) of the given time-domain signal f(t), we need to apply the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous time-domain signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time range, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nFor the given signal f(t) = sin(2π(10^6)t) + 0.5sin(2π(20^6)t) + 0.2sin(2π(30^6)t), we can apply the Fourier transform to each term separately and then sum the results.\n\nLet's denote the three terms as f1(t), f2(t), and f3(t):\n\nf1(t) = sin(2π(10^6)t)\nf2(t) = 0.5sin(2π(20^6)t)\nf3(t) = 0.2sin(2π(30^6)t)\n\nNow, we apply the Fourier transform to each term:\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[f1(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nF2(ω) = ∫[f2(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nF3(ω) = ∫[f3(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThe Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF{sin(2πft)} = (j/2) [δ(ω - 2πf) - δ(ω + 2πf)], where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nApplying this to our terms, we get:\n\nF1(ω) = (j/2) [δ(ω - 2π(10^6)) - δ(ω + 2π(10^6))]\nF2(ω) = 0.5(j/2) [δ(ω - 2π(20^6)) - δ(ω + 2π(20^6))]\nF3(ω) = 0.2(j/2) [δ(ω - 2π(30^6)) - δ(ω + 2π(30^6))]\n\nNow, we sum the results to get the frequency-domain representation F(ω):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω)\nF(ω) = (j/2) [δ(ω - 2π(10^6)) - δ(ω + 2π(10^6))] + 0.5(j/2) [δ(ω - 2π(20^6)) - δ(ω + 2π(20^6))] + 0.2(j/2) [δ(ω - 2π(30^6)) - δ(ω + 2π(30^6))]\n\nii) To determine the amplitude and phase angle at each of the three frequency components (10 MHz, 20 MHz, and 30 MHz), we can look at the coefficients of the Dirac delta functions in F(ω):\n\nAt 10 MHz (ω = 2π(10^6)):\nAmplitude = |(j/2)| = 1/2\nPhase angle = arg(j/2) = arg(j) = 90°\n\nAt 20 MHz (ω = 2π(20^6)):\nAmplitude = |0.5(j/2)| = 0.5/2 = 1/4\nPhase angle = arg(0.5(j/2)) = arg(j) = 90°\n\nAt 30 MHz (ω = 2π(30^6)):\nAmplitude = |0.2(j/2)| = 0.2/2 = 1/10\nPhase angle = arg(0.2(j/2)) = arg(j) = 90°\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase angle at the three frequency components are:\n\n10 MHz: Amplitude = 1/2, Phase angle = 90°\n20 MHz: Amplitude = 1/4, Phase angle = 90°\n30 MHz: Amplitude = 1/10, Phase angle = 90°"
