    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 6)/(x - 3) as x approaches 3, we first try to simplify the function.\n\nWe can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 2)(x - 3))/(x - 3)\n\nWe can now cancel out the (x - 3) terms:\n\nf(x) = x - 2\n\nNow that the function is simplified, we can find the limit as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x -> 3) (x - 2) = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 6)/(x - 3) as x approaches 3 is 1."
