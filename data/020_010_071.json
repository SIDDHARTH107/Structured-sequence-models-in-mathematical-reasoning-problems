    "message_1": "A manufacturing company specializes in producing car parts. The company needs to determine the optimal mix of materials to use in their brake pads to minimize the cost while ensuring a minimum level of braking capacity. The cost of each material and their respective percentages in the mix are as follows:\n\n- Material A costs $10 per kg and must make up at least 25% of the mix\n- Material B costs $8 per kg and must make up at least 20% of the mix\n- Material C costs $6 per kg and must make up at least 10% of the mix\n\nThe minimum level of braking capacity required is measured in terms of the coefficient of friction (COF). The COF must be at least 0.5. The COF for each material and their respective percentages in the mix are as follows:\n\n- Material A has a COF of 0.6\n- Material B has a COF of 0.7\n- Material C has a COF of 0.5\n\nWhat is the optimal mix of materials that the company should use in their brake pads?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the percentages of Material A, Material B, and Material C in the mix, respectively. We need to minimize the cost function while satisfying the constraints for the minimum percentages and the COF.\n\nCost function: C(x, y, z) = 10x + 8y + 6z\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y + z = 1 (The sum of the percentages must equal 100%)\n2. x >= 0.25\n3. y >= 0.20\n4. z >= 0.10\n5. 0.6x + 0.7y + 0.5z >= 0.5 (The COF constraint)\n\nWe will first find the mix that satisfies the minimum percentage constraints and the COF constraint. Since Material C is the cheapest, we will try to maximize its percentage while still satisfying the constraints.\n\nLet x = 0.25, y = 0.20, and z = 0.55. This satisfies the minimum percentage constraints. Now, let's check if it satisfies the COF constraint:\n\n0.6(0.25) + 0.7(0.20) + 0.5(0.55) = 0.15 + 0.14 + 0.275 = 0.565\n\nSince 0.565 >= 0.5, this mix satisfies the COF constraint.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of this mix:\n\nC(0.25, 0.20, 0.55) = 10(0.25) + 8(0.20) + 6(0.55) = 2.5 + 1.6 + 3.3 = 7.4\n\nSo, the optimal mix of materials that the company should use in their brake pads is 25% Material A, 20% Material B, and 55% Material C, with a cost of $7.4 per kg."
