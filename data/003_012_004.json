    "message_1": "A student is standing 40 meters away from a tree. The angle of elevation from the student's eye to the top of the tree is 30 degrees. Using trigonometry, what is the height of the tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this problem, we have the angle of elevation (30 degrees) and the distance from the student to the tree (40 meters). We want to find the height of the tree, which is the side opposite the angle. Let's call the height of the tree h.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = h / 40\n\nTo solve for h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 40:\n\nh = 40 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\nh ≈ 40 * 0.577\n\nh ≈ 23.08\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 23.08 meters."
