    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  4  6 |\n    | 4  9  7 |\n    | 6  7 12 |\n\nb = | 20 |\n    | 32 |\n    | 39 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = LL^T.\n\nL = | l11  0   0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nL^T = | l11 l21 l31 |\n      |  0  l22 l32 |\n      |  0   0  l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition method, we can find the elements of matrix L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(2) = 1.4142\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 4 / 1.4142 = 2.8284\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 6 / 1.4142 = 4.2426\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(9 - 2.8284^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (7 - 4.2426 * 2.8284) / 1 = -3\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(12 - 4.2426^2 - (-3)^2) = sqrt(3) = 1.7321\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | 1.4142  0      0     |\n    | 2.8284  1      0     |\n    | 4.2426 -3  1.7321 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n1.4142y1 = 20 => y1 = 20 / 1.4142 = 14.1421\n2.8284y1 + y2 = 32 => y2 = 32 - 2.8284 * 14.1421 = -8\n4.2426y1 - 3y2 + 1.7321y3 = 39 => y3 = (39 - 4.2426 * 14.1421 + 3 * 8) / 1.7321 = 3\n\nSo, the solution vector y is:\n\ny = | 14.1421 |\n    |    -8   |\n    |     3   |\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n1.4142x1 = 14.1421 => x1 = 14.1421 / 1.4142 = 10\n2.8284x1 + x2 = -8 => x2 = -8 - 2.8284 * 10 = -36\n4.2426x1 - 3x2 + 1.7321x3 = 3 => x3 = (3 - 4.2426 * 10 + 3 * 36) / 1.7321 = 1\n\nSo, the solution vector x is:\n\nx = | 10 |\n    | -36 |\n    |  1  |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 10, y = -36, and z = 1."
