    "message_1": "Here is a possible question for a math student to solve:\n\nA cylindrical steel pressure vessel is to be manufactured with a volume of 50 cubic meters. The material cost of the top and bottom of the vessel is $100 per square meter, while the material cost of the cylindrical portion is $50 per square meter. What are the dimensions of the vessel that minimize the material cost?\n\nNote: The student may need to assume that the wall thickness of the vessel is negligible compared to its radius and height, and that the vessel can be approximated as a solid cylinder with two hemispherical ends.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the material cost, we need to find the dimensions (radius r and height h) of the cylinder that minimize the surface area, since the cost is proportional to the surface area.\n\nThe volume of the cylinder is given by V = πr^2h, and we are given that V = 50 cubic meters. So, we have:\n\nπr^2h = 50\n\nNow, we need to express h in terms of r:\n\nh = 50 / (πr^2)\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder consists of the top and bottom (two circles) and the lateral surface (a rectangle). The surface area A is given by:\n\nA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for h in terms of r:\n\nA = 2πr^2 + 2πr(50 / (πr^2))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nA = 2πr^2 + 100/r\n\nNow, we need to minimize A with respect to r. To do this, we find the first derivative of A with respect to r and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = 4πr - 100/r^2\n\nSetting dA/dr = 0, we get:\n\n4πr - 100/r^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by r^2, we get:\n\n4πr^3 - 100 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for r:\n\nr^3 = 100 / (4π)\nr^3 = 25 / π\nr = (25 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we find the height h using the expression for h in terms of r:\n\nh = 50 / (π((25 / π)^(1/3))^2)\nh = 50 / (25 / π)\nh = 2π\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cylinder that minimize the material cost are:\n\nr ≈ (25 / π)^(1/3) meters\nh ≈ 2π meters\n\nNow, we can find the material cost:\n\nCost = 100 * (2π((25 / π)^(1/3))^2) + 50 * (2π((25 / π)^(1/3))(2π))\nCost ≈ 100 * (2π(25 / π)) + 50 * (4π^2)\nCost ≈ 5000 + 1000π\n\nThe minimum material cost is approximately 5000 + 1000π dollars."
