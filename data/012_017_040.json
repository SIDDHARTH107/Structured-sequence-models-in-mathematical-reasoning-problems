In this graph, there are 7 vertices, which means we need to find a set of edges that connects all vertices in pairs.\n\nWe can find the maximum number of perfect matchings by analyzing the possible pairings:\n\n1. A-E, B-C, D-F, G\n2. A-E, B-G, C-F, D\n3. A-D, B-C, E-F, G\n4. A-D, B-G, E-C, F\n5. A-B, D-E, F-G, C\n\nThere are 5 perfect matchings in this graph."
