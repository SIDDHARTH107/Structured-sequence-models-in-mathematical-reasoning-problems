    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a Morse-Smale complex can be computed using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index. In this case, we have 4 minima (index 0), 2 saddles (index 1), and 2 maxima (index 2). So, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = (# of index 0 critical points) - (# of index 1 critical points) + (# of index 2 critical points)\nχ = 4 - 2 + 2\nχ = 4\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the complex is 4."
