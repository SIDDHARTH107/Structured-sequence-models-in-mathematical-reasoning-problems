    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees, we need to first find the radius of the circle, the arc length of the sector, and then add the two radii to the arc length.\n\n1. Find the radius of the circle:\nSince the diameter is 12 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter:\nr = 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm\n\n2. Find the arc length (s) of the sector:\nThe arc length is a fraction of the circle's circumference, which depends on the central angle (θ) of the sector. The formula for the arc length is:\ns = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nFor our problem, θ = 60 degrees and r = 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\ns = (60/360) × 2π(6)\ns = (1/6) × 12π\ns = 2π cm\n\n3. Find the perimeter of the sector:\nThe perimeter (P) of the sector is the sum of the arc length and the two radii:\nP = s + 2r\nP = 2π + 2(6)\nP = 2π + 12\n\nThe perimeter of the sector with a central angle of 60 degrees is 2π + 12 cm."
