    "message_1": "A company produces electricity at a constant rate and sells it for $0.15 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The demand for electricity in a given day can be modeled by the function f(t), where f(t) is the number of kilowatt-hours used at time t (where t is measured in hours between 0 and 24). Assume f(t) is a periodic function with a period of 24 hours.\n\nUsing Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform, find the frequency and amplitude of the largest harmonic present in the demand function. What is the total revenue earned by the company in a single day assuming a constant rate of production?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency and amplitude of the largest harmonic present in the demand function, we need to perform a Fourier analysis on the function f(t). However, we don't have the explicit form of f(t) provided. In a real-world scenario, we would need to collect data on the electricity demand over a 24-hour period and then perform the Fourier analysis on the collected data.\n\nSince we don't have the explicit form of f(t), we cannot find the frequency and amplitude of the largest harmonic present in the demand function.\n\nHowever, we can still find the total revenue earned by the company in a single day assuming a constant rate of production. To do this, we need to find the total kilowatt-hours used in a day and multiply it by the cost per kilowatt-hour.\n\nLet's denote the total kilowatt-hours used in a day as E. We can find E by integrating the demand function f(t) over a 24-hour period:\n\nE = âˆ«[0, 24] f(t) dt\n\nAgain, since we don't have the explicit form of f(t), we cannot compute the integral directly. However, if we had the function, we would compute the integral and then multiply the result by the cost per kilowatt-hour ($0.15) to find the total revenue earned by the company in a single day:\n\nTotal revenue = E * $0.15"
