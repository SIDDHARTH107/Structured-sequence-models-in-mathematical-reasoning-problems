    "message_1": "A company wants to determine the relationship between the horsepower (HP) of a car and its fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG). After collecting data for 20 cars, they obtain the following regression equation: \n\nMPG = 30 - 0.2 HP \n\nWhat is the predicted MPG for a car with 150 HP according to this regression equation?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted MPG for a car with 150 HP, we can plug the value of HP into the regression equation:\n\nMPG = 30 - 0.2 * 150\n\nMPG = 30 - 30\n\nMPG = 0\n\nAccording to this regression equation, the predicted MPG for a car with 150 HP is 0. However, this result may not be practically accurate, as it is unlikely for a car to have 0 MPG. The regression equation may not be a perfect representation of the relationship between HP and MPG, especially for extreme values of HP."
