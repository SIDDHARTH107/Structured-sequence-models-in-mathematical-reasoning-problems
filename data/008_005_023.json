    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate $x_1$ from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n$2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 2(5)$\n\n$2x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 = 10$\n\nNow, subtract the first modified equation from the second equation:\n\n$(2x_1 - x_2 - 3x_3) - (2x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3) = -4 - 10$\n\n$-3x_2 - 5x_3 = -14$\n\nNext, multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation:\n\n$3(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 3(5)$\n\n$3x_1 + 3x_2 + 3x_3 = 15$\n\nNow, subtract the second modified equation from the third equation:\n\n$(3x_1 - 4x_2 + x_3) - (3x_1 + 3x_2 + 3x_3) = 2 - 15$\n\n$-7x_2 - 2x_3 = -13$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n$-3x_2 - 5x_3 = -14$\n\n$-7x_2 - 2x_3 = -13$\n\nWe can eliminate $x_2$ by multiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 3, and then adding the two equations:\n\n$7(-3x_2 - 5x_3) = 7(-14)$\n\n$-21x_2 - 35x_3 = -98$\n\n$3(-7x_2 - 2x_3) = 3(-13)$\n\n$-21x_2 - 6x_3 = -39$\n\nNow, add the two modified equations:\n\n$(-21x_2 - 35x_3) + (-21x_2 - 6x_3) = -98 + (-39)$\n\n$-29x_3 = -137$\n\nNow, divide by -29:\n\n$x_3 = \\frac{-137}{-29} = 4.724$\n\nNow that we have $x_3$, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with $x_2$:\n\n$-3x_2 - 5(4.724) = -14$\n\n$-3x_2 - 23.62 = -14$\n\nAdd 23.62 to both sides:\n\n$-3x_2 = 9.62$\n\nNow, divide by -3:\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{9.62}{-3} = -3.207$\n\nFinally, substitute $x_2$ and $x_3$ back into the first equation to find $x_1$:\n\n$x_1 - 3.207 + 4.724 = 5$\n\n$x_1 + 1.517 = 5$\n\nSubtract 1.517 from both sides:\n\n$x_1 = 5 - 1.517 = 3.483$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\n$x_1 = 3.483$\n\n$x_2 = -3.207$\n\n$x_3 = 4.724$"
