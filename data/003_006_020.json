    "message_2": "To find the measure of each angle in the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines first to find one angle, and then use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles.\n\nLet the triangle have vertices A, B, and C, with side lengths a = 14, b = 11, and c = 8. We want to find angles A, B, and C.\n\nStep 1: Use the Law of Cosines to find angle A.\nThe Law of Cosines states: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc * cos(A)\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n14^2 = 11^2 + 8^2 - 2 * 11 * 8 * cos(A)\n\n196 = 121 + 64 - 176 * cos(A)\n11 = 176 * cos(A)\ncos(A) = 11/176\n\nNow, find the angle A using the inverse cosine function:\nA = arccos(11/176) ≈ 81.79°\n\nStep 2: Use the Law of Sines to find angle B.\nThe Law of Sines states: sin(A)/a = sin(B)/b\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nsin(81.79°)/14 = sin(B)/11\n\nNow, solve for sin(B):\nsin(B) = 11 * sin(81.79°)/14\nsin(B) ≈ 0.755\n\nNow, find the angle B using the inverse sine function:\nB = arcsin(0.755) ≈ 49.47°\n\nStep 3: Use the property that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180° to find angle C.\nC = 180° - A - B\nC = 180° - 81.79° - 49.47°\nC ≈ 48.74°\n\nSo, the measure of each angle in the triangle is approximately A ≈ 81.79°, B ≈ 49.47°, and C ≈ 48.74°."
