    "message_1": "A radio tower emits a trigonometric signal given by the function y = 2 cos(3πt) + 1, where y represents the signal amplitude and t represents time. What is the period and amplitude of this signal? Round your answers to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2 cos(3πt) + 1.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function, which in this case is 2.\n\nTo find the period, we need to look at the coefficient of the variable t inside the cosine function. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nIn this case, B = 3π. So, the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |3π| = (2π) / (3π) = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the signal is 2 and the period is approximately 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)."
