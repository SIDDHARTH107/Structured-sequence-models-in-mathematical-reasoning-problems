Use Morse inequalities to compute the number $b_1$ of connected components of the level set $M_t=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : f(x,y)=t\\}$ for $t=0$, and show that $b_1=2$.",
    "message_2": "To use Morse inequalities, we first need to find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$. The critical points are the points where the gradient of the function vanishes, i.e., $\\nabla f(x, y) = 0$. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy).$$\n\nSetting the components of the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n$$-6xy = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. If $x = 0$, then from equation (1), we get $y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, we have a critical point at $(0, 0)$. If $y = 0$, then from equation (1), we get $x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. So, we have another critical point at $(0, 0)$. Thus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ at the critical point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$$H_f(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6x & -6y \\\\ -6y & -6x \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nAt the critical point $(0, 0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$$H_f(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is degenerate at the critical point $(0, 0)$. However, we can still analyze the behavior of the function near this point. Notice that the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$ is odd with respect to the $x$-axis and even with respect to the $y$-axis. This means that the level set $M_0$ is symmetric with respect to both axes.\n\nNow, let's consider the level set $M_0 = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : f(x, y) = 0\\}$. We have:\n\n$$x^3 - 3xy^2 = 0.$$\n\nFactoring out $x$, we get:\n\n$$x(x^2 - 3y^2) = 0.$$\n\nThis equation represents the union of the $x$-axis and the two hyperbolas $x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$. The $x$-axis is a connected component of the level set $M_0$, and the two hyperbolas form another connected component. Thus, we have $b_1 = 2$ connected components for the level set $M_0$."
