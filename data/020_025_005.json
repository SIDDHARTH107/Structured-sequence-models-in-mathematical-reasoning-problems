    "message_1": "A delivery company needs to decide the best route for a truck to make three deliveries. From the starting point, Delivery A is 5 miles east, Delivery B is 8 miles south, and Delivery C is 10 miles west. What is the optimal route for the truck to take to minimize the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. We can treat the starting point, Delivery A, Delivery B, and Delivery C as vertices of a triangle.\n\nLet's denote the starting point as S. The distances between the points are as follows:\n\nSA = 5 miles (east)\nSB = 8 miles (south)\nSC = 10 miles (west)\n\nWe can calculate the distances between the delivery points using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nAB = √((SA + SC)^2 + SB^2) = √((5 + 10)^2 + 8^2) = √(15^2 + 8^2) = √(225 + 64) = √289 = 17 miles\n\nAC = √(SA^2 + (SB + SC)^2) = √(5^2 + (8 + 10)^2) = √(5^2 + 18^2) = √(25 + 324) = √349 ≈ 18.68 miles\n\nBC = √(SC^2 + SB^2) = √(10^2 + 8^2) = √(100 + 64) = √164 ≈ 12.81 miles\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distances for each possible route:\n\n1. Route SABCS: SA + AB + BC + CS = 5 + 17 + 12.81 + 10 = 44.81 miles\n2. Route SABSC: SA + AB + BS = 5 + 17 + 8 = 30 miles\n3. Route SACBS: SA + AC + CB + BS = 5 + 18.68 + 12.81 + 8 = 44.49 miles\n4. Route SACSB: SA + AC + CS = 5 + 18.68 + 10 = 33.68 miles\n5. Route SBCAS: SB + BC + CA + AS = 8 + 12.81 + 18.68 + 5 = 44.49 miles\n6. Route SBCSA: SB + BC + AS = 8 + 12.81 + 5 = 25.81 miles\n\nThe optimal route is Route SABSC with a total distance of 30 miles."
