    "message_2": "To find the cross product of vector 𝑎 and vector 𝑏 using trigonometry, we first need to find the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them.\n\nThe magnitude of vector 𝑎 is:\n|𝑎| = √(2² + (-3)² + 4²) = √(4 + 9 + 16) = √29\n\nThe magnitude of vector 𝑏 is:\n|𝑏| = √(3² + 2² + (-6)²) = √(9 + 4 + 36) = √49 = 7\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula:\n\n𝑎 · 𝑏 = |𝑎| * |𝑏| * cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of 𝑎 and 𝑏 is:\n𝑎 · 𝑏 = (2 * 3) + (-3 * 2) + (4 * -6) = 6 - 6 - 24 = -24\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\ncos(θ) = (𝑎 · 𝑏) / (|𝑎| * |𝑏|)\ncos(θ) = -24 / (√29 * 7)\nθ = arccos(-24 / (√29 * 7))\n\nNow, we can find the cross product magnitude:\n|𝑎 x 𝑏| = |𝑎| * |𝑏| * sin(θ)\n\nSince sin(θ) = √(1 - cos²(θ)), we have:\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-24 / (√29 * 7))²)\n\n|𝑎 x 𝑏| = √29 * 7 * √(1 - (-24 / (√29 * 7))²)\n\nNow, we need to find the direction of the cross product. We can do this using the formula:\n\n𝑎 x 𝑏 = (𝑎_y * 𝑏_z - 𝑎_z * 𝑏_y)𝑖 - (𝑎_x * 𝑏_z - 𝑎_z * 𝑏_x)𝑗 + (𝑎_x * 𝑏_y - 𝑎_y * 𝑏_x)𝑘\n\n𝑎 x 𝑏 = ((-3) * (-6) - 4 * 2)𝑖 - (2 * (-6) - 4 * 3)𝑗 + (2 * 2 - (-3) * 3)𝑘\n𝑎 x 𝑏 = (18 - 8)𝑖 - (-12 - 12)𝑗 + (4 + 9)𝑘\n𝑎 x 𝑏 = 10𝑖 + 24𝑗 + 13𝑘\n\nSo, the cross product of vector 𝑎 and vector 𝑏 is:\n\n𝑎 x 𝑏 = 10𝑖 + 24𝑗 + 13𝑘"
