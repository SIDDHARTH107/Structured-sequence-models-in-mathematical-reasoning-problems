    "message_2": "There are 13 heart cards in a standard deck of 52 playing cards (one for each rank: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King). To find the probability of drawing a heart card, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (the number of heart cards), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = 13/52\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13.\n\nProbability = (13/13) / (52/13) = 1/4\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a heart card from a standard deck of playing cards is 1/4 or 0.25 (25%)."
