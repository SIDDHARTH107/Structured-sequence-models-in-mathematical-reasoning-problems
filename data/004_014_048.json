    "message_2": "To find the volume of water in the tank, we will use the method of integration. First, let's find the equation of the line that represents the radius of the cone as a function of height.\n\nLet r be the radius of the cone at a height h from the bottom, and R be the radius of the cone at the top (4 meters, since the diameter is 8 meters). The height of the cone is H = 12 meters. We can use similar triangles to find the relationship between r, h, R, and H:\n\nr / h = R / H\n\nNow we can solve for r as a function of h:\n\nr(h) = (R / H) * h = (4 / 12) * h = h / 3\n\nNow we can set up the integral to find the volume of the water in the tank. The volume of a cone can be found using the formula V = (1/3)πR^2H, but since we're only filling the tank up to a height of 8 meters, we need to integrate the cross-sectional area of the cone from 0 to 8 meters:\n\nV = ∫[0, 8] π[r(h)]^2 dh\n\nSubstitute r(h) = h / 3:\n\nV = ∫[0, 8] π[(h / 3)]^2 dh\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nV = π ∫[0, 8] (h^2 / 9) dh\n\nIntegrate with respect to h:\n\nV = π [ (h^3 / 27) |[0, 8] ]\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = π [ (8^3 / 27) - (0^3 / 27) ]\n\nV = π [ (512 / 27) ]\n\nV ≈ 59.69 cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of water in the tank is approximately 59.69 cubic meters."
