    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In this case, we are looking for transformations that preserve the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. \n\nThe isometries of the Euclidean plane can be classified into four types:\n\n1. Translations: A translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed distance in a fixed direction. Mathematically, a translation can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)\n$$\n\nwhere $(a, b)$ is the translation vector. Since translations do not change the distance between points, they are isometries of the metric.\n\n2. Rotations: A rotation is a transformation that rotates every point in the plane around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a fixed angle. Mathematically, a rotation can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y') = (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta, x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle of rotation. Rotations preserve the distance between points, so they are isometries of the metric.\n\n3. Reflections: A reflection is a transformation that reflects every point in the plane across a fixed line (the axis of reflection). Mathematically, a reflection can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y') = (x \\cos 2\\alpha + y \\sin 2\\alpha, y \\cos 2\\alpha - x \\sin 2\\alpha)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle between the x-axis and the axis of reflection. Reflections preserve the distance between points, so they are isometries of the metric.\n\n4. Glide reflections: A glide reflection is a transformation that combines a reflection across a fixed line with a translation parallel to that line. Mathematically, a glide reflection can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y') = (x \\cos 2\\alpha + y \\sin 2\\alpha + a, y \\cos 2\\alpha - x \\sin 2\\alpha + b)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle between the x-axis and the axis of reflection, and $(a, b)$ is the translation vector parallel to the axis of reflection. Glide reflections preserve the distance between points, so they are isometries of the metric.\n\nIn summary, the isometries of the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections."
