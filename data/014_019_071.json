    "message_1": "A message was encrypted using a transposition cipher where the rows of the plaintext message were rearranged. The original message was 40 characters long and the transposition cipher rearranged it into 8 rows with 5 characters in each row. What was the length of the ciphertext message?",
    "message_2": "The length of the ciphertext message remains the same as the original message because a transposition cipher only rearranges the characters without changing their count. Therefore, the length of the ciphertext message is also 40 characters."
