    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of the given graph, we can use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G) = T(G - e) + T(G / e) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G) = x * T(G - e) if e is a loop,\nT(G) = y * T(G / e) if e is a bridge.\n\nHere, G - e denotes the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G / e denotes the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nThe given graph has no loops, so we don't need to worry about the second case. We can start by considering the edge AB. The graph G - AB has 7 edges, and the graph G / AB has 6 edges. We can continue this process for each edge until we reach the base case, which is an empty graph or a graph with only isolated vertices. The Tutte polynomial of an empty graph is 1, and the Tutte polynomial of a graph with only isolated vertices is x^(number of isolated vertices).\n\nAfter performing the recursive calculations, we obtain the Tutte polynomial for the given graph:\n\nT(x, y) = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 4xy^4 + y^5."
