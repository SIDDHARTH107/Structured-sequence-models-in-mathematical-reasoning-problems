    "message_1": "A student wants to find the height of a tree but can't climb it. The student measures the angle of elevation to the top of the tree to be 60 degrees. The student stands 20 meters away from the base of the tree. How tall is the tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and the distance from the student to the tree (adjacent side) is 20 meters. We want to find the height of the tree (opposite side).\n\nThe formula for tangent is:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60) = height of the tree / 20 meters\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so:\n\n√3 = height of the tree / 20 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tree:\n\nheight of the tree = 20 meters * √3\n\nheight of the tree ≈ 20 meters * 1.732\n\nheight of the tree ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nThe height of the tree is approximately 34.64 meters."
