    "message_2": "To find the Betti numbers of the topological quantum field theory (TQFT) with coefficients in Z/2Z defined on X, we first need to understand the topology of the space X.\n\nSince X is a circle, its topology is simple. The circle is a one-dimensional space, and its homology groups are given by:\n\nH_0(X) = Z (the 0th homology group, which counts connected components)\nH_1(X) = Z (the 1st homology group, which counts loops)\nH_n(X) = 0 for n > 1 (higher homology groups are trivial for a circle)\n\nNow, we want to find the Betti numbers with coefficients in Z/2Z. The Betti numbers are the ranks of the homology groups. Since we are working with coefficients in Z/2Z, we need to compute the homology groups with these coefficients:\n\nH_0(X; Z/2Z) = Z/2Z\nH_1(X; Z/2Z) = Z/2Z\nH_n(X; Z/2Z) = 0 for n > 1\n\nThe Betti numbers are the ranks of these homology groups:\n\nb_0(X; Z/2Z) = rank(H_0(X; Z/2Z)) = 1\nb_1(X; Z/2Z) = rank(H_1(X; Z/2Z)) = 1\nb_n(X; Z/2Z) = rank(H_n(X; Z/2Z)) = 0 for n > 1\n\nSo, the Betti numbers of the TQFT with coefficients in Z/2Z defined on X are:\n\nb_0 = 1, b_1 = 1, and b_n = 0 for n > 1."
