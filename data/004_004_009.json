    "message_2": "To use integration to find the amount of water in the tank after 20 minutes, we need to set up an equation that represents the volume of water in the tank as a function of time.\n\nLet V(t) be the volume of water in the tank at time t (in minutes). Since water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute, we can represent this as a differential equation:\n\ndV/dt = 2\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides of the equation with respect to time to find the volume of water in the tank as a function of time:\n\n∫(dV/dt) dt = ∫2 dt\n\nV(t) = 2t + C\n\nTo find the constant of integration C, we can use the initial condition that the tank is empty at time t = 0:\n\nV(0) = 2(0) + C\n0 = C\n\nSo, the volume of water in the tank as a function of time is:\n\nV(t) = 2t\n\nNow, we can find the amount of water in the tank after 20 minutes by plugging in t = 20:\n\nV(20) = 2(20) = 40 cubic meters\n\nSo, there are 40 cubic meters of water in the tank after 20 minutes."
