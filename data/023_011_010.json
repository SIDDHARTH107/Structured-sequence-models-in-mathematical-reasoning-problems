    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for a given function, we use the following formula:\n\nc(n) = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * n * t / T)] dt, where T is the period of the function and the integral is taken over one period.\n\nFor the given function f(t) = sin(2πt) + cos(4πt), the period is T = 1. So, we can find the Fourier coefficients for n = ±1 and n = ±2 as follows:\n\nc(1) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 1 * t)] dt from 0 to 1\nc(-1) = ∫[f(t) * e^(j * 2π * 1 * t)] dt from 0 to 1\nc(2) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 2 * t)] dt from 0 to 1\nc(-2) = ∫[f(t) * e^(j * 2π * 2 * t)] dt from 0 to 1\n\nNow, let's compute the integrals:\n\nc(1) = ∫[(sin(2πt) + cos(4πt)) * e^(-j * 2π * t)] dt from 0 to 1\nc(-1) = ∫[(sin(2πt) + cos(4πt)) * e^(j * 2π * t)] dt from 0 to 1\nc(2) = ∫[(sin(2πt) + cos(4πt)) * e^(-j * 4π * t)] dt from 0 to 1\nc(-2) = ∫[(sin(2πt) + cos(4πt)) * e^(j * 4π * t)] dt from 0 to 1\n\nSince sin(2πt) and cos(4πt) are orthogonal functions, their integrals over one period will be zero. Therefore, we have:\n\nc(1) = 0\nc(-1) = 0\nc(2) = 0\nc(-2) = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for n = ±1 and n = ±2 are all zero."
