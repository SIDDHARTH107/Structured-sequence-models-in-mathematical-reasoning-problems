    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x²/2), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = e^(-x²/2), so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x²/2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nNow, let's combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x²/2 - 2πikx)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we will complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x²/2 - 2πikx = -(x² + 4πikx)/2\n\nNow, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x:\n\n-(x² + 4πikx + (4πik)²/4 - (4πik)²/4)/2 = -(x + 2πik)²/2 + (2πk)²/2\n\nNow, we rewrite the integral:\n\nF(k) = e^((2πk)²/2) ∫[e^(-(x + 2πik)²/2)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nNow, we make a substitution: let u = x + 2πik. Then, du = dx, and the integral becomes:\n\nF(k) = e^((2πk)²/2) ∫[e^(-u²/2)] du, with the integral taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nThis is a Gaussian integral, which has a known value:\n\n∫[e^(-u²/2)] du = √(2π), with the integral taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x²/2) is:\n\nF(k) = e^((2πk)²/2) * √(2π).\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(x) = e^(-x²/2) is F(k) = √(2π) * e^((2πk)²/2)."
