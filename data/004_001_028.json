    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x - 3, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2)/dx + d(5x)/dx - d(3)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 2(2x^(2-1)) + 5(1x^(1-1)) - 0\nf'(x) = 4x + 5\n\nNow, we will find the value of the derivative at the point x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 4(4) + 5\nf'(4) = 16 + 5\nf'(4) = 21\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x - 3 at the point x = 4 is 21."
