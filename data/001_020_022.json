    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to solve the equation |2x+6|=12 for x. We can split the absolute value equation into two separate equations:\n\n1) 2x + 6 = 12\n2) -(2x + 6) = 12\n\nNow, we solve each equation for x:\n\nEquation 1: 2x + 6 = 12\n2x = 12 - 6\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nEquation 2: -(2x + 6) = 12\n-2x - 6 = 12\n-2x = 12 + 6\n-2x = 18\nx = -9\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 3 and x = -9."
