    "message_1": "A Lévy C curve is generated by adding line segments of length 1 and angles of 45 degrees to a starting point, and iterating the process indefinitely. Write a program to generate the Lévy C curve up to a certain number of iterations specified by the user, and calculate the length of the curve after each iteration. For example, if the user specifies 6 iterations, the program should output the length of the Lévy C curve after 1 iteration, after 2 iterations, after 3 iterations, and so on up to 6 iterations.",
    "message_2": "Here's a Python program to generate the Lévy C curve up to a certain number of iterations specified by the user and calculate the length of the curve after each iteration:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef levy_c_curve_length(iterations):\n    length = 1\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        length *= math.sqrt(2)\n    return length\n\ndef main():\n    iterations = int(input(\"Enter the number of iterations: \"))\n    for i in range(1, iterations + 1):\n        curve_length = levy_c_curve_length(i)\n        print(f\"Length of the Lévy C curve after {i} iteration(s): {curve_length}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run the program, copy and paste the code into a Python environment or a file named `levy_c_curve.py` and run it. The program will prompt you to enter the number of iterations, and it will output the length of the Lévy C curve after each iteration up to the specified number of iterations."
