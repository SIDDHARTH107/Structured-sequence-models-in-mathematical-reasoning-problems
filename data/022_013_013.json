Find the values of a and b such that the function g(z) = af(z) + b is also analytic and satisfies g(1+i) = 2.\n\nHint: Recall that for a function to be analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Use these equations to determine the values of a and b that satisfy the conditions given above.",
    "message_2": "Since f(z) is an analytic function, g(z) = af(z) + b will also be analytic for any complex constants a and b, because the sum and product of analytic functions are also analytic. Therefore, we don't need to check the Cauchy-Riemann equations for g(z).\n\nNow, we need to find the values of a and b such that g(1+i) = 2. First, let's find f(1+i):\n\nf(1+i) = 2(1+i)^2 - 3i(1+i) + 1\n= 2((1+i)(1+i)) - 3i(1+i) + 1\n= 2(1 + 2i + i^2) - 3i(1+i) + 1\n= 2(1 + 2i - 1) - 3i(1+i) + 1\n= 4i - 3i - 3i^2 + 1\n= 4i - 3i + 3 + 1\n= 3 + i\n\nNow, we can find the values of a and b such that g(1+i) = 2:\n\ng(1+i) = a * f(1+i) + b\n2 = a * (3 + i) + b\n\nSince a and b are constants, we can equate the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\nReal part:\n2 = 3a + b\n\nImaginary part:\n0 = a\n\nFrom the imaginary part, we find that a = 0. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation for the real part:\n\n2 = 3(0) + b\n2 = b\n\nSo, the values of a and b are a = 0 and b = 2. Therefore, the function g(z) = af(z) + b is g(z) = 2."
