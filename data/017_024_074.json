    "message_2": "To determine which group is isomorphic to the given group, we will analyze the properties of each group and compare them to the properties of the given group. We will use the concepts of group order, abelian vs. non-abelian, and the structure of the groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C96:\nThe cyclic group C96 has order 96 and is abelian. If the given group is abelian and has order 96, then it could be isomorphic to C96. However, if the given group is non-abelian, then it cannot be isomorphic to C96.\n\n2. Alternating group A4 × C4 × C2:\nThe alternating group A4 × C4 × C2 is a direct product of three groups: A4, C4, and C2. The order of A4 × C4 × C2 is |A4| × |C4| × |C2| = 12 × 4 × 2 = 96. A4 is non-abelian, while C4 and C2 are abelian. The direct product of a non-abelian group with any other group is non-abelian. Therefore, A4 × C4 × C2 is non-abelian. If the given group is non-abelian and has order 96, then it could be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 or one of the other 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\n3. One of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96:\nThere are 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. If the given group is non-abelian and has order 96, then it could be isomorphic to one of these groups or A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nTo determine which group is isomorphic to the given group, we need more information about the structure and properties of the given group. If the given group is abelian, then it is isomorphic to C96. If the given group is non-abelian, then it could be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 or one of the other 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. Further analysis of the given group's properties and structure would be required to determine the specific isomorphism."
