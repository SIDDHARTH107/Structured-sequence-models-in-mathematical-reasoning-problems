    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. \n\nGiven the population mean (μ) is 150 lbs and the population standard deviation (σ) is 25 lbs, we can calculate the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean) using the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nwhere n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, n = 100, so:\n\nσ_sample_mean = 25 / √100 = 25 / 10 = 2.5 lbs\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean weight will be between 145 lbs and 155 lbs. To do this, we can calculate the z-scores for both 145 lbs and 155 lbs using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor 145 lbs:\n\nz1 = (145 - 150) / 2.5 = -5 / 2.5 = -2\n\nFor 155 lbs:\n\nz2 = (155 - 150) / 2.5 = 5 / 2.5 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -2 and 2. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the area under the curve between these two z-scores.\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = P(z < 2) - P(z < -2)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator:\n\nP(z < 2) ≈ 0.9772\nP(z < -2) ≈ 0.0228\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean weight will be between 145 lbs and 155 lbs is approximately 95.44%."
