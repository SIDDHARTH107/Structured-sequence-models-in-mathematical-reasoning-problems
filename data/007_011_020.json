In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo n if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod n).\n\nTo find all the quadratic residues modulo 7, we can simply compute the squares of the integers from 0 to 6 (since 7 is a prime number) and then reduce them modulo 7.\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n6^2 ≡ 36 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues modulo 7 are {0, 1, 2, 4}."
