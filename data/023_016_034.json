    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x) up to the third harmonic, we need to find the coefficients a₀, a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, and b₃. The general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ [aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]\n\nwhere n ranges from 1 to the number of harmonics we are considering (in this case, 3).\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) is defined piecewise, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫[|x|]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x]dx from 0 to π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫[-x]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x]dx from 0 to π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(-1/2)x² | from -π to 0 + (1/2)x² | from 0 to π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(0 - (-1/2)π²) + (1/2)π² - 0]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * (1/2)π²\n\na₀ = π/2\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [∫[|x|cos(nx)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x*cos(nx)]dx from 0 to π]\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-x*cos(nx)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x*cos(nx)]dx from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we need to integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = -x (for the first integral) and x (for the second integral), dv = cos(nx)dx\nThen, du = -dx (for the first integral) and dx (for the second integral), v = (1/n)sin(nx)\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(uv | from -π to 0) - ∫[vdu] from -π to 0 + (uv | from 0 to π) - ∫[vdu] from 0 to π]\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(-x*(1/n)sin(nx) | from -π to 0) + ∫[(1/n)sin(nx)dx] from -π to 0 + (x*(1/n)sin(nx) | from 0 to π) - ∫[(1/n)sin(nx)dx] from 0 to π]\n\nNow, integrate (1/n)sin(nx)dx:\n\n(1/n) * ∫[sin(nx)dx] = (1/n²) * (-cos(nx))\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(-x*(1/n)sin(nx) | from -π to 0) + (1/n²)*(-cos(nx)) | from -π to 0 + (x*(1/n)sin(nx) | from 0 to π) - (1/n²)*(-cos(nx)) | from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the expressions at the limits:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * (0 - πsin(nπ)) + (1/n²)*(-cos(nπ) + 1) + (1/n) * (πsin(nπ) - 0) - (1/n²)*(-cos(nπ) + 1)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the terms with sin(nπ) will be zero:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/n²)*(-cos(nπ) + 1) - (1/n²)*(-cos(nπ) + 1)]\n\naₙ = 0 for all n > 0\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)sin(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [∫[|x|sin(nx)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x*sin(nx)]dx from 0 to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-x*sin(nx)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x*sin(nx)]dx from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we need to integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = -x (for the first integral) and x (for the second integral), dv = sin(nx)dx\nThen, du = -dx (for the first integral) and dx (for the second integral), v = -(1/n)cos(nx)\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(uv | from -π to 0) - ∫[vdu] from -π to 0 + (uv | from 0 to π) - ∫[vdu] from 0 to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-x*(-1/n)cos(nx) | from -π to 0) + ∫[(1/n)cos(nx)dx] from -π to 0 + (x*(-1/n)cos(nx) | from 0 to π) - ∫[(-1/n)cos(nx)dx] from 0 to π]\n\nNow, integrate (1/n)cos(nx)dx and (-1/n)cos(nx)dx:\n\n(1/n) * ∫[cos(nx)dx] = (1/n²) * sin(nx)\n(-1/n) * ∫[cos(nx)dx] = (-1/n²) * sin(nx)\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-x*(-1/n)cos(nx) | from -π to 0) + (1/n²)*sin(nx) | from -π to 0 + (x*(-1/n)cos(nx) | from 0 to π) - (-1/n²)*sin(nx) | from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the expressions at the limits:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (πcos(nπ) - 0) + (1/n²)*(sin(nπ) - 0) - (1/n) * (πcos(nπ) - 0) + (1/n²)*(sin(nπ) - 0)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the terms with sin(nπ) will be zero:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (πcos(nπ) - 0) - (1/n) * (πcos(nπ) - 0)]\n\nbₙ = 0 for all n > 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series up to the third harmonic is:\n\nf(x) = π/2"
