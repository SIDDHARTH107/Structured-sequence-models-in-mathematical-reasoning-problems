    "message_1": "I apologize, but it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem in Deontic logic as Deontic logic deals with concepts such as obligation, permission, and prohibition, which are not quantitative in nature. Instead, it deals with judgments about the normative status of certain states of affairs. Therefore, a problem in Deontic logic is more likely to be in the form of an argument or a set of conditions that may or may not entail certain obligations or permissions.",
    "message_2": "That's correct. Deontic logic is not concerned with numerical problems or quantitative analysis. Instead, it focuses on the study of normative concepts and reasoning. If you have a problem or scenario related to obligations, permissions, or prohibitions, feel free to share it, and I will help you analyze it using Deontic logic principles."
