    "message_2": "To determine if the system exhibits chaotic behavior, we need to calculate the Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent is given by the average rate of divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space. For a discrete-time system like the one described, we can compute the Lyapunov exponent using the following formula:\n\nλ = lim (n -> ∞) (1/n) * Σ(log|f'(x[n])|)\n\nwhere f'(x) is the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x(1-x) with respect to x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(4x(1-x))/dx = 4(1 - 2x)\n\nNow, we can compute the Lyapunov exponent using the formula:\n\nλ = lim (n -> ∞) (1/n) * Σ(log|4(1 - 2x[n])|)\n\nTo determine if the system exhibits chaotic behavior, we need to check if the Lyapunov exponent is positive. If λ > 0, the system is chaotic.\n\nSince the Lyapunov exponent depends on the state x[n], we cannot determine its sign without knowing the specific values of x[n]. However, we can analyze the behavior of the system for different initial conditions.\n\nFor x[n] in the range (0, 1), the term (1 - 2x[n]) is positive, and the Lyapunov exponent is positive. This means that the system exhibits chaotic behavior for initial conditions in this range.\n\nFor x[n] = 0 or x[n] = 1, the Lyapunov exponent is zero, and the system does not exhibit chaotic behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the system described by the equation x[n+1] = 4x[n](1-x[n]) exhibits chaotic behavior for most initial conditions in the range (0, 1)."
