    "message_1": "In a combinatorial game of Nim where there are three piles of stones with 7, 9, and 12 stones, respectively, how many stones should the second player remove from the second pile in order to win assuming both players play optimally?",
    "message_2": "In the game of Nim, the optimal strategy is to make the bitwise XOR of the pile sizes equal to 0 after your move. Let's first find the bitwise XOR of the current pile sizes:\n\n7 (in binary: 0111)\n9 (in binary: 1001)\n12 (in binary: 1100)\n-------------------\nXOR: 0010 (in decimal: 2)\n\nNow, let's find the optimal move for the second player. They should aim to make the XOR of the pile sizes equal to 0 after their move. To do this, they should remove stones from the second pile (with 9 stones) since it has the most significant bit that contributes to the current XOR value of 2.\n\nLet's find the target size for the second pile:\n\n7 XOR 12 = 11 (in binary: 1011)\n\nSo, the second player should aim to make the second pile have 11 stones. To do this, they need to remove:\n\n9 - 11 = -2\n\nHowever, this result is negative, which means that the second player cannot make a move that guarantees a win in this situation. The first player has a winning strategy if they play optimally."
