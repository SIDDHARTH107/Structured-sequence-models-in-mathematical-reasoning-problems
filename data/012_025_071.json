If a Hamiltonian cycle exists, list the vertices in the order they appear in the cycle. If it does not exist, explain why.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph, we can use the backtracking algorithm. We will start from an arbitrary vertex and try to visit all the vertices exactly once, returning to the starting vertex at the end.\n\nLet's start from vertex A:\n\n1. A -> B\n2. B -> C\n3. C -> D\n4. D -> E\n5. E -> F\n6. F -> G\n7. G -> H\n\nNow, we have visited all the vertices exactly once, and vertex H is connected to vertex A. So, we can return to the starting vertex A.\n\nThe Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph is: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> A.\n\nSo, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph, and the vertices in the order they appear in the cycle are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H."
