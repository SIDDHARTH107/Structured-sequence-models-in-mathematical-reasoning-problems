    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 3x^2 - 12x + 9 completely, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. The GCF of 3, -12, and 9 is 3. So, we can factor out 3 from the polynomial:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (3) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (-4). These two numbers are -3 and -1. So, we can factor the quadratic expression as follows:\n\n3(x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nThus, the completely factored form of the polynomial 3x^2 - 12x + 9 is 3(x - 3)(x - 1)."
