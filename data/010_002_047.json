    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence $(x_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ converges to any point $x\\in X$ with respect to the metric $d$, we need to check if there exists a point $x\\in X$ such that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, we have $d(x_n, x) < \\epsilon$.\n\nIn this case, the metric $d$ is the discrete metric, which means that the distance between any two distinct points is 1, and the distance between a point and itself is 0. Now, let's analyze the sequence $(x_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ defined by $x_n = n$. The first few terms of the sequence are:\n\n$x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 3, x_4 = 4, x_5 = 5, x_6 = 6, \\dots$\n\nNotice that the terms of the sequence are increasing and are not bounded by the set $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Therefore, for any $x \\in X$, there will always be terms of the sequence $(x_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ such that $d(x_n, x) = 1$, which is not less than any given $\\epsilon > 0$. \n\nFor example, let's consider the point $x = 1$. For any $n \\geq 2$, we have $d(x_n, x) = 1$, since $x_n \\neq x$ for $n \\geq 2$. This means that the sequence $(x_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ does not converge to $x = 1$. Similarly, we can show that the sequence does not converge to any other point in $X$.\n\nThus, the sequence $(x_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ does not converge to any point $x\\in X$ with respect to the metric $d$."
