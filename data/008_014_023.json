    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector.\n\nA = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 1 -2  5 |\n    | 3  4 -8 |\n\nb = | -1 |\n    |  5 |\n    |  0 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we factor A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = (2, 1, 3)\nu2 = (3, -2, 4) - proj_u1(3, -2, 4) = (3, -2, 4) - (3/2, 3/2, 9/2) = (0, -7/2, -1/2)\nu3 = (-1, 5, -8) - proj_u1(-1, 5, -8) - proj_u2(-1, 5, -8) = (-1, 5, -8) - (-1/2, -1/2, -3/2) - (1/3, -10/3, 4/3) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince u3 is the zero vector, we only need to normalize u1 and u2 to get the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (2, 1, 3) / sqrt(14) = (1/sqrt(14), 1/sqrt(14), 3/sqrt(14))\nq2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (0, -7/2, -1/2) / sqrt(26) = (0, -7/sqrt(104), -1/sqrt(104))\n\nNow, we can form the orthogonal matrix Q:\n\nQ = | 1/sqrt(14)  0          |\n    | 1/sqrt(14) -7/sqrt(104)|\n    | 3/sqrt(14) -1/sqrt(104) |\n\nNext, we find the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nR = Q^T * A = | 1/sqrt(14)  1/sqrt(14)  3/sqrt(14) | * | 2  3 -1 |\n              | 0         -7/sqrt(104) -1/sqrt(104)|   | 1 -2  5 |\n                                                        | 3  4 -8 |\n\nR = | sqrt(14)  5/sqrt(14) -11/sqrt(14) |\n    | 0         sqrt(26)   -3/sqrt(26)  |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | 1/sqrt(14)  1/sqrt(14)  3/sqrt(14) | * | -1 |\n          | 0         -7/sqrt(104) -1/sqrt(104)|   |  5 |\n                                                    |  0 |\n\nQ^T * b = | -1/sqrt(14) + 5/sqrt(14) |\n          | -35/sqrt(104) - 5/sqrt(104) |\n\nQ^T * b = | 4/sqrt(14) |\n          | -40/sqrt(104) |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system:\n\nsqrt(14) * x1 + 5/sqrt(14) * x2 - 11/sqrt(14) * x3 = 4/sqrt(14)\nsqrt(26) * x2 - 3/sqrt(26) * x3 = -40/sqrt(104)\n\nDivide the first equation by sqrt(14) and the second equation by sqrt(26):\n\nx1 + 5x2 - 11x3 = 4\nx2 - 3x3 = -20\n\nNow, we can solve the system using back-substitution:\n\nx2 - 3x3 = -20 => x2 = 3x3 - 20\n\nSubstitute x2 into the first equation:\n\nx1 + 5(3x3 - 20) - 11x3 = 4 => x1 = 11x3 - 100\n\nNow, we have the solutions in terms of x3:\n\nx1 = 11x3 - 100\nx2 = 3x3 - 20\n\nSince the system is underdetermined (there are infinitely many solutions), we can't find a unique solution for x3. However, we have expressed the solutions x1 and x2 in terms of x3."
