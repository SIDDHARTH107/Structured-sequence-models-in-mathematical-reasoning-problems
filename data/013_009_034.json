    "message_1": "Consider the following game where two players play against each other repeatedly: each player can choose to either show a head or a tail of a penny. If both players show the same side, player 1 wins and receives $1 from player 2. If they show different sides, player 2 wins and receives $1 from player 1. Suppose the game is played for 5 rounds. What is the probability that player 1 wins at least 3 rounds and player 2 wins no more than 2 rounds?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that player 1 wins at least 3 rounds and player 2 wins no more than 2 rounds, we can consider the possible outcomes for player 1: winning 3, 4, or 5 rounds. We will use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of each outcome and then sum them up.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this game, the probability of player 1 winning a round is 1/2 (since there are two possible outcomes: head or tail), and the probability of player 2 winning a round is also 1/2. So, p = 1/2 and (1-p) = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for player 1 winning 3, 4, or 5 rounds:\n\n1. Player 1 wins 3 rounds (and player 2 wins 2 rounds):\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 = 10 * (1/8) * (1/4) = 10/32\n\n2. Player 1 wins 4 rounds (and player 2 wins 1 round):\nP(4) = C(5, 4) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^1 = 5 * (1/16) * (1/2) = 5/32\n\n3. Player 1 wins 5 rounds (and player 2 wins 0 rounds):\nP(5) = C(5, 5) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^0 = 1 * (1/32) * 1 = 1/32\n\nNow, we sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(player 1 wins at least 3 rounds and player 2 wins no more than 2 rounds) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32 = 16/32 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability that player 1 wins at least 3 rounds and player 2 wins no more than 2 rounds is 1/2 or 50%."
