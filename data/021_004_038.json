Also, find the approximate value of its integral from x = 1 to x = 2 using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of 0.2.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the approximate value of the derivative at x = 2.5 using the forward difference method with a step size of 0.1.\n\nThe forward difference method is given by the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h is the step size (0.1 in this case).\n\nSo, we need to find the values of f(2.5) and f(2.6):\n\nf(2.5) = (2.5)^3 - 2(2.5)^2 + 3(2.5) - 4 = 15.625 - 12.5 + 7.5 - 4 = 6.625\nf(2.6) = (2.6)^3 - 2(2.6)^2 + 3(2.6) - 4 = 17.576 - 13.52 + 7.8 - 4 = 7.856\n\nNow, we can find the approximate derivative:\n\nf'(2.5) ≈ (f(2.6) - f(2.5)) / 0.1 = (7.856 - 6.625) / 0.1 = 12.31\n\nNext, let's find the approximate value of the integral from x = 1 to x = 2 using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of 0.2.\n\nThe trapezoidal rule is given by the formula:\n\n∫(f(x)dx) ≈ (h/2) * (f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + ... + 2f(xn-1) + f(xn))\n\nwhere h is the step size (0.2 in this case), and x0, x1, ..., xn are the points in the interval [1, 2].\n\nWe have the points: 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.\n\nNow, let's find the values of the function at these points:\n\nf(1) = 1^3 - 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 4 = -2\nf(1.2) = 1.728 - 2(1.44) + 3(1.2) - 4 = -0.672\nf(1.4) = 2.744 - 2(2.744) + 3(1.4) - 4 = 0.048\nf(1.6) = 4.096 - 2(4.096) + 3(1.6) - 4 = 0.224\nf(1.8) = 5.832 - 2(5.832) + 3(1.8) - 4 = -0.336\nf(2) = 8 - 2(8) + 3(2) - 4 = -4\n\nNow, we can find the approximate integral:\n\n∫(f(x)dx) ≈ (0.2/2) * (-2 + 2(-0.672) + 2(0.048) + 2(0.224) - 0.336 - 4) = 0.1 * (-2 - 1.344 + 0.096 + 0.448 - 0.336 - 4) = 0.1 * (-7.136) = -0.7136\n\nSo, the approximate value of the derivative at x = 2.5 is 12.31, and the approximate value of the integral from x = 1 to x = 2 is -0.7136."
