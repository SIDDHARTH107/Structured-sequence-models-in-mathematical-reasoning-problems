    "message_1": "A student needs to arrange a 5-member committee using 9 available members. However, two of the members refuse to serve together on the same committee. How many possible ways can the committee be formed using the inclusion-exclusion principle?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee without any restrictions. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 9 (total available members) and k = 5 (number of members needed for the committee). So, the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee without any restrictions is:\n\nC(9, 5) = 9! / (5!(9-5)!) = 9! / (5!4!) = 126\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to form a 5-member committee with the two members who refuse to serve together. If these two members are both on the committee, there are 7 remaining members to choose from, and we need to select 3 more members to complete the committee. So, the number of ways to form a 5-member committee with the two members who refuse to serve together is:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = 35\n\nFinally, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of ways to form a 5-member committee without the two members serving together. We subtract the number of ways with the two members serving together from the total number of ways without any restrictions:\n\nNumber of ways without the two members serving together = Total number of ways - Number of ways with the two members serving together\n\nNumber of ways without the two members serving together = 126 - 35 = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 possible ways to form a 5-member committee without the two members serving together."
