    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. They are as follows:\n\n1. The cyclic group C_120, which is generated by an element of order 120.\n2. The direct product of C_60 and C_2, denoted as C_60 × C_2. This group has elements of order 60 and 2.\n3. The symmetric group S_5, which consists of all permutations of 5 elements. This group has a total of 120 elements, and it is non-abelian.\n4. The alternating group A_5, which consists of all even permutations of 5 elements. This group has a total of 60 elements, and it is non-abelian.\n5. The dicyclic group Dic_30, which is a non-abelian group of order 120 and has elements of order 2, 4, 15, and 30.\n\nThese are the 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
