    "message_2": "To find the values of E for which the solutions ψ(x) are bounded as |x| → ∞, we can analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Schrödinger equation. \n\nAs |x| → ∞, the potential term -x^2/4 dominates the energy term E. Thus, the Schrödinger equation can be approximated as:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} - \\frac{x^2}{4}\\psi = 0$$\n\nNow, we can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let y = x^2/4, then x^2 = 4y and dx = (1/2)dy/x. Thus, the second derivative becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dy^2} - y\\psi = 0$$\n\nThis is the well-known Airy equation. The solutions to the Airy equation are the Airy functions Ai(y) and Bi(y). The Ai(y) function is bounded as y → ∞, while the Bi(y) function is unbounded. Therefore, we require the solution to be proportional to Ai(y) for the wavefunction to be bounded.\n\nNow, we can transform back to the original variable x:\n\n$$\\psi(x) \\propto \\text{Ai}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right)$$\n\nThe zeros of the Airy function Ai(y) correspond to the allowed energy eigenvalues E. Let y_n be the nth zero of the Airy function, then the corresponding energy eigenvalue is:\n\n$$E_n = \\frac{4y_n}{4} = y_n$$\n\nThus, the values of E for which the solutions ψ(x) are bounded as |x| → ∞ are given by the zeros of the Airy function Ai(y)."
