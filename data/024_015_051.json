    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of $\\omega$, we need to apply the exterior derivative operator $d$ to each term in the 2-form. Recall that the exterior derivative of a differential form is a linear operation, so we can apply it to each term separately and then sum the results.\n\nFirst, let's apply the exterior derivative to the term $x^2 dy \\wedge dz$:\n\n$d(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = d(x^2) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n\nSince $d(x^2) = 2x dx$, we have:\n\n$d(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n\nNow, let's apply the exterior derivative to the term $z^2 dx \\wedge dy$:\n\n$d(z^2 dx \\wedge dy) = d(z^2) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nSince $d(z^2) = 2z dz$, we have:\n\n$d(z^2 dx \\wedge dy) = 2z dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nNow, we can sum the results to obtain the exterior derivative of $\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 2z dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate $d\\omega$ at the point $(1,1,1)$. Plugging in the coordinates, we get:\n\n$d\\omega(1,1,1) = 2(1) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 2(1) dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = 2 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 2 dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ at the point $(1,1,1)$ is:\n\n$d\\omega(1,1,1) = 2 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + 2 dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$"
