    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for this system:\n\n```\n[  2  3 -1 | 0 ]\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[ -3  2  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n```\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[  2  3 -1 | 0 ]\n[ -3  2  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[  0  5 -5 | 0 ]\n[  0  1 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 5:\n\n```\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[  0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[  0  1 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (-1 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[  0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[  0  0 -4 | 0 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by -4:\n\n```\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[  0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[  0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\n1. Replace Row 2 with (Row 3 + Row 2):\n\n```\n[  1 -1  2 | 0 ]\n[  0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[  0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 1 with (-2 * Row 3 + Row 1):\n\n```\n[  1 -1  0 | 0 ]\n[  0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[  0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 1 with (Row 2 + Row 1):\n\n```\n[  1  0  0 | 0 ]\n[  0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[  0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix corresponds to the system of equations:\n\n```\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n```\n\nSo, the solution to this system of homogeneous linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
