    "message_1": "A tower has a height of 50 meters. A person is standing at a distance of 100 meters from the tower. What is the maximum and minimum angle of elevation of the top of the tower from the person's position?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum angle of elevation, we need to consider two scenarios: \n\n1. When the person is looking straight at the top of the tower.\n2. When the person is looking at the top of the tower while standing at the highest or lowest possible point.\n\nScenario 1: The person is looking straight at the top of the tower.\n\nIn this case, we can use the tangent function to find the angle of elevation. We have a right triangle with the height of the tower (50 meters) as the opposite side and the distance from the person to the tower (100 meters) as the adjacent side.\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(angle) = 50/100\nangle = arctan(50/100)\n\nangle ≈ 26.57°\n\nSo, the angle of elevation when the person is looking straight at the top of the tower is approximately 26.57°.\n\nScenario 2: The person is looking at the top of the tower while standing at the highest or lowest possible point.\n\nSince the problem does not specify any constraints on the person's position, we can assume that the person can be at any height. In this case, the minimum angle of elevation would be 0° (when the person is at the same height as the top of the tower) and the maximum angle of elevation would be 90° (when the person is standing directly below the top of the tower).\n\nTherefore, the maximum angle of elevation is 90°, and the minimum angle of elevation is 0°."
