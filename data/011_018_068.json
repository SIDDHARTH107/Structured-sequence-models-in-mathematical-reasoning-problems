    "message_1": "Suppose there is a group of 14 people who want to play bridge, and each game consists of 4 players. How many different sets of 4 players can be chosen from the group to form a bridge game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different sets of 4 players that can be chosen from a group of 14 people, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (14 in this case) and k is the number of people in each set (4 in this case).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(14, 4) = 14! / (4!(14-4)!)\n\nC(14, 4) = 14! / (4!10!)\n\nC(14, 4) = (14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(14, 4) = (14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(14, 4) = 24024 / 24\n\nC(14, 4) = 1001\n\nSo, there are 1001 different sets of 4 players that can be chosen from a group of 14 people to form a bridge game."
