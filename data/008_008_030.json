    "message_1": "A factory produces two products: chairs and tables. Each chair yields a profit of $5, and each table yields a profit of $10. The factory can produce no more than 200 chairs and tables each day due to space and labor constraints. It also requires 4 hours to produce a table and 2 hours to produce a chair. The factory can operate at most 80 hours per day. What is the maximum daily profit the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced daily.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (due to space and labor constraints)\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 80 (due to the 80-hour operating limit)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 10y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the second constraint:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 80\nx + 2y ≤ 40\n\nNow, we can solve the constraint equations for y:\n\ny ≤ 200 - x (from the first constraint)\ny ≤ (40 - x)/2 (from the second constraint)\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we can analyze the corner points of the feasible region determined by these constraints. The corner points are (0, 0), (0, 20), (40, 0), and (20, 20).\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 20) = 5(0) + 10(20) = $200\n3. P(40, 0) = 5(40) + 10(0) = $200\n4. P(20, 20) = 5(20) + 10(20) = $300\n\nThe maximum daily profit the factory can make is $300 by producing 20 chairs and 20 tables."
