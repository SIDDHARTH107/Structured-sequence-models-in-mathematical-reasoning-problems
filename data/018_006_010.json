    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ A' = U, we need to show that every element in U is either in A or A', and there are no additional elements in A ∪ A'.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of A, denoted as A'. A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A = {1,3,5,7,9}, then A' = {2,4,6,8,10}.\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and A', denoted as A ∪ A'. The union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the sets. So, A ∪ A' = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.\n\nComparing A ∪ A' with the universal set U, we can see that they have the same elements: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. Therefore, A ∪ A' = U.\n\nHence, we have proved that the union of a set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
