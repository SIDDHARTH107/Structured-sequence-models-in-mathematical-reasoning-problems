    "message_2": "To find the length of the projection of vector 𝑎 onto vector 𝑏, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of projection = (𝑎 · 𝑏) / ||𝑏||\n\nwhere 𝑎 · 𝑏 is the dot product of vectors 𝑎 and 𝑏, and ||𝑏|| is the magnitude of vector 𝑏.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of 𝑎 and 𝑏:\n\n𝑎 · 𝑏 = (3)(5) + (-4)(12) = 15 - 48 = -33\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector 𝑏:\n\n||𝑏|| = √(5^2 + 12^2) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13\n\nNow, we can find the length of the projection of 𝑎 onto 𝑏:\n\nLength of projection = (-33) / 13 = -33/13\n\nThe length of the projection of vector 𝑎 onto vector 𝑏 is -33/13."
