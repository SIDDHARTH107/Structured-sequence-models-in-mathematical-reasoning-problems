    "message_1": "In the game of Stag Hunt, two hunters must decide whether to hunt a stag together, which would yield a payoff of 10 units of food, or hunt rabbits individually, which would yield a payoff of 2 units of food each. If one hunter decides to hunt rabbits and the other decides to hunt a stag, they will not be able to catch the stag and will only receive 1 unit of food each. \n\nSuppose you are playing Stag Hunt with a partner and you both have a 50% chance of choosing to hunt a stag. What is the expected payoff for each hunter if you both hunt a stag?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected payoff for each hunter, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities. There are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both hunters choose to hunt a stag (probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25). In this case, they catch the stag and each get a payoff of 10/2 = 5 units of food.\n2. Both hunters choose to hunt rabbits (probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25). In this case, they each get a payoff of 2 units of food.\n3. One hunter chooses to hunt a stag, and the other chooses to hunt rabbits (probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25). In this case, they each get a payoff of 1 unit of food.\n4. The other hunter chooses to hunt a stag, and one chooses to hunt rabbits (probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25). In this case, they each get a payoff of 1 unit of food.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected payoff for each hunter by multiplying the payoff of each outcome by its probability and summing the results:\n\nExpected payoff = (0.25 * 5) + (0.25 * 2) + (0.25 * 1) + (0.25 * 1) = 1.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 2.25 units of food.\n\nSo, the expected payoff for each hunter if they both hunt a stag is 2.25 units of food."
