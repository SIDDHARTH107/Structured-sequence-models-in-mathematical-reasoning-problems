    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of rolling two sixes in three rolls, we can find the probability of NOT rolling two sixes and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are three possible scenarios in which we do not roll two sixes:\n\n1. No sixes are rolled.\n2. One six is rolled, and it occurs in the first roll.\n3. One six is rolled, and it occurs in the second or third roll.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities of each of these scenarios:\n\n1. No sixes are rolled:\nThe probability of not rolling a six in one roll is 5/6 (since there are 5 non-six outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes). Since the rolls are independent, the probability of not rolling a six in all three rolls is (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = 125/216.\n\n2. One six is rolled, and it occurs in the first roll:\nThe probability of rolling a six in the first roll is 1/6. The probability of not rolling a six in the second and third rolls is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36. So, the probability of this scenario is (1/6) * (25/36) = 25/216.\n\n3. One six is rolled, and it occurs in the second or third roll:\nThis scenario is symmetric to the previous one, so its probability is also 25/216.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of NOT rolling two sixes by adding the probabilities of these three scenarios: 125/216 + 25/216 + 25/216 = 175/216.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of rolling two sixes in three rolls by subtracting the probability of NOT rolling two sixes from 1: 1 - 175/216 = 41/216.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling two sixes in three rolls of a fair die is 41/216."
