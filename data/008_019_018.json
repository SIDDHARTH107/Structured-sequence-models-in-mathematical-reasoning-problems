    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1   2  -1 |  1      ]\n[ 3  -4   5 | -4i     ]\n[ 2   1   3 |  2+3i   ]\n```\n\nWe will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get the largest absolute value in the first row:\n\n```\n[ 3  -4   5 | -4i     ]\n[ 1   2  -1 |  1      ]\n[ 2   1   3 |  2+3i   ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-1/3) * Row 1 + Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 3  -4   5 | -4i     ]\n[ 0   2 -4/3|  1+4i/3 ]\n[ 2   1   3 |  2+3i   ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (-2/3) * Row 1 + Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 3  -4   5 | -4i     ]\n[ 0   2 -4/3|  1+4i/3 ]\n[ 0   3   1 |  6+11i  ]\n```\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by 2:\n\n```\n[ 3  -4   5 | -4i     ]\n[ 0   1 -2/3|  1/2+2i ]\n[ 0   3   1 |  6+11i  ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 3 with -3 * Row 2 + Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 3  -4   5 | -4i     ]\n[ 0   1 -2/3|  1/2+2i ]\n[ 0   0   5 |  3+5i   ]\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to solve for x, y, and z.\n\n1. Divide Row 3 by 5:\n\n```\nz = (3+5i)/5 = 3/5 + i\n```\n\n2. Substitute z into Row 2:\n\n```\ny - 2/3(3/5 + i) = 1/2 + 2i\ny = 1/2 + 2i + 2/3(3/5 + i)\ny = 1/2 + 2i + 2/5 + 2/3i\ny = (7/10) + (22/3)i\n```\n\n3. Substitute y and z into Row 1:\n\n```\n3x - 4((7/10) + (22/3)i) + 5(3/5 + i) = -4i\n3x - (28/5) - (88/3)i + 3 + 5i = -4i\n3x = (28/5) - 3 + 4i - 5i + (88/3)i\n3x = (2/5) - (1/3)i\nx = (2/15) - (1/9)i\n```\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = (2/15) - (1/9)i\ny = (7/10) + (22/3)i\nz = 3/5 + i\n```"
