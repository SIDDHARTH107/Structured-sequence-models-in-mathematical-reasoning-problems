    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular polygon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (Perimeter × Apothem) / 2\n\nFirst, we need to find the perimeter and the apothem of the polygon.\n\nPerimeter (P) = Number of sides × Side length\nP = 8 × 10 cm = 80 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the apothem (a). The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. We can find the apothem using the formula:\n\na = s / (2 × tan(180° / n))\n\nwhere s is the side length and n is the number of sides.\n\na = 10 / (2 × tan(180° / 8))\na = 10 / (2 × tan(22.5°))\na ≈ 10 / (2 × 0.4142)\na ≈ 12.07 cm\n\nNow that we have the apothem, we can find the area of the polygon:\n\nArea = (Perimeter × Apothem) / 2\nArea = (80 cm × 12.07 cm) / 2\nArea ≈ 484.8 cm²\n\nThe area of the regular polygon is approximately 484.8 cm²."
