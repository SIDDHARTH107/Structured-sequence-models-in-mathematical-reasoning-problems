    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first divide by 3 to simplify:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, we can factor the equation:\n\n0 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNext, we need to determine if these critical points are relative maxima, relative minima, or neither. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the function is concave down at x = 1, which means there is a relative maximum at this point.\n\nSince f''(3) > 0, the function is concave up at x = 3, which means there is a relative minimum at this point.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 are x = 1 (relative maximum) and x = 3 (relative minimum)."
