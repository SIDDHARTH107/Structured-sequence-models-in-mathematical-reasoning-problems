Find the Chern classes of this complex manifold.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Chern classes of the complex manifold $M$, we will use the adjunction formula. First, let's compute the Chern classes of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\nThe tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is given by $T\\mathbb{CP}^3 = \\mathcal{O}(1)^{\\oplus 4}/\\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the hyperplane bundle. The total Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is given by:\n\n$$c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3) = (1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)))^4 (1 - c_1(\\mathcal{O})) = (1 + H)^4 (1 - 0) = (1 + H)^4,$$\n\nwhere $H$ is the first Chern class of the hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Expanding this expression, we get:\n\n$$c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 1 + 4H + 6H^2 + 4H^3 + H^4.$$\n\nNow, let's compute the normal bundle of $M$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The normal bundle is given by the dual of the conormal bundle, which is the ideal sheaf of $M$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The ideal sheaf is generated by the two quadrics $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, so we have:\n\n$$N_{M/\\mathbb{CP}^3} = \\mathcal{O}_M(Q_1) \\oplus \\mathcal{O}_M(Q_2).$$\n\nSince $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are both quadrics, their associated line bundles are $\\mathcal{O}(2)$. Thus, the total Chern class of the normal bundle is:\n\n$$c(N_{M/\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}(2)))^2 = (1 + 2H)^2 = 1 + 4H + 4H^2.$$\n\nNow we can apply the adjunction formula to compute the total Chern class of $M$:\n\n$$c(T_M) = \\frac{c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3)}{c(N_{M/\\mathbb{CP}^3})} = \\frac{(1 + H)^4}{1 + 4H + 4H^2}.$$\n\nExpanding the numerator and performing the division, we get:\n\n$$c(T_M) = 1 + 2H + 2H^2.$$\n\nThus, the Chern classes of the complex manifold $M$ are:\n\n$$c_1(M) = 2H, \\quad c_2(M) = 2H^2.$$"
