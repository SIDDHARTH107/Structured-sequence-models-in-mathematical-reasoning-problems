    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the time evolution of three variables x(t), y(t), and z(t). The system is defined by the following equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x-c)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are parameters. To find the first point of intersection between the Rössler system and the line y=0, we need to solve the system of ODEs numerically and find the first time t when y(t) = 0.\n\nHowever, you haven't provided the values for the parameters a, b, and c. Please provide these values so that I can proceed with the numerical solution."
