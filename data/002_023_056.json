    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (4 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 16 cm^2\nSurface Area = 64 * π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.1416, we get:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 64 * 3.1416 cm^2\nSurface Area ≈ 201.0624 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 201.0624 cm^2."
