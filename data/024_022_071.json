    "message_2": "To determine if $f$ is an isometry of the given metric, we need to check if the distance between any two points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is preserved under the transformation $f$. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the given metric is:\n\n$$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation $f$ to these points:\n\n$$f(x_1, y_1) = (x_1 + y_1, y_1)$$\n$$f(x_2, y_2) = (x_2 + y_2, y_2)$$\n\nThe distance between the transformed points is:\n\n$$d(f(x_1, y_1), f(x_2, y_2)) = \\sqrt{((x_2 + y_2) - (x_1 + y_1))^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$d(f(x_1, y_1), f(x_2, y_2)) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 2(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1) + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nComparing the expressions for $d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))$ and $d(f(x_1, y_1), f(x_2, y_2))$, we see that they are not equal in general, since the term $2(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)$ is present in the latter but not in the former. Therefore, $f$ is not an isometry of the given metric.\n\nTo find a metric for which $f$ is an isometry, let's consider a general metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ given by:\n\n$$ds^2 = A dx^2 + B dx dy + C dy^2$$\n\nwhere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants. We want to find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that the distance between any two points is preserved under the transformation $f$. In other words, we want:\n\n$$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = d(f(x_1, y_1), f(x_2, y_2))$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the transformed points, we get:\n\n$$A(x_2 - x_1)^2 + B(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1) + C(y_2 - y_1)^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + 2(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1) + (y_2 - y_1)^2$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the terms, we find:\n\n$$A = 1, \\quad B = 2, \\quad C = 1$$\n\nThus, the metric for which $f$ is an isometry is given by:\n\n$$ds^2 = dx^2 + 2 dx dy + dy^2$$"
