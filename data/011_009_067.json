    "message_1": "In a combinatorics class, a teacher asked the students to arrange a set of 6 books on a bookshelf. Each bookcase can accommodate at most 3 books. How many ways can the books be arranged on the bookshelf? Use Bell numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bell numbers, we need to find the number of ways to partition the set of 6 books into subsets, where each subset represents a bookcase. Since each bookcase can accommodate at most 3 books, we can have the following partition sizes: (3, 3), (3, 2, 1), (3, 1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 1, 1), and (2, 1, 1, 1, 1).\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways to arrange the books for each partition size:\n\n1. (3, 3): There are C(6,3) ways to choose 3 books for the first bookcase, and the remaining 3 books go to the second bookcase. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the books in each bookcase. So, the total number of arrangements for this partition is C(6,3) * (3!)^2 = 20 * (6)^2 = 720.\n\n2. (3, 2, 1): There are C(6,3) ways to choose 3 books for the first bookcase, C(3,2) ways to choose 2 books for the second bookcase, and the remaining book goes to the third bookcase. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the books in the first bookcase, 2! ways in the second bookcase, and 1! way in the third bookcase. So, the total number of arrangements for this partition is C(6,3) * C(3,2) * (3!) * (2!) * (1!) = 20 * 3 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n3. (3, 1, 1, 1): There are C(6,3) ways to choose 3 books for the first bookcase, and the remaining 3 books go to the other bookcases. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the books in the first bookcase. So, the total number of arrangements for this partition is C(6,3) * (3!) = 20 * 6 = 120.\n\n4. (2, 2, 2): There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 books for the first bookcase, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 books for the second bookcase, and the remaining 2 books go to the third bookcase. Then, there are 2! ways to arrange the books in each bookcase. So, the total number of arrangements for this partition is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * (2!)^3 = 15 * 6 * (2)^3 = 360.\n\n5. (2, 2, 1, 1): There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 books for the first bookcase, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 books for the second bookcase, and the remaining 2 books go to the other bookcases. Then, there are 2! ways to arrange the books in the first and second bookcases. So, the total number of arrangements for this partition is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * (2!)^2 = 15 * 6 * (2)^2 = 360.\n\n6. (2, 1, 1, 1, 1): There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 books for the first bookcase, and the remaining 4 books go to the other bookcases. Then, there are 2! ways to arrange the books in the first bookcase. So, the total number of arrangements for this partition is C(6,2) * (2!) = 15 * 2 = 30.\n\nNow, we sum up the number of arrangements for all partition sizes: 720 + 720 + 120 + 360 + 360 + 30 = 2310.\n\nSo, there are 2310 ways to arrange the 6 books on the bookshelf."
