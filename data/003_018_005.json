    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the given trigonometric function, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function y = 3sin(2x) - 5cos(3x) with respect to x.\n\ny'(x) = d/dx [3sin(2x) - 5cos(3x)]\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 3sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 3cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 2.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nd/dx [3sin(2x)] = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is -5cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 5sin(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 3.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nd/dx [-5cos(3x)] = 5sin(3x) * 3 = 15sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ny'(x) = 6cos(2x) + 15sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ny'(π/4) = 6cos(2(π/4)) + 15sin(3(π/4))\n\ny'(π/4) = 6cos(π/2) + 15sin(3π/4)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(3π/4) = √2/2, so:\n\ny'(π/4) = 6(0) + 15(√2/2)\n\ny'(π/4) = 15√2/2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function y = 3sin(2x) - 5cos(3x) at x = π/4 is y'(π/4) = 15√2/2."
