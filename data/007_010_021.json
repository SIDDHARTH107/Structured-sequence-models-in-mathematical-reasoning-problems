    "message_1": "Suppose a baker has three cake orders with requirements as follows: the first order requires 5 layers, the second order requires 7 layers, and the third order requires 9 layers. The baker can only bake cakes with a maximum of 10 layers each. Using the Chinese remainder theorem, what is the smallest number of cakes the baker needs to make to fulfill all three orders?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve this problem. Let x be the number of cakes the baker needs to make. We have the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 5 (mod 10) for the first order\nx ≡ 7 (mod 10) for the second order\nx ≡ 9 (mod 10) for the third order\n\nSince the moduli are all the same (10), we can combine the congruences into a single congruence:\n\nx ≡ 5 + 7 + 9 (mod 10)\nx ≡ 21 (mod 10)\n\nSince 21 ≡ 1 (mod 10), we have:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 10)\n\nThis means that the smallest number of cakes the baker needs to make is 1 more than a multiple of 10. The smallest such number is 11. Therefore, the baker needs to make at least 11 cakes to fulfill all three orders."
