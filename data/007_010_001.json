    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first find the product of the moduli, which is N = 7 * 11 = 77. Then, we compute the individual modular inverses.\n\nLet N1 = N/7 = 11 and N2 = N/11 = 7.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of N1 and N2.\n\nWe want to find integers y1 and y2 such that:\n\nN1 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nN2 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\n11 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n7 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nBy inspection or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find:\n\ny1 = 2 (since 11 * 2 = 22 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\ny2 = 8 (since 7 * 8 = 56 ≡ 1 (mod 11))\n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies both equations:\n\nx = (3 * N1 * y1) + (5 * N2 * y2) (mod N)\n\nx = (3 * 11 * 2) + (5 * 7 * 8) (mod 77)\n\nx = 66 + 280 (mod 77)\n\nx = 346 (mod 77)\n\nx ≡ 58 (mod 77)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies both equations is x = 58."
