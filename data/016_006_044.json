    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal generated using an iterated function system (IFS) with four transformation functions. Each iteration applies one of the four functions to the current set of points to generate a new set of points. \n\nIf we start with a single point and iterate the Barnsley fern 10 times, we will generate a total of 4^10 points, as each iteration multiplies the number of points by 4.\n\n4^10 = 1,048,576\n\nSo, after 10 iterations of the Barnsley fern starting with a single point, there will be a total of 1,048,576 points generated."
