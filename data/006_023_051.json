    "message_2": "To find the expected number of consumers who display this behavior, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number = Probability of the behavior * Total number of consumers\n\nExpected number = 0.3 * 150\n\nExpected number = 45\n\nSo, the expected number of consumers who display this behavior is 45."
