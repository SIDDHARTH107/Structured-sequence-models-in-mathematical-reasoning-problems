    "message_2": "First, let's recall some definitions:\n\n1. The index of a critical point p of a smooth function f is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of f at p.\n2. A non-degenerate critical point is a critical point with a non-singular (invertible) Hessian matrix.\n\nNow, let's prove the general result:\n\nLet's consider the Morse function f: M → R, where M is a smooth, compact, connected manifold of dimension n. We know that p is a non-degenerate critical point of f, and λ1, λ2, ..., λk are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of f at p.\n\nWe will use the Morse inequalities, which state that for any Morse function f and any integer k, the number of critical points of f with index less than or equal to k is at least\n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i\\binom{n+i}{i}\\binom{k}{i}.$$ \n\nNow, let's consider the specific example:\n\nLet M be the 2-dimensional torus (a donut shape) and let f(x,y) = cos(x) + 2 cos(y). We want to find the critical points of f and their indices.\n\nFirst, we find the gradient of f:\n\n∇f(x,y) = (-sin(x), -4sin(y))\n\nTo find the critical points, we set the gradient equal to zero:\n\n-sin(x) = 0\n-4sin(y) = 0\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n\nx = kπ, k ∈ Z\ny = l(π/2), l ∈ Z\n\nSince we are on a torus, we only need to consider x and y in the range [0, 2π). Thus, the critical points are:\n\n(0, 0), (π, 0), (0, π/2), (π, π/2), (0, 3π/2), (π, 3π/2)\n\nNow, we find the Hessian matrix of f:\n\nH(f) = | -cos(x)   0    |\n           |    0    -8cos(y) |\n\nWe can now find the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at each critical point:\n\n1. At (0, 0): λ1 = -1, λ2 = -8\n2. At (π, 0): λ1 = 1, λ2 = -8\n3. At (0, π/2): λ1 = -1, λ2 = 8\n4. At (π, π/2): λ1 = 1, λ2 = 8\n5. At (0, 3π/2): λ1 = -1, λ2 = 8\n6. At (π, 3π/2): λ1 = 1, λ2 = 8\n\nNow, we can find the indices of the critical points:\n\n1. At (0, 0): index = 2 (both eigenvalues are negative)\n2. At (π, 0): index = 1 (one eigenvalue is negative)\n3. At (0, π/2): index = 1 (one eigenvalue is negative)\n4. At (π, π/2): index = 0 (no eigenvalues are negative)\n5. At (0, 3π/2): index = 1 (one eigenvalue is negative)\n6. At (π, 3π/2): index = 0 (no eigenvalues are negative)\n\nSo, there are 6 critical points, with indices 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, and 0."
