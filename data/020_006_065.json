    "message_1": "A factory makes two types of products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A takes 2 hours to produce and each unit of Product B takes 4 hours to produce. The factory has a total of 50 hours available for production per day. The factory wants to produce at least 10 units of Product A and at least 5 units of Product B. However, the production line can only produce up to a total of 20 units per day. Also, they want to produce at least one more unit of Product A than of Product B. Formulate a mixed-integer programming problem to maximize their profit if the profit is $10 per unit of Product A and $20 per unit of Product B.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nMaximize P = 10x + 20y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Time constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 50 (each unit of Product A takes 2 hours to produce, and each unit of Product B takes 4 hours to produce, with a total of 50 hours available for production per day)\n\n2. Minimum production constraint for Product A: x ≥ 10\n\n3. Minimum production constraint for Product B: y ≥ 5\n\n4. Total production constraint: x + y ≤ 20 (the production line can only produce up to a total of 20 units per day)\n\n5. At least one more unit of Product A than Product B: x ≥ y + 1\n\n6.
