The sales profit for each product is based on the production volume as follows:\n\n- The profit for Product A is $10 per unit.\n- The profit for Product B is $15 per unit.\n\nThe production of the products is limited by the following conditions:\n\n- The total production time available is 1000 hours per week.\n- The maximum production capacity for Product A is 200 units per hour.\n- The maximum production capacity for Product B is 150 units per hour.\n- The total number of units produced cannot exceed 800 units per week.\n\nWhat should be the optimal production volume for each product to maximize the total sales profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced per week, and y be the number of units of Product B produced per week. We want to maximize the total sales profit, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production time constraint: x/200 + y/150 <= 1000/60 (since there are 1000 hours available per week)\n2. Total units constraint: x + y <= 800\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x >= 0 and y >= 0\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y <= 150(60 - x/200)\n2. y <= 800 - x\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the equalities and solving the system of equations:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 800\n2. y = 150(60 - x/200), y = 800 - x\n\nSolving the second system of equations:\n\n150(60 - x/200) = 800 - x\n9000 - 0.75x = 800 - x\n8200 = 0.25x\nx = 32800 / 4\nx = 8200\n\ny = 800 - 8200\ny = -7400\n\nSince y cannot be negative, this corner point is not feasible.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at the feasible corner points:\n\n1. Profit = 10(0) + 15(800) = 0 + 12000 = 12000\n\nThe maximum profit is $12,000, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 800 units of Product B per week."
