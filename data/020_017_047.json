    "message_1": "A metal factory produces rectangular metal sheets with a length of 20 cm and a width of 10 cm. The factory wants to reduce the length of the metal sheet by keeping the same area of the sheet. What should be the new length of the sheet that minimizes the cost of metal used per sheet? The cost of metal is proportional to the area of the sheet.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the new length as L and the new width as W. The area of the original metal sheet is 20 cm * 10 cm = 200 cm². Since the factory wants to keep the same area, we have:\n\nL * W = 200 cm²\n\nThe factory wants to minimize the cost of metal used per sheet, which is proportional to the area. To minimize the area, we need to minimize the perimeter of the rectangle, as the area is constant. The perimeter P is given by:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can express W in terms of L using the area equation:\n\nW = 200 / L\n\nSubstitute this expression for W into the perimeter equation:\n\nP = 2L + 2(200 / L)\n\nTo minimize the perimeter, we can take the derivative of P with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\ndP/dL = 2 - (400 / L²) = 0\n\nNow, solve for L:\n\n400 / L² = 2\n\nL² = 400 / 2\n\nL² = 200\n\nL = √200 ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the new length of the sheet that minimizes the cost of metal used per sheet is approximately 14.14 cm. To find the new width, we can use the area equation:\n\nW = 200 / 14.14 ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nThe new dimensions of the metal sheet that minimize the cost of metal used per sheet are approximately 14.14 cm by 14.14 cm, which is a square shape."
