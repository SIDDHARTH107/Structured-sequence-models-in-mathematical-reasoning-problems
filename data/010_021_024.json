    "message_2": "In a 2-dimensional space, the symplectic form can be represented by a 2x2 antisymmetric matrix. The standard symplectic form is given by the matrix:\n\nω = | 0  1 |\n      | -1 0 |\n\nThis form has the property that rotating by any angle is a symplectic transformation. To see this, let's consider a rotation matrix R(θ) for an angle θ:\n\nR(θ) = | cos(θ) -sin(θ) |\n          | sin(θ)  cos(θ) |\n\nA transformation is symplectic if it preserves the symplectic form, i.e., R^T * ω * R = ω. Let's check this for the given rotation matrix and symplectic form:\n\nR^T(θ) = |  cos(θ) sin(θ) |\n             | -sin(θ) cos(θ) |\n\nNow, let's compute R^T * ω * R:\n\nR^T(θ) * ω = |  cos(θ) sin(θ) | * |  0  1 | = | -sin(θ) cos(θ) |\n                    | -sin(θ) cos(θ) |   | -1  0 |   | -cos(θ) -sin(θ) |\n\nR^T(θ) * ω * R(θ) = | -sin(θ) cos(θ) | * |  cos(θ) -sin(θ) | = |  0  1 |\n                             | -cos(θ) -sin(θ) |   |  sin(θ)  cos(θ) |   | -1  0 |\n\nAs we can see, R^T * ω * R = ω, which confirms that rotating by any angle θ is a symplectic transformation for the given symplectic form."
