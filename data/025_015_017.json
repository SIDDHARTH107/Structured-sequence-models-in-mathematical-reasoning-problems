    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane containing the intersection of the given surfaces, we can first solve for one of the variables in the linear equation and substitute it into the quadratic equation. Let's solve for z in the linear equation:\n\nz = -x - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (-x - y)^2 = 9\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) = 9\n2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy = 9\n\nNow, divide the equation by 2 to simplify it further:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + xy = 9/2\n\nThis is the equation of the plane containing the intersection of the given surfaces."
