    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2 on the interval [-2, 3], we will first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\nx(3x - 6) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 0 and x = 2. These are the critical points.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 + 2 = -8 - 12 + 2 = -18\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 2 = 2\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2 = 8 - 12 + 2 = -2\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 3(3)^2 + 2 = 27 - 27 + 2 = 2\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 2, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 3, and the minimum value is -18, which occurs at x = -2."
