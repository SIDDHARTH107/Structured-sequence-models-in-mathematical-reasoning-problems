    "message_2": "To find out how many events should expect to be affected by rain, we can multiply the total number of events by the probability of rain.\n\nNumber of events = 200\nProbability of rain = 25% = 0.25\n\nExpected events affected by rain = Number of events × Probability of rain\nExpected events affected by rain = 200 × 0.25\nExpected events affected by rain = 50\n\nSo, 50 outdoor events should expect to be affected by rain."
