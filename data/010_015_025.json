    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology groups of Y, we first need to understand the topology of Y. Since Y consists of all points on the sphere X with nonnegative x-coordinate, it is a hemisphere (including the boundary, which is a great circle). The boundary of Y is a circle, which we will denote as Z.\n\nNow, we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the De Rham cohomology groups of Y. Consider the open sets U and V, where U is the interior of Y and V is a small open neighborhood of the boundary circle Z. Then, U ∪ V = Y and U ∩ V is an open annulus.\n\nThe De Rham cohomology groups of U are the same as those of a 2-dimensional disk, which are:\n\nH^0(U) = R\nH^1(U) = 0\nH^2(U) = 0\n\nThe De Rham cohomology groups of V are the same as those of a cylinder, which are:\n\nH^0(V) = R\nH^1(V) = R\nH^2(V) = 0\n\nThe De Rham cohomology groups of U ∩ V are the same as those of an annulus, which are:\n\nH^0(U ∩ V) = R\nH^1(U ∩ V) = R\nH^2(U ∩ V) = 0\n\nNow, we can set up the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the De Rham cohomology groups of Y:\n\n... → H^0(U ∩ V) → H^0(U) ⊕ H^0(V) → H^0(Y) → H^1(U ∩ V) → H^1(U) ⊕ H^1(V) → H^1(Y) → H^2(U ∩ V) → H^2(U) ⊕ H^2(V) → H^2(Y) → ...\n\nThe maps between these groups are alternating sums of restriction maps. Since H^0(U ∩ V) = H^0(U) = H^0(V) = R, the map H^0(U) ⊕ H^0(V) → H^0(Y) is an isomorphism. Thus, H^0(Y) = R.\n\nThe map H^1(U ∩ V) → H^1(U) ⊕ H^1(V) is injective, and since H^1(U) = 0, we have H^1(Y) = H^1(V) = R.\n\nFinally, since H^2(U ∩ V) = H^2(U) = 0, the map H^2(U) ⊕ H^2(V) → H^2(Y) is surjective, and thus H^2(Y) = 0.\n\nIn summary, the De Rham cohomology groups of Y are:\n\nH^0(Y) = R\nH^1(Y) = R\nH^2(Y) = 0"
