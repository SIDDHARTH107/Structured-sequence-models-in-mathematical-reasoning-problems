    "message_1": "A manifold can be triangulated if it is a separable metric space. A separable metric space is a space that has a countable, dense subset. Consider a sphere S², what is the minimum number of triangular faces needed to triangulate the surface of the sphere?",
    "message_2": "To triangulate the surface of a sphere (S²), we can use a polyhedron called a tetrahedron, which is the simplest 3-dimensional polyhedron that can be formed by connecting vertices with triangular faces. A tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 triangular faces. \n\nWhen we project the tetrahedron onto the surface of the sphere, each triangular face will cover a part of the sphere's surface. Therefore, the minimum number of triangular faces needed to triangulate the surface of a sphere is 4."
