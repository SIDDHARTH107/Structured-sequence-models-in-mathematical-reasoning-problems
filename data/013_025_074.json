    "message_1": "The travelers' dilemma is a game where two travelers participating in an airline baggage auction are faced with the decision of how much to declare the value of their respective bags. If they both declare the same value, the airline will charge them each that amount. However, if one declares a higher value and the other declares a lower value, the one who declares the lower value will be charged the amount of the higher value, while the one who declares the higher value will only be charged a slightly higher value. \n\nSuppose two travelers, Alice and Bob, are participating in this auction. Alice decides to declare that her bag is worth $200, and Bob must decide whether to declare his bag is worth less or more than Alice's. If Bob declares his bag's value as $150, he will be charged $200, and Alice will be charged $201. However, if Bob declares his bag's value as $250, he will be charged $250, and Alice will be charged $251. \n\nWhat is the best strategy for Bob to minimize the cost of the baggage fee, given these circumstances?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, Bob's best strategy to minimize the cost of the baggage fee is to declare his bag's value as $199. If he does this, he will be charged $200 (the higher value declared by Alice), and Alice will be charged $201. This way, Bob pays the least amount possible while still ensuring that he doesn't pay more than Alice."
