    "message_2": "This system of linear equations has a singular matrix, which means that the determinant of the matrix is zero. This can lead to either no solution or infinitely many solutions. Let's first find the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables:\n\nThe matrix is:\n```\n|  2  4 -8 |\n| -4 -8 16 |\n|  1  2 -4 |\n```\n\nTo find the determinant, we can use the first row:\n\nDeterminant = 2 * | -8 16 | - 4 * | -4 16 | - 8 * | -4 -8 |\n                         |  2 -4 |       |  1 -4 |       |  1  2 |\n\nDeterminant = 2 * (-8 * -4 - 16 * 2) - 4 * (-4 * -4 - 16 * 1) - 8 * (-4 * 2 - 8 * 1)\nDeterminant = 2 * (32 - 32) - 4 * (16 - 16) - 8 * (-8 - 8)\nDeterminant = 2 * 0 - 4 * 0 - 8 * (-16)\nDeterminant = 0\n\nSince the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular. Now, let's check if the system has no solution or infinitely many solutions by checking if the augmented matrix has a row of the form [0 0 0 | a] with a â‰  0.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n```\n|  2  4 -8 | 10 |\n| -4 -8 16 | -20|\n|  1  2 -4 | 5  |\n```\n\nWe can perform row operations to simplify the matrix:\n\n1. Add 2 times the third row to the first row:\n```\n|  0  0  0 | 20 |\n| -4 -8 16 | -20|\n|  1  2 -4 | 5  |\n```\n\n2. Add -2 times the third row to the second row:\n```\n|  0  0  0 | 20 |\n|  0  0  0 | 0  |\n|  1  2 -4 | 5  |\n```\n\nThe first row of the augmented matrix is [0 0 0 | 20], which means that the system has no solution."
