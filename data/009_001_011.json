If there are currently 500 deer in the city, write a differential equation that models the population growth over time. Using that equation, find the population after 5 years, assuming no natural predators or other factors that would limit the deer population.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth of the deer using a differential equation, we can use the exponential growth model:\n\ndP/dt = k*P\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population (P) with respect to time (t), and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nGiven that the deer population is growing at a rate of 8% per year, we have:\n\nk = 0.08\n\nSo, the differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.08*P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.08*dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P)dP = ∫0.08*dt\n\nln(P) = 0.08*t + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition that there are currently 500 deer in the city:\n\nln(500) = 0.08*0 + C\n\nC = ln(500)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution of the differential equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.08*t + ln(500)\n\nTo find the population after 5 years, we can plug t = 5 into the equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.08*5 + ln(500)\n\nln(P) = 0.4 + ln(500)\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.4 + ln(500))\n\nP ≈ e^(0.4) * 500\n\nP ≈ 1.4918 * 500\n\nP ≈ 745.9\n\nAfter 5 years, the deer population will be approximately 746, assuming no natural predators or other factors that would limit the deer population."
