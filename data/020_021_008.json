    "message_1": "A factory has a total of 500 units of two different products (Product A and Product B) that it needs to produce. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of packaging time, while each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of assembly time and 3 hours of packaging time. The assembly department works for a maximum of 600 hours in a week, while the packaging department works for a maximum of 900 hours in a week. Assuming that the factory wants to maximize productivity, how many units of each product should it produce to meet the demand?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 500 (total units)\n2. 2x + y ≤ 600 (assembly time constraint)\n3. x + 3y ≤ 900 (packaging time constraint)\n\nWe need to find the values of x and y that satisfy these constraints and maximize productivity.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the equation 1 for x:\n\nx = 500 - y\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the inequalities 2 and 3:\n\n2(500 - y) + y ≤ 600\n1000 - 2y + y ≤ 600\n1000 - y ≤ 600\ny ≥ 400\n\nAnd:\n\n(500 - y) + 3y ≤ 900\n500 - y + 3y ≤ 900\n500 + 2y ≤ 900\n2y ≤ 400\ny ≤ 200\n\nSo, the range of possible values for y is 400 ≤ y ≤ 200. However, this range is contradictory, which means there is no solution that satisfies all the constraints. The factory cannot meet the demand with the given constraints on assembly and packaging time."
