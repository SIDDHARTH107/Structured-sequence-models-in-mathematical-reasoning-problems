    "message_2": "Mori theory is a mathematical concept in algebraic geometry and is not applicable to finding the equation of a line in a two-dimensional plane. Instead, we can use the standard method of finding the slope and the y-intercept to determine the equation of the line.\n\nTo find the equation of the line passing through the points (1, -3) and (4, 2), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is given by:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is one of the points on the line and m is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (1, -3) and (4, 2):\n\nm = (2 - (-3)) / (4 - 1) = (5) / (3) = 5/3\n\nNow, we can plug the slope (m) and one of the points, say (1, -3), into the slope-point form:\n\ny - (-3) = (5/3)(x - 1)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ny + 3 = (5/3)(x - 1)\n\nNow, distribute the 5/3:\n\ny + 3 = (5/3)x - (5/3)\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\ny = (5/3)x - (5/3) - 3\n\nTo combine the constants, we need a common denominator, which is 3:\n\ny = (5/3)x - (5/3) - (9/3)\n\ny = (5/3)x - (14/3)\n\nSo, the equation of the line that passes through the points (1, -3) and (4, 2) is:\n\ny = (5/3)x - (14/3)"
