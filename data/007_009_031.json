    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers that share no common factors with n other than 1.\n\nTo calculate φ(12), we first find the prime factors of 12. The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we use the formula for the Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 12, we have two distinct prime factors: 2 and 3.\n\nSo, φ(12) = 12 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = 12 * (1/2) * (2/3) = 12 * (1/3) = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 12 is 4."
