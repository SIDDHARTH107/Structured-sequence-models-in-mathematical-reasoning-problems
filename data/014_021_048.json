    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext using the Hill cipher, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix. The key matrix is:\n\n```\nM H\nA R\n```\n\nWe'll convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\n```\n12 7\n0 17\n```\n\nNow, we'll find the inverse of this matrix modulo 26. The determinant of the matrix is:\n\n```\ndet = (12 * 17) - (7 * 0) = 204\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of the determinant modulo 26. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find it:\n\n```\ngcd(204, 26) = 2\n```\n\nSince the gcd is not 1, the matrix is not invertible modulo 26. This means that the given key matrix is incorrect or the ciphertext was not encrypted using the Hill cipher with a 2x2 key matrix."
