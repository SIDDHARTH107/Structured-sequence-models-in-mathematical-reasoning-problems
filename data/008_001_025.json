    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 2 -4  3 | -7 ]\n[ 3 -6  5 |  8 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform row operations to get the matrix into its reduced row-echelon form (RREF).\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -8  5 | -19]\n[ 0 -12 8 | -10]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -8:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -5/8 | 19/8]\n[ 0 -12 8 | -10]\n```\n\nStep 3: Add 12 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -5/8 | 19/8]\n[ 0  0  2 |  6 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -5/8 | 19/8]\n[ 0  0  1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nNow that the matrix is in RREF, we can read the solutions for x, y, and z directly from the matrix:\n\n```\nx = 6 - 2y + z\ny = 19/8 + 5z/8\nz = 3\n```\n\nSubstitute z = 3 into the equation for y:\n\n```\ny = 19/8 + 5(3)/8 = 19/8 + 15/8 = 34/8 = 17/4\n```\n\nSubstitute y = 17/4 and z = 3 into the equation for x:\n\n```\nx = 6 - 2(17/4) + 3 = 6 - 17/2 + 3 = (12 - 17 + 6)/2 = 1/2\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1/2, y = 17/4, and z = 3."
