    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector of the pizza that you have eaten, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then take one-fourth of it.\n\nThe area of a circle can be found using the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven the diameter of the pizza is 16 inches, the radius is half of the diameter, which is 8 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the entire pizza:\n\nA = πr^2\nA = 3.14 × (8^2)\nA = 3.14 × 64\nA = 200.96 square inches\n\nNow, we need to find one-fourth of the area:\n\nOne-fourth of the pizza = (1/4) × 200.96\nOne-fourth of the pizza = 50.24 square inches\n\nSo, the area of the sector of the pizza that you have eaten is 50.24 square inches."
