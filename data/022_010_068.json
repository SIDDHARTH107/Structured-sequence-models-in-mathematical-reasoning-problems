    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1) / (z - 2i) centered at z = 2i, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z - 2i). Let w = z - 2i, then z = w + 2i. Now, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(w) = ((w + 2i)^2 - 1) / w\n\nExpanding the numerator, we get:\n\nf(w) = (w^2 + 4iw - 3) / w\n\nNow, we can separate this into two parts:\n\nf(w) = (w^2 - 3) / w + 4i\n\nWe can rewrite the first part as a geometric series:\n\nf(w) = -3w^(-1) + w + 4i\n\nThe Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z = 2i is:\n\nf(z) = -3(z - 2i)^(-1) + (z - 2i) + 4i\n\nThe radius of convergence for a Laurent series is determined by the nearest singularity to the center of the expansion. In this case, the only singularity is at z = 2i, which is the center of the expansion. Therefore, the radius of convergence is infinite, as there are no other singularities in the complex plane."
