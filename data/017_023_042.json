    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information and use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 72, we can write it as a product of prime powers: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow p-subgroups of G:\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. The only possibilities are 1, 3, and 9. We are given that there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, so this case is determined.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. The only possibilities are 1 and 4. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups by n_3.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G based on the number of Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1. In this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P_2 and P_3 be Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup of G, respectively. Since P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, their product P_2P_3 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |P_2| = 8 and |P_3| = 9, we have |P_2P_3| = |P_2| * |P_3| = 72 by the formula for the order of a product of two subgroups. Thus, G = P_2P_3, and G is a semi-direct product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_2 is isomorphic to either Z_8, Z_4 × Z_2, or Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2, and P_3 is isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3, there are 6 possible semi-direct products in this case. However, one of them is the direct product Z_8 × Z_9, which is abelian, so we have 5 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 4. In this case, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal in G. Therefore, we cannot use the semi-direct product structure to determine the possible structures of G in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 5 non-abelian groups of order 72 that G could be isomorphic to when the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 9."
