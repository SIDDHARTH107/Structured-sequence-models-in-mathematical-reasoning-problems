    "message_2": "To find the period, amplitude, and range of the function y = 2sin(3x) + 1, we need to analyze the different components of the function.\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 2, so the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\n2. Period:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of the basic sine function is 2π, so to find the period of y = 2sin(3x) + 1, we divide the basic period by the coefficient of x:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\n3. Range:\nThe range of a sine function is determined by the amplitude and the vertical shift. In this case, the amplitude is 2, and the vertical shift is 1 (the constant added to the sine function). The sine function has a range of [-1, 1], so after multiplying by the amplitude and adding the vertical shift, the range becomes:\n\nRange = [(-1) * 2 + 1, (1) * 2 + 1] = [-1, 3]\n\nSo, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π) / 3, and the range is [-1, 3]."
