    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z+1)/z^2 at its singular point z=0, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a simple pole:\n\nRes[f(z), z=0] = lim (z->0) [(z-0) * f(z)]\n\nRes[f(z), z=0] = lim (z->0) [z * (z+1)/z^2]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nRes[f(z), z=0] = lim (z->0) [(z+1)/z]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nRes[f(z), z=0] = (0+1)/0\n\nThe limit does not exist, as the expression is undefined when z=0. This means that the function f(z) = (z+1)/z^2 does not have a residue at its singular point z=0."
