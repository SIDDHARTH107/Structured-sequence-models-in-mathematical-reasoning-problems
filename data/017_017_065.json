C_3 x C_5 ⋊ C_2: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 15 (C_3 x C_5) with the cyclic group of order 2 (C_2).\n3. C_5 x C_3 ⋊ C_2: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 15 (C_5 x C_3) with the cyclic group of order 2 (C_2).\n4. D_30: The dihedral group of order 30.\n\nThese groups are distinct up to isomorphism, meaning that there is no isomorphism between any two of these groups."
