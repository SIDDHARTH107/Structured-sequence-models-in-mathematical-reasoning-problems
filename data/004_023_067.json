    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves, we need to find the difference between the two functions and integrate that difference over the given interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference between the two functions:\n\ny1 = x^2\ny2 = 2x\n\nDifference: y2 - y1 = 2x - x^2\n\nNow, we'll integrate the difference over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate, we'll use the power rule for integration:\n\n∫(2x - x^2) dx = 2∫x dx - ∫x^2 dx = 2(x^2/2) - (x^3/3) + C = x^2 - (x^3/3) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\nArea = (x^2 - (x^3/3))| from 0 to 2\n\nArea = [(2^2 - (2^3/3)) - (0^2 - (0^3/3))]\n\nArea = [(4 - (8/3)) - (0)]\n\nArea = 4 - 8/3 = (12 - 8)/3 = 4/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x in the interval from x = 0 to x = 2 is 4/3 square units."
