    "message_1": "Consider a principal-agent model, where the principal hires an agent to complete a task. The agent has two effort levels: high and low. The principal does not know the effort level chosen by the agent, but she can give a monetary incentive to the agent based on the outcome of the task. If the agent puts high effort, then the probability of successfully completing the task is 0.8. If the agent puts low effort, then the probability of successfully completing the task is 0.4. If the task is successfully completed, the principal gives the agent a monetary incentive of $10. If the task is not successfully completed, the principal does not give any incentive.\n\nWhat is the optimal monetary incentive that the principal should offer the agent to ensure that the agent chooses the high effort level?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the utility of the agent when choosing high effort as U_H and the utility when choosing low effort as U_L. The agent will choose high effort if U_H > U_L.\n\nThe utility of the agent depends on the monetary incentive and the probability of successfully completing the task. We can write the utilities as follows:\n\nU_H = 0.8 * Monetary Incentive - Cost of High Effort\nU_L = 0.4 * Monetary Incentive - Cost of Low Effort\n\nTo ensure that the agent chooses the high effort level, we need U_H > U_L. Let's subtract U_L from U_H:\n\n0.8 * Monetary Incentive - Cost of High Effort > 0.4 * Monetary Incentive - Cost of Low Effort\n\nNow, let's solve for the Monetary Incentive:\n\n0.4 * Monetary Incentive > Cost of High Effort - Cost of Low Effort\n\nMonetary Incentive > (Cost of High Effort - Cost of Low Effort) / 0.4\n\nThe optimal monetary incentive that the principal should offer the agent to ensure that the agent chooses the high effort level is greater than (Cost of High Effort - Cost of Low Effort) / 0.4."
