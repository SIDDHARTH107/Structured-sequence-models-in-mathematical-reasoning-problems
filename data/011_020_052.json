    "message_1": "A company has 6 job openings for a pool of 12 qualified candidates. In how many ways can they fill the 6 job openings with the 12 candidates, provided that each candidate can only be hired for one job?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of candidates (12), k is the number of job openings (6), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nC(12, 6) = 12! / (6!(12-6)!)\n\nC(12, 6) = 12! / (6!6!)\n\nC(12, 6) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(12, 6) = 479001600 / (720 × 720)\n\nC(12, 6) = 479001600 / 518400\n\nC(12, 6) = 924\n\nSo, there are 924 different ways to fill the 6 job openings with the 12 candidates."
