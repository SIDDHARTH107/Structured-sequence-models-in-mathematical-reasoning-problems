    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. However, in this problem, we are not partitioning the set of desserts into subsets; instead, we are selecting 3 desserts out of 8. Therefore, we should use combinations to solve this problem.\n\nA combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of selection does not matter. The number of combinations of n items taken r at a time is denoted as C(n, r) or \"n choose r\" and is calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nIn this problem, we have 8 desserts (n = 8) and we want to choose 3 of them (r = 3). Using the formula, we can calculate the number of ways to select 3 desserts out of 8:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, the customer can select 3 desserts out of 8 in 56 different ways."
