    "message_1": "A car manufacturer claims that their new electric car model has an average range of 250 miles on a single charge with a standard deviation of 20 miles. A random sample of 30 electric cars of this model is taken to test this claim. What is the probability that the average range of this sample is greater than or equal to 255 miles?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average range of the sample is greater than or equal to 255 miles, we can use the z-score formula for sample means. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere X̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, μ = 250 miles, σ = 20 miles, n = 30, and X̄ = 255 miles. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (255 - 250) / (20 / √30) ≈ 1.94\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than or equal to 1.94. We can use a standard normal (z) table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability. \n\nUsing a z-table, we find that the area to the left of z = 1.94 is approximately 0.9738. Since we want the probability that the z-score is greater than or equal to 1.94, we need to find the area to the right of z = 1.94. This can be calculated as:\n\nP(z ≥ 1.94) = 1 - P(z ≤ 1.94) = 1 - 0.9738 ≈ 0.0262\n\nSo, the probability that the average range of the sample is greater than or equal to 255 miles is approximately 0.0262 or 2.62%."
