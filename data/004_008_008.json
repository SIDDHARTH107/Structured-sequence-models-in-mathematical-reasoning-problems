    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x² - 3 at the point (2, 5), we first need to find the derivative of the function, which will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x² - 3 is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 5). We do this by plugging in the x-coordinate of the point into the derivative:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 5) is 4.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point (2, 5) and m is the slope 4:\n\ny - 5 = 4(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = 4x - 8\n\ny = 4x - 3\n\nSo, the equation of the line tangent to the curve f(x) = x² - 3 at the point (2, 5) is y = 4x - 3."
