    "message_1": "A company plans to manufacture cylindrical cans with a volume of 200 cubic inches. The can will have a closed top and bottom made with a material costing $0.10 per square inch, and the side will be made with a material costing $0.05 per square inch. What should be the dimensions of the can to minimize the cost of production? Note that the height and radius of the can have to be equal.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the radius of the can as r and the height as h. Since the height and radius have to be equal, we can say h = r. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h. We are given that the volume is 200 cubic inches, so we can write the equation:\n\n200 = πr^2h\n\nNow, we can substitute h with r:\n\n200 = πr^2r\n200 = πr^3\n\nNow, let's find the surface area of the can. The surface area of a cylinder with a closed top and bottom is given by the formula A = 2πr^2 + 2πrh. Since the top and bottom are made of a material costing $0.10 per square inch and the side is made of a material costing $0.05 per square inch, we can write the cost function as:\n\nC(r) = 0.10(2πr^2) + 0.05(2πrh)\n\nNow, we can substitute h with r:\n\nC(r) = 0.10(2πr^2) + 0.05(2πr^2)\nC(r) = 0.15(2πr^2)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the minimum of the cost function C(r). We can do this by finding the derivative of C(r) with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 0.15(4πr)\n0 = 4πr\n\nSince r cannot be 0, there is no minimum cost when the radius is equal to the height. However, we can still find the dimensions that minimize the cost given the constraint that the volume is 200 cubic inches.\n\nFrom the volume equation, we can solve for r:\n\n200 = πr^3\nr^3 = 200/π\nr = (200/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the height, which is equal to the radius:\n\nh = r\nh = (200/π)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the dimensions that minimize the cost of production are r = (200/π)^(1/3) inches and h = (200/π)^(1/3) inches."
