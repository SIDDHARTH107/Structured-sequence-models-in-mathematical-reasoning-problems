    "message_1": "A company offers its employees two payment options for their sales performance. Option A offers a base salary of $5,000 plus a commission of 5% of their total sales. Option B offers a base salary of $8,000 plus a commission of 3.5% of their total sales. The employee knows that they can sell either $80,000, $100,000 or $120,000 in products over the year with equal probability. Using game theory, which payment option should the employee choose to maximize their expected earnings?",
    "message_2": "To determine which payment option the employee should choose, we need to calculate the expected earnings for each option based on the possible sales amounts.\n\nOption A:\n1. If the employee sells $80,000:\nEarnings = $5,000 + 0.05 * $80,000 = $5,000 + $4,000 = $9,000\n\n2. If the employee sells $100,000:\nEarnings = $5,000 + 0.05 * $100,000 = $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,000\n\n3. If the employee sells $120,000:\nEarnings = $5,000 + 0.05 * $120,000 = $5,000 + $6,000 = $11,000\n\nOption B:\n1. If the employee sells $80,000:\nEarnings = $8,000 + 0.035 * $80,000 = $8,000 + $2,800 = $10,800\n\n2. If the employee sells $100,000:\nEarnings = $8,000 + 0.035 * $100,000 = $8,000 + $3,500 = $11,500\n\n3. If the employee sells $120,000:\nEarnings = $8,000 + 0.035 * $120,000 = $8,000 + $4,200 = $12,200\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected earnings for each option, given that each sales amount has an equal probability of 1/3.\n\nExpected Earnings for Option A:\n= (1/3) * $9,000 + (1/3) * $10,000 + (1/3) * $11,000\n= $3,000 + $3,333.33 + $3,666.67\n= $10,000\n\nExpected Earnings for Option B:\n= (1/3) * $10,800 + (1/3) * $11,500 + (1/3) * $12,200\n= $3,600 + $3,833.33 + $4,066.67\n= $11,500\n\nSince the expected earnings for Option B ($11,500) are higher than the expected earnings for Option A ($10,000), the employee should choose Option B to maximize their expected earnings."
