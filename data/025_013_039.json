    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the Jacobian variety $J(C)$, we first need to determine the genus of the curve $C$. The curve is given by the equation $y^2 = x^5 - 4x^3 + 3x$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n = 5$. \n\nTo find the genus $g$ of the curve, we can use the formula for the genus of a hyperelliptic curve:\n\n$$g = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n - 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5 - 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 2$$\n\nSo the genus of the curve $C$ is $g = 2$. The dimension of the Jacobian variety $J(C)$ is equal to the genus of the curve, so the dimension of $J(C)$ is also 2.\n\nAs for the number of connected components, the Jacobian variety of a curve is always connected. Therefore, the number of connected components of $J(C)$ is 1."
