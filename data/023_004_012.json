    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = x^2 for values of x between -4 and 4, we first need to define the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit, and the integral is taken over the entire real line. However, since we are only interested in the interval [-4, 4], we will use the Fourier series representation instead.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ[a_n * cos(2πnx / (2L)) + b_n * sin(2πnx / (2L))]\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, given by:\n\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(2πnx / (2L))] dx, from -L to L\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(2πnx / (2L))] dx, from -L to L\n\nFor our function f(x) = x^2 and interval [-4, 4], we have L = 4. Let's compute the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_n = (1 / 4) * ∫[(x^2) * cos(2πnx / 8)] dx, from -4 to 4\nb_n = (1 / 4) * ∫[(x^2) * sin(2πnx / 8)] dx, from -4 to 4\n\nSince f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. Now we need to find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / 4) * ∫[(x^2) * cos(2πnx / 8)] dx, from -4 to 4\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(2πnx / 8) dx\nThen du = 2x dx, v = (8 / (2πn)) * sin(2πnx / 8)\n\nNow, using integration by parts:\n\na_n = (1 / 4) * [(8 / (2πn)) * x^2 * sin(2πnx / 8) | from -4 to 4 - (8 / (2πn)) * ∫[2x * sin(2πnx / 8)] dx, from -4 to 4]\n\nThe first term in the brackets will be zero since sin(0) = sin(2πn) = 0. Now we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\na_n = -(1 / (πn)) * ∫[x * sin(2πnx / 8)] dx, from -4 to 4\n\nAgain, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(2πnx / 8) dx\nThen du = dx, v = -(8 / (2πn)) * cos(2πnx / 8)\n\na_n = -(1 / (πn)) * [-(8 / (2πn)) * x * cos(2πnx / 8) | from -4 to 4 + (8 / (2πn)) * ∫[cos(2πnx / 8)] dx, from -4 to 4]\n\nThe second term in the brackets will be zero since the integral of cos(2πnx / 8) over a full period is zero. Now we need to solve the remaining term:\n\na_n = (8 / (π^2 * n^2)) * [x * cos(2πnx / 8) | from -4 to 4]\n\na_n = (32 / (π^2 * n^2)) * [cos(2πn) - cos(0)]\n\nSince cos(2πn) = 1 and cos(0) = 1, we have:\n\na_n = 0 for n ≠ 0\n\nNow we need to find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / 4) * ∫[x^2] dx, from -4 to 4\na_0 = (1 / 4) * [(1 / 3) * x^3 | from -4 to 4]\na_0 = (1 / 3) * (64 - (-64))\na_0 = 128 / 3\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-4, 4] is:\n\nf(x) = (128 / 6) + Σ[0 * cos(2πnx / 8) + 0 * sin(2πnx / 8)]\n\nf(x) = 64 / 3"
