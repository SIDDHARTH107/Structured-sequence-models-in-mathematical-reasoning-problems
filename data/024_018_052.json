    "message_1": "A student needs to calculate the sectional curvature of a surface at a specific point. The given information is: \n\n- The Gaussian curvature of the surface at the given point is 3.\n- The first fundamental form coefficient E = 4, F = 2, and G = 9.\n\nWhat is the sectional curvature of the surface at the given point for the normal vector pointing in the direction of (1, 1, 1)? Provide the answer rounded to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to find the tangent vector in the direction of (1, 1, 1). Let the tangent vector be (a, b), then the normal vector is (a, b, -1). We can use the first fundamental form coefficients to find the tangent vector.\n\nE(a^2) + 2F(ab) + G(b^2) = 1\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n4(a^2) + 4(ab) + 9(b^2) = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector (a, b) that is orthogonal to the normal vector (1, 1, 1). The dot product of these two vectors should be zero:\n\na + b - 1 = 0\n\nSolving for b, we get:\n\nb = 1 - a\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\n4(a^2) + 4(a)(1 - a) + 9(1 - a)^2 = 1\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n4a^2 + 4a - 4a^2 + 9 - 18a + 9a^2 = 1\n\nCombining terms, we get:\n\n9a^2 - 14a + 8 = 0\n\nSolving for a using the quadratic formula:\n\na = (14 ± √(14^2 - 4 * 9 * 8)) / (2 * 9)\n\na ≈ 0.67 or 1.33\n\nSince a + b = 1, we choose a ≈ 0.67, and then b ≈ 0.33.\n\nNow, we can find the sectional curvature using the Gaussian curvature (K) and the tangent vector (a, b):\n\nSectional curvature = K * (a^2 * b^2) / (a^2 + b^2)^2\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nSectional curvature = 3 * (0.67^2 * 0.33^2) / (0.67^2 + 0.33^2)^2\n\nSectional curvature ≈ 1.34\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface at the given point for the normal vector pointing in the direction of (1, 1, 1) is approximately 1.34 (rounded to two decimal places)."
