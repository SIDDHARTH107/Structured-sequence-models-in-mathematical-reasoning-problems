    "message_2": "To simplify the expression 2^3 x 2^4, we use the exponent rule for multiplying bases with the same base: a^m * a^n = a^(m+n).\n\nIn this case, the base is 2, and the exponents are 3 and 4. So, we add the exponents:\n\n2^3 * 2^4 = 2^(3+4) = 2^7\n\nNow, we calculate 2^7:\n\n2^7 = 128\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 128."
