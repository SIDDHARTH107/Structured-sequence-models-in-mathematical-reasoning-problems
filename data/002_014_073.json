    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, width of 6 cm and a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top/bottom = 10 cm * 6 cm = 60 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, the combined area is:\n2 * Area_top/bottom = 2 * 60 cm² = 120 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the width by the height:\nArea_left/right = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, the combined area is:\n2 * Area_left/right = 2 * 24 cm² = 48 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_front/back = 10 cm * 4 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, the combined area is:\n2 * Area_front/back = 2 * 40 cm² = 80 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together to find the total surface area:\nTotal_surface_area = 120 cm² + 48 cm² + 80 cm² = 248 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 248 cm²."
