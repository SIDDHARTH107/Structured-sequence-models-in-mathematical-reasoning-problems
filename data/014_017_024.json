    "message_1": "Using frequency analysis, a message was encrypted by substituting each letter of the English alphabet with another letter, i.e., A is always substituted with D, B is always substituted with L, C is always substituted with O, etc. The encrypted message is \"DLOLELDY PL TLDLYLJYL\". Determine the original message.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to perform frequency analysis on the encrypted message and compare it to the frequency of letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc. We will analyze the frequency of letters in the encrypted message and try to match them with the frequency of letters in the English language.\n\nHere's the frequency of letters in the encrypted message:\n\nD: 4\nL: 6\nO: 2\nE: 2\nY: 3\nP: 1\nT: 1\nJ: 1\n\nNow, let's try to match the frequency of letters in the encrypted message with the frequency of letters in the English language:\n\nL (6) -> E (most common letter in English)\nD (4) -> T (second most common letter in English)\nY (3) -> A (third most common letter in English)\nE (2) -> O (fourth most common letter in English)\nO (2) -> I (fifth most common letter in English)\nP (1) -> N (sixth most common letter in English)\nT (1) -> S (seventh most common letter in English)\nJ (1) -> H (eighth most common letter in English)\n\nUsing this substitution, we can now decrypt the message:\n\nDLOLELDY PL TLDLYLJYL\nETAOITAT AN STEAHAIO\n\nThe decrypted message is \"ETAOITAT AN STEAHAIO\". However, this doesn't seem to be a meaningful message in English. Frequency analysis is not always perfect, and sometimes it requires some trial and error or additional context to find the correct decryption. In this case, we may need more information or a different approach to decrypt the message accurately."
