    "message_1": "In a principal-agent setting, a CEO wants to incentivize a manager to increase profits by offering a bonus. The CEO offers a bonus of $10,000 if the manager increases profits by 20% and a bonus of $20,000 if the manager increases profits by 30%. If the manager's effort/expenses to increase profits by 20% is $50,000, and $70,000 to increase profits by 30%, what is the manager's optimal effort and expected bonus?",
    "message_2": "To determine the manager's optimal effort and expected bonus, we need to calculate the net gain for each scenario (20% profit increase and 30% profit increase) and compare them.\n\nScenario 1: 20% profit increase\nBonus: $10,000\nEffort/Expenses: $50,000\nNet gain: $10,000 - $50,000 = -$40,000\n\nScenario 2: 30% profit increase\nBonus: $20,000\nEffort/Expenses: $70,000\nNet gain: $20,000 - $70,000 = -$50,000\n\nComparing the net gains, the manager would have a higher net gain by choosing to increase profits by 20%. Therefore, the manager's optimal effort is to increase profits by 20% with an expected bonus of $10,000."
