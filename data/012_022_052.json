    "message_2": "To find the Ramsey number R(3,4), we will first try to find a coloring of the edges of K5 that does not contain a red triangle or a blue square. If we can find such a coloring, then R(3,4) must be greater than 5.\n\nConsider the following coloring of K5:\n\n1. Color the edges connecting vertices 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, and 5 and 1 with red.\n2. Color the remaining edges (connecting vertices 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 5, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 5) with blue.\n\nIn this coloring, there is no red triangle, as each vertex is only connected to two other vertices by red edges. There is also no blue square, as there is no cycle of length 4 with all blue edges.\n\nSince we have found a coloring of K5 that does not contain a red triangle or a blue square, R(3,4) must be greater than 5.\n\nNow, let's consider a complete graph K6. We will show that in any coloring of the edges of K6, there must be either a red triangle or a blue square.\n\nLet's focus on a single vertex, say vertex 1. There are 5 edges connected to vertex 1, and each of these edges must be colored either red or blue. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of these edges must have the same color, say red, without loss of generality. Let the vertices connected to vertex 1 by these red edges be vertices 2, 3, and 4.\n\nNow, consider the edges connecting vertices 2, 3, and 4. If any of these edges is red, then we have a red triangle (formed by vertices 1, 2, 3, or 1, 2, 4, or 1, 3, 4). If all three of these edges are blue, then we have a blue square (formed by vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5).\n\nThus, in any coloring of the edges of K6, there must be either a red triangle or a blue square. Therefore, R(3,4) = 6."
