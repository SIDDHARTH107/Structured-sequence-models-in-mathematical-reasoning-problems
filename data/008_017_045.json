    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  2  3 -4 |\n    | -3  5  1 |\n    |  6 -2 -8 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | -2  |\n    | 12  |\n\nNow, let's find the sparse matrix representation of A. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, our matrix A doesn't have any zero elements, so we can't represent it as a sparse matrix. Therefore, we can't use the sparse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve this system. Let's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Multiply the first row by 3 and add it to the second row to eliminate x from the second row:\n\nA = |  2  3 -4 |\n    |  0 14 -11|\n    |  6 -2 -8 |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    |  19 |\n    |  12  |\n\n2. Multiply the first row by -3 and add it to the third row to eliminate x from the third row:\n\nA = |  2  3 -4 |\n    |  0 14 -11|\n    |  0  7  4 |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    |  19 |\n    | -9  |\n\n3. Divide the second row by 2:\n\nA = |  2  3 -4 |\n    |  0  7 -5.5|\n    |  0  7  4 |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    |  9.5|\n    | -9  |\n\n4. Subtract the second row from the third row to eliminate y from the third row:\n\nA = |  2  3 -4  |\n    |  0  7 -5.5|\n    |  0  0  9.5|\n\nB = |  7  |\n    |  9.5|\n    | -18.5|\n\n5. Now we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = -18.5 / 9.5 ≈ -1.947\ny = (9.5 - (-5.5 * -1.947)) / 7 ≈ 0.526\nx = (7 - 3 * 0.526 + 4 * 1.947) / 2 ≈ 1.263\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 1.263\ny ≈ 0.526\nz ≈ -1.947"
