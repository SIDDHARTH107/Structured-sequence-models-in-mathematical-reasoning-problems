    "message_2": "To calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, it is made up of 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3), and each of these pieces is scaled down by a factor of 2 (s = 2) compared to the original triangle.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.58496\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.58496."
