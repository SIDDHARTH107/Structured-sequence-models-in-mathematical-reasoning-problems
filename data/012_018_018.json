    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to find the minimum cut of the graph, which is the smallest number of edges that need to be removed to separate the graph into two disconnected components.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 8 vertices and 16 edges. We can use Menger's theorem to find the minimum cut of the graph. Menger's theorem states that the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is equal to the minimum vertex connectivity of the graph.\n\nThe minimum vertex connectivity (k) of a graph can be calculated using the formula:\n\nk = (2 * E) / V\n\nwhere E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, E = 16 and V = 8, so:\n\nk = (2 * 16) / 8 = 32 / 8 = 4\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 4."
