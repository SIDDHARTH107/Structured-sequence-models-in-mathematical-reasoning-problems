    "message_1": "A torus has an outer radius of 6 cm and an inner radius of 2 cm. Determine the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (outer radius - inner radius) and r is the radius of the tube (inner radius).\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 6 cm and the inner radius is 2 cm. So, the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (R) is:\n\nR = (6 - 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 2 * 2^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 2 * 4\nVolume = 8 * π^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume:\n\nVolume ≈ 8 * (3.14159)^2\nVolume ≈ 8 * 9.8696\nVolume ≈ 78.9568 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 78.96 cubic centimeters."
