    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{Dv}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}v = 0$\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$:\n\n$\\gamma'(t) = (-2\\sin(t), 2\\cos(t), 3)$\n\nNow, let's find the covariant derivative of $v$ with respect to $\\gamma'(t)$. We have:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}v = \\frac{d}{dt}v + \\Gamma(\\gamma'(t), v)$\n\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Christoffel symbol. However, since we are working in Euclidean space, the Christoffel symbols are all zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}v = \\frac{d}{dt}v$\n\nNow, we want to solve the equation $\\frac{d}{dt}v = 0$. This means that the derivative of $v$ with respect to $t$ is zero, which implies that $v$ is constant along the curve. So, the parallel transport of $v$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is just $v$ itself.\n\nNow, let's find the final position and direction of $v$ after the parallel transport. Since $v$ is constant along the curve, its final position and direction will be the same as its initial position and direction. The initial position of $v$ is at the point $\\gamma(0)$:\n\n$\\gamma(0) = (2\\cos(0), 2\\sin(0), 3(0)) = (2, 0, 0)$\n\nThe initial direction of $v$ is $(1, 0, 0)$. Therefore, the final position and direction of $v$ after the parallel transport along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ are:\n\nFinal position: $(2, 0, 0)$\nFinal direction: $(1, 0, 0)$"
