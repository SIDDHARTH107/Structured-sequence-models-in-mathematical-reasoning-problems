    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of games the team has played so far as \"x\". Since the team has won 70% of its games, it has won 0.7x games and lost 0.3x games.\n\nNow, if the team wins its next 4 games, their total number of games played will be x + 4, and their total number of wins will be 0.7x + 4.\n\nTo find the win-loss record, we need to find the ratio of wins to losses. After winning the next 4 games, the team's win-loss record will be:\n\n(0.7x + 4) / (0.3x)\n\nTo express this as a fraction in lowest terms, we need to find a common factor for the numerator and the denominator. However, since 0.7 and 0.3 are decimals, let's first convert them to fractions:\n\n(7/10)x + 4 / (3/10)x\n\nNow, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimals:\n\n(7x + 40) / 3x\n\nThere are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, so the win-loss record for the season, expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, is:\n\n(7x + 40) / 3x"
