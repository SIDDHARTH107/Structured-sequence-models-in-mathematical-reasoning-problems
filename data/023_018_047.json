    "message_2": "To find the time-domain response of the system to the input $u(t) = \\cos(2t)$, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal. The Laplace transform of $\\cos(2t)$ is given by:\n\n$$U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\cos(2t)\\} = \\frac{s}{s^2 + 4}$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laplace transform of the output signal $Y(s)$ by multiplying the transfer function with the Laplace transform of the input signal:\n\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)} \\cdot \\frac{s}{s^2 + 4}$$\n\nTo find the time-domain response $y(t)$, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. We can do this by performing partial fraction decomposition on $Y(s)$:\n\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{A}{s+1} + \\frac{B}{s+2} + \\frac{Cs + D}{s^2 + 4}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by the common denominator, we get:\n\n$$s = A(s+2)(s^2 + 4) + B(s+1)(s^2 + 4) + (Cs + D)(s+1)(s+2)$$\n\nExpanding and collecting terms, we get:\n\n$$s = (A+B)s^3 + (2A+2B+C)s^2 + (4A+4B+D)s + 8A+4B$$\n\nComparing coefficients, we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$A + B = 0$$\n$$2A + 2B + C = 0$$\n$$4A + 4B + D = 1$$\n$$8A + 4B = 0$$\n\nSolving this system, we find:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{4}, B = -\\frac{1}{4}, C = -1, D = 2$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite $Y(s)$ using the values of A, B, C, and D:\n\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{1/4}{s+1} - \\frac{1/4}{s+2} + \\frac{-s + 2}{s^2 + 4}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$ to obtain the time-domain response $y(t)$:\n\n$$y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-t} - \\frac{1}{4}e^{-2t} - \\cos(2t) + \\sin(2t)$$\n\nSo, the time-domain response of the system to the input $u(t) = \\cos(2t)$ is:\n\n$$y(t) = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-t} - \\frac{1}{4}e^{-2t} - \\cos(2t) + \\sin(2t)$$"
