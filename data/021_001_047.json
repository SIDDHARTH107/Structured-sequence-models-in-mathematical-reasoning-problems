    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n\n[ 2  1 |  7 ]\n[ 1 -3 | -5 ]\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get a triangular matrix.\n\nWe want to eliminate the x term in the second equation. To do this, we can subtract half of the first row from the second row.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - (1/2) * Row1\n\n[  2   1  |   7  ]\n[  0  -3.5| -8.5 ]\n\nStep 3: Normalize the second row by dividing by the leading coefficient (-3.5).\n\nRow2 = Row2 / (-3.5)\n\n[  2   1  |   7  ]\n[  0   1  |   2.428571428571429  ]\n\nStep 4: Perform row operations to eliminate the y term in the first equation.\n\nRow1 = Row1 - Row2\n\n[  2   0  |   4.571428571428571  ]\n[  0   1  |   2.428571428571429  ]\n\nStep 5: Normalize the first row by dividing by the leading coefficient (2).\n\nRow1 = Row1 / 2\n\n[  1   0  |   2.285714285714286  ]\n[  0   1  |   2.428571428571429  ]\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 2.285714285714286\ny = 2.428571428571429\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 2.29\ny ≈ 2.43"
