Find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u) for T = 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian H(x, u, p) for this problem:\n\nH(x, u, p) = L(x, u) + p * f(x, u)\nwhere L(x, u) is the integrand of the cost function, f(x, u) is the differential equation, and p is the costate variable.\n\nIn our case, L(x, u) = x^2(t) + u^2(t) and f(x, u) = x(t) + u(t). So, the Hamiltonian is:\n\nH(x, u, p) = x^2(t) + u^2(t) + p(t) * (x(t) + u(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the Hamiltonian. To do this, we take the partial derivative of H with respect to u and set it to zero:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u(t) + p(t) = 0\n\nSolving for u(t), we get:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * p(t)\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equation. To do this, we take the partial derivative of H with respect to x and set it equal to the negative time derivative of the costate variable:\n\n-∂H/∂x = -∂p/∂t\n\nTaking the partial derivative of H with respect to x, we get:\n\n-∂H/∂x = -2x(t) - p(t)\n\nSo, the costate equation is:\n\n-2x(t) - p(t) = -∂p/∂t\n\nNow, we need to find the boundary condition for the costate variable. Since we are minimizing the cost function J(u), the final costate value is zero:\n\np(T) = 0\n\nNow, we have a first-order differential equation for the costate variable:\n\n-∂p/∂t = -2x(t) - p(t)\np(T) = 0\n\nSolving this differential equation, we get:\n\np(t) = -2 * (e^(T-t) - 1)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for p(t) into the optimal control input equation:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * p(t)\nu(t) = -1/2 * (-2 * (e^(T-t) - 1))\nu(t) = e^(T-t) - 1\n\nSince T = 1, we have:\n\nu(t) = e^(1-t) - 1\n\nSo, the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J(u) for T = 1 is:\n\nu(t) = e^(1-t) - 1"
