    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the system in matrix form:\n\nAX = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables, and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |      X = | x |      B = |  6  |\n    | 2  3  4 |          | y |          | 20  |\n    | 3  4  5 |          | z |          | 26  |\n\nNow we can partition matrix A into block matrices:\n\nA = | A11  A12 | = | 1  1 |  A11 = | 1 |  A12 = | 1 |\n    | A21  A22 |   | 2  3 |  A21 = | 2 |  A22 = | 3 |\n                      | 3  4 |  A31 = | 3 |  A32 = | 4 |\n\nNow we can write the system of linear equations in block matrix form:\n\n| A11  A12 | | x |   |  6  |\n| A21  A22 | | y | = | 20  |\n| A31  A32 | | z |   | 26  |\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the Schur complement method. First, we compute the Schur complement S of A with respect to A11:\n\nS = A22 - A21 * A11^(-1) * A12\n\nSince A11 is a 1x1 matrix, its inverse is simply 1/A11:\n\nA11^(-1) = 1\n\nNow we can compute S:\n\nS = A22 - A21 * A11^(-1) * A12 = 3 - 2 * 1 * 1 = 1\n\nNow we can rewrite the system of linear equations using the Schur complement:\n\n| A11  A12 | | x |   |  6  |\n| A21   S  | | y | = | 20  |\n\nNow we can solve the system for y:\n\ny = (20 - A21 * x) / S = (20 - 2 * x) / 1\n\nNext, we can substitute y back into the first equation to solve for x:\n\nx + (20 - 2 * x) + z = 6\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (6 - 20 + 2 * x + z) / 3\n\nNow we can substitute x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (20 - 2 * ((6 - 20 + 2 * x + z) / 3)) / 1\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 2\n\nNow we can substitute y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = (6 - 20 + 2 * x + z) / 3\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1\n\nFinally, we can substitute x and y back into the original equation to solve for z:\n\n1 + 2 + z = 6\n\nSolving for z, we get:\n\nz = 3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1, y = 2, z = 3"
