    "message_2": "To form the committee, we need to select 3 men from 5 men, 2 women from 4 women, and 2 children from 6 children.\n\nThe number of ways to select 3 men from 5 men is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 women from 4 women is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 children from 6 children is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to select men, women, and children:\n\nTotal ways = (ways to select men) * (ways to select women) * (ways to select children)\nTotal ways = 10 * 6 * 15 = 900\n\nSo, there are 900 ways to form the committee with 3 men, 2 women, and 2 children."
