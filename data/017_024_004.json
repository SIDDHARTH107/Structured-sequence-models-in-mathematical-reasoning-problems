    "message_2": "To determine which of the given possibilities the group of order 96 is isomorphic to, we will analyze each possibility using the relevant properties and theorems of group theory.\n\n1. Cyclic group C96:\nA group of order 96 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 96. By the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, if a group G is cyclic, then the number of elements of order d in G is φ(d), where φ is the Euler's totient function, and d divides the order of G. The order of G is 96, which has prime factorization 2^5 * 3. The divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. We need to find an element of order 96, so we need to compute φ(96). Using the formula for the Euler's totient function, we get:\n\nφ(96) = 96 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = 96 * (1/2) * (2/3) = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 elements of order 96 in a cyclic group of order 96. If our group has an element of order 96, then it is isomorphic to C96.\n\n2. Alternating group A4 × C4 × C2:\nThe order of A4 × C4 × C2 is (4! / 2) * 4 * 2 = 12 * 4 * 2 = 96. Since the direct product of groups is a group, A4 × C4 × C2 is a group of order 96. To determine if our group is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, we can analyze the structure of the group. A4 is a non-abelian group, while C4 and C2 are abelian. The direct product of a non-abelian group and abelian groups is non-abelian. Therefore, if our group is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, it must be non-abelian.\n\n3. One of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96:\nIf our group is not isomorphic to C96 or A4 × C4 × C2, then it must be isomorphic to one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nTo determine which possibility our group is isomorphic to, we can use the Sylow theorems. By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 96 must divide 3, and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 32. If our group has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup or a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then that subgroup is normal. If our group has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup or a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then it cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, since A4 is not a normal subgroup of A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nIf our group has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is a semi-direct product of these subgroups, and it is non-abelian. In this case, our group is isomorphic to one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group of order 96, we cannot definitively determine which of the given possibilities it is isomorphic to. However, we have provided the necessary conditions and analysis for each possibility, which can be used to determine the isomorphism once more information about the group is known."
