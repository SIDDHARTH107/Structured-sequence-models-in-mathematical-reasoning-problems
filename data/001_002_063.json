    "message_2": "To find the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line passing through the points (-2, 4) and (6, -2), we first need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).\n\n1. Find the slope (m):\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (-2 - 4) / (6 - (-2))\nm = (-6) / (8)\nm = -3/4\n\n2. Use the slope and one of the points to find the y-intercept (b):\ny = mx + b\nWe can use the point (-2, 4) for this step:\n4 = (-3/4)(-2) + b\n4 = 3/2 + b\nb = 4 - 3/2\nb = 5/2\n\n3. Write the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\ny = -3/4x + 5/2"
