    "message_1": "A company produces laptops in two different factories, Factory A and Factory B. The proportion of defective laptops produced in Factory A is 0.05 while the proportion of defective laptops produced in Factory B is 0.03. The company randomly selects a laptop from their inventory and it is found to be defective. What is the probability that the laptop came from Factory A?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that the laptop came from Factory A, and B be the event that the laptop came from Factory B. Let D be the event that the laptop is defective. We are asked to find the probability P(A|D), which is the probability that the laptop came from Factory A given that it is defective.\n\nWe can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem:\n\nP(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / [P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)]\n\nWe are given the probabilities P(D|A) = 0.05 and P(D|B) = 0.03, which are the probabilities of a laptop being defective given that it came from Factory A and Factory B, respectively. However, we are not given the probabilities P(A) and P(B), which are the probabilities that a laptop came from Factory A and Factory B, respectively.\n\nWe can assume that the company produces an equal number of laptops in both factories, so P(A) = P(B) = 0.5. Now we can plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A|D) = (0.05 * 0.5) / [(0.05 * 0.5) + (0.03 * 0.5)]\nP(A|D) = 0.025 / (0.025 + 0.015)\nP(A|D) = 0.025 / 0.04\nP(A|D) = 0.625\n\nSo the probability that the defective laptop came from Factory A is 0.625 or 62.5%."
