    "message_2": "a) The zeroes of f(z)\n\nTo find the zeroes of f(z), we need to solve the equation f(z) = 0:\n\ncos(z) + 3 = 0\ncos(z) = -3\n\nSince the cosine function has a range of [-1, 1], there are no zeroes for f(z) because cos(z) cannot be equal to -3.\n\nb) The poles of f(z)\n\nf(z) = cos(z) + 3 is an entire function, which means it is holomorphic (analytic) everywhere in the complex plane. Entire functions do not have any poles, so there are no poles for f(z).\n\nc) The order of the pole at z = 0\n\nAs mentioned in part (b), f(z) does not have any poles, so there is no pole at z = 0.\n\nd) The Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 0\n\nSince f(z) is an entire function, we can expand it as a Taylor series around z = 0. The Taylor series expansion of cos(z) is given by:\n\ncos(z) = Σ (-1)^n * (z^(2n)) / (2n)!, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = cos(z) + 3 is:\n\nf(z) = Σ (-1)^n * (z^(2n)) / (2n)! + 3, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\ne) The radius of convergence of the Laurent series expansion in part (d)\n\nSince f(z) is an entire function, its Laurent series expansion converges everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, the radius of convergence is infinite."
