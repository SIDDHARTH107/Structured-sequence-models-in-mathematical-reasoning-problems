    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the sine and cosine of an angle are related through the Pythagorean identity: sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. \n\nGiven that sin(θ) = 0.6, we can find the cosine of the same angle using this identity:\n\nsin²θ + cos²θ = 1\n(0.6)² + cos²θ = 1\n0.36 + cos²θ = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for cos²θ:\n\ncos²θ = 1 - 0.36\ncos²θ = 0.64\n\nTo find the cosine of the angle, we take the square root of cos²θ:\n\ncos(θ) = ±√0.64\ncos(θ) = ±0.8\n\nSince cosine can be positive or negative depending on the quadrant of the angle, the cosine of the angle could be either 0.8 or -0.8. However, in the context of a right triangle, the angle will be between 0 and 90 degrees, so the cosine will be positive:\n\ncos(θ) = 0.8"
