    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the condition in a group of 100 people, you can multiply the probability of having the condition by the total number of people in the group.\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Probability of having the condition × Total number of people\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 0.05 × 100\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 5\n\nSo, in a group of 100 people, the expected number of people who have the condition is 5."
