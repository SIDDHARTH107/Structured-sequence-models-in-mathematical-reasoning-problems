    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. BC (1)\n2. AC (2)\n3. CD (3)\n4. AB (4)\n5. BD (5)\n6. CE (6)\n7. DE (7)\n\nNow, we add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create a cycle:\n\n1. Add BC (1)\n2. Add AC (2)\n3. Add CD (3) - At this point, adding AB would create a cycle, so we skip it.\n4. Skip AB (4)\n5. Add BD (5) - Adding CE or DE would create a cycle, so we stop here.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree consists of the edges BC, AC, CD, and BD with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11."
