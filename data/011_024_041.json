    "message_1": "A shipment of 500 packages needs to be transported from warehouse A to warehouse B through a network of transportation routes. Each route has a limited capacity for the number of packages it can carry. The following table shows the routes, their maximum capacity, and their transportation cost per package:\n\n| Route  | Maximum Capacity | Cost per Package |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------|\n|   1    |       100       |        $10       |\n|   2    |       200       |        $8        |\n|   3    |       150       |        $12       |\n|   4    |       100       |        $14       |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost to transport all 500 packages from warehouse A to warehouse B?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost, we should prioritize using the routes with the lowest cost per package. We can start by using Route 2, which has the lowest cost per package ($8) and can carry 200 packages. Then, we can use Route 1, which has the next lowest cost per package ($10) and can carry 100 packages. Finally, we can use Route 3, which has a cost per package of $12 and can carry the remaining 200 packages. We don't need to use Route 4 since its cost per package is the highest and the other routes can cover the entire shipment.\n\nThe minimum cost can be calculated as follows:\n\nCost for Route 2 = 200 packages * $8/package = $1600\nCost for Route 1 = 100 packages * $10/package = $1000\nCost for Route 3 = 200 packages * $12/package = $2400\n\nTotal minimum cost = $1600 + $1000 + $2400 = $5000\n\nSo, the minimum cost to transport all 500 packages from warehouse A to warehouse B is $5000."
