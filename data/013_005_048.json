    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve based on the Chicken Game in Game Theory:\n\nTwo drivers, John and Jane, are playing the Chicken Game. Each of them must make a choice to either swerve or continue driving straight ahead. If they both swerve, they will both be safe but neither will win. If one swerves and the other doesn't, the driver who doesn't swerve will win and the other will be a chicken. However, if neither swerves, they will crash and both will lose. \n\nIf John has a payoff matrix of { (5,5), (-10,10) } where the first number indicates his payoff and the second number indicates Jane's payoff, what should John do to maximize his chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for John, we need to analyze the payoff matrix. The matrix is given as:\n\n{(5,5), (-10,10)}\n\nThis matrix represents the following scenarios:\n\n1. (5,5): Both John and Jane swerve, and neither wins, but both are safe.\n2. (-10,10): John doesn't swerve, Jane swerves, John loses (is the chicken), and Jane wins.\n\nSince there are only two possible scenarios in this payoff matrix, John should choose the option that maximizes his payoff. Comparing the payoffs for John in both scenarios:\n\n1. Swerve: John's payoff is 5.\n2. Don't swerve: John's payoff is -10.\n\nIn this case, John should choose to swerve, as it gives him a higher payoff (5) compared to not swerving (-10). This means that John should prioritize his safety over trying to win the game, as the potential loss is greater than the potential gain."
