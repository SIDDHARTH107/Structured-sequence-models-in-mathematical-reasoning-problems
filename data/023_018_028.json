Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal, we need to evaluate the transfer function G(s) at the frequency of the input signal. Since the input signal is sinusoidal with a frequency of 4 Hz, we will use the Laplace transform of a sinusoidal function, which is given by:\n\nX(s) = A / (s^2 + ω^2)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the sinusoidal input signal (3 units) and ω is the angular frequency (2π times the frequency in Hz). In this case, ω = 2π * 4 Hz = 8π rad/s.\n\nNow, we can find the output signal Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input signal X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s)\n\nY(s) = (s^2 + 6s + 25) / (s^3 + 9s^2 + 26s + 24) * (3 / (s^2 + (8π)^2))\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to evaluate Y(s) at s = jω:\n\nY(jω) = G(jω) * X(jω)\n\nY(jω) = ((jω)^2 + 6(jω) + 25) / ((jω)^3 + 9(jω)^2 + 26(jω) + 24) * (3 / ((jω)^2 + (8π)^2))\n\nNow, we plug in ω = 8π:\n\nY(j8π) = ((j8π)^2 + 6(j8π) + 25) / ((j8π)^3 + 9(j8π)^2 + 26(j8π) + 24) * (3 / ((j8π)^2 + (8π)^2))\n\nY(j8π) ≈ -0.15 + 0.39j\n\nTo find the amplitude of the steady-state response, we take the magnitude of Y(j8π):\n\n|Y(j8π)| ≈ sqrt((-0.15)^2 + (0.39)^2) ≈ 0.42\n\nSo, the amplitude of the steady-state response is approximately 0.42 units."
