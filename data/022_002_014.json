    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle |z| = 1/2 under the mapping f(z) = z^2, we first need to parameterize the circle |z| = 1/2. We can do this using the polar form of complex numbers:\n\nz = re^(iθ) where r = 1/2 and θ varies from 0 to 2π.\n\nNow, we apply the mapping f(z) = z^2:\n\nf(z) = (re^(iθ))^2 = r^2 * e^(2iθ)\n\nSince r = 1/2, we have:\n\nf(z) = (1/2)^2 * e^(2iθ) = 1/4 * e^(2iθ)\n\nNow, let's find the image of the circle |z| = 1/2 under the mapping f(z). The magnitude of f(z) is:\n\n|f(z)| = |1/4 * e^(2iθ)| = 1/4\n\nSo, the image of the circle |z| = 1/2 under the mapping f(z) = z^2 is another circle with radius 1/4 and centered at the origin. The equation of this circle is:\n\n|w| = 1/4, where w is the image of z under the mapping f(z)."
