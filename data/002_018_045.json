    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches all six faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nPlugging in the given radius:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\nV = 36π cm^3\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 36π cubic centimeters, or approximately 113.097 cubic centimeters."
