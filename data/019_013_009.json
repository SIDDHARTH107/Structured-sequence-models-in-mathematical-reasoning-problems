Define a second-order formula for the set Q which contains all positive integers n which satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1) n is divisible by some prime p in P, and\n2) for every prime q in P, if q divides m then q also divides n.\n\nWhat is the smallest positive integer in set Q?",
    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer in set Q, we need to consider the conditions given.\n\n1) n is divisible by some prime p in P: This means that n has at least one prime factor.\n\n2) for every prime q in P, if q divides m then q also divides n: This means that n must have all the prime factors that any other positive integer m has.\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, n must have all prime factors of all positive integers. Since the prime factors of a positive integer are unique, we can find the smallest positive integer in set Q by taking the product of the smallest prime numbers.\n\nThe smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, and so on.\n\nHowever, we only need to consider the smallest prime numbers up to the point where their product is greater than the next prime number. This is because if we include the next prime number in the product, it would no longer be the smallest positive integer in set Q.\n\nThe smallest prime numbers that satisfy this condition are 2, 3, and 5. Their product is 2 × 3 × 5 = 30. The next prime number is 7, and 30 is less than 7 × 7 = 49.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer in set Q is 30."
