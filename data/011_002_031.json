    "message_2": "Yes, I can help the student solve this problem. \n\nFirst, let's understand what the notation means. \"nCr\" or \"C(n, r)\" is the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items. The formula for finding the number of combinations is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere \"n!\" denotes the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nNow let's solve the given expression:\n\n3C2 + 5C3\n\nFirst, we'll find the value of 3C2:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\n= 3! / (2!1!)\n= (3×2×1) / ((2×1)(1))\n= 6 / 2\n= 3\n\nNext, we'll find the value of 5C3:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3!2!)\n= (5×4×3×2×1) / ((3×2×1)(2×1))\n= 120 / (6×2)\n= 120 / 12\n= 10\n\nNow, we'll add the two values:\n\n3C2 + 5C3 = 3 + 10 = 13\n\nSo, the value of the expression 3C2 + 5C3 is 13."
