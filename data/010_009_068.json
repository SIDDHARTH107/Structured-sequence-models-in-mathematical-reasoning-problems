    "message_1": "Consider a triangle with side lengths of 5, 6, and 7. We want to triangulate this triangle into smaller triangles with sides of length 2 by drawing non-intersecting line segments from each vertex to the opposite side. How many smaller triangles will we end up with?",
    "message_2": "Let's label the vertices of the triangle A, B, and C, with side AB = 5, BC = 6, and AC = 7. We will draw non-intersecting line segments from each vertex to the opposite side, dividing the sides into segments of length 2.\n\nStarting with side AB, we can divide it into segments of length 2 and 3. Draw a line segment from vertex C to the point on side AB where the division occurs. This creates two smaller triangles.\n\nNext, divide side BC into segments of length 2 and 4. Draw a line segment from vertex A to the point on side BC where the division occurs. This creates two smaller triangles within the larger triangle, but also divides one of the triangles created in the previous step into two smaller triangles. So, we now have a total of 4 smaller triangles.\n\nFinally, divide side AC into segments of length 2, 2, and 3. Draw a line segment from vertex B to the point on side AC where each division occurs. This creates two smaller triangles within the larger triangle, and also divides two of the triangles created in the previous steps into two smaller triangles each. So, we now have a total of 7 smaller triangles.\n\nThus, by drawing non-intersecting line segments from each vertex to the opposite side, we end up with 7 smaller triangles."
