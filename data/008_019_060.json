    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method in this case.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equations:\n\nEquation 1: 3x + 5yi = 7 + 2zi\nEquation 2: 2x - 4yi = 2 + 3zi\n\nWe can eliminate the yi term by multiplying Equation 1 by 4 and Equation 2 by 5, and then adding the two equations:\n\n4 * (3x + 5yi) = 4 * (7 + 2zi)\n5 * (2x - 4yi) = 5 * (2 + 3zi)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n12x + 20yi = 28 + 8zi\n10x - 20yi = 10 + 15zi\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(12x + 20yi) + (10x - 20yi) = (28 + 8zi) + (10 + 15zi)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n22x = 38 + 23zi\n\nNow, divide by 22:\n\nx = (38 + 23zi) / 22\n\nx = 19/11 + (23/22)zi\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find the value of yi. We will use Equation 1:\n\n3x + 5yi = 7 + 2zi\n\n3(19/11 + (23/22)zi) + 5yi = 7 + 2zi\n\n(57/11 + (69/22)zi) + 5yi = 7 + 2zi\n\nNow, equate the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\nReal part: 57/11 + 5yi = 7\nImaginary part: 69/22zi = 2zi\n\nFor the imaginary part, we have:\n\n69/22 = 2\n69 = 44\nyi = 69/44\n\nNow we have the values of x and yi:\n\nx = 19/11 + (23/22)zi\nyi = 69/44\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 19/11 + (23/22)zi\nyi = 69/44"
