    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each stage, each segment is divided into 4 new segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor is 3, as each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the number of iterations (n) or the initial segment length, as it is a property of the fractal itself. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after stage n, with an initial segment length of 1 unit, is approximately 1.2619."
