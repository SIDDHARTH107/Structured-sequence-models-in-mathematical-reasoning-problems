    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points. In this case, we are looking for transformations that preserve the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$. Let's consider the transformation $f(x,y) = (x_0 + x, y_0 - y)$ and find the conditions on $x_0$ and $y_0$ for it to be an isometry.\n\nFirst, let's compute the differential of the transformation:\n\n$$df = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} dx \\\\ dy \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} dx \\\\ -dy \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, let's compute the metric under this transformation:\n\n$$ds'^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 = dx^2 + (-dy)^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$$\n\nSince $ds'^2 = ds^2$, the transformation $f(x,y) = (x_0 + x, y_0 - y)$ is an isometry.\n\nNow, let's find the conditions on $x_0$ and $y_0$ such that the isometry maps $(0,0)$ to $(x_0, y_0)$. Applying the transformation to $(0,0)$, we get:\n\n$$f(0,0) = (x_0 + 0, y_0 - 0) = (x_0, y_0)$$\n\nSince the transformation maps $(0,0)$ to $(x_0, y_0)$, there are no additional conditions on $x_0$ and $y_0$. Therefore, any values of $x_0$ and $y_0$ will satisfy the given condition, and the isometry is given by $f(x,y) = (x_0 + x, y_0 - y)$."
