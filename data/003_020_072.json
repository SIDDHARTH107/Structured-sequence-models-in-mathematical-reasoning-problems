    "message_1": "A student is standing 100 meters away from a tall building. The student wants to determine the height of the building. The angle between the ground and the top of the building is 60°. Using trigonometry, what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle, the opposite side (height of the building), and the adjacent side (distance from the building) in a right triangle.\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this problem, the angle is 60°, the opposite side is the height of the building (which we want to find), and the adjacent side is 100 meters.\n\ntan(60°) = height / 100\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = tan(60°) * 100\n\nThe tangent of 60° is equal to √3, so:\n\nheight = √3 * 100\n\nheight ≈ 1.732 * 100\n\nheight ≈ 173.2 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 173.2 meters."
