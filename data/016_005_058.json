    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. In each iteration, the number of line segments doubles. Let's calculate the total number of line segments for each iteration:\n\n1st iteration: 1 line segment (initial line)\n2nd iteration: 2 line segments (1 * 2)\n3rd iteration: 4 line segments (2 * 2)\n4th iteration: 8 line segments (4 * 2)\n5th iteration: 16 line segments (8 * 2)\n\nNow, let's sum up the line segments from all iterations:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n\nSo, the total number of line segments required to construct the Cantor set up to its 5th iteration is 31."
