    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $100,000 to allocate to two different advertising campaigns: online and television. The online campaign costs $1 per impression, while the television campaign costs $10 per viewer. The company wants to reach at least 200,000 potential customers. What is the optimal allocation of the budget between online and television advertising in order to minimize the total cost while achieving the target audience?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of online impressions and y be the number of television viewers. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. The total cost constraint: $1x + $10y <= $100,000\n2. The target audience constraint: x + y >= 200,000\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we want to maximize the number of online impressions since they are cheaper. Therefore, we will try to minimize the number of television viewers (y).\n\nFrom the target audience constraint, we can write y as:\n\ny = 200,000 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the total cost constraint:\n\n$1x + $10(200,000 - x) <= $100,000\n\nSimplify the inequality:\n\nx + 2,000,000 - 10x <= 100,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9x >= 1,900,000\n\nNow, divide by 9:\n\nx >= 211,111.11\n\nSince x must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nx = 211,112\n\nNow, find the value of y using the target audience constraint:\n\ny = 200,000 - 211,112 = -11,112\n\nSince y cannot be negative, the company cannot achieve the target audience of 200,000 potential customers with the given budget of $100,000. Therefore, it is not possible to find an optimal allocation of the budget between online and television advertising to achieve the target audience while minimizing the total cost."
