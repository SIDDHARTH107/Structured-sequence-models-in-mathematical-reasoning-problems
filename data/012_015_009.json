    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges. Is this graph connected or disconnected? If it is connected, prove it. If it is disconnected, identify the number of connected components and the corresponding vertices in each component.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices, so a connected graph must have at least 6 edges. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of edges a disconnected graph with 7 vertices can have. The most unbalanced partition of the vertices would be 6 vertices in one component and 1 vertex in the other. A complete graph with 6 vertices has (6 * 5) / 2 = 15 edges. However, since the graph is disconnected, we need to subtract at least one edge to break the connection between the two components. So, the maximum number of edges in a disconnected graph with 7 vertices is 14.\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a disconnected graph with 7 vertices, it is possible that the graph is disconnected. However, we cannot determine the exact number of connected components and the corresponding vertices in each component without more information about the graph's structure."
