    "message_2": "In the matching pennies game, there are 4 possible outcomes when both players play randomly:\n\n1. W shows heads and X shows heads (W wins)\n2. W shows heads and X shows tails (X wins)\n3. W shows tails and X shows heads (X wins)\n4. W shows tails and X shows tails (W wins)\n\nThere are 2 outcomes where W wins (both pennies show heads or both pennies show tails) out of the 4 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that W will win is:\n\nProbability (W wins) = (Number of winning outcomes for W) / (Total possible outcomes) = 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%."
