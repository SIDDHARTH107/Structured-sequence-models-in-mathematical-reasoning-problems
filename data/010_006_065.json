    "message_1": "A math student is asked to compute the fundamental group of the space obtained by gluing the edges of a square S to a point x. Specifically, let S = [0,1] x [0,1] be the unit square in the plane, let x = (1/2,1/2) be the center of the square, and let the identification be made as follows: identify the left edge of the square with the bottom edge, and identify the top edge with the right edge, all with the orientation from left to right and from bottom to top. What is the fundamental group of the resulting space?",
    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the resulting space, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we need to divide the square into two open sets U and V such that their intersection is simply connected. We can choose U to be the square with a small open disk removed around the center point x, and V to be an open disk centered at x that covers the edges of the square.\n\nBoth U and V are simply connected, and their intersection U ∩ V is also simply connected. According to the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of the resulting space is the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, divided by the normal subgroup generated by the relations between the fundamental groups of U and V.\n\nSince U, V, and U ∩ V are all simply connected, their fundamental groups are trivial (i.e., the group with only one element). Therefore, the fundamental group of the resulting space is the free product of two trivial groups, which is also a trivial group.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the resulting space is the trivial group, denoted as {1} or {e}, where e is the identity element."
