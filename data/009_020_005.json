    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). The PMP states that the optimal control input u(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian H, which is given by:\n\nH = L + λ'(t) * f\n\nwhere L is the Lagrangian, λ(t) is the costate variable, and f is the system dynamics. In our case, we have:\n\nL = y²(t) + u²(t)\nf = y''(t) + 5y'(t) + 6y(t) - u(t)\n\nThe Hamiltonian is:\n\nH = y²(t) + u²(t) + λ'(t) * (y''(t) + 5y'(t) + 6y(t) - u(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations. The costate equations are given by:\n\nλ'(t) = -∂H/∂y(t)\nλ'(t) = -2y(t) - 6λ(t)\n\nand\n\nλ''(t) = -∂H/∂y'(t)\nλ''(t) = -5λ'(t)\n\nNow, we need to minimize the Hamiltonian with respect to the control input u(t). The optimal control input u*(t) is given by:\n\nu*(t) = -∂H/∂u(t)\nu*(t) = -2u(t) + λ'(t)\n\nSince |u(t)| ≤ 1, we have:\n\n-1 ≤ u*(t) ≤ 1\n\nNow, we have a boundary value problem with the following equations:\n\n1. y''(t) + 5y'(t) + 6y(t) = u*(t)\n2. λ''(t) = -5λ'(t)\n3. u*(t) = -2u(t) + λ'(t), with -1 ≤ u*(t) ≤ 1\n4. y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0\n\nTo solve this boundary value problem, we can use numerical methods such as the shooting method or the finite difference method. However, this problem is quite complex and does not have a closed-form solution. Therefore, we cannot provide an explicit expression for the optimal control input u*(t) that minimizes the cost J."
