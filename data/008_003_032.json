    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix. Let's perform the row operations:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form. In this case, there is only one non-zero row, so the rank of matrix A is 1."
