    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 2 within the range [-10, 10] using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of grey wolves (search agents) randomly within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each search agent using the objective function f(x).\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the three best search agents) based on their fitness values.\n4. Update the positions of the remaining search agents according to the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the stopping criterion is met (in this case, a precision of 0.001).\n\nSince the GWO algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, it is not possible to provide an exact solution here. However, you can implement the GWO algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB and run it to find the minimum value of the given function within the specified range and precision.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the GWO algorithm that you can use as a starting point: https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy/blob/master/algorithms/GWO.py\n\nRemember to define your objective function and set the appropriate parameters for the search space and precision."
