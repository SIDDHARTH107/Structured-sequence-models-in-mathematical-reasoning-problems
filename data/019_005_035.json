    "message_1": "Suppose there are three mathematicians - Alice, Bob, and Charlie - who are each given a different piece of information about a mathematical problem. Alice knows that the problem is solvable, Bob knows that it is unsolvable, and Charlie knows that he does not know if it is solvable or unsolvable. Using epistemic logic, what conclusions can be drawn about the solvability of the problem?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the following notation:\n\nA: The problem is solvable.\nB: The problem is unsolvable.\nKx(P): Person x knows proposition P.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. KA(A): Alice knows that the problem is solvable.\n2. KB(B): Bob knows that the problem is unsolvable.\n3. KC(~KA(A) ∧ ~KA(B)): Charlie knows that he does not know if it is solvable or unsolvable.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the problem is solvable (A), then Alice's knowledge is correct, and Bob's knowledge is incorrect. However, if the problem is unsolvable (B), then Bob's knowledge is correct, and Alice's knowledge is incorrect. \n\nSince Charlie knows that he does not know if it is solvable or unsolvable, he must be aware of the fact that either Alice or Bob has incorrect knowledge. This means that Charlie knows that at least one of them is wrong:\n\n4. KC(~KA(A) ∨ ~KB(B))\n\nNow, let's examine the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The problem is solvable (A)\n- Alice's knowledge is correct: KA(A)\n- Bob's knowledge is incorrect: ~KB(B)\n- Charlie's knowledge is correct: KC(~KA(A) ∨ ~KB(B))\n\nCase 2: The problem is unsolvable (B)\n- Alice's knowledge is incorrect: ~KA(A)\n- Bob's knowledge is correct: KB(B)\n- Charlie's knowledge is correct: KC(~KA(A) ∨ ~KB(B))\n\nIn both cases, Charlie's knowledge is correct. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the solvability of the problem based on the given information. The problem could be either solvable or unsolvable, and Charlie's knowledge remains consistent in both cases."
