    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 7 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 cm * 4 cm * 7 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 168 cubic cm\n\nVolume = 56 cubic cm\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 56 cubic centimeters."
