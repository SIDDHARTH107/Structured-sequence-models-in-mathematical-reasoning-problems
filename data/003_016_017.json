    "message_1": "A water wave can be modeled using the trigonometric function y = 2 sin(3x - 2), where x is the distance in meters and y is the height in meters. What is the phase shift of the wave?",
    "message_2": "The given wave function is y = 2 sin(3x - 2). In general, a sine wave function can be written as y = A sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn this case, we have A = 2, B = 3, and C = 2. To find the phase shift, we need to divide C by B:\n\nPhase shift = C / B = 2 / 3\n\nThe phase shift of the wave is 2/3 meters."
