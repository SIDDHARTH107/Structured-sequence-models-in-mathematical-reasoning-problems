    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a randomly selected group of 500 people from a certain demographic, at least 10 individuals will be affected by a rare disease if the overall prevalence rate of the disease in that demographic is 2%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nwhere X is the number of individuals affected by the disease, k is the threshold (in this case, 10), and P(X < k) is the cumulative probability of having fewer than k individuals affected by the disease.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the prevalence rate of the disease (0.02), and n is the total number of people in the group (500).\n\nWe want to find P(X ≥ 10), so we need to calculate P(X < 10) first:\n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial probability formula and then sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.1603\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 10 individuals affected by the disease:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.1603 ≈ 0.8397\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 individuals in a randomly selected group of 500 people from this demographic will be affected by the rare disease is approximately 83.97%."
