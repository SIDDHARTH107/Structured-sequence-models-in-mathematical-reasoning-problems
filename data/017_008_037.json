Cyclic group of order 8: C_8\nThis group has one element of order 8, and its group structure is given by {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, where a^8 = 1.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 4: C_2 × C_4\nThis group has one element of order 4 and three elements of order 2. Its group structure is given by {(1,1), (a,1), (a^2,1), (a^3,1), (1,b), (a,b), (a^2,b), (a^3,b)}, where a^4 = 1 and b^2 = 1.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: C_2 × C_2 × C_2\nThis group has seven elements of order 2. Its group structure is given by {(1,1,1), (a,1,1), (1,b,1), (1,1,c), (a,b,1), (a,1,c), (1,b,c)}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1.\n\n4. Quaternion group: Q_8\nThis group has one element of order 8, two elements of order 4, and four elements of order 2. Its group structure is given by {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\n5. Dihedral group of order 8: D_4\nThis group has one element of order 4, four elements of order 2, and two elements of order 1. Its group structure is given by {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r^4 = 1, s^2 = 1, and sr = r^(-1)s.\n\nThese five groups represent the distinct isomorphic classes of groups of order 8."
