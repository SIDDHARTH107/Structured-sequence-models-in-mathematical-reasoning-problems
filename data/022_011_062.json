    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the zero at $z=0$, we first need to simplify the function $f(z)$ and determine the order of the zero in the numerator and the order of the pole in the denominator.\n\nWe can factor the numerator and denominator as follows:\n\nNumerator: $z^2 + 2z + 1 = (z+1)^2$\n\nDenominator: $z^3 - 3z = z(z^2 - 3) = z(z-\\sqrt{3})(z+\\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z+1)^2}{z(z-\\sqrt{3})(z+\\sqrt{3})}$\n\nAt $z=0$, we can see that there is a zero of order 2 in the numerator (from the $(z+1)^2$ term) and a pole of order 1 in the denominator (from the $z$ term).\n\nSince the order of the zero in the numerator is greater than the order of the pole in the denominator, the zero at $z=0$ is a removable zero. The order of the removable zero is the difference between the orders of the zero and the pole, which is $2 - 1 = 1$. Therefore, the zero at $z=0$ is a removable zero of order 1."
