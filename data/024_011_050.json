    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of u on M, we first need to compute the covariant derivatives of u with respect to the coordinates x and y. Since the metric is Euclidean (ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2), the Christoffel symbols vanish, and the covariant derivatives are equal to the partial derivatives. Therefore, we have:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x\n∂u/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to compute the second covariant derivatives of u:\n\n∂²u/∂x² = 2\n∂²u/∂y² = 2\n\nFinally, the Laplacian of u on M is given by the sum of the second covariant derivatives:\n\nΔu = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 2 + 2 = 4"
