    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Therefore, we have the following Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 (2^3)\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3 (3^1)\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5 (5^1)\n\nNow, we will determine the number of Sylow subgroups for each prime:\n\n1. For the Sylow 2-subgroups, the number of subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are 1 and 15. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal. If there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, none of them are normal.\n2. For the Sylow 3-subgroups, the number of subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is 1, so there is one Sylow 3-subgroup, and it is normal.\n3. For the Sylow 5-subgroups, the number of subgroups must divide 120 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is 1, so there is one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it is normal.\n\nSince the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are both normal, their product is a normal subgroup of order 15. The remaining factor is a group of order 8. There are five groups of order 8 up to isomorphism: Z_8, Z_4 × Z_2, Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2, D_4, and Q_8.\n\nNow, we can form the following semi-direct products:\n\n1. Z_15 × Z_8 (direct product)\n2. Z_15 × (Z_4 × Z_2) (direct product)\n3. Z_15 × (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2) (direct product)\n4. Z_15 × D_4 (two non-isomorphic semi-direct products)\n5. Z_15 × Q_8 (no non-trivial semi-direct products)\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120:\n\n1. Z_15 × Z_8\n2. Z_15 × (Z_4 × Z_2)\n3. Z_15 × (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2)\n4. Two non-isomorphic semi-direct products of Z_15 and D_4"
