    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 19988 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can use the property of congruence:\n\nIf a ≡ b (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + c (mod m) and a * c ≡ b * c (mod m).\n\nFirst, we can break down 19988 into smaller parts that are easier to work with:\n\n19988 = 10000 + 9988\n\nNow, let's find the congruence of each part modulo 7:\n\n10000 ≡ 1 (mod 7) because 10000 = 7 * 1428 + 1\n\n9988 ≡ 0 (mod 7) because 9988 = 7 * 1426\n\nNow, we can add the congruences:\n\n(10000 + 9988) ≡ (1 + 0) (mod 7)\n\n19988 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 19988 is divided by 7 is 1."
