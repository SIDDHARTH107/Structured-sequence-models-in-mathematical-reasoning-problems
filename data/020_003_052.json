    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The profit for each unit of Product A is $10 and for each unit of Product B is $8. The production process requires the company to use two machines, Machine X and Machine Y. The company has a maximum of 180 hours of Machine X and 240 hours of Machine Y available per week. The production time per unit of Product A on Machine X is 3 hours and on Machine Y is 2 hours. The production time per unit of Product B on Machine X is 2 hours and on Machine Y is 4 hours. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can achieve per week by producing the two products if they optimize the use of the machines?",
