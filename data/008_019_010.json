    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the substitution method.\n\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for y:\n\n4x - y = 1 - 4i\ny = 4x - 1 + 4i\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the first equation:\n\n2x + 3yi = 4 + 2i\n2x + 3(4x - 1 + 4i)i = 4 + 2i\n\nNow, distribute the 3i:\n\n2x + 12xi - 3i + 12i^2 = 4 + 2i\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n2x + 12xi - 3i - 12 = 4 + 2i\n\nCombine the real and imaginary parts:\n\n(2x - 12) + (12x - 3)i = 4 + 2i\n\nNow, equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n2x - 12 = 4\n12x - 3 = 2\n\nSolve the first equation for x:\n\n2x = 16\nx = 8\n\nNow, substitute the value of x in the second equation:\n\n12(8) - 3 = 2\n96 - 3 = 2\ny = 2/(-93)\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 8\ny = 2/(-93)"
