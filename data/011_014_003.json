    "message_1": "A group of 6 friends decides to attend a concert together. They want to choose their seats in such a way that no two of them sit together in adjacent seats in a row. How many ways can they choose their seats from a row of 10 seats?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the complementary counting method to solve this problem. First, we'll find the total number of ways to seat the 6 friends without any restrictions, and then subtract the number of ways in which at least two friends sit together.\n\n1. Total number of ways to seat the 6 friends without any restrictions:\n\nThere are 10 seats and 6 friends, so there are 10P6 ways to arrange them, which is equal to 10!/(10-6)! = 10!/(4!) = 151200 ways.\n\n2. Number of ways in which at least two friends sit together:\n\nLet's consider the case where exactly one pair of friends sit together. We can treat this pair as a single entity, so we have 5 entities (4 single friends and 1 pair) to arrange in 9 seats. There are 9P5 ways to arrange these entities, which is equal to 9!/(9-5)! = 9!/(4!) = 15120 ways. However, there are 2! ways to arrange the friends within the pair, so we need to multiply 15120 by 2! to account for these arrangements. This gives us 15120 * 2! = 30240 ways.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where more than one pair of friends sit together, as they are counted multiple times in the previous calculation. Let's consider the case where exactly two pairs of friends sit together. We have 4 entities (2 single friends and 2 pairs) to arrange in 8 seats. There are 8P4 ways to arrange these entities, which is equal to 8!/(8-4)! = 8!/(4!) = 1680 ways. However, there are (2!)^2 ways to arrange the friends within each pair, so we need to multiply 1680 by (2!)^2 to account for these arrangements. This gives us 1680 * (2!)^2 = 6720 ways.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where all three pairs of friends sit together. We have 3 entities (3 pairs) to arrange in 7 seats. There are 7P3 ways to arrange these entities, which is equal to 7!/(7-3)! = 7!/(4!) = 210 ways. However, there are (2!)^3 ways to arrange the friends within each pair, so we need to multiply 210 by (2!)^3 to account for these arrangements. This gives us 210 * (2!)^3 = 1680 ways.\n\n3. Subtract the number of ways in which at least two friends sit together from the total number of ways:\n\n151200 - 30240 + 6720 - 1680 = 120000 ways.\n\nSo, there are 120000 ways for the 6 friends to choose their seats in a row of 10 seats such that no two of them sit together in adjacent seats."
