    "message_2": "First, let's compute the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection of (A x B) with C, (A x B) ∩ C:\n\nSince C = {4, 5, 6}, we are looking for ordered pairs in A x B where the second element is in C. However, there are no such ordered pairs in A x B. Therefore, (A x B) ∩ C = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's compute the intersection of B and C, B ∩ C:\n\nB ∩ C = {2, 3, 4} ∩ {4, 5, 6} = {4}\n\nNow, let's compute the Cartesian product A x (B ∩ C):\n\nA x (B ∩ C) = A x {4} = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}\n\nNow, we can see that (A x B) ∩ C = ∅ and A x (B ∩ C) = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}. Since these two results are not equal, this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
