    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of a 35-degree angle in a right triangle, we can use a right triangle with one angle being 35 degrees and the other angle being 90 degrees (since it's a right triangle). Let's call the angle opposite the side of length \"a\" as A (35 degrees), the angle opposite the side of length \"b\" as B, and the angle opposite the side of length \"c\" (the hypotenuse) as C (90 degrees).\n\nUsing the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios, we have:\n\nsin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse = a/c\ncos(A) = adjacent/hypotenuse = b/c\ntan(A) = opposite/adjacent = a/b\n\nSince we don't have the actual side lengths, we can use a calculator or a trigonometric table to find the values of the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for a 35-degree angle.\n\nsin(35°) ≈ 0.5736\ncos(35°) ≈ 0.8192\ntan(35°) ≈ 0.7002\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of a 35-degree angle in a right triangle are approximately 0.5736, 0.8192, and 0.7002, respectively."
