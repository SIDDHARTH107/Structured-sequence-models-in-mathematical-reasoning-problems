    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(4x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(cos(4x))/dx\n\nThe outer function is cos(u) and the inner function is u = 4x. The derivative of cos(u) with respect to u is -sin(u), and the derivative of 4x with respect to x is 4.\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (-sin(u)) * (du/dx)\n\nSubstitute u = 4x:\n\ndy/dx = (-sin(4x)) * (4)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = (-sin(4(π/4))) * (4)\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = (-sin(π)) * (4)\n\nSince sin(π) = 0:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = (-0) * (4) = 0\n\nSo, the derivative of y = cos(4x) at x = π/4 is 0."
