Let H be a subgroup of G. If H is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element, then H is cyclic since it can be generated by the identity element. Now, let's assume H is a non-trivial subgroup.\n\nLet m be the smallest positive integer such that $a^m \\in H$. We claim that H = $\\langle a^m \\rangle$. To prove this, we will show that every element in H can be expressed as a power of $a^m$.\n\nLet $h \\in H$. Since G is a cyclic group generated by a, we can write $h = a^k$ for some integer k. By the division algorithm, we can write $k = mq + r$, where $0 \\leq r < m$. Then, we have:\n\n$h = a^k = a^{mq + r} = (a^m)^q \\cdot a^r$\n\nSince $a^m \\in H$ and H is a subgroup, we have $(a^m)^q \\in H$. Thus, the inverse element $((a^m)^q)^{-1} \\in H$. Multiplying both sides by $((a^m)^q)^{-1}$, we get:\n\n$h \\cdot ((a^m)^q)^{-1} = a^r$\n\nSince H is a subgroup, the product of two elements in H is also in H. Therefore, $a^r \\in H$. But we chose m to be the smallest positive integer such that $a^m \\in H$, and $0 \\leq r < m$. The only possibility is that $r = 0$. So, $h = a^{mq} = (a^m)^q$. This shows that every element in H can be expressed as a power of $a^m$, and hence H = $\\langle a^m \\rangle$.\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group $\\langle10\\rangle$. This group is generated by the element 10, and its elements are {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90} under addition modulo 100. Let H be a subgroup of $\\langle10\\rangle$. From the above proof, we know that H must be cyclic. Therefore, every subgroup of the cyclic group $\\langle10\\rangle$ is cyclic."
