    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of f(z) in the closed disc |z| ≤ 2, we can use the argument principle. The argument principle states that if f(z) is a meromorphic function (a function that is holomorphic except for isolated singularities) inside and on some simple closed contour C, and f has no zeros or poles on C, then\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = 2π(N - P),\n\nwhere Δarg(f(z)) is the total change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C, N is the number of zeros of f(z) inside C, and P is the number of poles of f(z) inside C.\n\nIn our case, f(z) = 3z^4 - 5z^3 + 2z - 1 is an entire function, so it has no poles. We want to find the number of zeros of f(z) in the closed disc |z| ≤ 2, so we can take C to be the circle |z| = 2.\n\nLet's parameterize the circle C by z(t) = 2e^(it), where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then, the derivative of z(t) with respect to t is\n\ndz/dt = 2ie^(it).\n\nNow, we can compute f(z(t)) and its derivative with respect to t:\n\nf(z(t)) = 3(2e^(it))^4 - 5(2e^(it))^3 + 2(2e^(it)) - 1\n        = 48e^(4it) - 40e^(3it) + 4e^(it) - 1.\n\nNow, we compute the derivative of f(z(t)) with respect to t:\n\ndf/dt = d(f(z(t))/dt = 48(4ie^(4it)) - 40(3ie^(3it)) + 4(ie^(it))\n      = 192ie^(4it) - 120ie^(3it) + 4ie^(it).\n\nNow, we can compute the total change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C:\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = ∫(df/dt) / f(z(t)) dz/dt dt\n           = ∫(192ie^(4it) - 120ie^(3it) + 4ie^(it)) / (48e^(4it) - 40e^(3it) + 4e^(it) - 1) * 2ie^(it) dt\n           = ∫(2i(192ie^(4it) - 120ie^(3it) + 4ie^(it))) / (48e^(4it) - 40e^(3it) + 4e^(it) - 1) dt\n           = ∫(2i(192ie^(3it) - 120ie^(2it) + 4i)) / (48e^(3it) - 40e^(2it) + 4 - e^(-it)) dt\n           = 2πi(N - 0),\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the interval [0, 2π].\n\nSince f(z) is an entire function and has no poles, the argument principle simplifies to\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = 2πN.\n\nNow, we can compute the integral:\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = 2πi∫(2i(192ie^(3it) - 120ie^(2it) + 4i)) / (48e^(3it) - 40e^(2it) + 4 - e^(-it)) dt\n           = 4πi∫(192ie^(3it) - 120ie^(2it) + 4i) / (48e^(3it) - 40e^(2it) + 4 - e^(-it)) dt.\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use the residue theorem. However, since f(z) is an entire function, it has no poles, so the integral is equal to 0:\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = 0.\n\nThus, we have\n\n0 = 2πN,\n\nwhich implies that N = 0.\n\nTherefore, there are no zeros of f(z) in the closed disc |z| ≤ 2."
