    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 20 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 ∈ {1, 10}.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 12 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 ∈ {1, 6}.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since these subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The order of P_2 is 4, the order of P_3 is 3, and the order of P_5 is 5. Since the orders of P_2, P_3, and P_5 are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60. Thus, G is isomorphic to C60.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product P_3 ⋊ P_2. The automorphism group of P_3 is isomorphic to C2, so there are two possible semidirect products: the direct product P_3 × P_2, which is abelian, and a non-abelian group of order 12. Since the direct product is already accounted for in Case 1, we consider the non-abelian group of order 12, which is isomorphic to A4.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup A4 in G, and the quotient group G/A4 has order 5. By the correspondence theorem, there is a subgroup H of G such that H/A4 is isomorphic to C5. Since A4 is normal in G, the intersection of A4 and H is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product A4 ⋊ C5. The automorphism group of A4 is isomorphic to S4, which has a subgroup isomorphic to A5. Therefore, there are two possible semidirect products: the direct product A4 × C5, which is isomorphic to A5 × C2, and 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 60: the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, and 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. Every group of order 60 is isomorphic to one of these groups."
