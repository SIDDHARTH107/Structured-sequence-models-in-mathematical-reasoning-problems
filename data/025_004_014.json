Find the degree of the map $\\phi_{2P}: C \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$ that sends $P$ and $Q$ on $C$ to the same point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$, where $P$ and $Q$ are two distinct points on $C$.",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the map $\\phi_{2P}: C \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$, we first need to find an expression for the map. We will use the fact that the curve $C$ is a rational curve, and we can use the addition law for points on an elliptic curve to find the map.\n\nLet $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ be two distinct points on the curve $C$. According to the addition law for points on an elliptic curve, the sum of these two points, $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$, satisfies the following relations:\n\n1. If $x_1 \\neq x_2$, then the slope $m$ of the line connecting $P$ and $Q$ is given by $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n2. If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $P + Q = \\mathcal{O}$, the point at infinity.\n3. If $P = Q$, then the slope $m$ of the tangent line at $P$ is given by $m = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $P \\neq Q$ and $x_1 \\neq x_2$. Then, the coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$ are given by:\n\n$$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$$\n$$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$$\n\nSince we want to find the map $\\phi_{2P}$ that sends $P$ and $Q$ to the same point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$, we need to find the point $2P = P + P$ on the curve $C$. Using the formula for the slope of the tangent line at $P$, we have:\n\n$$m = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}$$\n\nThe coordinates of the point $2P$ are then given by:\n\n$$x_{2P} = m^2 - 2x_1$$\n$$y_{2P} = m(x_1 - x_{2P}) - y_1$$\n\nNow, we can find the map $\\phi_{2P}: C \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$ by considering the projection from the point $2P$ onto the $x$-axis. This map is given by:\n\n$$\\phi_{2P}(x, y) = \\frac{x - x_{2P}}{y - y_{2P}}$$\n\nTo find the degree of this map, we need to count the number of preimages of a generic point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Since the curve $C$ is a rational curve, it has genus 0, and the degree of the map $\\phi_{2P}$ is equal to the number of distinct points in the preimage of a generic point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nLet $t$ be a generic point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Then, the preimage of $t$ under the map $\\phi_{2P}$ is given by the points $(x, y)$ on the curve $C$ that satisfy:\n\n$$\\frac{x - x_{2P}}{y - y_{2P}} = t$$\n\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n\n$$y - y_{2P} = t(x - x_{2P})$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $x_{2P}$ and $y_{2P}$, we have:\n\n$$y - \\left(m(x_1 - x_{2P}) - y_1\\right) = t\\left(x - (m^2 - 2x_1)\\right)$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $y$, which means that there are at most 2 distinct points in the preimage of a generic point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Therefore, the degree of the map $\\phi_{2P}: C \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$ is 2."
