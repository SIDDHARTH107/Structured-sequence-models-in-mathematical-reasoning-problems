    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nTo find the value of Euler's totient function for 21, we first find the prime factors of 21. The prime factors of 21 are 3 and 7. Now, we can use the formula for the totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor 21, we have:\n\nφ(21) = 21 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/7)\nφ(21) = 21 * (2/3) * (6/7)\nφ(21) = 21 * (12/21)\nφ(21) = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for 21 is 12."
