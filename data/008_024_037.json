    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the first and the third equations are the same, so we can eliminate one of them. We are left with:\n\n1) 2x + 3y - z = 5\n2) 4x + 6y - 2z = 10\n\nNow, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:\n\n1) 4x + 6y - 2z = 10\n\nComparing this new equation with the second equation, we can see that they are the same:\n\n2) 4x + 6y - 2z = 10\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same plane in 3D space, and their intersection is a line, which means there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the solutions, we can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's express z in terms of x and y using the first equation:\n\nz = 2x + 3y - 5\n\nNow, any point (x, y, z) that satisfies this equation is a solution to the system of linear equations. Since there are infinitely many such points, the system has infinitely many solutions."
