    "message_1": "A bird watcher is standing at point A and she spots a rare bird at point B. Point A is 60 meters away from point C, which is directly under point B. The angle of elevation at point A is 40 degrees and the angle of elevation at point B is 65 degrees. What is the distance between the bird watcher at point A and the rare bird at point B?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the bird watcher at point A and the rare bird at point B as AB, and the height of the bird above point C as h. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles, distances, and height.\n\nFrom point A, we have:\ntan(40°) = h / 60\n\nFrom point B, we have:\ntan(65°) = h / (AB - 60)\n\nFirst, we can solve for h from the first equation:\nh = 60 * tan(40°)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for h into the second equation:\ntan(65°) = (60 * tan(40°)) / (AB - 60)\n\nNow, we can solve for AB:\nAB - 60 = (60 * tan(40°)) / tan(65°)\nAB = 60 + (60 * tan(40°)) / tan(65°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the tangent of the angles:\nAB = 60 + (60 * 0.8391) / 2.1445\nAB ≈ 60 + 23.574\nAB ≈ 83.574\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird watcher at point A and the rare bird at point B is approximately 83.574 meters."
