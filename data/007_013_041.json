    "message_2": "The Goldbach Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For the number 28, we can express it as a sum of two prime numbers in the following ways:\n\n1. 28 = 5 + 23\n2. 28 = 11 + 17\n\nBoth of these expressions satisfy the Goldbach Conjecture for the number 28."
