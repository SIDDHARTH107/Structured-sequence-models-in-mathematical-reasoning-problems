    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The function f(x) is defined as:\n\nf(x) = {0, -π < x < 0\n       {1,  0 < x < π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = 0 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for 0 < x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 dx + ∫[0, π] 1 dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is x evaluated from 0 to π:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 + (π - 0)] = 1\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 * cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] 1 * cos(nx) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (1/n) * sin(nx) evaluated from 0 to π:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 + (1/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))] = 0\n\nThe sine function is 0 at all integer multiples of π, so a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSplitting the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] 1 * sin(nx) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (-1/n) * cos(nx) evaluated from 0 to π:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [0 + (-1/n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(0))] = (-1/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) ≈ (1/2) + Σ[(-1/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nx)]\n\nTo determine whether the series converges to the function at x = 0, we can take the limit as x approaches 0:\n\nlim (x -> 0) [(1/2) + Σ[(-1/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nx)]]\n\nSince sin(nx) approaches 0 as x approaches 0, each term in the series goes to 0. Therefore, the limit is:\n\nlim (x -> 0) [(1/2) + 0] = 1/2\n\nThe Fourier series converges to 1/2 at x = 0, which is the average value of the function at the discontinuity."
