    "message_2": "To find the expected number of households that will experience a robbery in one day, we can multiply the total number of households by the probability of a robbery occurring.\n\nExpected number of households = Total households × Probability of robbery\nExpected number of households = 500 × 0.05\nExpected number of households = 25\n\nSo, the expected number of households that will experience a robbery in one day is 25."
