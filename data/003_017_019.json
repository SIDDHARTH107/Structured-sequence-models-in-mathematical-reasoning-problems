    "message_2": "To find the average temperature of the city during the day, we need to integrate the temperature function T(t) over the course of a day (24 hours) and then divide by the total time (24 hours).\n\nThe average temperature, A, can be found using the following formula:\n\nA = (1/24) * ∫[T(t) dt] from 0 to 24\n\nA = (1/24) * ∫[20 + 5cos((π/12)t) dt] from 0 to 24\n\nFirst, we integrate the function with respect to t:\n\n∫[20 + 5cos((π/12)t) dt] = 20t + (5(12/π)sin((π/12)t)) + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from 0 to 24:\n\n(20(24) + (5(12/π)sin((π/12)(24)))) - (20(0) + (5(12/π)sin((π/12)(0))))\n\n= (480 + (60/π)sin(2π)) - (0 + (60/π)sin(0))\n\nSince sin(2π) = 0 and sin(0) = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n\n= 480\n\nNow, we divide by the total time (24 hours) to find the average temperature:\n\nA = (1/24) * 480\n\nA = 20°C\n\nSo, the average temperature of the city during the day is 20°C."
