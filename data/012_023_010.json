    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. To find the largest clique, we can look for the largest set of vertices where each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that there is a clique of size 3, which includes vertices 2, 3, and 4. The subgraph formed by these vertices has the following adjacency matrix:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1\\\\ \n1 & 0 & 1\\\\ \n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThere is no larger clique in the graph. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
