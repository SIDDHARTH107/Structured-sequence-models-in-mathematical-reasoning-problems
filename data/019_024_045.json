    "message_1": "Abductive logic is not typically associated with numerical problems or calculations. It is a form of logical reasoning that involves making educated guesses to form a hypothesis or explanation for a given observation or phenomenon. \n\nHowever, here is an example question that incorporates both mathematics and logic:\n\nSuppose a university has a total of 10,000 students, 50% of whom are women. If we randomly select 5 students from the university, what is the probability that all 5 will be women? Use abductive reasoning to explain your answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of probability. Since 50% of the students are women, the probability of selecting a woman in each draw is 0.5. Since the draws are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each draw to find the probability of all 5 students being women.\n\nProbability of all 5 students being women = (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.5^5 = 0.03125\n\nUsing abductive reasoning, we can hypothesize that the probability of selecting 5 women out of 5 students is relatively low, at 3.125%. This is because there is a significant chance of selecting at least one man in the group, given that half of the student population is male."
