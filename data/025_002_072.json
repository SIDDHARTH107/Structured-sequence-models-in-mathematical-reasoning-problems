    "message_1": "Let X and Y be two irreducible plane algebraic curves of degree 5 and 4 respectively, both defined over the complex numbers. Suppose that X intersects Y at 9 distinct points. What is the degree of the algebraic curve that is the intersection of X and Y?",
    "message_2": "The degree of the algebraic curve that is the intersection of X and Y can be found using Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves X and Y, counted with multiplicities, is equal to the product of their degrees, provided that the curves are in general position (i.e., they do not share a common component).\n\nIn this case, X has degree 5 and Y has degree 4. Since X and Y are irreducible and intersect at 9 distinct points, we can assume they are in general position. Therefore, the number of intersection points, counted with multiplicities, is equal to the product of their degrees:\n\n5 * 4 = 20\n\nSince there are 9 distinct intersection points, this means that the intersection points must have a total multiplicity of 20 - 9 = 11. However, since the intersection points are distinct, their multiplicities must be at least 1. Therefore, the degree of the algebraic curve that is the intersection of X and Y cannot be determined uniquely from the given information."
