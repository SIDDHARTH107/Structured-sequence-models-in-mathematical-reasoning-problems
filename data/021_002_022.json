    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Start with an initial vector x_0.\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current vector x_k to get the next vector x_(k+1) = A * x_k.\n3. Normalize x_(k+1) by dividing it by its norm (magnitude).\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, i.e., until the difference between consecutive vectors is less than a specified tolerance.\n\nLet's apply the power iteration method to the given matrix A and initial vector x_0:\n\nMatrix A = [[3, 1], [1, 3]]\nInitial vector x_0 = [1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = A * x_0 = [[3, 1], [1, 3]] * [1, 1] = [4, 4]\nNormalize x_1: x_1 = [1, 1]\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = A * x_1 = [[3, 1], [1, 3]] * [1, 1] = [4, 4]\nNormalize x_2: x_2 = [1, 1]\n\nSince x_1 and x_2 are the same, the power iteration method has converged. Now, we can find the dominant eigenvalue by using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue λ = (x_2^T * A * x_2) / (x_2^T * x_2)\n\nλ = ([1, 1] * [[3, 1], [1, 3]] * [1, 1]) / ([1, 1] * [1, 1])\nλ = (4 + 4) / (1 + 1)\nλ = 8 / 2\nλ = 4\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is 4, and the corresponding eigenvector is [1, 1]."
