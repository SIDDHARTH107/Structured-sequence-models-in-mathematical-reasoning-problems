    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we first need to find the gradient of the function and set it equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3x^2 - 3y^2 \\\\ -6xy \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nSetting the gradient equal to the zero vector, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$$\n$$-6xy = 0$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases: either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. \n\nCase 1: $x = 0$\n\nSubstituting $x = 0$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$3(0)^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$$\n\nSo, the only critical point in this case is $(0,0)$.\n\nCase 2: $y = 0$\n\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3(0)^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$$\n\nThis case gives us the same critical point as before, $(0,0)$.\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0,0)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the index of this critical point. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of $f$:\n\n$$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 6x & -6y \\\\ -6y & -6x \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nEvaluating the Hessian matrix at the critical point $(0,0)$, we get:\n\n$$H(f)(0,0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. Since the Hessian matrix at $(0,0)$ is the zero matrix, it has no negative eigenvalues. Therefore, the index of the critical point $(0,0)$ is 0.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one critical point of the function $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, which is $(0,0)$, and its index is 0."
