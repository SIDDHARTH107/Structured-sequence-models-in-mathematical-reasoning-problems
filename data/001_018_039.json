    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. The expression is:\n\nlog₃[(3^4 * 3^(-2)) / (3^2)]\n\nFirst, we can use the properties of exponents to simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\n(3^4 * 3^(-2)) / (3^2) = (3^(4 - 2)) / (3^2) = 3^2 / 3^2\n\nNow, we can use the quotient rule of logarithms, which states that logₐ(x/y) = logₐ(x) - logₐ(y):\n\nlog₃(3^2 / 3^2) = log₃(3^2) - log₃(3^2)\n\nSince the base of the logarithm and the base of the exponent are the same (base 3), we can use the property logₐ(a^x) = x:\n\n2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog₃[(3^4 * 3^(-2)) / (3^2)] = 0"
