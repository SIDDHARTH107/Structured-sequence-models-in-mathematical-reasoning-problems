    "message_2": "In 2D space, the cross product of two vectors A and B can be represented as a scalar value, which is the determinant of the matrix formed by the two vectors. The cross product is also equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of the angle between them.\n\nLet's first find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\nMagnitude of A = |A| = √(4² + 3²) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\nMagnitude of B = |B| = √((-2)² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (4 * -2) + (3 * 5) = -8 + 15 = 7\n\nNext, we'll use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle between A and B:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|)\ncos(θ) = 7 / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, we'll find the sine of the angle between A and B using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1\nsin²(θ) = 1 - cos²(θ)\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (7 / (5 * √29))²)\n\nFinally, we'll find the cross product of A and B using the magnitudes and sine of the angle between them:\n\nA × B = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\nA × B = 5 * √29 * √(1 - (7 / (5 * √29))²)\n\nA × B ≈ 19.1311\n\nSo, the cross product of A and B is approximately 19.1311."
