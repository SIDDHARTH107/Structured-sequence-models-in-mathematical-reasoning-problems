Show that any infinite subset of the real line has a limit point, and therefore the real line is compact.",
    "message_2": "To prove that X is compact, we need to show that every open cover of X has a finite subcover. Let's proceed by contradiction. Suppose that X is not compact, which means that there exists an open cover of X that does not have a finite subcover. Let {U_i} be such an open cover.\n\nNow, let's construct a sequence {x_n} in X as follows:\n\n1. Choose any point x_1 in X. Since {U_i} is an open cover, there exists an open set U_1 containing x_1.\n2. Since U_1 is not a finite subcover, X - U_1 is nonempty. Choose a point x_2 in X - U_1. There exists an open set U_2 containing x_2.\n3. Continue this process, choosing x_n in X - (U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ... ∪ U_(n-1)) and an open set U_n containing x_n.\n\nThis construction results in an infinite sequence {x_n} in X. By our assumption, every infinite subset of X has a limit point, so there exists a limit point x of {x_n}. Since {U_i} is an open cover of X, there exists an open set U_k containing x.\n\nSince x is a limit point of {x_n}, there exists a subsequence {x_nk} of {x_n} that converges to x. However, since x_nk is in U_k for each k, and U_k is open, there exists a neighborhood V_k of x contained in U_k. For sufficiently large k, x_nk is in V_k, which is a contradiction because x_nk is not in U_k for k > 1.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that X is not compact must be false, and X is indeed compact.\n\nHowever, the real line with the Euclidean topology is not compact, even though every infinite subset has a limit point. The confusion in the original statement is that having a limit point in every infinite subset is a necessary condition for compactness, but it is not sufficient. For the real line, we can consider the open cover consisting of open intervals (-n, n) for all integers n. This open cover does not have a finite subcover, so the real line is not compact."
