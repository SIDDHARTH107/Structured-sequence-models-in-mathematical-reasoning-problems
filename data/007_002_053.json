    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 5327 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nLet's find the sum of the digits of 5327:\n\n5 + 3 + 2 + 7 = 17\n\nSince 17 is not divisible by 9, we need to find the remainder when 17 is divided by 9:\n\n17 รท 9 = 1 (remainder 8)\n\nSo, the remainder when 5327 is divided by 9 is 8."
