    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the given Diophantine equation by dividing it by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients (6, 9, and 21), which is 3. So, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for x and y. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3y = 7 - 2x\n\nWe can see that 7 - 2x must be a multiple of 3 for y to be an integer. Let's find a value of x that satisfies this condition:\n\nIf x = 1, then 7 - 2x = 7 - 2(1) = 5, which is not a multiple of 3.\n\nIf x = 2, then 7 - 2x = 7 - 2(2) = 3, which is a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, when x = 2, we have:\n\n3y = 7 - 2(2) = 3\n\ny = 3/3 = 1\n\nThus, one solution is (x, y) = (2, 1).\n\nNow, let's find the general solution. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2x = 7 - 3y\n\nNotice that if we increase y by 2, the left side of the equation will increase by 6, which is a multiple of 2. So, we can write the general solution as:\n\nx = 2 + 3k\ny = 1 - 2k\n\nwhere k is an integer."
