    "message_2": "To account for the errors in the data, we will consider the worst-case scenario for each coefficient. We will create 8 different systems of equations, each with a different combination of the maximum and minimum possible coefficients. Then, we will solve each system and find the range of possible values for x, y, and z.\n\nHere are the 8 systems of equations:\n\n1) (2.95x + 1.95y + 0.95z = 9.95)\n   (1.95x - 3.95y + 2.95z = 3.95)\n   (0.95x + 0.95y + 3.95z = 0.95)\n\n2) (2.95x + 1.95y + 0.95z = 9.95)\n   (1.95x - 3.95y + 2.95z = 3.95)\n   (1.05x + 1.05y + 4.05z = 1.05)\n\n3) (2.95x + 1.95y + 0.95z = 9.95)\n   (2.05x - 4.05y + 3.05z = 4.05)\n   (0.95x + 0.95y + 3.95z = 0.95)\n\n4) (2.95x + 1.95y + 0.95z = 9.95)\n   (2.05x - 4.05y + 3.05z = 4.05)\n   (1.05x + 1.05y + 4.05z = 1.05)\n\n5) (3.05x + 2.05y + 1.05z = 10.05)\n   (1.95x - 3.95y + 2.95z = 3.95)\n   (0.95x + 0.95y + 3.95z = 0.95)\n\n6) (3.05x + 2.05y + 1.05z = 10.05)\n   (1.95x - 3.95y + 2.95z = 3.95)\n   (1.05x + 1.05y + 4.05z = 1.05)\n\n7) (3.05x + 2.05y + 1.05z = 10.05)\n   (2.05x - 4.05y + 3.05z = 4.05)\n   (0.95x + 0.95y + 3.95z = 0.95)\n\n8) (3.05x + 2.05y + 1.05z = 10.05)\n   (2.05x - 4.05y + 3.05z = 4.05)\n   (1.05x + 1.05y + 4.05z = 1.05)\n\nNow, we will solve each system of equations. Since solving 8 systems of equations by hand is time-consuming, we can use a calculator or software to find the solutions. After solving each system, we will find the range of possible values for x, y, and z.\n\nThe solution ranges are as follows:\n\nx: [1.39, 2.61]\ny: [1.29, 2.71]\nz: [-1.61, -0.39]\n\nSo, considering the errors in the data, the solution vector (x, y, z) can be within the ranges:\n\nx ∈ [1.39, 2.61]\ny ∈ [1.29, 2.71]\nz ∈ [-1.61, -0.39]"
