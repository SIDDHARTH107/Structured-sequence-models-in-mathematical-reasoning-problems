    "message_2": "This equation is a Pell equation, which is a Diophantine equation of the form x^2 - Dy^2 = 1, where D is a non-square positive integer. In this case, D = 5.\n\nTo find the integer solutions, we can use the method of continued fractions. The continued fraction expansion of the square root of 5 is [2; 4, 4, 4, ...], which has a repeating block of length 1. The convergents of this continued fraction are given by the following fractions:\n\n1/1, 3/1, 7/2, 17/5, 41/12, ...\n\nThe solutions to the Pell equation are given by the numerators and denominators of these convergents. However, since the repeating block has length 1, we only need to consider every second convergent. Therefore, the integer solutions are:\n\nx = 1, y = 0 (trivial solution)\nx = 9, y = 4\nx = 161, y = 72\nx = 2889, y = 1292\n...\n\nThese solutions can be generated recursively using the following formulas:\n\nx_{n+1} = 9x_n + 20y_n\ny_{n+1} = 4x_n + 9y_n\n\nStarting with the trivial solution (x_0, y_0) = (1, 0), we can generate all the integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 5y^2 = 1."
