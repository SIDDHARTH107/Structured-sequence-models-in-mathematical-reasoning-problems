    "message_1": "Consider the theory of groups and the language of groups which has only one binary function symbol * and one constant symbol e. Let G be an infinite group such that x * y = y * x for all x,y in G. Suppose that the group term t (x) involving only the variable symbol x represents an element of G other than the identity e. Prove that there exist distinct elements a,b in G such that t (a) = t (b).",
    "message_2": "Since G is an infinite group, there are infinitely many elements in G. Let's consider the set T = {t(x) | x ∈ G}. Since t(x) is a group term involving only the variable symbol x, T is a subset of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the function f: G → T defined by f(x) = t(x) for all x ∈ G. We will show that f is not injective, meaning there exist distinct elements a, b ∈ G such that f(a) = f(b), or equivalently, t(a) = t(b).\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that f is injective. Then, for every distinct pair of elements a, b ∈ G, we have t(a) ≠ t(b). This implies that the function f is a bijection between G and T. Since G is infinite, this would mean that T is also infinite.\n\nHowever, we know that t(x) represents an element of G other than the identity e. This means that the identity element e is not in the set T. Since T is a subset of G, and G is a group, we know that for every element t(x) ∈ T, there exists an inverse element t(x)^(-1) ∈ G such that t(x) * t(x)^(-1) = e. \n\nNow, consider the set T_inv = {t(x)^(-1) | x ∈ G}. Since f is a bijection between G and T, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of T and T_inv. However, since T is infinite, T_inv must also be infinite.\n\nSince T and T_inv are both infinite subsets of G, their union T ∪ T_inv is also infinite. But this leads to a contradiction, because G is a group and the union of two infinite subsets of G cannot be equal to G, as G contains the identity element e, which is not in T or T_inv.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that f is injective must be false. There exist distinct elements a, b ∈ G such that t(a) = t(b)."
