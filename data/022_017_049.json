    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = Â±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution to the differential equation will be in the form:\n\ny(x) = C1 * e^(2ix) + C2 * e^(-2ix)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants."
