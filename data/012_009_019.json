    "message_2": "To find the total number of edges in the graph, we can sum the degrees of all the vertices and then divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice, once for each vertex it connects).\n\nDegree sequence: {5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2}\n\nSum of degrees: 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 19\n\nTotal number of edges: 19 / 2 = 9.5\n\nHowever, the number of edges should be an integer. This indicates that the given degree sequence is not valid for a simple, undirected graph. Please check the degree sequence and try again."
