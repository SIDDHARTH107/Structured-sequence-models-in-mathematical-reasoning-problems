    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the given area around the y-axis, we will use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of infinitesimally thin disks that make up the solid.\n\nFirst, we need to express x in terms of y. From the given equation, y = 2x^2, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = y/2\nx = sqrt(y/2)\n\nNow, we will set up the integral using the disk method. The area of each disk is given by A(y) = πr^2, where r is the distance from the y-axis to the curve. In this case, r = x = sqrt(y/2). So, the area of each disk is:\n\nA(y) = π(sqrt(y/2))^2 = π(y/2)\n\nNow, we will integrate A(y) with respect to y from the lower bound (y = 0) to the upper bound (y = 2(1)^2 = 2):\n\nV = ∫[0, 2] π(y/2) dy\n\nTo solve the integral, we can factor out the constant π/2:\n\nV = (π/2) ∫[0, 2] y dy\n\nNow, we integrate y with respect to y:\n\nV = (π/2) * [y^2/2] evaluated from 0 to 2\n\nV = (π/2) * [(2^2)/2 - (0^2)/2]\n\nV = (π/2) * [4/2]\n\nV = (π/2) * 2\n\nV = π\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated by revolving the area bounded by the curve y = 2x^2, the x-axis, and the lines x = 0 and x = 1 around the y-axis is π cubic units."
