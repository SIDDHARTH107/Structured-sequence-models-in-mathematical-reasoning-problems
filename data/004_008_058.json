    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x^2 at the point x = 3, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x^2 is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(x) at x = 3:\n\nf'(3) = 2(3) = 6\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x^2 at the point x = 3 is 6."
