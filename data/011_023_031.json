    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, we can use the concept of chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nSince each vertex in G has a degree of at least 3, this means that each vertex is connected to at least 3 other vertices. According to Brooks' theorem, for a connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most Δ(G), where Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in G.\n\nIn this case, the maximum degree of the vertices in G is at least 3. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is at most 3. However, we need to check if G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nA complete graph with 10 vertices would have each vertex connected to every other vertex, resulting in a degree of 9 for each vertex. Since the degree of each vertex in G is at least 3, G cannot be a complete graph.\n\nAn odd cycle with 10 vertices is not possible, as an odd cycle must have an odd number of vertices.\n\nSince G is neither a complete graph nor an odd cycle, the chromatic number of G is at most 3. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 3."
