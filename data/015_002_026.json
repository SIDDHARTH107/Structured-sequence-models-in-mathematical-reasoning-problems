We want to find x10.\n\nWe can calculate the terms in the sequence iteratively:\n\nx1 = 3.8 * 0.3 * (1 - 0.3) = 3.8 * 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.798\nx2 = 3.8 * 0.798 * (1 - 0.798) = 3.8 * 0.798 * 0.202 = 0.613512\nx3 = 3.8 * 0.613512 * (1 - 0.613512) = 3.8 * 0.613512 * 0.386488 = 0.901312\nx4 = 3.8 * 0.901312 * (1 - 0.901312) = 3.8 * 0.901312 * 0.098688 = 0.338073\nx5 = 3.8 * 0.338073 * (1 - 0.338073) = 3.8 * 0.338073 * 0.661927 = 0.849872\nx6 = 3.8 * 0.849872 * (1 - 0.849872) = 3.8 * 0.849872 * 0.150128 = 0.485201\nx7 = 3.8 * 0.485201 * (1 - 0.485201) = 3.8 * 0.485201 * 0.514799 = 0.949607\nx8 = 3.8 * 0.949607 * (1 - 0.949607) = 3.8 * 0.949607 * 0.050393 = 0.181832\nx9 = 3.8 * 0.181832 * (1 - 0.181832) = 3.8 * 0.181832 * 0.818168 = 0.563656\nx10 = 3.8 * 0.563656 * (1 - 0.563656) = 3.8 * 0.563656 * 0.436344 = 0.935258\n\nSo, the value of x10 is approximately 0.935258."
