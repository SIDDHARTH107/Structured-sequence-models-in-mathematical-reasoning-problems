    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nWe can rewrite this theorem as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) when a and p are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nIn our case, we want to find the remainder when 7^17 is divided by 13. Since 7 and 13 are coprime, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^(13-1) ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\n7^12 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 7^17 as (7^12) * (7^5). Using the result from Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^17 ≡ (7^12) * (7^5) ≡ 1 * (7^5) (mod 13)\n\nSo, we just need to find the remainder when 7^5 is divided by 13:\n\n7^5 = 16807\n\nNow, divide 16807 by 13:\n\n16807 ÷ 13 = 1292 remainder 11\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^17 is divided by 13 is 11."
