    "message_2": "To find the limit of the sequence of functions f_n(x) = n^2x(1-x)^n as n approaches infinity, we can analyze the behavior of the function for different values of x in the interval [0, 1].\n\n1. If x = 0 or x = 1, then f_n(x) = 0 for all n, so lim_{n -> ∞} f_n(x) = 0 in these cases.\n\n2. If 0 < x < 1, we can rewrite f_n(x) as:\n\nf_n(x) = n^2x(1-x)^n = (n(1-x))^n * (x/(1-x))\n\nNow, let's consider the term (n(1-x))^n. We can rewrite this term as:\n\n((1-x)n)^n = (1 - (1-x)n)^n\n\nThis term is in the form of (1 + a/n)^n, where a = -x(1-x)n. As n approaches infinity, this term converges to e^a, where e is the base of the natural logarithm:\n\nlim_{n -> ∞} (1 - (1-x)n)^n = e^{-x(1-x)n}\n\nNow, let's consider the term (x/(1-x)). As n approaches infinity, this term remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the limit of f_n(x) as n approaches infinity is:\n\nlim_{n -> ∞} f_n(x) = e^{-x(1-x)n} * (x/(1-x))\n\nHowever, as n approaches infinity, the term -x(1-x)n approaches -∞ for any x in the interval (0, 1). Therefore, e^{-x(1-x)n} approaches 0, and the limit of f_n(x) becomes:\n\nlim_{n -> ∞} f_n(x) = 0 * (x/(1-x)) = 0\n\nSo, the limit of the sequence of functions f_n(x) = n^2x(1-x)^n as n approaches infinity is 0 for all x in the interval [0, 1]."
