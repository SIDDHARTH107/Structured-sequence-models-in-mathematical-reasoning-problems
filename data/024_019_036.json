    "message_2": "The total Gaussian curvature of a surface can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the total Gaussian curvature of a surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = 2πχ\n\nGiven the Euler characteristic χ = 1/2, we can find the total Gaussian curvature:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = 2π(1/2) = π\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature of the surface is π."
