    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 5), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (2, 3) as (x1, y1) and (4, 5) as (x2, y2), we can plug in the values:\n\nm = (5 - 3) / (4 - 2)\nm = 2 / 2\nm = 1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope (m = 1) and one of the points (x1 = 2, y1 = 3):\n\ny - 3 = 1(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for y to get the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny - 3 = x - 2\ny = x + 1\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 5) in slope-intercept form is:\n\ny = x + 1"
