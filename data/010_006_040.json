    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the punctured sphere, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B such that their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X can be computed as the amalgamated product of the fundamental groups of A and B over their intersection.\n\nLet's consider the punctured sphere S² - {p} and divide it into two open sets A and B as follows:\n\n1. A is the punctured sphere with a small open disk removed around the point p.\n2. B is an open disk that contains the point p.\n\nNow, A is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹, since we can contract the punctured sphere to the boundary of the removed disk. Therefore, the fundamental group of A is isomorphic to the fundamental group of S¹, which is the group of integers Z (generated by loops around the circle).\n\nThe set B is an open disk, which is contractible. Therefore, the fundamental group of B is trivial (i.e., it consists of only the identity element).\n\nThe intersection A ∩ B is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹. Thus, the fundamental group of A ∩ B is also isomorphic to the group of integers Z.\n\nNow we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of the punctured sphere S² - {p} is the amalgamated product of the fundamental groups of A and B over their intersection:\n\nπ₁(S² - {p}) = π₁(A) * π₁(B) / π₁(A ∩ B)\n\nSince π₁(A) = Z, π₁(B) is trivial, and π₁(A ∩ B) = Z, the amalgamated product becomes:\n\nπ₁(S² - {p}) = Z * 1 / Z\n\nThis is just the group of integers Z. Therefore, the fundamental group of the punctured sphere S² - {p} is isomorphic to the group of integers Z."
