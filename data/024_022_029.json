    "message_2": "First, let's find the metric d' induced by the linear transformation T. Let p = (x1, y1) and q = (x2, y2) be points in R². Then T(p) = (2x1 + 3y1, 4x1 - 5y1) and T(q) = (2x2 + 3y2, 4x2 - 5y2). The distance between T(p) and T(q) in the transformed space is given by:\n\nd'(T(p), T(q)) = √[((2x2 + 3y2) - (2x1 + 3y1))^2 + ((4x2 - 5y2) - (4x1 - 5y1))^2]\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression:\n\nd'(T(p), T(q)) = √[(2(x2 - x1) + 3(y2 - y1))^2 + (4(x2 - x1) - 5(y2 - y1))^2]\n\nLet Δx = x2 - x1 and Δy = y2 - y1. Then:\n\nd'(T(p), T(q)) = √[(2Δx + 3Δy)^2 + (4Δx - 5Δy)^2]\n\nAn isometry between (R², d) and (R², d') is a function f: R² → R² such that d'(f(p), f(q)) = d(p, q) for all p, q in R². In other words, we want to find a function f such that:\n\nd'(f(p), f(q)) = √[(2Δx + 3Δy)^2 + (4Δx - 5Δy)^2] = √(Δx^2 + Δy^2)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n(2Δx + 3Δy)^2 + (4Δx - 5Δy)^2 = Δx^2 + Δy^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n(4Δx^2 + 12ΔxΔy + 9Δy^2) + (16Δx^2 - 40ΔxΔy + 25Δy^2) = Δx^2 + Δy^2\n\n19Δx^2 - 28ΔxΔy + 34Δy^2 = Δx^2 + Δy^2\n\n18Δx^2 - 28ΔxΔy + 33Δy^2 = 0\n\nNow, we want to find a function f that satisfies this equation for all Δx and Δy. Notice that the transformation T itself satisfies this equation:\n\nT((x, y)) = (2x + 3y, 4x - 5y)\n\nIf we let f = T, then:\n\nΔx' = 2Δx + 3Δy\nΔy' = 4Δx - 5Δy\n\nSubstituting these into the equation above, we get:\n\n18(2Δx + 3Δy)^2 - 28(2Δx + 3Δy)(4Δx - 5Δy) + 33(4Δx - 5Δy)^2 = 0\n\nThis equation holds true, so the transformation T itself is an isometry between (R², d) and (R², d').\n\nSince T is a linear transformation, it is also invertible. The inverse of T can be found by solving the system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = a\n4x - 5y = b\n\nSolving this system, we find the inverse transformation T^(-1):\n\nT^(-1)((a, b)) = (1/13(a + 5b), 1/13(4a - 3b))\n\nThe inverse transformation T^(-1) is also an isometry between (R², d') and (R², d).\n\nTherefore, the set of all isometries between (R², d) and (R², d') is {T, T^(-1)}."
