What is the rank of $E$?",
    "message_2": "To find the rank of the vector bundle $E$, we need to look at the total Chern class $c(E)$. For a real vector bundle, the total Chern class is given by the product of the individual Chern classes, i.e., $c(E) = c_0(E) + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + \\cdots$. Here, $c_0(E)$ is always 1, and $c_i(E)$ corresponds to the $i$-th Chern class.\n\nIn the given problem, we have $c(E) = 1 + a_1H + a_2H^2$. Comparing this expression with the general expression for the total Chern class, we can see that $c_1(E) = a_1H$ and $c_2(E) = a_2H^2$. \n\nNow, the rank of a real vector bundle is related to its first Chern class $c_1(E)$. In particular, for a real vector bundle, the rank is given by twice the first Chern number, i.e., $rank(E) = 2c_1(E)$. In our case, $c_1(E) = a_1H$, so the rank of the vector bundle $E$ is:\n\n$rank(E) = 2a_1H$.\n\nSince $a_1$ is an integer, the rank of $E$ is an even integer multiple of the hyperplane class $H$."
