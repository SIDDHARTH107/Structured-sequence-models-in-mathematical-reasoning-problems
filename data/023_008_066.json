    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the non-periodic function f(x) = x defined for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1, we first need to make it periodic. We can do this by extending the function to be an odd function over the interval -1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and then making it periodic with a period of 2.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier coefficients for this odd periodic function. The Fourier series for an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function, n is an integer, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients. In this case, L = 1.\n\nTo find the coefficients b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx) from -L to L\n\nFor our function, this becomes:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫(x * sin(nπx) dx) from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral. We can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = dx and v = -(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-(x/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)] - ∫[-(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) dx]) from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫cos(nπx) dx = (1/(nπ)) * sin(nπx)\n\nSo,\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-(x/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)] - [- (1/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπx)]) from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ)] - [- (1/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπ)] - [-(1/(nπ)) * cos(-nπ)] - [- (1/(n^2π^2)) * sin(-nπ)])\n\nSince cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ) and sin(-nπ) = -sin(nπ),\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ)] - [- (1/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπ)] - [-(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ)] - [ (1/(n^2π^2)) * sin(nπ)])\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\nb_n = 2 * (2 * (1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ))\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n, we have:\n\nb_n = 4 * (1/(nπ)) * (-1)^n\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(4 * (1/(nπ)) * (-1)^n * sin(nπx)) for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
