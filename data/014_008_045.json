What is the resulting ciphertext block?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can help you understand the concepts and process, but I cannot perform the encryption without knowing the specific block cipher algorithm being used. There are several block cipher algorithms, such as DES, AES, and Blowfish, each with its own encryption process.\n\nOnce you provide the specific block cipher algorithm, I can guide you through the encryption process to obtain the ciphertext block."
