    "message_1": "An experiment is conducted to determine whether a new weight loss drug is effective. 50 people are selected at random and divided into two groups: a treatment group (who will take the weight loss drug) and a control group (who will not take the drug). After 3 months, the weight loss (in pounds) for each person is recorded. The data is summarized in the table below.\n\n| Group   | Sample Size | Mean Weight Loss | Standard Deviation |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Control | 25          | 2.5             | 1.2                |\n| Treatment | 25          | 6.2              | 1.6                |\n\nAssuming the weight loss data is normally distributed, test the hypothesis that the new drug is effective at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the new drug is effective at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the mean weight loss between the control and treatment groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a difference in the mean weight loss between the two groups.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the pooled standard deviation (Sp):\n\nSp = sqrt[((n1 - 1) * s1^2 + (n2 - 1) * s2^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2)]\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the control and treatment groups, and s1 and s2 are their respective standard deviations.\n\nSp = sqrt[((25 - 1) * 1.2^2 + (25 - 1) * 1.6^2) / (25 + 25 - 2)]\nSp = sqrt[(24 * 1.44 + 24 * 2.56) / 48]\nSp = sqrt[(34.56 + 61.44) / 48]\nSp = sqrt[96 / 48]\nSp = sqrt[2]\nSp ≈ 1.414\n\nNow, let's calculate the t-statistic:\n\nt = (M1 - M2) / (Sp * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2))\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the mean weight loss of the control and treatment groups.\n\nt = (2.5 - 6.2) / (1.414 * sqrt(1/25 + 1/25))\nt = (-3.7) / (1.414 * sqrt(2/25))\nt = (-3.7) / (1.414 * 0.2)\nt ≈ -13.12\n\nNow, we will find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) equal to n1 + n2 - 2 = 25 + 25 - 2 = 48. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.0106.\n\nSince our calculated t-statistic (-13.12) is less than the critical t-value (-2.0106), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is a significant difference in the mean weight loss between the control and treatment groups, and we can conclude that the new weight loss drug is effective at a significance level of 0.05."
