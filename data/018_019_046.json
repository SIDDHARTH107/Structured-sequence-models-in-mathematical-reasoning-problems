    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 4}) - {2} = {1, 3, 4}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and C:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = ({1, 3, 4} ∆ {3, 4, 5}) = ({1, 3, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 3, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {1, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C:\n\nB ∆ C = ({2, 4} ∆ {3, 4, 5}) = ({2, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({2, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B ∆ C):\n\nA ∆ (B ∆ C) = ({1, 2, 3} ∆ {2, 3, 5}) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 5}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 5}) = {1, 5}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C) = {1, 5}. This shows that the symmetric difference operation is associative, as the order in which the symmetric differences are taken does not affect the final result. In general, for any sets A, B, and C, (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C), which demonstrates the associative property of the symmetric difference operation."
