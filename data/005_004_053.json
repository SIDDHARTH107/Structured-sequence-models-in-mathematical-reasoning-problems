To compare the average fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) of the three engine types, 6 cars equipped with each engine type are tested. The following data are obtained:\n\n* Engine type 1: 20, 18, 22, 24, 21, 19\n* Engine type 2: 26, 28, 24, 27, 25, 26\n* Engine type 3: 30, 32, 28, 29, 31, 27\n\nIs there a significant difference between the mean fuel efficiency of the three engine types at 5% level of significance using ANOVA?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference between the mean fuel efficiency of the three engine types at a 5% level of significance using ANOVA, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean fuel efficiency for each engine type.\n2. Calculate the overall mean fuel efficiency.\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW).\n4. Calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and the Mean Square Within Groups (MSW).\n5. Calculate the F-statistic.\n6. Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean fuel efficiency for each engine type.\n\nEngine type 1: (20 + 18 + 22 + 24 + 21 + 19) / 6 = 124 / 6 = 20.67\nEngine type 2: (26 + 28 + 24 + 27 + 25 + 26) / 6 = 156 / 6 = 26\nEngine type 3: (30 + 32 + 28 + 29 + 31 + 27) / 6 = 177 / 6 = 29.5\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean fuel efficiency.\n\nTotal fuel efficiency: 124 + 156 + 177 = 457\nTotal number of cars: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18\nOverall mean: 457 / 18 = 25.39\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW).\n\nSSB = Σn_i(x̄_i - x̄)^2\nSSB = 6(20.67 - 25.39)^2 + 6(26 - 25.39)^2 + 6(29.5 - 25.39)^2 = 6(22.1289) + 6(0.3721) + 6(16.8521) = 236.0736\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - x̄_i)^2\nSSW = (2^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + (0^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) + (0^2 + 2^2 + 1.5^2 + 0.5^2 + 1.5^2 + 2.5^2) = 30 + 14 + 19.5 = 63.5\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and the Mean Square Within Groups (MSW).\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1) = 236.0736 / (3 - 1) = 118.0368\nMSW = SSW / (N - k) = 63.5 / (18 - 3) = 63.5 / 15 = 4.2333\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic.\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 118.0368 / 4.2333 = 27.87\n\nStep 6: Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table.\n\nAt a 5% level of significance and with degrees of freedom (2, 15), the critical value from the F-distribution table is approximately 3.68.\n\nSince the calculated F-statistic (27.87) is greater than the critical value (3.68), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean fuel efficiency of the three engine types. Therefore, there is a significant difference between the mean fuel efficiency of the three engine types at a 5% level of significance using ANOVA."
