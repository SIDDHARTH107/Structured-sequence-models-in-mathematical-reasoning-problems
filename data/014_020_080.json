    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"HELLO\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATHS\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the plaintext. In this case, the keyword becomes \"MATHS\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square (also known as the tabula recta) to encrypt each letter of the plaintext using the corresponding letter of the keyword. The Vigenere square consists of 26 rows and columns, each representing the letters of the alphabet.\n\nEncryption process:\n1. H (plaintext) + M (keyword) = X (ciphertext)\n2. E (plaintext) + A (keyword) = E (ciphertext)\n3. L (plaintext) + T (keyword) = Z (ciphertext)\n4. L (plaintext) + H (keyword) = Q (ciphertext)\n5. O (plaintext) + S (keyword) = H (ciphertext)\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"XEZQH\"."
