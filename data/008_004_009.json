    "message_2": "To solve this system of homogeneous linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[  3   4  -2 |  0 ]\n[  6  -8   4 |  0 ]\n[  9 -12   6 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[  1   4/3  -2/3 |  0 ]\n[  6  -8    4  |  0 ]\n[  9 -12    6  |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the first row. Subtract 6 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 9 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[  1   4/3  -2/3 |  0 ]\n[  0  -24   12 |  0 ]\n[  0  -16    8 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -24 and the third row by -16 to get leading 1s:\n\n```\n[  1   4/3  -2/3 |  0 ]\n[  0    1  -1/2 |  0 ]\n[  0    1  -1/2 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below the second row. Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n[  1   4/3  -2/3 |  0 ]\n[  0    1  -1/2 |  0 ]\n[  0    0     0 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow we can see that the third row is all zeros, so we can ignore it. We are left with the following system of equations:\n\n```\nx + (4/3)y - (2/3)z = 0\ny - (1/2)z = 0\n```\n\nExpressing y and z in terms of x:\n\n```\ny = (1/2)z\nx + (4/3)((1/2)z) - (2/3)z = 0\n```\n\nSimplify the second equation:\n\n```\nx + (2/3)z - (2/3)z = 0\nx = 0\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of homogeneous linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 0\ny = (1/2)z\nz = z\n```\n\nThis represents a one-parameter family of solutions, where z can be any real number."
