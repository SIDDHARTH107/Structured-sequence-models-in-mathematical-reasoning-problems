    "message_1": "A particle moves vertically upwards in a straight line under the action of gravity with an initial velocity of 30 m/s. Using calculus, determine its maximum height above its starting point and the time at which it reaches this height. Assume acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s².",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first need to find the equation for the particle's velocity and position as a function of time. Since the particle is moving vertically upwards under the action of gravity, we know that its acceleration is constant and equal to -9.8 m/s² (negative because it's acting opposite to the direction of motion).\n\nLet v(t) be the velocity of the particle at time t, and let s(t) be its position at time t. We are given that the initial velocity is 30 m/s, so v(0) = 30 m/s.\n\n1. Find the velocity function, v(t):\n\nSince acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, we have:\n\na(t) = dv/dt\n\nWe know that the acceleration is constant and equal to -9.8 m/s², so:\n\n-9.8 = dv/dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(-9.8) dt = ∫dv\n\n-9.8t + C = v(t)\n\nUsing the initial condition v(0) = 30 m/s, we can find the constant C:\n\n30 = -9.8(0) + C\nC = 30\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -9.8t + 30\n\n2. Find the position function, s(t):\n\nSince velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time, we have:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(-9.8t + 30) dt = ∫ds\n\n-4.9t^2 + 30t + D = s(t)\n\nUsing the initial condition s(0) = 0 (since the particle starts at its initial position), we can find the constant D:\n\n0 = -4.9(0)^2 + 30(0) + D\nD = 0\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -4.9t^2 + 30t\n\n3. Find the maximum height and the time at which it reaches this height:\n\nThe maximum height is reached when the particle's velocity is 0 (since it momentarily stops before falling back down). So, we need to find the time t when v(t) = 0:\n\n0 = -9.8t + 30\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = 30/9.8\nt ≈ 3.06 s\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height by plugging this value of t into the position function s(t):\n\ns(3.06) = -4.9(3.06)^2 + 30(3.06)\ns(3.06) ≈ 45.9 m\n\nSo, the maximum height above its starting point is approximately 45.9 meters, and it reaches this height at approximately 3.06 seconds."
