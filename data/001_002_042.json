    "message_2": "To solve the linear equation for $y$, we want to isolate $y$ on one side of the equation. We can follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract $2x$ from both sides of the equation:\n$-3y = -2x + 6$\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by $-3$:\n$y = \\frac{-2x}{-3} + \\frac{6}{-3}$\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n$y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 2$\n\nSo, the solution for $y$ is $y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 2$."
