    "message_2": "First, let's find AxB and BxA.\n\nAxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, AxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nBxA is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) such that b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, BxA = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nNow, let's find (AxB)∪(BxA) and (BxA)∪(AxB).\n\n(AxB)∪(BxA) is the union of the sets AxB and BxA, which means it contains all elements that are in either AxB or BxA or both. So, (AxB)∪(BxA) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\n(BxA)∪(AxB) is the union of the sets BxA and AxB, which means it contains all elements that are in either BxA or AxB or both. So, (BxA)∪(AxB) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nAs we can see, (AxB)∪(BxA) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} and (BxA)∪(AxB) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}. Both sets are equal, so the statement that (AxB)∪(BxA) ≠ (BxA)∪(AxB) is incorrect. In fact, (AxB)∪(BxA) = (BxA)∪(AxB)."
