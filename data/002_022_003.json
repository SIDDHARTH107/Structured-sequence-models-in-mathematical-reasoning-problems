    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (outer radius - inner radius) and r is the radius of the tube (inner radius).\n\nIn this case, R = (8 cm - 4 cm) / 2 = 2 cm and r = 4 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 2 cm * (4 cm)^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 2 cm * 16 cm^2\nVolume = 32 * π^2 cm^3\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 32 * π^2 cm^3 or approximately 1005.31 cm^3."
