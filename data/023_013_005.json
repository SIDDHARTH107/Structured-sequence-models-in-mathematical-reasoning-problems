    "message_1": "Consider a thin rod of length L = 1 m that is initially at a uniform temperature of 10 °C. The left end of the rod is brought into contact with a hot surface at a temperature of 100 °C while the right end is cooled by contact with a cold surface at a temperature of 0 °C. The rod has a thermal diffusivity of α = 0.1 m²/s. \n\nCalculate the temperature distribution within the rod at time t = 10 minutes using the Fourier transform method. Provide the analytical solution to three significant figures.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier transform method. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x, t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature distribution within the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, x is the position along the rod, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given the initial condition:\n\nT(x, 0) = 10 °C\n\nand the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = 100 °C\nT(L, t) = 0 °C\n\nTo solve the heat equation using the Fourier transform method, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) dT(t) / dt = α T(t) d²X(x) / dx²\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by αXT:\n\n(dT(t) / dt) / T(t) = (d²X(x) / dx²) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of time only and the right side is a function of position only, they must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ²:\n\n(dT(t) / dt) / T(t) = -λ²\n(d²X(x) / dx²) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) dT(t) / dt = -λ²T(t)\n2) d²X(x) / dx² = -λ²X(x)\n\nThe general solution for equation (1) is:\n\nT(t) = C1 * exp(-λ²αt)\n\nThe general solution for equation (2) is:\n\nX(x) = C2 * cos(λx) + C3 * sin(λx)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions to find the constants:\n\nT(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = 100 °C\nX(0) = C2 = 100 °C\n\nT(L, t) = X(L)T(t) = 0 °C\nX(L) = 100 * cos(λL) = 0\n\nSince L = 1 m, we have:\n\ncos(λ) = 0\n\nThe solutions for λ are:\n\nλ = (2n + 1) * π / 2, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nNow, we can write the solution for X(x) as:\n\nX(x) = 100 * cos(λx) = 100 * cos((2n + 1) * πx / 2)\n\nThe complete solution for T(x, t) is a sum of these solutions:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [100 * cos((2n + 1) * πx / 2) * exp(-((2n + 1) * π / 2)²αt)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature distribution within the rod at time t = 10 minutes:\n\nt = 10 * 60 s = 600 s\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [100 * cos((2n + 1) * πx / 2) * exp(-((2n + 1) * π / 2)² * 0.1 * 600)]\n\nThe series converges quickly, so we can truncate it after a few terms. Using the first three terms (n = 0, 1, 2), we get:\n\nT(x, t) ≈ 100 * cos(πx / 2) * exp(-π² * 0.1 * 600 / 4) + 100 * cos(3πx / 2) * exp(-9π² * 0.1 * 600 / 4) + 100 * cos(5πx / 2) * exp(-25π² * 0.1 * 600 / 4)\n\nThis is the analytical solution for the temperature distribution within the rod at time t = 10 minutes to three significant figures."
