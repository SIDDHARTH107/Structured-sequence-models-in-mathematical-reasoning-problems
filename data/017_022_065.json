    "message_2": "There are 52 distinct groups of order 60. These groups can be classified into three types: the cyclic group C60, the direct product of the alternating group A5 and the cyclic group C2 (A5 × C2), and 50 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n1. The cyclic group C60:\nThis group has 60 elements and is generated by a single element of order 60. It is the simplest group of order 60 and is abelian.\n\n2. The alternating group A5 × C2:\nThis group is a direct product of the alternating group A5, which has order 5! = 120, and the cyclic group C2 of order 2. The order of A5 × C2 is 60, and it is non-abelian.\n\n3. The 50 non-abelian groups of order 60:\nThese groups are more complicated and can be classified using the Sylow theorems and group extensions. The Sylow theorems state that for a group G of order p^n * m, where p is a prime number and p does not divide m, the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G (denoted by n_p) satisfies:\n\n  a. n_p divides m\n  b. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p\n\nFor a group of order 60, we have p = 2, 3, and 5, and m = 30, 20, and 12, respectively. Using the Sylow theorems, we can find the possible values for n_p:\n\n  a. n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15 (divisors of 30)\n  b. n_3 can be 1 or 10 (divisors of 20)\n  c. n_5 can be 1 or 6 (divisors of 12)\n\nUsing these values, we can analyze the structure of the groups and their extensions. We can then classify the 50 non-abelian groups of order 60 into 32 isomorphism classes.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 52 distinct groups of order 60, which can be classified into three types: the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, and 50 non-abelian groups of order 60, which can be further classified into 32 isomorphism classes."
