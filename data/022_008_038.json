    "message_1": "Suppose we have an entire function defined as $f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 4$. Find the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ at its zeros.",
    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is an entire function, it has no poles, and therefore, the residues at its zeros are all zero. The sum of the residues of $f(z)$ at its zeros is simply the sum of zeros, which can be found using Vieta's formulas.\n\nVieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. For a cubic polynomial of the form $f(z) = z^3 + az^2 + bz + c$, the sum of the roots is given by $-a$. In this case, $f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 4$, so the sum of the roots (and thus the sum of the residues at the zeros) is $-2$."
