If yes, provide an isomorphism, otherwise explain why they are not isomorphic.",
    "message_2": "Yes, the graphs G and H are isomorphic. An isomorphism between the two graphs can be established by mapping the vertices of graph G to the vertices of graph H as follows:\n\na -> 1\nb -> 2\nc -> 3\nd -> 4\ng -> 6\nh -> 7\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of vertices, as the edges in graph G correspond to the edges in graph H:\n\nab -> 12\nac -> 13\nah -> 17\nag -> 16\nbc -> 24\ncd -> 34\ncg -> 36\n\nThus, the graphs G and H are isomorphic."
