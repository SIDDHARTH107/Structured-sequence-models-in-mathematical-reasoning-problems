    "message_2": "There are 20 students in the class, and 15 of them have taken a course in discrete mathematics. To find the number of students who have not taken the course, we subtract the number of students who have taken the course from the total number of students in the class:\n\n20 students (total) - 15 students (have taken discrete mathematics) = 5 students (have not taken discrete mathematics)\n\nSo, 5 students in the class have not taken a course in discrete mathematics."
