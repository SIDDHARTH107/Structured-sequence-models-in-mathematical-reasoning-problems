    "message_2": "To compute the average degree of membership for the fuzzy set A, we need to determine the degree of membership for each category (low, medium, and high) based on the student's test score of 70 out of 100.\n\n1. Low score (0-50):\nSince the student's score of 70 is outside the range of low scores, the degree of membership for the low category is 0.\n\n2. Medium score (40-80):\nThe student's score of 70 falls within the medium score range. To calculate the degree of membership, we can use the following formula:\n\nDegree of membership = (upper limit - score) / (upper limit - lower limit)\nDegree of membership = (80 - 70) / (80 - 40)\nDegree of membership = 10 / 40\nDegree of membership = 0.25\n\n3. High score (70-100):\nThe student's score of 70 also falls within the high score range. To calculate the degree of membership, we can use the following formula:\n\nDegree of membership = (score - lower limit) / (upper limit - lower limit)\nDegree of membership = (70 - 70) / (100 - 70)\nDegree of membership = 0 / 30\nDegree of membership = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the average degree of membership for the fuzzy set A:\n\nAverage degree of membership = (degree of membership_low × membership value_low + degree of membership_medium × membership value_medium + degree of membership_high × membership value_high) / (degree of membership_low + degree of membership_medium + degree of membership_high)\n\nAverage degree of membership = (0 × 0.2 + 0.25 × 0.5 + 0 × 0.3) / (0 + 0.25 + 0)\nAverage degree of membership = (0 + 0.125 + 0) / 0.25\nAverage degree of membership = 0.125 / 0.25\nAverage degree of membership = 0.5\n\nThe computed average degree of membership for the fuzzy set A of the student's performance in mathematics is 0.5."
