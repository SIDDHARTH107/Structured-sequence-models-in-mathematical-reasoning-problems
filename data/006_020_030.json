    "message_1": "In a certain community, there are 50 youth organizations. The probability of a randomly selected organization hosting a social event during a given month is 0.8. What is the probability that at least 40 organizations will host a social event during that month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 40 organizations will host a social event during that month, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.8)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 organizations)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 40 organizations hosting a social event)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 40 organizations hosting a social event, we need to calculate the probability for 40, 41, 42, ..., 50 organizations and sum them up.\n\nP(X >= 40) = P(X = 40) + P(X = 41) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 40) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.8)^k * (0.2)^(50-k)] for k = 40 to 50\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 40) ≈ 0.956\n\nSo, the probability that at least 40 organizations will host a social event during that month is approximately 0.956 or 95.6%."
