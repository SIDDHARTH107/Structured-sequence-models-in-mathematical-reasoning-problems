    "message_1": "Let X be a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard number 1 and Picard group generated by an ample divisor H. Suppose that the nef cone of X is generated by three divisors E1, E2, and E3 such that E1^3=E2^3=E3^3=0, E1^2.E2=E1^2.E3=E2^2.E3=1, and H.E1=H.E2=H.E3=2. Determine the degree of X, i.e. the intersection number of H with a curve in the linear system |H|.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of X, we need to compute the intersection number H^3, which is the self-intersection of H three times. Since the nef cone is generated by E1, E2, and E3, we can write H as a linear combination of these divisors:\n\nH = aE1 + bE2 + cE3\n\nNow we can use the given intersection numbers to compute H^3:\n\nH^3 = (aE1 + bE2 + cE3)^3\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\nH^3 = a^3E1^3 + b^3E2^3 + c^3E3^3 + 3a^2bE1^2.E2 + 3ab^2E1.E2^2 + 3a^2cE1^2.E3 + 3ac^2E1.E3^2 + 3b^2cE2^2.E3 + 3bc^2E2.E3^2 + 6abcE1.E2.E3\n\nUsing the given intersection numbers, we can simplify this expression:\n\nH^3 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2\n\nNow we need to find the coefficients a, b, and c. We can use the given intersection numbers H.E1, H.E2, and H.E3:\n\nH.E1 = 2 = aE1^2 + bE1.E2 + cE1.E3\nH.E2 = 2 = aE1.E2 + bE2^2 + cE2.E3\nH.E3 = 2 = aE1.E3 + bE2.E3 + cE3^2\n\nUsing the given intersection numbers, we can simplify these equations:\n\n2 = a + b + c\n2 = a + b + c\n2 = a + b + c\n\nSince all three equations are the same, we only need to solve one of them. We can choose a = b = c = 1 as a solution. Now we can substitute these values into the expression for H^3:\n\nH^3 = 3(1)^2(1) + 3(1)(1)^2 + 3(1)^2(1) + 3(1)(1)^2 + 3(1)^2(1) + 3(1)(1)^2\nH^3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3\nH^3 = 18\n\nThus, the degree of X is 18, which is the intersection number of H with a curve in the linear system |H|."
