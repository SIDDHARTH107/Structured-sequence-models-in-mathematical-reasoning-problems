    "message_2": "To verify that the union of set A and B is a superset of both set A and set B, we first need to find the union of set A and B.\n\nThe union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. So, the union of set A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, we need to check if A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B. A set is considered a superset of another set if it contains all the elements of the other set.\n\nFor set A:\nA = {2, 4, 6}\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nA ∪ B contains all the elements of set A, so A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nFor set B:\nB = {4, 6, 8}\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nA ∪ B contains all the elements of set B, so A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nSince A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B, we have verified that the union of set A and B is a superset of both set A and set B."
