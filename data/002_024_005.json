    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all four sides together.\n\nPerimeter = length of side 1 + length of side 2 + length of side 3 + length of side 4\n\nThe given lengths of the sides are 8cm, 14cm, 10cm, and 12cm.\n\nPerimeter = 8cm + 14cm + 10cm + 12cm\nPerimeter = 44cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 44cm."
