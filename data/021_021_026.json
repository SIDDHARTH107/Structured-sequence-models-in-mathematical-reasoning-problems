    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. Here's a Python implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm to find the global minimum of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 + 2*x**2 - 3*x + 1\n\ndef generate_population(population_size):\n    return [random.uniform(-10, 10) for _ in range(population_size)]\n\ndef cuckoo_search(population_size, iterations, step_size):\n    population = generate_population(population_size)\n    best_solution = min(population, key=f)\n    \n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        new_population = []\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            new_solution = population[i] + step_size * random.uniform(-1, 1)\n            if f(new_solution) < f(population[i]):\n                new_population.append(new_solution)\n            else:\n                new_population.append(population[i])\n        \n        best_solution = min(new_population, key=f)\n        population = new_population\n    \n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npopulation_size = 20\niterations = 1000\nstep_size = 0.01\n\nbest_solution, best_value = cuckoo_search(population_size, iterations, step_size)\nprint(\"Global minimum: x = {:.4f}, f(x) = {:.4f}\".format(best_solution, best_value))\n```\n\nThis code defines the function f(x) and implements the cuckoo search algorithm. It generates an initial population of 20 random solutions, and iterates 1000 times, updating the population with new solutions based on the step size of 0.01. Finally, it returns the best solution found and its corresponding function value.\n\nPlease note that the cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic method, and the results may vary slightly each time you run the code. You can adjust the parameters (population size, number of iterations, and step size) to fine-tune the algorithm for your specific problem."
