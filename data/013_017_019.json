The probability of a young person getting sick in a year is 0.1 and the probability of an old person getting sick in a year is 0.5. The insurance company charges a premium of $500 to young people and $1000 to old people. Assuming equal numbers of young and old people buy insurance, what is the average premium charged by the insurance company?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of young people as Y and the number of old people as O. Since there are equal numbers of young and old people, we can say Y = O. \n\nThe total premium collected from young people is $500 * Y, and the total premium collected from old people is $1000 * O. To find the total premium collected, we add these two amounts:\n\nTotal premium = ($500 * Y) + ($1000 * O)\n\nSince Y = O, we can substitute Y for O:\n\nTotal premium = ($500 * Y) + ($1000 * Y)\n\nNow, we can factor out Y:\n\nTotal premium = Y * ($500 + $1000)\n\nTotal premium = Y * $1500\n\nTo find the average premium charged, we need to divide the total premium by the total number of people (Y + O). Since Y = O, the total number of people is Y + Y = 2Y.\n\nAverage premium = (Total premium) / (Total number of people)\n\nAverage premium = (Y * $1500) / (2Y)\n\nThe Y's cancel out:\n\nAverage premium = $1500 / 2\n\nAverage premium = $750\n\nSo, the average premium charged by the insurance company is $750."
