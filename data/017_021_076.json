    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 48. We know that 48 = 2^4 * 3. By Sylow's theorems, we can analyze the possible Sylow subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is n_3 = 1, so there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3.\n\n2. Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 3. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 2-subgroup, say P_2.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3. Since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_3. If P_2 is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48. If P_2 is not cyclic, then G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups, and no normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Let Q be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the index of Q in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, there exists a subgroup H of order 3 in G such that G is the semidirect product of Q and H, i.e., G ≅ Q ⋊ H. \n\nNow, let's analyze the action of H on Q by conjugation. Since Q is a 2-group and H is a 3-group, the action of H on Q by conjugation is non-trivial. This means that there exists a non-identity element h in H such that hqh^(-1) ≠ q for some q in Q. Since |H| = 3, the action of H on Q by conjugation is equivalent to the action of the cyclic group C3 on Q. \n\nLet's consider the automorphism group Aut(Q) of Q. Since Q has order 16, Aut(Q) has order 32 or 48. In either case, Aut(Q) has a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, say R. The action of H on Q by conjugation induces an automorphism of Q, which is an element of order 3 in Aut(Q). Thus, the induced automorphism must belong to R. \n\nNow, let's consider the semidirect product of Q and R, i.e., Q ⋊ R. Since R is a normal subgroup of Aut(Q), Q ⋊ R is a subgroup of Aut(Q). Moreover, |Q ⋊ R| = |Q| * |R| = 48, so Q ⋊ R is a group of order 48. By construction, the action of R on Q by conjugation is the same as the action of H on Q by conjugation. Therefore, G is isomorphic to Q ⋊ R, which is the alternating group A4 × C4.\n\nIn conclusion, given a specific group G of order 48, we can determine which of the three types of groups it is isomorphic to by analyzing its Sylow subgroups and their actions on each other. If G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, it is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C48 or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. If G has three Sylow 2-subgroups, it is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4."
