    "message_2": "There is exactly one group of order 8 that is isomorphic to each of the mentioned groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: There is only one cyclic group of order 8, which is generated by an element of order 8.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: There is only one quaternion group of order 8, which has elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with specific multiplication rules.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: There is only one dihedral group of order 8, which represents the symmetries of a square.\n\nSo, there are a total of 3 groups of order 8 that are isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4."
