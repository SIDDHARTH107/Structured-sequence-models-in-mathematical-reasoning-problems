    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x) + sin(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we can use the double-angle formula for cosine, which is:\n\ncos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x)\n\nNow, substitute this into the original equation:\n\n1 - 2sin^2(x) + sin(x) = 0\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n2sin^2(x) - sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - y - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -1, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / (2(2))\ny = (1 ± √(1 + 8)) / 4\ny = (1 ± √9) / 4\ny = (1 ± 3) / 4\n\nThere are two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (1 + 3) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\ny2 = (1 - 3) / 4 = -2 / 4 = -1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for each value of y:\n\n1) sin(x) = 1\nx = arcsin(1)\nx = π/2\n\n2) sin(x) = -1/2\nx = arcsin(-1/2)\nx = -π/6, 7π/6 (since 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π)\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = π/2, -π/6, 7π/6"
