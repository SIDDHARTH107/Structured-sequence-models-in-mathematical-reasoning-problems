    "message_2": "To find the probability of a tornado not occurring in the next 5 years, we first need to find the probability of a tornado not occurring in a single year. Since the probability of a tornado occurring in a year is 0.02, the probability of a tornado not occurring in a year is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of a tornado not occurring for 5 consecutive years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.98^5 â‰ˆ 0.90392\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado not occurring in the next 5 years is approximately 0.90392 or 90.392%."
