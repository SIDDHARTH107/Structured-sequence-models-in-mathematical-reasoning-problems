The intersection of two sets consists of the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, A ∩ B = {2, 3}.\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\n1. Element 2 is in A ∩ B. It is also in set A and set B.\n2. Element 3 is in A ∩ B. It is also in set A and set B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of each set A and B."
