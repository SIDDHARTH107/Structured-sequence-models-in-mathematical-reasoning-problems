    "message_1": "Let G be a group of order 96. Determine whether G is isomorphic to C96, A4 × C4 × C2 or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. Justify your answer with a detailed explanation.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow Theorems.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 32 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Both of these subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 32 * 3 / 1 = 96. Thus, G = PQ, and G is a semi-direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are abelian, G is isomorphic to C96 if and only if the semi-direct product is a direct product. This occurs when the action of Q on P is trivial. However, we cannot determine whether this is the case without more information about G.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, G has a semi-direct product structure with the Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. However, the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal, so G cannot be isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, G has a semi-direct product structure with the Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup. However, the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal, so G cannot be isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal, so G cannot be isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 in this case.\n\nIn summary, we cannot determine whether G is isomorphic to C96 without more information about the action of its Sylow 3-subgroup on its Sylow 2-subgroup. However, we can conclude that G is not isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 in any of the cases. If G is not isomorphic to C96, then it must be isomorphic to one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96."
