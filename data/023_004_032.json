So, we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(2t + 1) * e^(-jωt)] dt, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we will integrate term by term:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2t * e^(-jωt)] dt + ∫[e^(-jωt)] dt, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[2t * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let u = 2t and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 2 dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nuv - ∫v du = -2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt) - ∫[-2/(jω) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral:\n\n∫[-2/(jω) * e^(-jωt)] dt = -2/(jω) * ∫[e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral in the original equation:\n\n∫[e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThis is a simple integral, and we get:\n\n-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, we have all the pieces to put together the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = -2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt) - (-2/(jω)^2) * e^(-jωt) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nHowever, since we are taking the integral from -∞ to +∞, the terms containing t will vanish, as they will not converge. Therefore, the Fourier transform of f(t) = 2t + 1 is:\n\nF(ω) = -2/(jω)^2"
