    "message_1": "Suppose two travelers flying on separate planes have each lost a piece of luggage, which they valued at $1500. The airlines' policies are that they will reimburse up to $800 for lost luggage. The travelers do not know each other, but they are each allowed to communicate with the airline to claim their reimbursement. \n\nAssume that each traveler has two options: claim the full $1500 value and risk not getting reimbursed at all, or claim the lower amount of $800 and be guaranteed reimbursement. The airlines will reimburse the first traveler that submits his or her claim for each item of lost luggage.\n\nWhat should the travelers do to maximize their expected payout?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their expected payout, each traveler should claim the lower amount of $800 and be guaranteed reimbursement. \n\nHere's why:\n\nIf both travelers claim $1500, there is a chance that neither of them will get reimbursed, as the airline only reimburses up to $800. In this case, their expected payout is $0.\n\nIf one traveler claims $1500 and the other claims $800, the one claiming $800 will be guaranteed reimbursement, while the one claiming $1500 may not get reimbursed at all. In this case, the expected payout for the traveler claiming $1500 is uncertain, while the expected payout for the traveler claiming $800 is $800.\n\nIf both travelers claim $800, they will both be guaranteed reimbursement, and their expected payout will be $800 each.\n\nTherefore, to maximize their expected payout, both travelers should claim $800."
