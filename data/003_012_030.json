    "message_1": "A tree is located 20 meters away from a building. From a window in the building, the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 45 degrees. What is the height of the tree?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Since we have the angle of elevation and the distance from the building to the tree, we can use the tangent function to find the height of the tree.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (in this case, the height of the tree) to the adjacent side (the distance from the building to the tree). So, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nIn our problem, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the building to the tree is 20 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\ntan(45) = height / 20\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1, the equation becomes:\n\n1 = height / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tree:\n\nheight = 20 * 1\nheight = 20 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is 20 meters."
