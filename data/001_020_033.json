    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = |x+3| - 2 on the interval [-5, 2], we need to consider the two cases for the absolute value function:\n\n1) When x + 3 ≥ 0, the function becomes f(x) = x + 3 - 2 = x + 1.\n2) When x + 3 < 0, the function becomes f(x) = -(x + 3) - 2 = -x - 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the function on the given interval:\n\nCase 1: x + 3 ≥ 0 → x ≥ -3. Since the interval is [-5, 2], we only need to consider the sub-interval [-3, 2]. In this case, the function is f(x) = x + 1. The minimum value occurs at the left endpoint, x = -3, and f(-3) = -3 + 1 = -2.\n\nCase 2: x + 3 < 0 → x < -3. In this case, the function is f(x) = -x - 1. The minimum value occurs at the right endpoint, x = -5, and f(-5) = -(-5) - 1 = 4.\n\nComparing the two cases, the minimum value of the function f(x) = |x+3| - 2 on the interval [-5, 2] is -2."
