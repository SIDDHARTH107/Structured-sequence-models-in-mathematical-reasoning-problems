    "message_1": "A student is pushing a block with a force of 50 N at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal. The weight of the block is 100 N. Find the vertical component of the force acting on the block. (Assume that the force is acting on the center of the block)",
    "message_2": "To find the vertical component of the force acting on the block, we can use the formula:\n\nVertical component = Force × sin(angle)\n\nwhere Force is the force applied by the student (50 N) and angle is the angle above the horizontal (30 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nangle (in radians) = (angle in degrees) × (π / 180)\nangle (in radians) = 30 × (π / 180) = π / 6\n\nNow, we can find the vertical component of the force:\n\nVertical component = 50 N × sin(π / 6)\nVertical component = 50 N × 0.5 (since sin(π / 6) = 0.5)\nVertical component = 25 N\n\nSo, the vertical component of the force acting on the block is 25 N."
