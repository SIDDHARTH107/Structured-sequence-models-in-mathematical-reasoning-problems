    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the Principal-Agent Problem in Game Theory:\n\nA principal hires an agent to undertake a project that would generate a reward of $100,000. The agent has a level of effort that she can exert in two different ways - a low effort or a high effort. The principal knows that the agent's cost of exerting high effort is $40,000, while the cost of exerting low effort is only $20,000. The principal can commit to paying the agent a fixed wage, but has no contract for specific output. If the principal offers the agent a wage of $70,000, what effort level will the agent choose? What would be the principal's profit?",
    "message_2": "If the principal offers the agent a wage of $70,000, the agent will choose the effort level that maximizes her utility (income minus effort cost). Let's compare the agent's utility for both effort levels:\n\n1. Low effort:\nUtility = Wage - Cost of low effort = $70,000 - $20,000 = $50,000\n\n2. High effort:\nUtility = Wage - Cost of high effort = $70,000 - $40,000 = $30,000\n\nSince the agent's utility is higher for the low effort level ($50,000) compared to the high effort level ($30,000), the agent will choose to exert low effort.\n\nNow let's calculate the principal's profit:\nProfit = Reward - Wage paid to the agent = $100,000 - $70,000 = $30,000\n\nSo, the principal's profit will be $30,000."
