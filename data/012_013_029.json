    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the graph, we will use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of the graph G with k colors. We will first consider the edge connecting vertices 2 and 4.\n\n1. Delete the edge (2, 4): The resulting graph G' has the same vertices, but the edge (2, 4) is removed. The chromatic polynomial of G' is P(G', k).\n\n2. Contract the edge (2, 4): The resulting graph G'' is obtained by merging vertices 2 and 4 into a single vertex, say vertex 6, and removing any duplicate edges. The chromatic polynomial of G'' is P(G'', k).\n\nNow, we can express the chromatic polynomial of the original graph G as P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nLet's find P(G', k) and P(G'', k):\n\nG':\n1 - connected to 2, 4\n2 - connected to 1, 3\n3 - connected to 2, 5\n4 - connected to 1\n5 - connected to 3\n\nG' is a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is P(G', k) = k(k-1)^(n-1) = k(k-1)^4, where n is the number of vertices (5 in this case).\n\nG'':\n1 - connected to 6\n6 - connected to 1, 3 (merged 2 and 4)\n3 - connected to 6, 5\n5 - connected to 3\n\nG'' is also a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^(n-1) = k(k-1)^3, where n is the number of vertices (4 in this case).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3 = k(k-1)^3[(k-1) - 1] = k(k-1)^3(k-2).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^3(k-2)."
