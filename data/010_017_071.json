Here are the critical points of the function with their indices:\n\n- 6 critical points of index 0\n- 8 critical points of index 1\n- 2 critical points of index 2\n\nWhat are the Morse numbers of the given Morse function?",
    "message_2": "The Morse numbers of a Morse function on a closed, oriented 3-manifold M are the number of critical points of each index. In this case, the Morse numbers are:\n\n- Morse number of index 0: 6\n- Morse number of index 1: 8\n- Morse number of index 2: 2\n\nThere are no critical points of index 3 since it is a 3-manifold. So, the Morse numbers of the given Morse function are (6, 8, 2)."
