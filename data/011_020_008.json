    "message_1": "A company wants to assign 6 of its 12 employees to work on 3 different projects. Each project requires a team of 2 employees. In how many ways can the company assign its employees to the projects such that each project has a different team of employees?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen.\n\nFirst, we need to choose 2 employees for the first project. There are 12 employees to choose from, so there are C(12, 2) ways to do this.\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12-2)!) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = (12 * 11) / (2 * 1) = 66 ways.\n\nNext, we need to choose 2 employees for the second project. Since 2 employees have already been chosen for the first project, there are now 10 employees to choose from. So, there are C(10, 2) ways to do this.\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45 ways.\n\nFinally, we need to choose 2 employees for the third project. Since 4 employees have already been chosen for the first two projects, there are now 8 employees to choose from. So, there are C(8, 2) ways to do this.\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28 ways.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose employees for each project to get the total number of ways to assign employees to the projects.\n\nTotal ways = 66 (first project) * 45 (second project) * 28 (third project) = 103,740 ways.\n\nSo, there are 103,740 ways to assign 6 of the 12 employees to work on the 3 different projects such that each project has a different team of employees."
