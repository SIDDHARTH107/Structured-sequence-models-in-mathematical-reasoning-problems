    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of trials (coin flips), which is 100 in this case\n- x is the number of successful trials (number of heads), which is 50\n- p is the probability of success (probability of getting a head), which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (probability of getting a tail), which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(50) = (100! / (50! * 50!)) * (0.5^50) * (0.5^50)\n\nFirst, we can calculate the binomial coefficient (100! / (50! * 50!)):\n\n100! = 100 × 99 × 98 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n50! = 50 × 49 × 48 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n\n100! / (50! * 50!) ≈ 1.0089134 × 10^29 / (3.0414093 × 10^64) ≈ 1.0089134 × 10^29 / (1.22561744 × 10^36) ≈ 100891344545564193334812497256 / 10272278170\n\nNow, we can calculate (0.5^50) * (0.5^50):\n\n(0.5^50) * (0.5^50) = (0.5^100) ≈ 7.8886091 × 10^-31\n\nFinally, we can multiply the binomial coefficient by the probability:\n\nP(50) ≈ (100891344545564193334812497256 / 10272278170) * (7.8886091 × 10^-31) ≈ 0.0795892\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips is approximately 0.0796, or 7.96%."
