    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Thus, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of the group.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 (2^5). In this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is a normal subgroup.\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 (2^4). In this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is not a normal subgroup.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (3^1). In this case, the Sylow 3-subgroup is a normal subgroup.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and classify the groups up to isomorphism.\n\nCase 1: One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nIn this case, both Sylow subgroups are normal, and the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: Z_32 (cyclic group of order 32) and Q_32 (generalized quaternion group of order 32). The Sylow 3-subgroup is always isomorphic to Z_3 (cyclic group of order 3).\n\nSo, we have two possibilities in this case:\n\n1.1. G = Z_32 x Z_3\n1.2. G = Q_32 x Z_3\n\nCase 2: Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nIn this case, the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, but the Sylow 2-subgroup is not. We have the following possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: Z_16, Z_8 x Z_2, Z_4 x Z_4, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, and D_8 x Z_2 (where D_8 is the dihedral group of order 8). The Sylow 3-subgroup is always isomorphic to Z_3.\n\nFor each of these possibilities, we need to consider the semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup with the Sylow 3-subgroup. However, not all of these semi-direct products will result in non-isomorphic groups. After analyzing the semi-direct products, we find the following non-isomorphic groups:\n\n2.1. G = Z_16 : Z_3\n2.2. G = (Z_8 x Z_2) : Z_3\n2.3. G = (Z_4 x Z_4) : Z_3\n2.4. G = (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) : Z_3\n2.5. G = (D_8 x Z_2) : Z_3\n\nIn total, we have found 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 96:\n\n1. G = Z_32 x Z_3\n2. G = Q_32 x Z_3\n3. G = Z_16 : Z_3\n4. G = (Z_8 x Z_2) : Z_3\n5. G = (Z_4 x Z_4) : Z_3\n6. G = (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) : Z_3\n7. G = (D_8 x Z_2) : Z_3"
