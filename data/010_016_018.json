    "message_2": "Let $[M]$ and $[N]$ denote the fundamental classes of $M$ and $N$, respectively. Since the intersection of $[M]$ and $[N]$ is non-zero, we have that $[M] \\cap [N] \\neq 0$. Recall that the intersection product of two cohomology classes is defined in terms of the cup product, and the degree of the resulting cohomology class is the sum of the degrees of the original classes.\n\nIn our case, $[M]$ is an $n$-dimensional class and $[N]$ is a $k$-dimensional class. The intersection product $[M] \\cap [N]$ is a cohomology class of degree $n+k$. However, since $M$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold, its highest non-trivial cohomology group is $H^n(M)$, and all higher cohomology groups are trivial, i.e., $H^i(M) = 0$ for $i > n$.\n\nSince $[M] \\cap [N] \\neq 0$, it must be the case that $n+k \\leq n$, otherwise the intersection product would be trivial. Therefore, we have $k \\leq n$. Furthermore, if $k < n$, the intersection product would be a cohomology class of degree less than $n$, which cannot be the fundamental class of $M$. Thus, we must have $k = n$.\n\nSo, the value of $k$ in terms of $n$ is $k = n$."
