In this case, the union of A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the union of A and B is a superset of set A and set B individually. By definition, a set S is a superset of another set T if every element of T is also an element of S.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union of A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of set A and set B individually."
