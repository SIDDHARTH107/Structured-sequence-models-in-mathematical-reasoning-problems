    "message_2": "To find the inflection point of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1) = 6x^2 - 12x + 4\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 12x + 4) = 12x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection point, we set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n12x - 12 = 0\n12(x - 1) = 0\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the inflection point, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the original function:\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 4(1) + 1 = 2 - 6 + 4 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, the inflection point of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1 is (1, 1)."
