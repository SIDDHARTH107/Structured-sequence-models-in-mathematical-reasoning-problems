The given ciphertext is \"CNVEFLEIIOMAOXIRCTPYSBREAAT\". \n\nFirst, let's find the length of the ciphertext, which is 27 characters. Now, let's arrange the ciphertext in a zigzag pattern with 4 rails:\n\nC       V       L       O       C       B\n  N   E   F   E   I   M   A   X   R   T   Y   R\n    V       I       O       I       P       A       T\n      E       S       E       A\n\nNow, read the plaintext row by row:\n\nCONGRATULATIONSIFYOUVEDECRYPTEDTHIS\n\nThe decrypted message is \"CONGRATULATIONSIFYOUVEDECRYPTEDTHIS\"."
