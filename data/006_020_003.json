If on an average day, 30% of the teenagers attend a musical event, what is the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is a teenager who will attend the musical event? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the number of teenagers in the community. \n\nNumber of teenagers = 40% of 500 people\nNumber of teenagers = 0.40 * 500\nNumber of teenagers = 200\n\nNext, we need to find the number of teenagers who attend the musical event on an average day.\n\nNumber of teenagers attending the musical event = 30% of 200 teenagers\nNumber of teenagers attending the musical event = 0.30 * 200\nNumber of teenagers attending the musical event = 60\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is a teenager who will attend the musical event.\n\nProbability = (Number of teenagers attending the musical event) / (Total number of people in the community)\nProbability = 60 / 500\nProbability = 0.12\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the probability is 0.12 or 12%."
