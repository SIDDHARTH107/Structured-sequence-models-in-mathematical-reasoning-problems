    "message_2": "A Latin square of order n is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and each column.\n\nFor a 4x4 Latin square, there are 4 different symbols (let's say 1, 2, 3, and 4). We can start by filling the first row and first column with these symbols in their natural order.\n\n1  _  _  _\n2  _  _  _\n3  _  _  _\n4  _  _  _\n\nNow, we need to fill the remaining 3x3 square (positions marked with an underscore). We can do this by considering the possible permutations of the symbols in the second row and second column.\n\nFor the second row, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining symbols (2, 3, and 4). However, we need to ensure that the arrangement in the second column is also a permutation of the remaining symbols (1, 3, and 4). This means that there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the symbols in the second column, given the arrangement in the second row.\n\nSo, there are 3! x 2! = 6 x 2 = 12 possible ways to fill the remaining 3x3 square.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the possible rotations and reflections of the Latin square, as these are considered the same Latin square. There are 4 rotations (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) and 1 reflection (the original square reflected along the vertical axis), which gives a total of 5 equivalent forms for each Latin square.\n\nTo find the number of distinct Latin squares, we divide the total number of possible ways to fill the remaining 3x3 square by the number of equivalent forms:\n\n12 / 5 = 2.4\n\nSince the number of distinct Latin squares must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 distinct Latin squares of order 4."
