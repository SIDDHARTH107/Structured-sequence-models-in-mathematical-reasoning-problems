    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the system's impulse response h(t), we first need to find the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function G(s). The transfer function is given by:\n\nG(s) = (3s + 5) / (s^2 + 4s + 3)\n\nWe can factor the denominator:\n\nG(s) = (3s + 5) / ((s + 1)(s + 3))\n\nNow, we can perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nG(s) = A / (s + 1) + B / (s + 3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator to clear the fractions:\n\n3s + 5 = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n3s + 5 = As + 3A + Bs + B\n\nComparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n\nA + B = 3\n3A + B = 5\n\nSolving this system, we find A = 2 and B = 1. So, the decomposed G(s) is:\n\nG(s) = 2 / (s + 1) + 1 / (s + 3)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of G(s) to get the impulse response h(t):\n\nh(t) = 2 * e^(-t) + e^(-3t)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of h(t) using the given property F{h'(t)} = jsF{h(t)}. First, we need to find the derivative of h(t) with respect to time:\n\nh'(t) = -2 * e^(-t) - 3 * e^(-3t)\n\nNow, we can find the Laplace transform of h'(t):\n\nH'(s) = L{h'(t)} = -2 / (s + 1) - 3 / (s + 3)\n\nUsing the given property, we can find the Fourier transform of h(t):\n\nF{h(t)} = H'(s) / js = (-2 / (s + 1) - 3 / (s + 3)) / js\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the system's impulse response h(t) is:\n\nF{h(t)} = (-2 / (s + 1) - 3 / (s + 3)) / js"
