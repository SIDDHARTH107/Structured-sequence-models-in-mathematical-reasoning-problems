    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 8, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is 8 - 1 = 7 edges.\n\nSince the given graph has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required (7 edges), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the extra edges could form cycles within the graph.\n\nTo determine if the graph is connected or not, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges."
