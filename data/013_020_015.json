    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 people participating in a beauty contest game where they each have to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the person whose number is closest to (2/3) of the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should each player choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, each player should try to guess what the average of all the numbers chosen will be, and then choose a number that is (2/3) of that average.\n\nLet's assume that all players think rationally and choose a number between 0 and 100. If everyone chooses a number uniformly at random, the average would be 50. In this case, a rational player would choose (2/3) * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think this way and choose 33.33, the new average would be 33.33. A smarter player would then choose (2/3) * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, with each step assuming that all other players are choosing the number from the previous step. The sequence of numbers chosen would be:\n\n50 → 33.33 → 22.22 → 14.81 → 9.87 → 6.58 → 4.39 → 2.93 → 1.95 → 1.30 → ...\n\nAs the number of iterations increases, the chosen number approaches 0. In a game with rational players, the optimal strategy would be to choose a number close to 0 to maximize the chances of winning. However, since the game involves human players who may not all think rationally or follow this logic, choosing a number slightly above 0 might be a better strategy to account for potential deviations from the optimal strategy."
