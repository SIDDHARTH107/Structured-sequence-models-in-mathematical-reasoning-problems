    "message_2": "The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm that checks if a given number is a prime number. To perform the test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the given number n - 1 as 2^r * d, where d is an odd number.\n2. Choose a random base a (in this case, a = 2).\n3. Calculate x = a^d mod n.\n4. If x = 1 or x = n - 1, then n is probably prime.\n5. Repeat the following r - 1 times:\n   a. Calculate x = x^2 mod n.\n   b. If x = n - 1, then n is probably prime.\n   c. If x = 1, then n is composite.\n6. If none of the above conditions are met, then n is composite.\n\nNow, let's apply the algorithm to the given number 1299721:\n\n1. Write 1299720 as 2^r * d:\n   1299720 = 2^4 * 81232, so r = 4 and d = 81232.\n\n2. Choose a random base a = 2.\n\n3. Calculate x = a^d mod n:\n   x = 2^81232 mod 1299721 = 1.\n\nSince x = 1, 1299721 is probably prime according to the Miller-Rabin primality test with base a = 2. However, it's important to note that the Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic test, and the result might not be accurate. To increase the accuracy, we can perform the test with more random bases. In this case, we only used one base (a = 2), so the result is not guaranteed to be correct."
