    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The company wants to maximize its profit by deciding how much of each product to produce. The production of product A costs 2 dollars per unit and product B costs 4 dollars per unit. The company has 600 dollars to spend on production costs. Product A sells for 5 dollars per unit and product B sells for 8 dollars per unit. The market for product A is limited to 100 units, while product B has a market for up to 200 units. The company wants to know the maximum profit it can make by producing a combination of products A and B.\n\nWhat is the optimal combination of products A and B that will maximize the company's profit, and what is the maximum profit that can be earned?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe cost constraint is given by:\n2x + 4y ≤ 600\n\nThe market constraint for product A is:\nx ≤ 100\n\nThe market constraint for product B is:\ny ≤ 200\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for the production of products A and B. Using the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 600\nx ≤ 100\ny ≤ 200\n\nDivide the first constraint by 2:\nx + 2y ≤ 300\n\nNow we have:\nx + 2y ≤ 300\nx ≤ 100\ny ≤ 200\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 150), (100, 100), and (100, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 150) = 5(0) + 8(150) = 1200\n3. P(100, 100) = 5(100) + 8(100) = 1300\n4. P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500\n\nThe maximum profit is 1300 dollars, which occurs when the company produces 100 units of product A and 100 units of product B."
