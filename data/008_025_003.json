    "message_2": "To show that this system of linear equations has no solution, we can demonstrate that the two equations are parallel and never intersect.\n\nFirst, let's manipulate the second equation to see if it's a multiple of the first equation:\n\n4x + 6y = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(4x + 6y) / 2 = 24 / 2\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n\nAs we can see, the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (2 times the first equation). This means that both equations represent the same line, and they are parallel and overlapping.\n\nIn this case, the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution, but rather an infinite number of solutions, as every point on the line satisfies both equations."
