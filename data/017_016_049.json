    "message_2": "A non-abelian group of order 27 must be of the form G = 3^3. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide the order of the group (27) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product G = P â‹Š H, where H is a subgroup of Aut(P). The order of Aut(P) is 3^2(3-1) = 18, so H must be of order 1, 3, 6, 9, or 18. If H is of order 1, then G would be abelian, which contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, H must be of order 3, 6, 9, or 18.\n\nNow, let's count the elements of order 3 in G. Since G is non-abelian, there must be at least one non-identity element in H of order 3. Let x be an element of order 3 in H. Then, the elements of order 3 in G are precisely the elements of the form x^i * p, where i = 0, 1, 2, and p is an element of order 3 in P.\n\nSince P is a group of order 3^3, it has 3^2 = 9 elements of order 3. Therefore, there are 3 * 9 = 27 elements of order 3 in G, including the identity element. Excluding the identity element, there are 26 elements of order 3 in the non-abelian group of order 27."
