    "message_1": "Consider a 2-dimensional plane with coordinates (x,y). A triangle is defined by the coordinates (0,0), (4,0), and (0,6). Divide this triangle into smaller triangles by drawing lines connecting the midpoints of each side. How many smaller triangles are in the resulting triangulation?",
    "message_2": "When you connect the midpoints of each side of the triangle, you create four smaller triangles. One triangle is in the center, and the other three triangles surround it, each sharing a side with the central triangle. So, there are 4 smaller triangles in the resulting triangulation."
