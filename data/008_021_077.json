    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the method of inverse matrices, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1 -1 |\n    | 4  2 -2 |\n    | 6  3 -3 |\n\nB = | 3 |\n    | 6 |\n    | 9 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the rows of matrix A are linearly dependent (Row 2 = 2 * Row 1, and Row 3 = 3 * Row 1). This means that the determinant of A is zero, and therefore, A is a singular matrix. A singular matrix does not have an inverse.\n\nSince A^(-1) does not exist, we cannot use the method of inverse matrices to solve this system of linear equations. Instead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination or substitution to solve the system."
