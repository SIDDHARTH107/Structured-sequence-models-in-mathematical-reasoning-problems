    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  1 |  8 ]\n[10  5 | 40 ]\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to solve the system. We want to get a matrix in row-echelon form. We'll start by dividing the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n[ 1  0.5 |  4 ]\n[10  5  | 40 ]\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the leading 10 in the second row. To do this, we'll subtract 10 times the first row from the second row:\n\n[  1   0.5 |  4  ]\n[  0   0   |  0  ]\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n[ 1  0.5 |  4 ]\n[ 0   0  |  0 ]\n\nFrom this matrix, we can see that the second equation is 0 = 0, which is always true. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and the system is dependent.\n\nNow, let's determine if the matrix is ill-conditioned. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if small changes in the input values can lead to large changes in the solution. In this case, we can see that the second row is a multiple of the first row (the second row is 5 times the first row). This means that the two equations are not linearly independent, and the matrix is singular (its determinant is 0). Singular matrices are considered ill-conditioned.\n\nIn the context of this problem, the ill-conditioned matrix means that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution, and small changes in the input values (the coefficients of the equations) can lead to large changes in the solution. This can make it difficult to find a stable and accurate solution to the problem."
