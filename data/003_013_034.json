What is the maximum height off the ground that a rider will experience during the ride? (Round your answer to two decimal places, in feet.)",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height off the ground that a rider will experience during the ride, we need to consider the radius of the circle the ride is rotating in and the height of the ride at its highest point.\n\nThe diameter of the circle is 50 feet, so the radius is half of that:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2\nRadius = 50 / 2\nRadius = 25 feet\n\nSince the ride is rotating in a circle, the maximum height will be at the top of the circle, which is the radius above the highest point of the ride.\n\nMaximum height = Highest point + Radius\nMaximum height = 25 feet + 25 feet\nMaximum height = 50 feet\n\nSo, the maximum height off the ground that a rider will experience during the ride is 50 feet."
