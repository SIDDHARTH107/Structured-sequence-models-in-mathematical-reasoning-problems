    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. The Descartes Circle Theorem states that if four mutually tangent circles have curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, then (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2).\n\nIn the initial configuration, we have three mutually tangent circles with curvatures 2, 3, and 4. Let k4 be the curvature of the fourth circle that makes the configuration complete. Applying the Descartes Circle Theorem:\n\n(2 + 3 + 4 + k4)^2 = 2(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + k4^2)\n\n(9 + k4)^2 = 2(29 + k4^2)\n\n81 + 18k4 + k4^2 = 58 + 2k4^2\n\nk4^2 - 18k4 + 23 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for k4: k4 = 9 and k4 = 2. Since the curvatures are distinct, we choose k4 = 9.\n\nNow, we have four mutually tangent circles with curvatures 2, 3, 4, and 9. To find the curvature of the fifth circle, let k5 be its curvature. Applying the Descartes Circle Theorem again:\n\n(2 + 3 + 4 + 9 + k5)^2 = 2(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 9^2 + k5^2)\n\n(18 + k5)^2 = 2(126 + k5^2)\n\n324 + 36k5 + k5^2 = 252 + 2k5^2\n\nk5^2 - 36k5 + 72 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for k5: k5 = 18 and k5 = 4. Since the curvatures are distinct, we choose k5 = 18.\n\nThe sum of the curvatures of the first five circles is 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 18 = 36."
