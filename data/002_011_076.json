    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 8 cm and a hypotenuse of 10 cm. What is the length of the triangle's other side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c.\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given the values of a and c:\n\n8^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n\n64 + b^2 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 64\nb^2 = 36\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš36\nb = 6\n\nSo, the length of the triangle's other side (height) is 6 cm."
