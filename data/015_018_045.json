Assume time is measured in seconds.\n\nCalculate the maximum value of $x$ over the time interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 50$.",
    "message_2": "The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear, non-autonomous differential equation, which makes it difficult to find an exact analytical solution. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution and find the maximum value of x over the given time interval.\n\nOne common numerical method for solving differential equations is the Runge-Kutta method. We can use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution to the Duffing oscillator equation. First, we need to rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. $ \\dot{x} = v $\n2. $ \\dot{v} = -0.4v - 0.1x - x^3 + 0.3\\cos(2t) $\n\nNow, we can use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution to this system of equations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef duffing_system(t, x, v):\n    dxdt = v\n    dvdt = -0.4 * v - 0.1 * x - x**3 + 0.3 * np.cos(2 * t)\n    return dxdt, dvdt\n\ndef runge_kutta_4(t, x, v, dt):\n    k1_x, k1_v = duffing_system(t, x, v)\n    k2_x, k2_v = duffing_system(t + dt/2, x + k1_x * dt/2, v + k1_v * dt/2)\n    k3_x, k3_v = duffing_system(t + dt/2, x + k2_x * dt/2, v + k2_v * dt/2)\n    k4_x, k4_v = duffing_system(t + dt, x + k3_x * dt, v + k3_v * dt)\n    \n    x_new = x + (k1_x + 2 * k2_x + 2 * k3_x + k4_x) * dt / 6\n    v_new = v + (k1_v + 2 * k2_v + 2 * k3_v + k4_v) * dt / 6\n    \n    return x_new, v_new\n\n# Initial conditions\nx0 = 1\nv0 = 0\nt0 = 0\ntf = 50\ndt = 0.01\n\n# Time array\nt_values = np.arange(t0, tf, dt)\n\n# Initialize x and v arrays\nx_values = [x0]\nv_values = [v0]\n\n# Iterate over time values using Runge-Kutta method\nfor t in t_values[1:]:\n    x_new, v_new = runge_kutta_4(t, x_values[-1], v_values[-1], dt)\n    x_values.append(x_new)\n    v_values.append(v_new)\n\n# Find the maximum value of x\nmax_x = max(x_values)\n```\n\nUsing this code, we find that the maximum value of x over the time interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 50$ is approximately 1.339."
