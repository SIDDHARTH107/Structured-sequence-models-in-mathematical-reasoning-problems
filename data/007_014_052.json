    "message_2": "To find the first five perfect numbers, we need to find the first five prime numbers and plug them into the formula (2^(p-1)) * ((2^p) - 1).\n\nThe first five prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\n1. For p = 2:\n(2^(2-1)) * ((2^2) - 1) = (2^1) * (4 - 1) = 2 * 3 = 6\n\n2. For p = 3:\n(2^(3-1)) * ((2^3) - 1) = (2^2) * (8 - 1) = 4 * 7 = 28\n\n3. For p = 5:\n(2^(5-1)) * ((2^5) - 1) = (2^4) * (32 - 1) = 16 * 31 = 496\n\n4. For p = 7:\n(2^(7-1)) * ((2^7) - 1) = (2^6) * (128 - 1) = 64 * 127 = 8128\n\n5. For p = 11:\n(2^(11-1)) * ((2^11) - 1) = (2^10) * (2048 - 1) = 1024 * 2047 = 2096128\n\nSo, the first five perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 2096128."
