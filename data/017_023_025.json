    "message_2": "Let's use the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of the group G.\n\nSince the order of G is 72, we can write it as 2^3 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (let's denote it as n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (let's denote it as n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n2. n_3 divides 2^3 = 8 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFrom condition 1, n_2 can be 1 or 3. From condition 2, n_3 can be 1 or 4. We are given that there are exactly 12 elements of order 3 in G. Since each Sylow 3-subgroup has 3 - 1 = 2 elements of order 3 (excluding the identity element), we must have n_3 = 4 (since 4 * 2 = 12). Therefore, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nNow let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. If n_2 = 1, then there would be a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which would be a normal subgroup of G. In this case, G would be a semi-direct product of the unique Sylow 2-subgroup and one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this would imply that G is not simple, which contradicts the fact that there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups (since a simple group cannot have more than one Sylow p-subgroup for any prime p). Therefore, we must have n_2 = 3, which means there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nEach Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, and since 8 = 2^3, there are two types of elements in each Sylow 2-subgroup: elements of order 2 and elements of order 4 or 8. The number of elements of order 2 in each Sylow 2-subgroup is 2^2 = 4 (excluding the identity element). Therefore, there are 3 * 4 = 12 elements of order 2 in G.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of elements in G that are not of order 1, 2, or 3. There are 72 - 1 (identity element) - 12 (order 2 elements) - 12 (order 3 elements) = 47 such elements. Since each Sylow 2-subgroup has 8 - 1 = 7 elements that are not of order 1 or 2, there must be 3 * 7 = 21 elements of order 4 or 8 in G.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many of these 21 elements are of order 8. Note that if an element x has order 4, then x^2 has order 2. Since there are 12 elements of order 2 in G, there can be at most 12 elements of order 4. Therefore, there must be at least 21 - 12 = 9 elements of order 8 in G.\n\nIn conclusion, there are at least 9 elements of order 8 in the group G."
