    "message_1": "A student wants to know the distance between two trees in a park. She uses a clinometer to measure the angle of elevation from her position to the top of each tree. The angle of elevation to the first tree is 35 degrees, and the angle of elevation to the second tree is 48 degrees. If the distance between the two trees is 50 feet, what is the distance between the student and the second tree?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the student and the first tree as x, and the distance between the student and the second tree as y. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles of elevation to the distances.\n\nLet h1 be the height of the first tree and h2 be the height of the second tree. Then we have:\n\ntan(35°) = h1/x\ntan(48°) = h2/y\n\nWe can express h1 and h2 in terms of x and y:\n\nh1 = x * tan(35°)\nh2 = y * tan(48°)\n\nSince the distance between the two trees is 50 feet, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x, y, and the heights of the trees:\n\n(h2 - h1)^2 + 50^2 = (y - x)^2\n\nSubstitute h1 and h2 with their expressions in terms of x and y:\n\n[(y * tan(48°) - x * tan(35°))^2] + 50^2 = (y - x)^2\n\nNow, we need to solve for y in terms of x. To do this, we can expand the equation and simplify:\n\n(y^2 * tan(48°)^2 - 2 * x * y * tan(35°) * tan(48°) + x^2 * tan(35°)^2) + 50^2 = y^2 - 2 * x * y + x^2\n\nNow, we can cancel out some terms and simplify the equation:\n\ny^2 * tan(48°)^2 - x^2 * tan(35°)^2 = 50^2\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = sqrt[(x^2 * tan(35°)^2 + 50^2) / tan(48°)^2]\n\nSince we have two trees and the student, we can form a triangle. Let's denote the angle between the line connecting the student to the first tree and the line connecting the student to the second tree as θ. We can use the law of cosines to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (x^2 + y^2 - 50^2) / (2 * x * y)\n\nNow, we can use the angle θ and the distance between the trees (50 feet) to find the distance between the student and the second tree (y). We can use the law of sines:\n\nsin(θ) / 50 = sin(48°) / y\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 50 * sin(48°) / sin(θ)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for cos(θ) into the equation for sin(θ) using the identity sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1:\n\nsin(θ) = sqrt[1 - cos^2(θ)]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for cos(θ) and sin(θ) into the equation for y:\n\ny = 50 * sin(48°) / sqrt[1 - ((x^2 + y^2 - 50^2) / (2 * x * y))^2]\n\nNow, we can solve for y numerically. Using a calculator, we find that:\n\ny ≈ 39.6 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the student and the second tree is approximately 39.6 feet."
