    "message_2": "To find the size of the maximum independent set in this graph, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set and the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. This is known as the Gallai's theorem.\n\nFirst, let's find an upper bound for the minimum vertex cover. Since the graph has 8 edges, the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph is at least 3 (if there were a vertex with degree 2, there would be at most 6 edges in the graph). Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with degree 3 or higher.\n\nNow, consider the subgraph formed by removing this vertex and its incident edges. This subgraph has at most 4 vertices and at most 5 edges. The maximum degree of a vertex in this subgraph is at most 2 (if there were a vertex with degree 3, there would be at least 6 edges in the subgraph). Therefore, the subgraph is either a cycle of length 4 or a tree.\n\nIn either case, the minimum vertex cover of the subgraph has size 2. Since we removed a vertex with degree 3 or higher, we need to add at least one more vertex to the vertex cover to cover all the edges in the original graph. Therefore, the minimum vertex cover of the original graph has size at most 3.\n\nBy Gallai's theorem, the size of the maximum independent set is equal to the number of vertices (7) minus the size of the minimum vertex cover (at most 3), which is at least 4. Therefore, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is at least 4."
