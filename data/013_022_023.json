    "message_1": "A dictator game is played by two players, the dictator and the receiver. The dictator has a total of 100 dollars that they can choose to share with the receiver. The dictator can choose to give any amount of money to the receiver, including nothing at all. If the dictator decides to give money to the receiver, the receiver must accept the offer. If the dictator gives nothing, both players receive nothing. If the dictator gives an amount less than or equal to 50 dollars, the receiver gets to keep the amount given and the dictator keeps the rest. If the dictator gives an amount greater than 50 dollars, then the receiver receives 50 dollars and the dictator keeps the rest. \n\nAssuming the dictator is motivated only by self-interest, what is the optimal amount of money they should give the receiver to maximize their own payout?",
