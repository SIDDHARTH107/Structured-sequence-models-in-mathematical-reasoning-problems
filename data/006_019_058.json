    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the candidate winning the election, we need to consider the margin of error. The opinion poll shows that 55% of the population is in favor of the candidate, with a margin of error of +/- 3%. This means the actual percentage of the population in favor of the candidate could be anywhere between 52% (55% - 3%) and 58% (55% + 3%).\n\nSince the sample size of the poll is 1000 people, we can use the normal distribution to approximate the probability. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample proportion will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough (n > 30).\n\nTo calculate the probability, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the lower limit of the margin of error (52%). The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the sample proportion, μ is the population proportion, and σ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion (σ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ = sqrt((p * (1 - p)) / n)\n\nwhere p is the population proportion (0.55) and n is the sample size (1000).\n\nσ = sqrt((0.55 * (1 - 0.55)) / 1000)\nσ ≈ 0.0157\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score for the lower limit of the margin of error (52% or 0.52):\n\nz = (0.52 - 0.55) / 0.0157\nz ≈ -1.91\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of getting a z-score less than -1.91 is approximately 0.0281 or 2.81%. This means there is a 2.81% chance that the actual percentage of the population in favor of the candidate is less than 52%.\n\nSince the candidate needs more than 50% of the votes to win the election, we can conclude that the probability of the candidate winning the election is approximately 1 - 0.0281 = 0.9719 or 97.19%."
