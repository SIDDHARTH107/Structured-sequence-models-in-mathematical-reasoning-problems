    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. Show that there exist, up to isomorphism, exactly 2 different groups of order 10, and determine which of these groups G must be isomorphic to.\n\nProof:\n\nSince the order of G is 10, we have |G| = 10 = 2 * 5, where 2 and 5 are prime numbers. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let P2 and P5 denote the Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup of G, respectively. Then, |P2| = 2 and |P5| = 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n2 = 1 or n2 = 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n5, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n5 = 1.\n\nIf n2 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, and it must be normal in G. Since n5 = 1, the Sylow 5-subgroup is also normal in G. In this case, G has a unique normal subgroup of order 2 and a unique normal subgroup of order 5. By the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which is the cyclic group of order 10, C10.\n\nIf n2 = 5, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P2 and P5. The automorphism group of P5, Aut(P5), is isomorphic to the group of units modulo 5, which is C4. There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from P2 to Aut(P5), which maps the non-identity element of P2 to an element of order 2 in Aut(P5). This gives us a non-trivial semidirect product, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 10, D10.\n\nThus, there are exactly two groups of order 10 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D10. The group G must be isomorphic to one of these two groups."
