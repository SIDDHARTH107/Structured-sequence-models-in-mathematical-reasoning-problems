    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the average weight of a cereal box is 16 ounces. You collect a random sample of 36 cereal boxes and find that the sample mean weight is 15.5 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.8 ounces. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the cereal boxes?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the cereal boxes, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 15.5 ounces, the standard deviation is 0.8 ounces, and the sample size is 36 cereal boxes. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval with a large sample size (n > 30) is approximately 1.96 (from the Z-table).\n\nConfidence Interval = 15.5 ± (1.96 * (0.8 / √36))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 0.8 / √36 = 0.8 / 6 = 0.1333\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.1333 = 0.2613\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = 15.5 - 0.2613 = 15.2387\nUpper Limit = 15.5 + 0.2613 = 15.7613\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the cereal boxes is approximately (15.2387, 15.7613) ounces."
