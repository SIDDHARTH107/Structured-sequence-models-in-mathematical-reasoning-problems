    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A is given $100 and must decide how much to offer Player B. If Player B accepts the offer, he gets the offered amount and Player A keeps the rest. If Player B rejects the offer, neither player gets anything. What is the optimal amount for Player A to offer if Player B's minimum acceptable offer is $25?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the optimal amount for Player A to offer depends on their knowledge of Player B's minimum acceptable offer and their goal to maximize their own payoff. Since Player A knows that Player B's minimum acceptable offer is $25, they should offer exactly $25 to Player B. This way, Player A can keep the maximum amount of $75 for themselves while ensuring that Player B accepts the offer. If Player A offers less than $25, Player B will reject the offer, and both players will end up with nothing."
