    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one burglary occurring tonight, we can first find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no burglaries occurring tonight is (1 - 0.05) = 0.95.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one burglary occurring tonight by subtracting the probability of no burglaries from 1:\n\n1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n\nSo, the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the neighborhood tonight is 0.05 or 5%."
