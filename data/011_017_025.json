    "message_1": "A group of 5 friends went to a restaurant that offers 5 different pizza toppings. They decided to order 5 large pizzas, each with a different topping. Can they do this in a way that each person gets a slice from every pizza and no two slices that touch at a corner have the same topping? If not, what is the maximum number of pizzas they can order under these conditions?",
    "message_2": "Yes, they can do this. Here's one way to arrange the slices:\n\n1. Divide each pizza into 5 equal slices.\n2. Arrange the slices in a circular pattern, with each pizza slice touching the next one at a corner.\n3. Each friend takes one slice from each pizza, going around the circle.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the arrangement, with each number representing a different topping:\n\n```\n  1\n5   2\n 4 3\n```\n\nIn this arrangement, no two slices that touch at a corner have the same topping. Each friend can take a slice from every pizza, and the condition is satisfied."
