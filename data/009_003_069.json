    "message_1": "Consider a metal rod of length 0.5 meters with a thermal diffusivity of 0.01 m^2/s. Initially, the temperature of the rod is 200 degrees Celsius, with both ends maintained at a constant temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. \n\nAssuming that the temperature of the rod varies only in the axial direction, and satisfies the one-dimensional heat transfer and diffusion equation, determine the temperature distribution of the rod after 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat transfer and diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the axial distance along the rod.\n\nSince the problem involves constant boundary conditions (both ends of the rod are maintained at 100 degrees Celsius), we can use the method of separation of variables to solve the equation. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x) * T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = α * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by α * X(x) * T(t):\n\nT'(t) / (α * T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ²:\n\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\nT'(t) / (α * T(t)) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) X''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\n2) T'(t) + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(λx) + B * sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, X(0) = X(0.5) = 100:\n\nX(0) = A * cos(0) = 100 => A = 100\nX(0.5) = 100 * cos(λ * 0.5) + B * sin(λ * 0.5) = 100\n\nSince cos(λ * 0.5) ≠ 1 for any non-zero λ, we must have B = 0. Therefore, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = 100 * cos(λx)\n\nNow, we solve the second equation:\n\nT'(t) + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE, and its general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C * exp(-αλ²t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the temperature distribution:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 * cos(λx) * exp(-αλ²t)\n\nTo find the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition T(x, 0) = 200, we can use a Fourier series expansion:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 + Σ[An * cos(λnx) * exp(-αλn²t)]\n\nwhere An are the Fourier coefficients, and λn = n * π / L, with L = 0.5 m.\n\nThe initial condition implies that:\n\n200 = 100 + Σ[An * cos(λnx)]\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients An can be found by:\n\nAn = 2/L * ∫[0 to L][(200 - 100) * cos(λnx) dx]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\nAn = 400/(n * π) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution after 10 seconds:\n\nT(x, 10) = 100 + Σ[400/(n * π) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(λnx) * exp(-αλn² * 10)]\n\nSince the series converges rapidly, we can approximate the solution by taking the first few terms:\n\nT(x, 10) ≈ 100 + Σ[400/(n * π) * (1 - (-1)^n) * cos(λnx) * exp(-αλn² * 10)] for n = 1 to N\n\nwhere N is the number of terms you want to consider for the approximation.\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the rod after 10 seconds."
