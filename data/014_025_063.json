    "message_1": "Consider the message \"SECURITY\" and its hash value computed using the SHA-256 algorithm. If the hash value is represented in hexadecimal format, what is its length in bits?",
    "message_2": "The SHA-256 algorithm produces a hash value of 256 bits. When represented in hexadecimal format, each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits (since there are 16 possible values for a hexadecimal digit: 0-9 and A-F, and 2^4 = 16). Therefore, the length of the hash value in hexadecimal format would be 256 bits / 4 bits per hexadecimal digit = 64 hexadecimal digits."
