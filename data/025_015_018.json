    "message_2": "A double point on the surface occurs when the tangent plane is the same at two distinct points. To find the tangent plane, we need to compute the gradient of the surface equation. The gradient is given by the vector of partial derivatives with respect to each variable:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y, z) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$\n\nLet $f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz - k$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3xz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3z^2 - 3xy$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the gradient is zero, i.e., $\\nabla f(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3yz = 0$\n\n$3y^2 - 3xz = 0$\n\n$3z^2 - 3xy = 0$\n\nDivide each equation by 3:\n\n$x^2 - yz = 0$\n\n$y^2 - xz = 0$\n\n$z^2 - xy = 0$\n\nNow, multiply the first equation by $x$, the second equation by $y$, and the third equation by $z$:\n\n$x^3 - xyz = 0$\n\n$y^3 - xyz = 0$\n\n$z^3 - xyz = 0$\n\nAdd the three equations:\n\n$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$\n\nThis is the same as the surface equation with $k = 0$. Therefore, the value of $k$ for which the surface has a double point is $k = 0$."
