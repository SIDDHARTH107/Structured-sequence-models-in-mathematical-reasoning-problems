Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (A) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = ∞, C = ∞, D = ∞, E = ∞\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 5, C = 2, D = ∞, E = ∞\n\n3. Select the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes (C) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, D, E}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 5, C = 2, D = 5, E = 10\n\n4. Select the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes (B) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, E}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 5, C = 2, D = 5, E = 10\n\n   Since we have reached node B, we can stop the algorithm here. The shortest path between nodes A and B is 5. However, to demonstrate the complete algorithm, let's continue until all nodes are visited.\n\n5. Select the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes (D) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {E}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 5, C = 2, D = 5, E = 9\n\n6. Select the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes (E) and update the distances of its neighbors.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 5, C = 2, D = 5, E = 9\n\nAll nodes have been visited, and the shortest path between nodes A and B is 5."
