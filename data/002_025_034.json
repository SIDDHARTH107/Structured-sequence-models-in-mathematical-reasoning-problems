    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two sides that are both 8 cm long and an angle between them of 60 degrees. What is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and an angle C between sides a and b, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the two equal sides are a = b = 8 cm, and the angle between them is C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 degrees * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 8² + 8² - 2 * 8 * 8 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 64 + 64 - 128 * (1/2)\nc² = 128 - 64\nc² = 64\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc = √64\nc = 8 cm\n\nThe length of the third side of the isosceles triangle is 8 cm."
