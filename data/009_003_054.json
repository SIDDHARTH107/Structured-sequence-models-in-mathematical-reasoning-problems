    "message_1": "Sure, here's a possible question:\n\nA metal slab of length 0.5 m and cross-sectional area 0.1 m² has an initial temperature distribution of T(x,0) = 20 - 8x, where x is the distance in meters from one end. The slab is insulated on the sides and the bottom, and the top surface is exposed to air at a constant temperature of 10°C. Find the temperature distribution T(x,t) at time t = 150 s, if the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.01 m²/s. \n\nAssume that T(x,t) satisfies the diffusion equation \n\n∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x²)\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity, and that the boundary conditions are \n\nT(0,t) = T(0.5,t) = 10°C \n\nfor all t.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let T(x, t) = X(x)T(t), where X(x) is a function of x only and T(t) is a function of t only. Substituting this into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = αT(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nNow, divide both sides by αXT:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n\nSolving the first equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions T(0, t) = 10 and T(0.5, t) = 10, we get:\n\nX(0) = A = 10\nX(0.5) = 10*cos(λ*0.5) = 10\n\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\ncos(λ*0.5) = 1\n\nThis implies that λ*0.5 = 2nπ, where n is an integer. So, λ = 4nπ.\n\nNow, we can write X(x) as:\n\nX(x) = 10*cos(4nπx)\n\nSolving the second ordinary differential equation for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-αλ²t)\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution T(x, t) as:\n\nT(x, t) = ∑[10*cos(4nπx) * C_n * exp(-α(4nπ)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 20 - 8x:\n\n20 - 8x = ∑[10*cos(4nπx) * C_n]\n\nWe can find the coefficients C_n using Fourier cosine series:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[T(x, 0) * cos(4nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L, where L = 0.5\n\nC_n = 4 * ∫[(20 - 8x) * cos(8nπx) dx] from 0 to 0.5\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nC_0 = 20\nC_n = (-1)^n / (nπ) for n ≥ 1\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution T(x, t) as:\n\nT(x, t) = 20 + ∑[(-1)^n / (nπ) * 10 * cos(4nπx) * exp(-α(4nπ)²t)]\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 150 s:\n\nT(x, 150) = 20 + ∑[(-1)^n / (nπ) * 10 * cos(4nπx) * exp(-0.01(4nπ)²*150)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution T(x, t) at time t = 150 s."
