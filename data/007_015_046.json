    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the sixth Mersenne prime, we need to find the first six prime numbers and then calculate the Mersenne primes for each of them.\n\nThe first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n\nNow, we calculate the Mersenne primes for each of these prime numbers:\n\nM_2 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\nM_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\nM_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31\nM_7 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\nM_11 = 2^11 - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047 (which is not a prime number, as it can be factored into 23 * 89)\nM_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191\n\nSo, the sixth Mersenne prime number is 8191."
