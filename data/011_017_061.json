    "message_1": "Consider a 4x4 Latin square where the first row is filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in some order. In how many ways can we complete the Latin square such that each row and each column contains exactly one occurrence of each digit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the Latin square as a matrix with elements a(i,j), where i is the row number and j is the column number. Since the first row is already filled, we have:\n\na(1,1) = 1, a(1,2) = 2, a(1,3) = 3, a(1,4) = 4\n\nNow, let's fill the second row. There are 3 possible values for a(2,1) (2, 3, or 4), and after choosing one, there are 2 possible values for a(2,2). The remaining value will be assigned to a(2,3), and a(2,4) will be the only value left to complete the row. Therefore, there are 3! = 6 ways to fill the second row.\n\nNext, let's fill the third row. There are 2 possible values for a(3,1) (whichever two values are not in the same column as a(2,1)). After choosing one, there is only 1 possible value for a(3,2) (the value not in the same column as a(2,2)). The remaining two values can be assigned to a(3,3) and a(3,4) in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, there are 2 ways to fill the third row.\n\nFinally, the fourth row will be uniquely determined by the previous rows, as there is only one possible value for each element that is not in the same column as the values above it.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to complete the Latin square is the product of the number of ways to fill each row:\n\n6 (second row) * 2 (third row) * 1 (fourth row) = 12 ways."
