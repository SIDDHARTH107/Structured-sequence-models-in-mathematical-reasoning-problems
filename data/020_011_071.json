    "message_1": "Consider a manufacturing company that produces two types of products A and B. The profit earned from producing one unit of A is $15, and the profit earned from producing one unit of B is $25. The company has a limited number of machines and workers available. To produce one unit of A requires 3 units of machine time and 2 units of labor time, while producing one unit of B requires 5 units of machine time and 4 units of labor time. The company has a maximum of 150 units of machine time and 100 units of labor time available. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn by producing a combination of A and B, given the time and resource constraints? How many units of products A and B should the company produce to achieve the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 15x + 25y, subject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 150 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 100 (labor time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we can simplify the labor time constraint by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 50\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 5y = 150 is the equation of a line with x-intercept (50, 0) and y-intercept (0, 30). All points below this line satisfy the machine time constraint.\n2. x + 2y = 50 is the equation of a line with x-intercept (50, 0) and y-intercept (0, 25). All points below this line satisfy the labor time constraint.\n\nThe feasible region is the area below both lines and in the first quadrant (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0). The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 25), (50, 0), and (20, 15).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 15(0) + 25(0) = $0\nP(0, 25) = 15(0) + 25(25) = $625\nP(50, 0) = 15(50) + 25(0) = $750\nP(20, 15) = 15(20) + 25(15) = $675\n\nThe maximum profit is $750, which is achieved when the company produces 50 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
