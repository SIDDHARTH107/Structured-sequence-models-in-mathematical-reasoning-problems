    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system of equations in matrix form. The matrix form of the given system is:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 6 10  3 |\n    | 4  3  8 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 12 |\n    | 28 |\n    | 20 |\n\nNow, we can represent the matrix A as a sparse matrix. In this case, since there are no zero elements in the matrix A, the sparse matrix representation will be the same as the original matrix A.\n\nNext, we can solve the system of linear equations using any suitable method, such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or Cramer's rule. Here, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n\nDivide the first equation by 2:\n\nx + 1.5y + 2z = 6\n\nSubtract 6 times the first equation from the second equation:\n\ny - 9z = -8\n\nSubtract 4 times the first equation from the third equation:\n\n-3y + 0z = -4\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third equation.\n\nDivide the second equation by -3:\n\ny - 3z = 4\n\nAdd the second equation to the third equation:\n\nz = 0\n\nStep 3: Back-substitute to find x and y.\n\nFrom the third equation, we have z = 0. Substitute this value into the second equation:\n\ny - 3(0) = 4\n\ny = 4\n\nNow, substitute the values of y and z into the first equation:\n\nx + 1.5(4) + 2(0) = 6\n\nx + 6 = 6\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 4, and z = 0."
