    "message_1": "A Lévy C curve is created by replacing each line segment of a given initial curve with two perpendicular lines of 1/3 the length of the original line segment. Find the total length of the Lévy C curve after the third iteration, starting from an initial curve of length 4 units.",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nInitial curve: Length = 4 units\n\nFirst iteration:\nEach line segment is replaced by two perpendicular lines of 1/3 the length of the original line segment. So, each 4-unit segment is replaced by two 4/3-unit segments. Since there is only one segment in the initial curve, the total length after the first iteration is 2 * (4/3) = 8/3 units.\n\nSecond iteration:\nNow, we have two line segments, each of length 4/3 units. In this iteration, each 4/3-unit segment is replaced by two 4/9-unit segments. So, the total length after the second iteration is 2 * 2 * (4/9) = 16/9 units.\n\nThird iteration:\nWe now have four line segments, each of length 4/9 units. In this iteration, each 4/9-unit segment is replaced by two 4/27-unit segments. So, the total length after the third iteration is 2 * 4 * (4/27) = 32/27 units.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Lévy C curve after the third iteration is 32/27 units."
