    "message_2": "To show that G has exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup and exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, we will use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 30, so |G| = 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.\n\nSylow's First Theorem states that for any prime factor p of |G|, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of order p^n, where p^n is the highest power of p that divides |G|. In our case, the prime factors of |G| are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nSylow's Second Theorem states that all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other. \n\nSylow's Third Theorem states that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides the index [G : P] = 30/5 = 6, so n_5 must divide 6. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. However, n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so n_5 cannot be 6. Therefore, n_5 = 1, which means there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Since there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G (as all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and the only conjugate of a single subgroup is itself).\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides the index [G : P] = 30/3 = 10, so n_3 must divide 10. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so n_3 cannot be 2, 5, or 10. Therefore, n_3 = 1, which means there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G (for the same reason as the Sylow 5-subgroup).\n\nIn conclusion, G has exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup and exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, and both are normal in G."
