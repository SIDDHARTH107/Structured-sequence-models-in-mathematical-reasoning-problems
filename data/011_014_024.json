    "message_2": "A simple connected graph is a graph where there are no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices, and all vertices are connected.\n\nFor a graph with n vertices, there can be a maximum of n(n-1)/2 edges. In our case, with 5 vertices, there can be a maximum of 5(5-1)/2 = 10 edges.\n\nTo count the number of simple connected graphs with 5 vertices, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the number of all possible graphs with 5 vertices (connected and disconnected).\n2. Calculate the number of all possible disconnected graphs with 5 vertices.\n3. Subtract the number of disconnected graphs from the total number of graphs to get the number of connected graphs.\n\nStep 1: Number of all possible graphs with 5 vertices\nFor each of the 10 possible edges, it can either be present or not present in the graph. So, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible graphs (connected and disconnected).\n\nStep 2: Number of all possible disconnected graphs with 5 vertices\nThere are three possible cases of disconnected graphs with 5 vertices:\n- One isolated vertex and a connected graph with 4 vertices.\n- One isolated vertex, one isolated vertex, and a connected graph with 3 vertices.\n- One isolated vertex, one isolated vertex, one isolated vertex, and a connected graph with 2 vertices.\n\nCase 1: One isolated vertex and a connected graph with 4 vertices\nThere are 2^(4(4-1)/2) = 2^6 = 64 possible graphs with 4 vertices. However, some of these graphs are disconnected. There are 11 connected graphs with 4 vertices (this can be found using the same approach recursively or by looking it up in a table of connected graphs). So, there are 5 * 11 = 55 graphs in this case (5 choices for the isolated vertex).\n\nCase 2: One isolated vertex, one isolated vertex, and a connected graph with 3 vertices\nThere are 2^(3(3-1)/2) = 2^3 = 8 possible graphs with 3 vertices. There are 4 connected graphs with 3 vertices (a cycle, a star, and two paths). So, there are (5 choose 2) * 4 = 10 * 4 = 40 graphs in this case.\n\nCase 3: One isolated vertex, one isolated vertex, one isolated vertex, and a connected graph with 2 vertices\nThere is only one connected graph with 2 vertices (a single edge). So, there are (5 choose 3) * 1 = 10 * 1 = 10 graphs in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 55 + 40 + 10 = 105 disconnected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the number of disconnected graphs from the total number of graphs\nConnected graphs with 5 vertices = Total graphs - Disconnected graphs = 1024 - 105 = 919\n\nSo, there are 919 simple connected graphs with exactly 5 vertices."
