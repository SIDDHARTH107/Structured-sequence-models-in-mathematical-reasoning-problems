    "message_2": "In an Apollonian gasket, the curvatures (k) of the circles are related to the Descartes Circle Theorem. Given three mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, and k3, the curvature of the fourth circle tangent to these three is given by:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 Â± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nIn this case, we have k1 = 1, k2 = 2, and k3 = 3. We will use the positive sign in the equation to find the curvature of the smallest circle in the Apollonian gasket.\n\nk4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 * sqrt(1 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 1)\nk4 = 6 + 2 * sqrt(2 + 6 + 3)\nk4 = 6 + 2 * sqrt(11)\n\nNow, the radius (r) of a circle is related to its curvature (k) by the formula:\n\nr = 1 / k\n\nSo, the radius of the smallest circle in the Apollonian gasket is:\n\nr = 1 / (6 + 2 * sqrt(11))\n\nThis is the exact value of the radius of the smallest circle in the Apollonian gasket with curvatures of 1, 2, and 3."
