    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. Additionally, we can write this as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) when a and p are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 26^37 is divided by 19. First, we notice that 19 is a prime number. We can rewrite 26 as 7 (mod 19) since 26 ≡ 7 (mod 19).\n\nNow, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^(19-1) ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n\n7^18 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n\nNow, we want to find 7^37 (mod 19). We can rewrite 37 as 18 * 2 + 1. So, we have:\n\n7^37 ≡ 7^(18 * 2 + 1) (mod 19)\n\nUsing the property of modular exponentiation, we can rewrite this as:\n\n7^37 ≡ (7^18)^2 * 7 (mod 19)\n\nWe already know that 7^18 ≡ 1 (mod 19), so we have:\n\n7^37 ≡ 1^2 * 7 (mod 19)\n\n7^37 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n\nSo, the remainder when 26^37 is divided by 19 is 7."
