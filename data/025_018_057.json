    "message_2": "A singular point on a surface is a point where the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to each variable are all zero. Let's find the singular points of the given surface.\n\nThe surface equation is $2x^2 + 3y^2 + z^2 = 6$. We need to find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x^2 + 3y^2 + z^2) = 4x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2x^2 + 3y^2 + z^2) = 6y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(2x^2 + 3y^2 + z^2) = 2z$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where all these partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$4x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$6y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\n$2z = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 0$\n\nThe only singular point on the surface is $(0, 0, 0)$. Since a line needs at least two points to be defined, there are no lines on the surface that pass through at least two singular points. Therefore, the answer is 0."
