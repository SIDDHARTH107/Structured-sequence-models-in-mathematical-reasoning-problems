($r \\Rightarrow w$)\nRule 2: If there's a car accident, the street will be blocked. ($a \\Rightarrow b$)\nRule 3: If the street is wet, then it's slippery. ($w \\Rightarrow s$)\n\nIf it's known that it's not raining and there is no car accident, can we conclude that the street is not slippery? Solve this logically with a numerical proof.",
    "message_2": "We are given that it's not raining and there is no car accident. We can represent this as:\n\n¬r (It's not raining)\n¬a (There is no car accident)\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude that the street is not slippery (¬s). To do this, we will examine the given rules and the provided information.\n\nRule 1: If it's raining, the street will be wet. (r ⇒ w)\nSince it's not raining (¬r), we cannot conclude anything about the street being wet or not from this rule.\n\nRule 2: If there's a car accident, the street will be blocked. (a ⇒ b)\nSince there is no car accident (¬a), we cannot conclude anything about the street being blocked or not from this rule.\n\nRule 3: If the street is wet, then it's slippery. (w ⇒ s)\nWe don't have any information about the street being wet or not, so we cannot conclude anything about the street being slippery or not from this rule.\n\nSince none of the given rules allow us to conclude anything about the street being slippery or not, we cannot determine if the street is not slippery (¬s) based on the provided information."
