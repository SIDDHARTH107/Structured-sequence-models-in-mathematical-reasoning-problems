    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx at the point (3,4), we first need to differentiate the given equation with respect to x. We will treat y as a function of x, i.e., y(x), and apply the chain rule when differentiating terms involving y.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 25\n\nDifferentiating with respect to x:\n\nd(x^2)/dx + d(y^2)/dx + d(2xy)/dx = d(25)/dx\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) + 2(x(dy/dx) + y) = 0\n\nNow, we will plug in the point (3,4) into the equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(4)(dy/dx) + 2(3(dy/dx) + 4) = 0\n\n6 + 8(dy/dx) + 6(dy/dx) + 8 = 0\n\n14 + 14(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we will solve for dy/dx:\n\n14(dy/dx) = -14\n\n(dy/dx) = -14/14\n\n(dy/dx) = -1\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx at the point (3,4) is -1."
