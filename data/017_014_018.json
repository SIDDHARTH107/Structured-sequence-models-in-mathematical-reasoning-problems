    "message_2": "To determine which type of group G is isomorphic to, we can analyze the given multiplication table.\n\nFirst, let's check if the group is abelian. A group is abelian if the multiplication table is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. In this case, the table is symmetric, as we can see that the elements are mirrored along the main diagonal:\n\n|   | 1 | a | b | c | d |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1 | a | b | c | d |\n| a | a | 1 | c | d | b |\n| b | b | d | 1 | a | c |\n| c | c | b | d | 1 | a |\n| d | d | c | a | b | 1 |\n\nSince the group is abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group. Now we need to check if it is isomorphic to a cyclic group C20 or a dihedral group D10.\n\nA cyclic group of order 20 has one generator that can produce all other elements in the group. In this case, we can see that no single element can generate all other elements in the group. For example, if we take the element 'a' and try to generate the other elements, we can see that:\n\na * a = 1\na * b = c\na * c = d\na * d = b\n\nWe can't generate the element 'b' using only the element 'a'. Therefore, the group is not isomorphic to a cyclic group C20.\n\nNow let's check if the group is isomorphic to a dihedral group D10. A dihedral group of order 20 has two generators, r and s, with the following properties:\n\n1. r^10 = 1\n2. s^2 = 1\n3. s * r = r^(-1) * s\n\nWe can see that the element 'a' satisfies the first property (a^2 = 1), and the element 'b' satisfies the second property (b^4 = 1). However, the third property is not satisfied, as:\n\nb * a = c\na^(-1) * b = d\n\nSince the third property is not satisfied, the group is not isomorphic to a dihedral group D10.\n\nIn conclusion, the given group G is an abelian group, but it is not isomorphic to any of the groups C20, D10, or a non-abelian group."
