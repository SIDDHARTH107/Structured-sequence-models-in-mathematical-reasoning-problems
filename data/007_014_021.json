    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first three perfect numbers are:\n\n1. 6: The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. The sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n2. 28: The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. The sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.\n3. 496: The divisors of 496 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, and 248. The sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248 = 496."
