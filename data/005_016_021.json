They collected data on the age and product purchase of 50 customers. \n\n- Age range of customers: 18-24, 25-34, and 35-44\n- Total number of customers: 50\n- Number of customers in age range 18-24 who purchased the product: 15\n- Number of customers in age range 25-34 who purchased the product: 20\n- Number of customers in age range 35-44 who purchased the product: 10\n\nWhat is the probability of a customer in the age range of 25-34 purchasing the product, according to the discriminant analysis?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a customer in the age range of 25-34 purchasing the product, we need to find the proportion of customers in that age range who purchased the product out of the total number of customers.\n\nNumber of customers in age range 25-34 who purchased the product: 20\nTotal number of customers: 50\n\nProbability = (Number of customers in age range 25-34 who purchased the product) / (Total number of customers)\n\nProbability = 20 / 50\n\nProbability = 0.4\n\nAccording to the discriminant analysis, the probability of a customer in the age range of 25-34 purchasing the product is 0.4 or 40%."
