    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedrons. In this case, the initial tetrahedron is made up of 64 smaller tetrahedrons, which means it has been through two iterations of the recursive process.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Initial tetrahedron (0 iterations): 1 tetrahedron\n2. First iteration: 1 + 4 = 5 tetrahedrons\n3. Second iteration: 5 + 4^2 = 5 + 16 = 21 tetrahedrons\n\nSo, a Sierpinski tetrahedron with an initial tetrahedron made up of 64 smaller tetrahedrons consists of 21 smaller tetrahedrons in total."
