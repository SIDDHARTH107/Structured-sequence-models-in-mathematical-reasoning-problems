    "message_2": "To compute the complex line integral using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if the function is analytic inside and on the contour C. The function is given by:\n\n$f(z) = \\dfrac{2z+3}{z^2-4}$\n\nThe function has singularities at $z = \\pm 2$, since the denominator becomes zero at these points. The contour C is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, so it encloses the singularity at $z = 2$. Therefore, we can't directly apply Cauchy's theorem.\n\nInstead, we will use the Cauchy Integral Formula, which states that for a simple closed contour C and an analytic function f(z) inside and on C, except for a singularity at $z_0$:\n\n$\\oint_C \\dfrac{f(z)}{z-z_0} \\mathrm{d}z = 2\\pi i f(z_0)$\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n$f(z) = \\dfrac{2z+3}{(z-2)(z+2)}$\n\nThe singularity inside the contour is at $z_0 = 2$. We can rewrite the function as:\n\n$f(z) = \\dfrac{g(z)}{z-2}$\n\nwhere $g(z) = \\dfrac{2z+3}{z+2}$.\n\nNow we can apply the Cauchy Integral Formula:\n\n$\\oint_C \\dfrac{2z+3}{z^2-4} \\mathrm{d}z = \\oint_C \\dfrac{g(z)}{z-2} \\mathrm{d}z = 2\\pi i g(2)$\n\nWe need to compute $g(2)$:\n\n$g(2) = \\dfrac{2(2)+3}{2+2} = \\dfrac{7}{4}$\n\nNow we can plug this back into the Cauchy Integral Formula:\n\n$\\oint_C \\dfrac{2z+3}{z^2-4} \\mathrm{d}z = 2\\pi i \\dfrac{7}{4} = \\dfrac{7\\pi i}{2}$\n\nSo, the complex line integral is:\n\n$\\oint_C \\dfrac{2z+3}{z^2-4} \\mathrm{d}z = \\dfrac{7\\pi i}{2}$"
