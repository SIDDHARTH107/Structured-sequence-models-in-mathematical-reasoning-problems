    "message_2": "Let $M$ be a compact 2-dimensional manifold with genus $g \\geq 1$. Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be loops with no common base-point that generate $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. We want to find the intersection number of the homology classes $[\\alpha]$ and $[\\beta]$.\n\nRecall that Poincaré duality states that for a compact, oriented $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, there is an isomorphism $PD: H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^{n-k}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k$. In our case, $n = 2$, so we have an isomorphism $PD: H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nLet $PD([\\alpha]) = \\alpha^*$ and $PD([\\beta]) = \\beta^*$, where $\\alpha^*$ and $\\beta^*$ are the Poincaré dual cohomology classes in $H^1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. To find the intersection number of $[\\alpha]$ and $[\\beta]$, we need to evaluate the cup product of their Poincaré duals on the fundamental class $[M] \\in H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$:\n\n$$\\langle \\alpha^* \\smile \\beta^*, [M] \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha^*, \\beta^* \\rangle.$$\n\nNow, since $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ generate $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, they form a basis for the first homology group. In particular, they can be represented as simple closed curves on the surface $M$ that intersect transversely in a single point. This means that their intersection number is $\\pm 1$, depending on the orientation of the intersection.\n\nThus, the intersection number of the homology classes $[\\alpha]$ and $[\\beta]$ is $\\langle \\alpha^*, \\beta^* \\rangle = \\pm 1$."
