A sample of 50 light bulbs is taken, and their average lifespan is calculated as 770 hours with a standard deviation of 40 hours. Conduct a hypothesis test at a significance level of 0.05 to determine whether or not the company's claim is true.",
    "message_2": "To conduct a hypothesis test, we need to set up our null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).\n\nH0: The average lifespan of the light bulbs is 800 hours (μ = 800)\nH1: The average lifespan of the light bulbs is not 800 hours (μ ≠ 800)\n\nWe are given:\n- Sample size (n) = 50\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 770 hours\n- Sample standard deviation (s) = 40 hours\n- Significance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large (n > 30), we can use the z-test to conduct the hypothesis test.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the test statistic (z-score)\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nz = (770 - 800) / (40 / √50)\nz = -30 / (40 / 7.071)\nz = -30 / 5.656\nz ≈ -5.31\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical z-value\nSince we are conducting a two-tailed test (μ ≠ 800), we need to find the critical z-value for α/2 = 0.025.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the critical z-value is approximately ±1.96.\n\nStep 3: Compare the test statistic to the critical z-value\nOur calculated z-score is -5.31, which is less than the critical z-value of -1.96.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision\nSince our test statistic (z = -5.31) falls in the rejection region (z < -1.96), we reject the null hypothesis (H0).\n\nConclusion:\nAt a 0.05 significance level, we have enough evidence to reject the company's claim that their new light bulbs have an average lifespan of 800 hours."
