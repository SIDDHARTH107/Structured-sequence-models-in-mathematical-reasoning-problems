    "message_2": "SHA-256 always produces a fixed-length hash value of 256 bits. To represent this hash value in hexadecimal notation, we need to convert the number of bits to hexadecimal characters. Since each hexadecimal character represents 4 bits (as there are 16 possible values: 0-9 and A-F), we can calculate the length of the resulting hash value in hexadecimal notation as follows:\n\nLength in hexadecimal = (Length in bits) / 4\nLength in hexadecimal = 256 / 4\nLength in hexadecimal = 64\n\nSo, the length of the resulting hash value in hexadecimal notation will be 64 characters."
