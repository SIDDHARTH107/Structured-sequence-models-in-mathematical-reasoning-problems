    "message_1": "Suppose you have two vectors, vector A = 3i - 4j and vector B = 2i + 6j. Find the angle between these two vectors using trigonometry. Round your answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the two vectors, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = (3i - 4j) · (2i + 6j) = 3*2 + (-4)*6 = 6 - 24 = -18\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|A| = √(3^2 + (-4)^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(2^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 36) = √40 = 2√10\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = (-18) / (5 * 2√10) = -18 / (10√10) = -√10 / 10\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the cosine value:\n\nθ = arccos(-√10 / 10)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that θ ≈ 131.81 degrees. Rounding to the nearest degree, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 132 degrees."
