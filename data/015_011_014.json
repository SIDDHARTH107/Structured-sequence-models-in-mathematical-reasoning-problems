    "message_1": "Consider a double pendulum consisting of two rods of length l={0.5,0.5} and masses m={1,1}. Assume the initial angles of the first and second rod with respect to the vertical are 0.1 radians and 0.2 radians, respectively. Determine the number of oscillations (to two decimal places) performed by the double pendulum in a given time interval of 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum is quite complex and cannot be easily solved analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the number of oscillations in a given time interval. One common method is to use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum can be derived using the Lagrangian method, which results in a set of coupled second-order differential equations. These equations are:\n\nθ1'' = (-(g * (2 * m1 + m2) * sin(θ1) - m2 * g * sin(θ1 - 2 * θ2) - 2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) * m2 * (θ2'^2 * l2 + θ1'^2 * l1 * cos(θ1 - θ2))) / (l1 * (2 * m1 + m2 - m2 * cos(2 * θ1 - 2 * θ2))))\n\nθ2'' = ((2 * sin(θ1 - θ2) * (θ1'^2 * l1 * (m1 + m2) + g * (m1 + m2) * cos(θ1) + θ2'^2 * l2 * m2 * cos(θ1 - θ2))) / (l2 * (2 * m1 + m2 - m2 * cos(2 * θ1 - 2 * θ2))))\n\nTo find the number of oscillations in 10 seconds, we can use the Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve these equations with the given initial conditions (θ1 = 0.1, θ2 = 0.2, θ1' = 0, θ2' = 0) and time step (e.g., dt = 0.01 s). We can then count the number of times the first pendulum (θ1) crosses the vertical position (θ1 = 0) in the positive direction.\n\nUsing a numerical solver (e.g., Python with SciPy's odeint function) and the given parameters, we find that the double pendulum performs approximately 1.76 oscillations in the given time interval of 10 seconds."
