    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion for the function $f(z) = \\frac{z}{(z-1)(z-2)}$ valid in the annulus $1 < |z-1| < 2$, we first perform partial fraction decomposition on the function:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z}{(z-1)(z-2)} = \\frac{A}{z-1} + \\frac{B}{z-2}$$\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can multiply both sides by the denominator and set z equal to the singularities:\n\n$$z = 1: A = f(1) = \\frac{1}{(1-1)(1-2)} \\Rightarrow A = -1$$\n$$z = 2: B = f(2) = \\frac{2}{(2-1)(2-2)} \\Rightarrow B = 2$$\n\nNow we have:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{z-1} + \\frac{2}{z-2}$$\n\nSince we are looking for the Laurent series expansion in the annulus $1 < |z-1| < 2$, we can rewrite the function using the substitution $w = z-1$:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{w} + \\frac{2}{w-1}$$\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{w} = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} w^n$$\n\nFor the second term, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{w-1} = \\frac{2}{1 - (1-w)} = 2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-w)^n$$\n\nNow we can combine the two series:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} w^n + 2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-w)^n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute back $z-1$ for $w$:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (z-1)^n + 2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-(z-1))^n$$\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion for the function $f(z)$ valid in the annulus $1 < |z-1| < 2$.\n\nThe radius of convergence for a Laurent series is determined by the distance to the nearest singularity. In this case, the singularities are at $z=1$ and $z=2$. Since the annulus is defined as $1 < |z-1| < 2$, the radius of convergence is 1, which is the distance from the center of the annulus ($z=1$) to the nearest singularity ($z=2$)."
