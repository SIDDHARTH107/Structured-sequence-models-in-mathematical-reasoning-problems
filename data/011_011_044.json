    "message_2": "To divide a set of 10 distinct objects into 3 non-empty subsets, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind. The Stirling number S(n, k) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 10 and k = 3.\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can calculate S(10, 3) using this formula:\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find S(9, 3) and S(9, 2):\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2)\nS(9, 2) = 2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1)\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the values for S(8, 3), S(8, 2), and S(8, 1):\n\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2)\nS(8, 2) = 2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1)\nS(8, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to divide a set into one subset, which is the set itself)\n\nNow, we can find the values for S(7, 3), S(7, 2), and S(7, 1):\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)\nS(7, 2) = 2 * S(6, 2) + S(6, 1)\nS(7, 1) = 1\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the values for S(6, 3), S(6, 2), and S(6, 1):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1)\nS(6, 1) = 1\n\nFinally, we can find the values for S(5, 3), S(5, 2), and S(5, 1):\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\nS(5, 1) = 1\n\nNow, we can find the values for S(4, 3), S(4, 2), and S(4, 1):\n\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 1) = 1\n\nUsing these values, we can now calculate S(5, 3) and S(5, 2):\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nNow, we can calculate S(6, 3) and S(6, 2):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\nS(6, 2) = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\n\nNow, we can calculate S(7, 3) and S(7, 2):\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * 90 + 31 = 301\nS(7, 2) = 2 * 31 + 1 = 63\n\nNow, we can calculate S(8, 3) and S(8, 2):\n\nS(8, 3) = 3 * 301 + 63 = 966\nS(8, 2) = 2 * 63 + 1 = 127\n\nNow, we can calculate S(9, 3) and S(9, 2):\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * 966 + 127 = 3025\nS(9, 2) = 2 * 127 + 1 = 255\n\nFinally, we can calculate S(10, 3):\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * 3025 + 255 = 9330\n\nSo, there are 9,330 ways to divide a set of 10 distinct objects into 3 non-empty subsets."
