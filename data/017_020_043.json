    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we need to consider the possible structures of groups of order 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 40.\n\nLet G be a group of order 40. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 8. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possible value for n_2 is 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of groups of order 40:\n\n1. If n_5 = 1 and n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup Q. In this case, G is the direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to C_5 × C_8 or C_5 × (C_4 × C_2). These are two non-isomorphic groups.\n\n2. If n_5 = 8 and n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup Q, but there are 8 Sylow 5-subgroups. In this case, G is a semi-direct product of a Sylow 5-subgroup P and Q. There are two possible actions of Q on P, which correspond to the two non-isomorphic groups C_5 ⋊ C_8 and C_5 ⋊ (C_4 × C_2).\n\nSo, there are a total of 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 40:\n\n1. C_5 × C_8\n2. C_5 × (C_4 × C_2)\n3. C_5 ⋊ C_8\n4. C_5 ⋊ (C_4 × C_2)"
