    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 13y = 985, we first find a particular solution (x0, y0) and then use the general solution formula for linear Diophantine equations.\n\n1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 13 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n13 = 7 * 1 + 6\n7 = 6 * 1 + 1\n6 = 1 * 6\n\nThe GCD is 1, which divides 985, so there are solutions to this equation.\n\n2. Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution:\n\n1 = 7 - 6\n1 = 7 - (13 - 7)\n1 = 2 * 7 - 13\n\nSo, a particular solution is (x0, y0) = (2, -1).\n\n3. Use the general solution formula for linear Diophantine equations:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere a = 7, b = 13, d = GCD(7, 13) = 1, and n is an integer.\n\nx = 2 + 13n\ny = -1 - 7n\n\nNow, we find the integer values of n that give valid pairs of integers (x, y) within a reasonable range. Since the equation is 7x + 13y = 985, we can estimate the range of n by dividing 985 by 13 and 7:\n\nLower bound: 985 / 13 ≈ 75\nUpper bound: 985 / 7 ≈ 140\n\nWe can now test values of n within this range to find valid pairs (x, y):\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (2, -1) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 1: (x, y) = (15, -8) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 2: (x, y) = (28, -15) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 3: (x, y) = (41, -22) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 4: (x, y) = (54, -29) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 5: (x, y) = (67, -36) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 6: (x, y) = (80, -43) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 7: (x, y) = (93, -50) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 8: (x, y) = (106, -57) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 9: (x, y) = (119, -64) [Not valid, as y is negative]\nn = 10: (x, y) = (132, -71) [Not valid, as y is negative]\n\nSince we have reached the upper bound and all y values are negative, there are no valid pairs of integers (x, y) that satisfy the Diophantine equation 7x + 13y = 985."
