Similarly, C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set A:\n\n- For every element x in set A, x is also an element of A ∪ B.\n- 2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 8 ∈ A and 8 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 10 ∈ A and 10 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of set A is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set B:\n\n- For every element x in set B, x is also an element of A ∪ B.\n- 1 ∈ B and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 7 ∈ B and 7 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 9 ∈ B and 9 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of set B is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that the resulting set A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B."
