    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we will use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's start by solving the third equation for x:\n\nx = -1 + 3i - 3z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the first and second equations:\n\n(-1 + 3i - 3z) + 2y + 3z = 7\n2(-1 + 3i - 3z) + (2+3i)y + 5z = 2+5i\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n-1 + 3i - 3z + 2y + 3z = 7\n-2 + 6i - 6z + (2+3i)y + 5z = 2+5i\n\n-1 + 3i + 2y = 7\n-2 + 6i - z + (2+3i)y = 2+5i\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation for y:\n\n2y = 8 - 3i\ny = 4 - (3/2)i\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n-2 + 6i - z + (2+3i)(4 - (3/2)i) = 2+5i\n\nDistribute the (2+3i) term:\n\n-2 + 6i - z + 8 + 6i - 3i^2 - 3(3/2)i = 2+5i\n\nSince i^2 = -1, simplify the equation:\n\n-2 + 6i - z + 8 + 6i + 3 - 9i = 2+5i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9 + 3i - z = 2+5i\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz = 7 - 2i\n\nFinally, we have the solutions for x, y, and z:\n\nx = -1 + 3i - 3z = -1 + 3i - 3(7 - 2i) = -1 + 3i - 21 + 6i = -22 + 9i\ny = 4 - (3/2)i\nz = 7 - 2i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -22 + 9i\ny = 4 - (3/2)i\nz = 7 - 2i"
