    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 5) - log(x - 1) = log 2 for x, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog((x + 5)/(x - 1)) = log 2\n\nNow, since the logarithms on both sides of the equation have the same base (which is 10 by default), we can set the arguments equal to each other:\n\n(x + 5)/(x - 1) = 2\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 5 = 2(x - 1)\n\nx + 5 = 2x - 2\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides:\n\n5 = x - 2\n\nFinally, add 2 to both sides:\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the solution to the equation log(x + 5) - log(x - 1) = log 2 for x is x = 7."
