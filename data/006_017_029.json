    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to the subtopic \"Probability of a certain type of traffic accident occurring on a road\": \n\nA busy intersection has an average of 20 accidents per month. Among these accidents, 60% are rear-end collisions. What is the probability that the next accident at the intersection will be a rear-end collision?",
    "message_2": "The probability that the next accident at the intersection will be a rear-end collision is 60%. This is because the historical data shows that 60% of the accidents at this intersection are rear-end collisions, and we can assume that this trend will continue in the future."
