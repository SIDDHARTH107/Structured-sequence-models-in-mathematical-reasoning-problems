    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. The Turing machine has a single tape.\n2. The input has at most 100 symbols.\n3. The machine never moves its head more than 100 squares from the center square to the left or right.\n\nSince the Turing machine never moves its head more than 100 squares from the center square to the left or right, it can access at most 201 squares (100 squares to the left, the center square, and 100 squares to the right).\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of steps the Turing machine can take to halt. In each step, the machine can do the following:\n\n1. Read the symbol at the current position.\n2. Write a new symbol at the current position.\n3. Move the head one square to the left or right.\n\nSince the Turing machine has a finite number of states and a finite number of symbols, there is a finite number of possible configurations for the machine. The number of configurations is the product of the number of states, the number of symbols, and the number of tape positions. Let's denote the number of states as S and the number of symbols as K. Then, the number of configurations is:\n\nC = S * K * 201\n\nNow, if the Turing machine takes more than C steps, it must enter the same configuration twice due to the pigeonhole principle. This means that the machine would enter an infinite loop and never halt.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of steps a Turing machine with a single tape can take to halt on input of at most 100 symbols, without moving its head more than 100 squares from the center square to the left or right, is equal to the number of configurations, which is:\n\nC = S * K * 201\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact number of states (S) and symbols (K) for the Turing machine, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the maximum number of steps."
