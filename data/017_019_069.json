    "message_2": "A group table of a non-abelian group of order 36 has 36 elements. The single-digit perfect squares are 1, 4, and 9. In a group table, the identity element (usually denoted as e) is always present, which corresponds to the perfect square 1. However, the presence of other perfect squares depends on the specific non-abelian group of order 36.\n\nIn general, it is not possible to determine the exact number of single-digit perfect squares in the group table of a non-abelian group of order 36 without more information about the group."
