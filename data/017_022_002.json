    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nStep 1: Sylow subgroups\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p dividing the order of G is congruent to 1 mod p and divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nThe prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. Thus, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\n- n_2 (number of Sylow 2-subgroups) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Possible values: 1, 3, 5, 15.\n- n_3 divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Possible values: 1, 10.\n- n_5 divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Possible values: 1, 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing possibilities\nWe will now analyze the possible structures of G based on the number of Sylow subgroups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2, P_3, and P_5 of orders 4, 3, and 5, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since their orders are pairwise coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 60. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60. In this case, G is isomorphic to C60.\n\nCase 2: n_2 > 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_3 and P_5 of orders 3 and 5, respectively, which are normal in G. Let H = P_3 × P_5, which is a normal subgroup of G of order 15. Since G/H has order 4, G has a normal subgroup of order 4, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup. This contradicts the assumption that n_2 > 1, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 > 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2 and P_5 of orders 4 and 5, respectively, which are normal in G. Let H = P_2 × P_5, which is a normal subgroup of G of order 20. Since G/H has order 3, G has a normal subgroup of order 3, which is a Sylow 3-subgroup. This contradicts the assumption that n_3 > 1, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 > 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2 and P_3 of orders 4 and 3, respectively, which are normal in G. Let H = P_2 × P_3, which is a normal subgroup of G of order 12. Since G/H has order 5, G has a normal subgroup of order 5, which is a Sylow 5-subgroup. This contradicts the assumption that n_5 > 1, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 5: n_2 > 1, n_3 > 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5, which is normal in G. The factor group G/P_5 has order 12, and by the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is either isomorphic to C12 or C6 × C2. If G/P_5 is isomorphic to C12, then G has a normal subgroup of order 12, which is a contradiction since n_3 > 1. Therefore, G/P_5 must be isomorphic to C6 × C2. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_5 and a group of order 12, which is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nCase 6: n_2 > 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 > 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. The factor group G/P_3 has order 20, and by the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is either isomorphic to C20 or C10 × C2. If G/P_3 is isomorphic to C20, then G has a normal subgroup of order 20, which is a contradiction since n_5 > 1. Therefore, G/P_3 must be isomorphic to C10 × C2. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_3 and a group of order 20, which is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nCase 7: n_2 > 1, n_3 > 1, n_5 > 1\nIn this case, none of the Sylow subgroups are normal in G. However, we know that the product of two Sylow subgroups has order 60, so G must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the possible structures of G, we can conclude that G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2 (which is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60), or one of the other 31 non-abelian groups of order 60."
