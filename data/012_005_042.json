    "message_2": "To find the diameter of a graph G, we need to determine the longest shortest path between any pair of vertices in the graph. Since we are not given the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot provide an exact diameter for this graph. However, we can provide an upper bound on the diameter.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph could be a tree (i.e., a connected graph with no cycles). In this case, the diameter would be the longest path in the tree. A tree with 8 vertices has 7 edges, so our graph has 3 additional edges. Adding these edges will only decrease the diameter, as they create shortcuts between vertices.\n\nLet's consider a tree with 8 vertices and a diameter of 5. It could look like this:\n\n```\n    1\n     \\\n      2\n     / \\\n    3   4\n         \\\n          5\n         / \\\n        6   7\n             \\\n              8\n```\n\nIn this tree, the longest shortest path is between vertices 1 and 8, with a distance of 5. Now, let's add 3 additional edges to this tree to make it a graph with 10 edges. We can add edges between vertices 3 and 5, 3 and 6, and 6 and 8. The resulting graph looks like this:\n\n```\n    1\n     \\\n      2\n     / \\\n    3---4\n     \\   \\\n      5   5\n       \\ / \\\n        6---7\n             \\\n              8\n```\n\nIn this graph, the longest shortest path is between vertices 1 and 8, with a distance of 4. Therefore, the diameter of the graph G is at most 4. However, without knowing the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine the exact diameter."
