    "message_2": "To compute the number of rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, we will use the following approach:\n\n1. Loop through all possible $x$ values in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, i.e., from $0$ to $10$.\n2. For each $x$ value, compute the right-hand side of the equation, i.e., $x^3 + 5x + 7$.\n3. Check if the result is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, i.e., if there exists a $y$ such that $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + 5x + 7 \\pmod{11}$.\n4. If it is a quadratic residue, add 2 to the count of rational points (since there will be two $y$ values corresponding to each $x$ value).\n5. Finally, add 1 to the count for the point at infinity.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps:\n\n1. Loop through $x = 0$ to $10$.\n\n2. Compute the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n- For $x = 0$: $0^3 + 5\\cdot0 + 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 1$: $1^3 + 5\\cdot1 + 7 \\equiv 13 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 2$: $2^3 + 5\\cdot2 + 7 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 3$: $3^3 + 5\\cdot3 + 7 \\equiv 61 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 4$: $4^3 + 5\\cdot4 + 7 \\equiv 103 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 5$: $5^3 + 5\\cdot5 + 7 \\equiv 157 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 6$: $6^3 + 5\\cdot6 + 7 \\equiv 223 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 7$: $7^3 + 5\\cdot7 + 7 \\equiv 301 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 8$: $8^3 + 5\\cdot8 + 7 \\equiv 391 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 9$: $9^3 + 5\\cdot9 + 7 \\equiv 493 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n- For $x = 10$: $10^3 + 5\\cdot10 + 7 \\equiv 607 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$\n\n3. Check if the results are quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$:\n\n- Quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ are: $0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9$.\n- The results that are quadratic residues are: $0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9$.\n\n4. Add 2 to the count of rational points for each quadratic residue:\n\n- There are 6 quadratic residues, so we have $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ rational points.\n\n5. Add 1 for the point at infinity:\n\n- Total number of rational points: $12 + 1 = 13$.\n\nSo, there are 13 rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, including the point at infinity."
