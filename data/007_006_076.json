    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 72 and 96 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (96) by the smaller number (72) and find the remainder.\n   96 รท 72 = 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (72) and the smaller number with the remainder (24) from the previous step.\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 72 and 24.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (72) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   72 รท 24 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the smaller number (24) in the last step.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 96 is 24."
