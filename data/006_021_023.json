    "message_2": "Based on the historical data provided, the probability of a hurricane occurring in Miami in the month of August is 25%. This is because hurricanes have occurred in August in 25 out of the past 100 years. To express this as a probability, we can write it as:\n\nP(hurricane in August) = (Number of years with a hurricane in August) / (Total number of years in the data)\nP(hurricane in August) = 25 / 100\nP(hurricane in August) = 0.25\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring in Miami this August is 0.25 or 25%."
