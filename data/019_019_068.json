    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of steps and the number being printed on the tape. Since we only have information about the number 5, we can't directly determine the exact relationship. However, we can make an assumption and see if it works.\n\nLet's assume that the number of steps is directly proportional to the number being printed. In this case, we can set up a proportion:\n\n7 steps / 5 = x steps / 11\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (7 * 11) / 5\nx = 77 / 5\nx = 15.4\n\nSince the number of steps must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 16 steps. However, this is just an assumption, and without more information about the Turing machine and its specific algorithm, we cannot be certain that this is the correct answer."
