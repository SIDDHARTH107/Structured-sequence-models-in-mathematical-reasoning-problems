    "message_1": "A student flips a fair coin 10 times. What is the probability that the first 5 flips are all heads and the last 5 flips are all tails?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of this specific sequence of coin flips, we can multiply the probabilities of each individual flip. Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails is also 1/2.\n\nFor the first 5 flips to be all heads, the probability is (1/2)^5. For the last 5 flips to be all tails, the probability is also (1/2)^5.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening together, we multiply the probabilities:\n\n(1/2)^5 * (1/2)^5 = (1/2)^10 = 1/1024\n\nSo the probability of the first 5 flips being all heads and the last 5 flips being all tails is 1/1024."
