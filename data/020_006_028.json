    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of chairs, A and B. Each chair of type A requires 2 units of wood and 1 unit of cloth to produce, while each chair of type B requires 3 units of wood and 2 units of cloth. The company has 15 units of wood and 10 units of cloth available in their inventory. The company wants to maximize their profit by selling the chairs. The profit per chair for type A is $40, and for type B it is $60. However, the company's production capacity is limited to producing no more than 6 chairs of type A and 4 chairs of type B. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn, and how many chairs of each type should they produce to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs of type A and y be the number of chairs of type B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 15 (wood constraint)\n2. x + 2y ≤ 10 (cloth constraint)\n3. x ≤ 6 (production capacity of type A)\n4. y ≤ 4 (production capacity of type B)\n5. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P = 40x + 60y.\n\nWe can start by solving the constraints to find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ (15 - 2x) / 3\n2. y ≤ (10 - x) / 2\n3. x ≤ 6\n4. y ≤ 4\n\nNow we can find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\nVertex 1: (x, y) = (0, 0)\nVertex 2: (x, y) = (0, 4)\nVertex 3: (x, y) = (6, 0)\nVertex 4: (x, y) = (6, 2)\nVertex 5: (x, y) = (3, 3)\n\nNow we can evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 40(0) + 60(0) = $0\nP(0, 4) = 40(0) + 60(4) = $240\nP(6, 0) = 40(6) + 60(0) = $240\nP(6, 2) = 40(6) + 60(2) = $360\nP(3, 3) = 40(3) + 60(3) = $300\n\nThe maximum profit is $360, which is achieved by producing 6 chairs of type A and 2 chairs of type B."
