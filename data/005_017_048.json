    "message_1": "Suppose a dataset of 100 students for a mathematics test contains 5 parameters namely: marks obtained in algebra, geometry, statistics, calculus, and trigonometry. Find the first two principal components for this dataset using principal component analysis.",
    "message_2": "To find the first two principal components for this dataset using principal component analysis (PCA), follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the dataset: Since the marks obtained in different subjects may have different scales, it's important to standardize the dataset. This means transforming the data so that each parameter has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix is a square matrix that shows the covariance between each pair of parameters. It helps to understand how the parameters are related to each other.\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are essential in PCA because they help to identify the principal components. The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is the first principal component, and the eigenvector with the second-highest eigenvalue is the second principal component.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order: This step helps to identify the most significant principal components.\n\n5. Select the first two eigenvectors: These two eigenvectors represent the first two principal components of the dataset.\n\nNote that without the actual dataset, it's impossible to provide the exact principal components. However, these steps outline the process to find the first two principal components using PCA."
