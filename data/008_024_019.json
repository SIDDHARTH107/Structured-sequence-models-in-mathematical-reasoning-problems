    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n(2)(2x + 3y) = (2)(8)\n4x + 6y = 16\n\nSince the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, these two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and they all lie on the line represented by the equation 2x + 3y = 8.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for y in terms of x (or vice versa):\n\n3y = -2x + 8\ny = (-2/3)x + (8/3)\n\nSo the solution set is all pairs of (x, y) that satisfy the equation y = (-2/3)x + (8/3)."
