    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 24, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of 2-Sylow subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is one 2-Sylow subgroup, which must be of order 8. This subgroup is normal since it is unique.\n\nNow, let's find the number of 3-Sylow subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are 1 and 4. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be of order 3 and normal. In this case, the group would be a direct product of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups, which would be abelian, contradicting our assumption that the group is non-abelian. Therefore, there must be four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 24. Since the 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, we can form the semidirect product of the 2-Sylow subgroup with a 3-Sylow subgroup. Let P be the 2-Sylow subgroup and Q be a 3-Sylow subgroup. The semidirect product is determined by a homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P). Since Q has order 3, φ(Q) must be a subgroup of Aut(P) of order 3.\n\nThe 2-Sylow subgroup P is of order 8, so it is either isomorphic to Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8) or D_4 (dihedral group of order 8). If P is isomorphic to Z_8, then Aut(P) is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2, which has no subgroups of order 3, so this case is not possible. If P is isomorphic to D_4, then Aut(P) is isomorphic to D_4 as well, which has a unique subgroup of order 3 (generated by a 120-degree rotation). Thus, there is only one non-trivial homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P), and this determines the semidirect product.\n\nTherefore, there is only one non-abelian group of order 24 up to isomorphism, which is the semidirect product of a 2-Sylow subgroup isomorphic to D_4 and a 3-Sylow subgroup isomorphic to Z_3. This group is sometimes denoted as D_4 ⋊ Z_3 or D_12, the dihedral group of order 12 (with a notation that considers the order of the group to be 2n, where n is the number of sides of the polygon the group acts on)."
