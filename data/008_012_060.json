    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the inverse matrix method, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\n[2  3] [x]   [7]\n[5 -4] [y]   [1]\n\nHere, A = [2  3]\n           [5 -4]\n\nB = [7]\n      [1]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of matrix A and adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -4) - (3 * 5)\n          = -8 - 15\n          = -23\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of matrix A:\n\nadj(A) = [-4 -3]\n              [-5  2]\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-23) * [-4 -3]\n                            [-5  2]\n\nA^(-1) = [ 4/23  3/23]\n              [ 5/23 -2/23]\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n[x]   [ 4/23  3/23] [7]\n[y] = [ 5/23 -2/23] [1]\n\n[x]   [ 4/23 * 7 + 3/23 * 1]\n[y] = [ 5/23 * 7 - 2/23 * 1]\n\n[x]   [ 28/23 + 3/23]\n[y] = [ 35/23 - 2/23]\n\n[x]   [ 31/23]\n[y] = [ 33/23]\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy the given system of linear equations are:\n\nx = 31/23\ny = 33/23"
