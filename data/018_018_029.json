    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the differences of the two sets.\n\nA Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nFor the given sets A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {4,5,6,7,8}, we can find the symmetric difference as follows:\n\nA - B = {1,2,3}\nB - A = {6,7,8}\n\nNow, we can find the union of these two sets:\n\nA Δ B = {1,2,3} ∪ {6,7,8} = {1,2,3,6,7,8}\n\nNow, let's verify if the symmetric difference is commutative. According to the commutative property, A Δ B should be equal to B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {6,7,8} ∪ {1,2,3} = {1,2,3,6,7,8}\n\nSince A Δ B = B Δ A, the symmetric difference is commutative."
