    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection between the two algebraic varieties $V_1$ and $V_2$, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_0x_1 + x_2x_3 = 0 \\\\\nx_0x_2 + x_1x_3 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet's consider the following cases:\n\n1. If $x_0 = 0$ and $x_1 = 0$, then the first equation is satisfied. The second equation becomes $x_2x_3 = 0$. In this case, we have two points of intersection: $(0:0:1:0)$ and $(0:0:0:1)$.\n\n2. If $x_0 = 0$ and $x_2 = 0$, then the second equation is satisfied. The first equation becomes $x_1x_3 = 0$. In this case, we have two points of intersection: $(0:1:0:0)$ and $(0:0:1:0)$.\n\n3. If $x_1 = 0$ and $x_3 = 0$, then the first equation is satisfied. The second equation becomes $x_0x_2 = 0$. In this case, we have two points of intersection: $(1:0:0:0)$ and $(0:1:0:0)$.\n\n4. If $x_0 \\neq 0$ and $x_1 \\neq 0$, we can divide the first equation by $x_0x_1$ and the second equation by $x_0x_2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{x_3}{x_2} = 0 \\\\\n1 + \\frac{x_3}{x_1} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $x_3 = -x_1$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x_1} - \\frac{1}{x_2} = 0 \\Rightarrow x_1 = x_2\n$$\n\nSo, in this case, we have one point of intersection: $(1:1:-1:1)$.\n\nIn total, we have found 7 points of intersection between the two algebraic varieties $V_1$ and $V_2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$."
