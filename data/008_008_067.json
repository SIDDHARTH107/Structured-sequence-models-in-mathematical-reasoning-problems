    "message_1": "A farmer has 200 acres of land to grow two crops, wheat and corn. It takes 1 acre to produce 100 bushels of wheat and 1 acre to produce 200 bushels of corn. The farmer has a market for 25,000 bushels of wheat and 30,000 bushels of corn. If the farmer sells each batch of wheat for 2 dollars and each batch of corn for 1 dollar, how many acres of each crop should be planted to maximize the farmer's profit? Use matrix methods to solve.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total acres constraint)\n2. 100x ≥ 25,000 (wheat demand constraint)\n3. 200y ≥ 30,000 (corn demand constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 2(100x) + 1(200y) = 200x + 200y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ 200 - x\n\n2. 100x ≥ 25,000\n   x ≥ 250\n\n3. 200y ≥ 30,000\n   y ≥ 150\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative, the feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\n\nx ≥ 250\ny ≥ 150\ny ≤ 200 - x\n\nNow, we will use matrix methods to find the vertices of the feasible region. We will solve the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. x = 250, y = 200 - x\n2. y = 150, x = 250\n3. y = 150, y = 200 - x\n\nSolving these systems of equations:\n\n1. x = 250, y = 200 - 250\n   x = 250, y = -50 (not feasible since y must be non-negative)\n\n2. y = 150, x = 250\n   x = 250, y = 150 (feasible)\n\n3. y = 150, y = 200 - x\n   150 = 200 - x\n   x = 50 (feasible)\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (250, 150) and (50, 150).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at these vertices:\n\nP(250, 150) = 200(250) + 200(150) = 50,000 + 30,000 = 80,000\nP(50, 150) = 200(50) + 200(150) = 10,000 + 30,000 = 40,000\n\nThe maximum profit is 80,000 dollars, which occurs when the farmer plants 250 acres of wheat and 150 acres of corn."
