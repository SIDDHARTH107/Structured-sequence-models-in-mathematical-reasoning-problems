    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cone, we need to find the sum of the base area and the lateral area.\n\nThe base area (A_base) of a cone can be found using the formula for the area of a circle:\nA_base = πr^2\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nThe lateral area (A_lateral) of a cone can be found using the formula:\nA_lateral = πrs\nwhere r is the radius of the base and s is the slant height.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the slant height (s) is 13 cm, we can find the base area and lateral area:\n\nA_base = π(5^2) = 25π cm^2\n\nA_lateral = π(5)(13) = 65π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π + 65π\nA_total = 90π cm^2\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is 90π cm^2."
