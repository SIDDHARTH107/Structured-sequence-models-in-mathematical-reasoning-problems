    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nIn a certain population, 30% of individuals are smokers and 20% of smokers have lung cancer. If 10% of non-smokers also have lung cancer, what is the probability that an individual selected at random from this population has lung cancer?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the law of total probability to solve this problem. We have two events: S (smoker) and L (lung cancer). We want to find P(L), the probability that an individual has lung cancer.\n\nP(L) = P(L|S) * P(S) + P(L|S') * P(S')\n\nHere, P(L|S) is the probability of having lung cancer given that the individual is a smoker, P(S) is the probability of being a smoker, P(L|S') is the probability of having lung cancer given that the individual is a non-smoker, and P(S') is the probability of being a non-smoker.\n\nWe are given:\nP(S) = 0.3 (30% are smokers)\nP(L|S) = 0.2 (20% of smokers have lung cancer)\nP(L|S') = 0.1 (10% of non-smokers have lung cancer)\n\nTo find P(S'), we can use the fact that P(S) + P(S') = 1, since an individual is either a smoker or a non-smoker:\nP(S') = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula for P(L):\n\nP(L) = P(L|S) * P(S) + P(L|S') * P(S')\nP(L) = (0.2 * 0.3) + (0.1 * 0.7)\nP(L) = 0.06 + 0.07\nP(L) = 0.13\n\nSo the probability that an individual selected at random from this population has lung cancer is 13%."
