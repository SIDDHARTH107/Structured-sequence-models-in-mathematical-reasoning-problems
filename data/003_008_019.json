    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(included angle)\n\nHere, the base is 10 cm, the height is 8 cm, and the included angle is 60°.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n60° * (π/180) = (1/3)π radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 8 * sin((1/3)π)\n\nArea = 5 * 8 * (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nArea = 40 * (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nArea = 20 * sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 20√3 square centimeters."
