    "message_2": "To find the expected number of houses that will experience a burglary in a month, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of burglaries = Total number of houses × Probability of a burglary\n\nIn this case, there are 500 houses in the neighborhood and the probability of a burglary occurring in a given month is 0.18. So, we can calculate the expected number of burglaries as follows:\n\nExpected number of burglaries = 500 × 0.18 = 90\n\nTherefore, the expected number of houses that will experience a burglary in a month is 90."
