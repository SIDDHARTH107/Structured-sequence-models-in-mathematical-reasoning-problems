    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = sin(3x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, our outer function is sin(u) and our inner function is u = 3x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(sin(u))/du = cos(u)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = d(sin(u))/du * d(3x)/dx = cos(u) * 3\n\nSince u = 3x, we can substitute it back in:\ndy/dx = 3cos(3x)\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at x = π/6:\ndy/dx = 3cos(3(π/6)) = 3cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the derivative at x = π/6 is:\ndy/dx = 3 * 0 = 0"
