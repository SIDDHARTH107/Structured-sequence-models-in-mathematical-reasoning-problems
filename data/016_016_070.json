    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using an iterative process. The total length of the Gosper curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the initial length is 1 (assuming unit length for each segment), and the multiplier is 7^(1/2), as each iteration replaces a segment with a new set of segments that are 1/âˆš7 times the length of the original segment.\n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve of order 5, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (7^(1/2))^5\nLength = 1 * 7^(5/2)\nLength = 7^(5/2)\n\nThe total length of the Gosper curve of order 5 is 7^(5/2) units."
