    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) consisting of four affine transformations. The scale factors (magnification) for each transformation are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1: 0.0 (the stem)\n2. Transformation 2: 0.85 (the largest leaflets)\n3. Transformation 3: 0.2 (the second largest leaflets)\n4. Transformation 4: 0.2 (the second largest leaflets, mirrored)\n\nSince the first largest fractal has a scale factor of 0.5, we can assume that the given scale factor is for Transformation 2. To find the scale factor for the second largest fractal (Transformation 3 and 4), we can set up a proportion:\n\n0.85 / 0.5 = x / 0.2\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (0.2 * 0.5) / 0.85\nx â‰ˆ 0.1176\n\nSo, the scale factor (magnification) of the second largest fractal in the self-similarity of the Barnsley fern is approximately 0.1176."
