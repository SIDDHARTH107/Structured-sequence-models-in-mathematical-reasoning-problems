    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition, we can multiply the total population by the probability of having the condition.\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Total population × Probability of having the condition\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 10,000 × 0.3\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 3,000\n\nSo, the expected number of people who have the condition in the population is 3,000."
