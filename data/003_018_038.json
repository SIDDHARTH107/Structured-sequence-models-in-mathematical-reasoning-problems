    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4cos(2x), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function, say g(h(x)), then the derivative of g with respect to x is the derivative of g with respect to h(x) times the derivative of h(x) with respect to x, or (g(h(x)))' = g'(h(x)) * h'(x).\n\nIn this case, our function f(x) = 4cos(2x) can be thought of as a composite function g(h(x)) where g(u) = 4cos(u) and h(x) = 2x.\n\nFirst, we'll find the derivatives of g(u) and h(x) with respect to u and x, respectively:\n\ng'(u) = -4sin(u)\nh'(x) = 2\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\nf'(x) = -4sin(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = -4sin(2(π/4)) * 2\nf'(π/4) = -4sin(π/2) * 2\nf'(π/4) = -4 * 1 * 2\nf'(π/4) = -8\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -8."
