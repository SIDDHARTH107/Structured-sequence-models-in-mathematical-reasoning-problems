    "message_2": "To find the next number in the sequence, let's first try to identify a pattern. We can do this by looking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n10 - 5 = 5\n17 - 10 = 7\n26 - 17 = 9\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time (3, 5, 7, 9, ...). This suggests that the sequence is generated by adding consecutive odd numbers to the previous term.\n\nSince the last difference was 9, the next difference should be 9 + 2 = 11. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 26 + 11 = 37.\n\nUsing inductive logic, we can hypothesize that the sequence is generated by adding consecutive odd numbers to the previous term. Based on this pattern, the next number in the sequence should be 37."
