    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x-3) + log2(x+2) = 3, we can first use the logarithm product rule, which states that logb(m) + logb(n) = logb(mn). Applying this rule, we get:\n\nlog2((x-3)(x+2)) = 3\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = (x-3)(x+2)\n\n8 = x^2 - x - 6\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - x - 14 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation can be factored as:\n\n(x-4)(x+2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If we plug x = 4 into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog2(4-3) + log2(4+2) = log2(1) + log2(6) = 0 + 2.585 = 2.585\n\nThis does not equal 3, so x = 4 is not a valid solution.\n\nIf we plug x = -2 into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog2(-2-3) + log2(-2+2) = log2(-5) + log2(0)\n\nSince logarithms are not defined for negative numbers or zero, x = -2 is also not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid solution for x in the given equation."
