    "message_2": "There seems to be a small mistake in the problem statement. There are 10 years in a decade, not 30. Assuming the problem meant to ask for the probability of at least 3 severe storms in March during a decade, we can proceed as follows:\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x! * (n - x)!)) * (p^x) * (1 - p)^(n - x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes in n trials, p is the probability of success in a single trial, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (number of years in a decade), p = 0.2 (probability of a severe storm in March), and we want to find the probability of at least 3 severe storms, which means x = 3, 4, 5, ..., 10.\n\nTo find the probability of at least 3 severe storms, we can find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 severe storms and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) - P(2)\n\nNow, we can calculate P(0), P(1), and P(2) using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(0) = (10! / (0! * 10!)) * (0.2^0) * (0.8^10) ≈ 0.1074\nP(1) = (10! / (1! * 9!)) * (0.2^1) * (0.8^9) ≈ 0.2684\nP(2) = (10! / (2! * 8!)) * (0.2^2) * (0.8^8) ≈ 0.3019\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 3 severe storms:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - 0.1074 - 0.2684 - 0.3019 ≈ 1 - 0.6777 ≈ 0.3223\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 3 severe storms in March during one decade is approximately 0.3223 or 32.23%."
