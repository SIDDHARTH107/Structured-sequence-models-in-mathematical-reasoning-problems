In this graph, all vertices have degree 4, which is even. Therefore, this graph has an Eulerian circuit. One possible Eulerian circuit is:\n\nA - B - C - F - E - D - A - E - B - F - C - E\n\nA Hamiltonian circuit is a closed walk that visits every vertex exactly once. This graph does have a Hamiltonian circuit. One possible Hamiltonian circuit is:\n\nA - B - C - F - E - D - A"
