    "message_2": "To find the degree of membership of the number 5 in the fuzzy set A, we will use the triangular membership function with the given parameters a=5, b=7, and c=9. The triangular membership function is defined as:\n\nμ(x) = (x - a) / (b - a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\nμ(x) = (c - x) / (c - b) for b ≤ x ≤ c\nμ(x) = 0 otherwise\n\nSince 5 is between a and b (5 ≤ x ≤ 7), we will use the first part of the function:\n\nμ(5) = (5 - 5) / (7 - 5)\nμ(5) = 0 / 2\nμ(5) = 0\n\nTherefore, the degree of membership of the number 5 in the fuzzy set A is 0."
