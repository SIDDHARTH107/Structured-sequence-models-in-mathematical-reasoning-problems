Using an initial population size of 50, a maximum generation of 500, and a step size of 0.01, what is the optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x)?",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - x + 1 using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of 50 nests (solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the function f(x).\n3. For each generation (up to 500 generations):\n   a. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution by taking a step of size 0.01 in a random direction.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. If the new solution is better (has a lower f(x) value), replace the old nest with the new solution.\n   d. Randomly choose a fraction of the worst nests and replace them with new random solutions.\n4. After 500 generations, the nest with the best fitness (lowest f(x) value) will be the optimal solution.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the cuckoo search algorithm directly. Instead, I can provide an alternative approach to find the optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 - x + 1.\n\nWe can find the minimum value of the function by taking the derivative of f(x) and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 1\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n0 = 2x - 1\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 1/2\n\nSo, the optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 - x + 1 is x = 1/2."
