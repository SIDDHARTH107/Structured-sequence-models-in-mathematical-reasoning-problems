    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and frequency of the signal f(t) = 2sin(3t) + 4cos(6t), we can analyze the given function. The function is already in the sum of sinusoids form, which means it is already in the time domain representation of the Fourier series.\n\nThe given function has two components:\n\n1. A sine wave with amplitude A1 = 2 and angular frequency ω1 = 3 rad/s.\n2. A cosine wave with amplitude A2 = 4 and angular frequency ω2 = 6 rad/s.\n\nTo find the frequency in Hz, we can use the formula:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nFor the sine wave component:\n\nf1 = ω1 / (2π) = 3 / (2π) ≈ 0.477 Hz\n\nFor the cosine wave component:\n\nf2 = ω2 / (2π) = 6 / (2π) ≈ 0.955 Hz\n\nSo, the signal has two components:\n\n1. A sine wave with amplitude 2 and frequency 0.477 Hz.\n2. A cosine wave with amplitude 4 and frequency 0.955 Hz."
