    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 8 cm and a diameter of 6 cm. What is the surface area of this cylinder? (Give the answer in terms of π)",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the diameter of the cylinder is 6 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 3 cm. The height (h) of the cylinder is 8 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(3 cm)² + 2π(3 cm)(8 cm)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(9 cm²) + 2π(3 cm)(8 cm)\n\nSurface Area = 18π cm² + 48π cm²\n\nSurface Area = 66π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder is 66π cm²."
