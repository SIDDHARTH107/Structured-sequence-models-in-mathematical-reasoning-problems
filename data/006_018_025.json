    "message_1": "The probability that a certain type of financial fraud occurs in a company is 0.05. If there are 500 employees in the company, what is the probability that at least 20 employees are involved in the fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, employees involved in fraud) out of n trials (employees)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an employee being involved in fraud, which is 0.05)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of employees, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of employees involved in fraud)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 20 employees are involved in the fraud, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for 20, 21, 22, ..., 500 employees involved in the fraud. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)]\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 19, and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1 to find the probability that at least 20 employees are involved in the fraud.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) â‰ˆ 1 - 0.358 = 0.642\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 employees are involved in the fraud is approximately 0.642 or 64.2%."
