    "message_1": "A factory produces batches of 1000 chocolate bars each, and the probability that any one of them is defective is 0.02. What is the probability that in a randomly selected batch of chocolate bars, five or more are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective chocolate bars\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of chocolate bars (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective chocolate bars (we want to find the probability of having 5 or more defective bars)\n- p is the probability of a chocolate bar being defective (0.02)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having 5 or more defective chocolate bars, we need to calculate the probability of having 0 to 4 defective chocolate bars and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the probability of having 5 or more defective chocolate bars is:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k (0 to 4) using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(1000, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (0.98)^1000\nP(X = 1) = C(1000, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^999\nP(X = 2) = C(1000, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (0.98)^998\nP(X = 3) = C(1000, 3) * (0.02)^3 * (0.98)^997\nP(X = 4) = C(1000, 4) * (0.02)^4 * (0.98)^996\n\nAfter calculating these probabilities, we can sum them up and subtract the result from 1:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)]\n\nP(X >= 5) ≈ 1 - [0.0004 + 0.0043 + 0.0194 + 0.0488 + 0.0819] ≈ 1 - 0.1548 ≈ 0.8452\n\nSo, the probability that in a randomly selected batch of chocolate bars, five or more are defective is approximately 0.8452 or 84.52%."
