    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 49, which is a prime power (7^2), we know that G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in G, denoted by n_7, satisfies:\n\n1. n_7 â‰¡ 1 (mod 7)\n2. n_7 divides the order of G, which is 49.\n\nThe only possible values for n_7 that satisfy these conditions are 1 and 49. If n_7 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let H be this normal Sylow 7-subgroup. Since the order of H is 7, which is prime, H is cyclic. Thus, G has a normal cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nNow, let g be an element in G that is not in H. Then, the order of g must be 7 or 49. If the order of g is 49, then G is cyclic, and we are done. If the order of g is 7, then we can consider the subgroup K generated by g. Since the order of K is 7, K is also cyclic.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of elements from H and K. For any h in H and k in K, we have:\n\nhk = kh\n\nThis is because H is normal in G. Therefore, we can form the set {hk | h in H, k in K}, which is a subgroup of G. The order of this subgroup is |H||K| = 7 * 7 = 49, which is the order of G. Thus, this subgroup is equal to G.\n\nSince both H and K are cyclic, their direct product is also cyclic. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7, which completes the proof."
