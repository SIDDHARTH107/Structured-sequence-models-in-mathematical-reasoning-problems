Alice computes her public key (A) by raising the primitive root (3) to the power of her secret key (4) modulo the prime number (17): A = (3^4) % 17 = 81 % 17 = 13.\n\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) by raising the primitive root (3) to the power of his secret key (3) modulo the prime number (17): B = (3^3) % 17 = 27 % 17 = 10.\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key by raising Bob's public key (10) to the power of her secret key (4) modulo the prime number (17): Shared_key_Alice = (10^4) % 17 = 10000 % 17 = 3.\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key by raising Alice's public key (13) to the power of his secret key (3) modulo the prime number (17): Shared_key_Bob = (13^3) % 17 = 2197 % 17 = 3.\n\nSince both Alice and Bob have computed the same shared secret key (3), they can use this key for encryption in their communication."
