    "message_2": "To find the sum of all prime numbers from 1 to 100, we first need to identify the prime numbers in this range. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and themselves. Here is the list of prime numbers between 1 and 100:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nNow, we simply add these numbers together to find the sum:\n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97 = 1060\n\nThe sum of all prime numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive, is 1060."
