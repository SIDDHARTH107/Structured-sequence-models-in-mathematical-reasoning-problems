    "message_2": "To find the analytic extension of $f(z)$ to the lower half-plane using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find a function $g(z)$ that is analytic in the lower half-plane and agrees with $f(z)$ on the real axis. We can do this by reflecting $f(z)$ across the real axis, which means replacing $z$ with its complex conjugate $\\bar{z}$:\n\n$$g(z) = f(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{\\bar{z}^3 + 4\\bar{z} - i}{\\bar{z}^2 + 1}.$$\n\nNow, we need to show that $g(z)$ is analytic in the lower half-plane. Since $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane, its complex conjugate $f(\\bar{z})$ is analytic in the lower half-plane. Therefore, $g(z)$ is analytic in the lower half-plane.\n\nNext, we need to show that $g(z)$ agrees with $f(z)$ on the real axis. If $z$ is real, then $\\bar{z} = z$, so $g(z) = f(z)$. Thus, $g(z)$ agrees with $f(z)$ on the real axis.\n\nNow that we have found an analytic extension of $f(z)$ to the lower half-plane, we can evaluate $f(-3i)$. Since $-3i$ is in the lower half-plane, we can use $g(z)$:\n\n$$f(-3i) = g(-3i) = \\frac{(-3i)^3 + 4(-3i) - i}{(-3i)^2 + 1} = \\frac{-27i - 12i - i}{9 + 1} = \\frac{-40i}{10} = -4i.$$"
