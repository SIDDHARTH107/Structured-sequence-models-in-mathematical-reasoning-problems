    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x² + 2x + 5, we will integrate each term with respect to x.\n\n∫(3x² + 2x + 5) dx = ∫(3x²) dx + ∫(2x) dx + ∫(5) dx\n\nFor the first term, we have:\n∫(3x²) dx = 3∫(x²) dx = 3(x³/3) = x³\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n∫(2x) dx = 2∫(x) dx = 2(x²/2) = x²\n\nFor the third term, we have:\n∫(5) dx = 5∫(1) dx = 5x\n\nNow, we combine the results and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x³ + x² + 5x + C"
