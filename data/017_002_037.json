For each divisor d, there is a unique subgroup of order d in the cyclic group generated by 12.\n\nLet G be the cyclic group generated by 12, and let g be a generator of G, i.e., G = ⟨g⟩. Then, the subgroups of G are given by:\n\n1. H_1 = ⟨g^12⟩, which has order 1 (the trivial subgroup).\n2. H_2 = ⟨g^6⟩, which has order 2.\n3. H_3 = ⟨g^4⟩, which has order 3.\n4. H_4 = ⟨g^3⟩, which has order 4.\n5. H_6 = ⟨g^2⟩, which has order 6.\n6. H_12 = ⟨g⟩, which has order 12 (the whole group G).\n\nNow, we need to prove that each of these subgroups is cyclic. A subgroup H of a group G is cyclic if there exists an element h in H such that H = ⟨h⟩. Since each of the subgroups H_i is generated by a power of g, they are all cyclic by definition. To see this more explicitly:\n\n1. H_1 = ⟨g^12⟩ = {e}, where e is the identity element. This is the trivial cyclic group.\n2. H_2 = ⟨g^6⟩ = {e, g^6}. This is a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. H_3 = ⟨g^4⟩ = {e, g^4, (g^4)^2 = g^8}. This is a cyclic group of order 3.\n4. H_4 = ⟨g^3⟩ = {e, g^3, (g^3)^2 = g^6, (g^3)^3 = g^9}. This is a cyclic group of order 4.\n5. H_6 = ⟨g^2⟩ = {e, g^2, (g^2)^2 = g^4, (g^2)^3 = g^6, (g^2)^4 = g^8, (g^2)^5 = g^10}. This is a cyclic group of order 6.\n6. H_12 = ⟨g⟩ = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9, g^10, g^11}. This is a cyclic group of order 12.\n\nThus, we have found all the subgroups of the cyclic group generated by 12, and we have shown that each one is cyclic."
