    "message_1": "A ship is sailing due east at a speed of 20 km/h. A strong breeze is blowing due north at a speed of 10 km/h. What is the direction and magnitude of the ship's resulting velocity relative to the ground? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the ship's resulting velocity, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet V_east be the velocity of the ship due east (20 km/h) and V_north be the velocity of the breeze due north (10 km/h). We can represent these velocities as vectors.\n\nThe magnitude of the resulting velocity (V_result) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV_result = √(V_east^2 + V_north^2)\nV_result = √(20^2 + 10^2)\nV_result = √(400 + 100)\nV_result = √500\nV_result ≈ 22.36 km/h\n\nNow, to find the direction of the resulting velocity, we can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = V_north / V_east\ntan(θ) = 10 / 20\ntan(θ) = 0.5\n\nθ = arctan(0.5)\nθ ≈ 26.57°\n\nThe direction of the resulting velocity is approximately 26.57° north of east.\n\nSo, the ship's resulting velocity relative to the ground is approximately 22.36 km/h in a direction of 26.57° north of east."
