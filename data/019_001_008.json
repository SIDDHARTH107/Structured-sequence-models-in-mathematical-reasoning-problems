    "message_1": "Suppose that p represents the statement \"It is sunny today\" and q represents the statement \"I will go to the beach\". Using propositional logic, combination of p and q, find the truth value of the following statement: \"It is sunny today and I will go to the beach, or it is not sunny today.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the truth value of the given statement, we need to break it down into its propositional logic components. The statement can be represented as:\n\n(p ∧ q) ∨ ¬p\n\nHere, \"∧\" represents the \"and\" operator, \"∨\" represents the \"or\" operator, and \"¬\" represents the \"not\" operator.\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible truth values of p and q:\n\n1. If p is true (it is sunny today) and q is true (I will go to the beach), then the statement becomes:\n\n   (T ∧ T) ∨ ¬T = T ∨ F = T (True)\n\n2. If p is true (it is sunny today) and q is false (I will not go to the beach), then the statement becomes:\n\n   (T ∧ F) ∨ ¬T = F ∨ F = F (False)\n\n3. If p is false (it is not sunny today) and q is true (I will go to the beach), then the statement becomes:\n\n   (F ∧ T) ∨ ¬F = F ∨ T = T (True)\n\n4. If p is false (it is not sunny today) and q is false (I will not go to the beach), then the statement becomes:\n\n   (F ∧ F) ∨ ¬F = F ∨ T = T (True)\n\nSo, the given statement is true in three out of four possible scenarios. However, without knowing the actual truth values of p and q, we cannot determine the exact truth value of the statement."
