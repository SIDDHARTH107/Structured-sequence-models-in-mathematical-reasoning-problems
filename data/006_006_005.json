    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the free throw shooting percentage)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of free throw attempts)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of successful free throws)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 6 (the number of free throw attempts)\n- k = 5 (the number of successful free throws)\n- p = 0.7 (the free throw shooting percentage)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 6 items taken 5 at a time:\n\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5! * (6-5)!)\n         = 6! / (5! * 1!)\n         = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (1))\n         = 6\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(6, 5) * p^5 * (1-p)^(6-5)\n         = 6 * (0.7)^5 * (1-0.7)^(6-5)\n         = 6 * (0.7)^5 * (0.3)^1\n         = 6 * 0.16807 * 0.3\n         â‰ˆ 0.302526\n\nSo, the probability of the player making exactly 5 out of 6 free throw attempts is approximately 0.302526 or 30.25%."
