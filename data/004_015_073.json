    "message_2": "To find the inflection point(s) of the function, we first need to find the second derivative of the function and then solve for the points where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nGiven function: f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x\n\nFirst, find the first derivative of the function:\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, find the second derivative of the function:\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection point(s), set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nThere is one inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-value, plug the x-value back into the original function:\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2)\nf(2) = 8 - 24 + 18\nf(2) = 2\n\nSo, the inflection point is (2, 2)."
