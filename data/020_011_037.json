    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of A requires 5 labor hours and 2 machine hours, while the production of B requires 3 labor hours and 6 machine hours. Labor cost is $10 per hour, and machine cost is $5 per hour. The company has 250 labor hours and 180 machine hours available per week. The profit earned by selling product A is $20 per unit, and for product B is $30 per unit. What is the optimal production quantity of each product that maximizes the profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor hours and machine hours can be written as:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 250 (labor hours)\n2x + 6y ≤ 180 (machine hours)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 250\n2x + 6y ≤ 180\n\nDivide the second inequality by 2:\n\nx + 3y ≤ 90\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of 5x + 3y = 250 and x + 3y = 90:\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n4x = 160\nx = 40\n\nSubstitute x into the second equation:\n\n40 + 3y = 90\n3y = 50\ny = 50/3 ≈ 16.67 (rounded down to 16 since we cannot produce a fraction of a product)\n\nSo, the first corner point is (40, 16).\n\n2. Intersection of 5x + 3y = 250 and x = 0:\n\nx = 0\n3y = 250\ny = 250/3 ≈ 83.33 (rounded down to 83)\n\nSo, the second corner point is (0, 83).\n\n3. Intersection of 2x + 6y = 180 and y = 0:\n\n2x = 180\nx = 90\n\nSo, the third corner point is (90, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P = 20x + 30y at each corner point:\n\nP(40, 16) = 20(40) + 30(16) = 800 + 480 = 1280\nP(0, 83) = 20(0) + 30(83) = 0 + 2490 = 2490\nP(90, 0) = 20(90) + 30(0) = 1800 + 0 = 1800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 83), with a profit of $2490.\n\nTherefore, the optimal production quantity is to produce 0 units of product A and 83 units of product B to maximize the profit of the company."
