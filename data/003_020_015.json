    "message_1": "Suppose a 10-foot ladder is leaned against a wall, and the bottom of the ladder is placed 4 feet away from the wall. What is the angle of elevation between the ladder and the wall?",
    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle formed by the ladder, the wall, and the ground to solve this problem. Let's call the angle of elevation between the ladder and the wall θ.\n\nIn this right triangle, the ladder acts as the hypotenuse (10 feet), the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall is the adjacent side (4 feet), and the height of the ladder on the wall is the opposite side. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the ladder on the wall:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n4^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n16 + b^2 = 100\nb^2 = 84\nb = √84 ≈ 9.165 feet\n\nNow we can use the tangent function to find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = (9.165 feet)/(4 feet)\n\nθ = arctan((9.165 feet)/(4 feet))\nθ ≈ 66.8 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of elevation between the ladder and the wall is approximately 66.8 degrees."
