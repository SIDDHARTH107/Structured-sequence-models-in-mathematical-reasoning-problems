    "message_1": "A beverage company produces two types of drinks, A and B. Each drink requires two ingredients, X and Y. The company has 800 gallons of X and 1000 gallons of Y available. Drink A requires 2 gallons of X and 5 gallons of Y, while drink B requires 5 gallons of X and 3 gallons of Y. If the profit per gallon of drink A is $3 and for drink B is $5, how many gallons of each should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of gallons of drink A and y be the number of gallons of drink B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\nP(x, y) = 3x + 5y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n2x + 5y ≤ 800 (ingredient X constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 1000 (ingredient Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for drink A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for drink B)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 5y = 800\n   y = (800 - 2x) / 5\n\n2. 5x + 3y = 1000\n   y = (1000 - 5x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We'll find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the constraint equations:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n   2x + 5y = 800\n   5x + 3y = 1000\n\n   Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate x:\n   10x + 25y = 4000\n   10x + 6y = 2000\n\n   Subtract the second equation from the first:\n   19y = 2000\n   y = 2000 / 19 ≈ 105.26\n\n   Plug y back into the first equation to find x:\n   2x + 5(105.26) = 800\n   2x = 800 - 526.32\n   x = (800 - 526.32) / 2 ≈ 136.84\n\n   So the intersection point is (136.84, 105.26).\n\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   2x + 5(0) = 800\n   x = 800 / 2 = 400\n\n   So the intersection point is (400, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0):\n   5(0) + 3y = 1000\n   y = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33\n\n   So the intersection point is (0, 333.33).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 3x + 5y at each of the corner points:\n\n1. P(136.84, 105.26) = 3(136.84) + 5(105.26) ≈ 1025.00\n2. P(400, 0) = 3(400) + 5(0) = 1200\n3. P(0, 333.33) = 3(0) + 5(333.33) ≈ 1666.65\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (0, 333.33) with a profit of approximately $1666.65. Therefore, the company should produce 0 gallons of drink A and approximately 333.33 gallons of drink B to maximize their profit."
