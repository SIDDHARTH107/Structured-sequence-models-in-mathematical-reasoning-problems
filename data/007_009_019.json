    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers in the range [1, n] that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nFor a given positive integer n, if n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, where p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct prime factors of n and a1, a2, ..., ak are their respective exponents, then Euler's totient function can be calculated using the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nNow, let's find the value of φ(25).\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 25. Since 25 = 5^2, its prime factorization is 5^2.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\n\nφ(25) = 25 * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(25) = 25 * (4/5)\nφ(25) = 20\n\nSo, the value of φ(25) is 20."
