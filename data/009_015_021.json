    "message_1": "Suppose a sample of a radioactive substance has an initial mass of 200 grams and a half-life of 10 days. Find the mass of the sample after 30 days assuming that the decay follows the exponential decay model.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the exponential decay formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 200 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, the mass of the radioactive substance will be 25 grams."
