    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source S to the sink T and update the residual capacities of the edges. We will continue this process until there are no more augmenting paths.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from S to T. One possible path is S -> B -> A -> D -> T with a bottleneck capacity of 4 (the minimum capacity along the path). We update the residual capacities of the edges and the current flow is 4.\n\nResidual capacities:\n```\n                 5 /----> A -----\\\n                /               9  \\\n               /     0       /------> D --->\n              S --> B -- 3 /           |\n               \\           /      2    |\n                \\     7  /--------> E --->\n                 6 \\___/         4\n```\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: S -> B -> D -> T with a bottleneck capacity of 3. We update the residual capacities and the current flow is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nResidual capacities:\n```\n                 5 /----> A -----\\\n                /               6  \\\n               /     3       /------> D --->\n              S --> B -- 0 /           |\n               \\           /      2    |\n                \\     7  /--------> E --->\n                 6 \\___/         4\n```\n\n3.

We update the residual capacities and the current flow is 7 + 5 = 12.\n\nResidual capacities:\n```\n                 0 /----> A -----\\\n                /               1  \\\n               /     3       /------> D --->\n              S --> B -- 0 /           |\n               \\           /      2    |\n                \\     7  /--------> E --->\n                 6 \\___/         4\n```\n\n4.

We update the residual capacities and the current flow is 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nResidual capacities:\n```\n                 0 /----> A -----\\\n                /               3  \\\n               /     3       /------> D --->\n              S --> B -- 0 /           |\n               \\           /      0    |\n                \\     5  /--------> E --->\n                 6 \\___/         2\n```\n\n5. At this point, there are no more augmenting paths from S to T. Therefore, the maximum flow is 14."
