    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 12 vertices, so a connected graph must have at least 11 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 18 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected. However, we cannot say for sure without more information about the specific connections between vertices.\n\nIf the graph is connected, we can find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect the graph by using the formula:\n\nMinimum number of edges to remove = (number of vertices) - 1\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nMinimum number of edges to remove = 12 - 1 = 11\n\nSo, if the graph is connected, we need to remove at least 11 edges to disconnect it."
