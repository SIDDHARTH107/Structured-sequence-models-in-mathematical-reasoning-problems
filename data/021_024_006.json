    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The production of A requires 3 hours on machine 1 and 2 hours on machine 2, while the production of B requires 4 hours on machine 1 and 1 hour on machine 2. The profit from the sale of one unit of A is $20, and for one unit of B is $30. The company wants to determine the optimal production plan to maximize total profit, given that machine 1 is available for 60 hours per week, and machine 2 is available for 40 hours per week, using the bat algorithm. How many units of product A and B should the company produce in a week to maximize the total profit, and what is the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 60 (Machine 1 availability)\n2x + y ≤ 40 (Machine 2 availability)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. 2x + y ≤ 40\n   y ≤ 40 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. Now, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of 3x + 4y = 60 and 2x + y = 40:\n\n   3x + 4(40 - 2x) = 60\n   3x + 160 - 8x = 60\n   -5x = -100\n   x = 20\n\n   2(20) + y = 40\n   y = 0\n\n   Vertex 1: (20, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of 3x + 4y = 60 and x = 0:\n\n   3(0) + 4y = 60\n   y = 15\n\n   Vertex 2: (0, 15)\n\n3. Intersection of 2x + y = 40 and x = 0:\n\n   2(0) + y = 40\n   y = 40\n\n   Vertex 3: (0, 40)\n\n4. Intersection of 2x + y = 40 and y = 0:\n\n   2x + 0 = 40\n   x = 20\n\n   Vertex 4: (20, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(20, 0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = 400\nP(0, 15) = 20(0) + 30(15) = 450\nP(0, 40) = 20(0) + 30(40) = 1200\nP(20, 0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = 400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 40) with a profit of $1200. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 40 units of product B in a week to maximize the total profit, which is $1200."
