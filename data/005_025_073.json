    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean score of all students, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (80)\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\nσ = standard deviation (10)\nn = sample size (100)\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard error = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nNow, we'll calculate the margin of error (Z * standard error):\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 1 = 1.96\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = 80 ± 1.96\n\nLower limit = 80 - 1.96 = 78.04\nUpper limit = 80 + 1.96 = 81.96\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean score of all students is (78.04, 81.96)."
