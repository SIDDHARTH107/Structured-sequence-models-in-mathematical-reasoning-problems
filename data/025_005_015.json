    "message_2": "To determine if the algebraic variety given by the equation $y^2 - x^3 = 0$ has any singular points, we need to compute its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and check if there are any points where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3$. Then, the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e.,\n\n$-3x^2 = 0$ and $2y = 0$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $x = 0$. From the second equation, we get $y = 0$. Thus, the only point where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to check if this point lies on the algebraic variety. Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the equation $y^2 - x^3 = 0$, we get:\n\n$0^2 - 0^3 = 0$\n\nSince this equation holds true, the point $(0, 0)$ lies on the algebraic variety.\n\nTherefore, the algebraic variety given by the equation $y^2 - x^3 = 0$ has a singular point at $(0, 0)$."
