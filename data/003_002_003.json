    "message_2": "In a right-angled triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of an angle can be found using the side lengths. In this case, the triangle has sides of length 3, 4, and 5, and we are given that angle θ is opposite to the shorter side of length 3. This means that the side of length 3 is the opposite side, the side of length 4 is the adjacent side, and the side of length 5 is the hypotenuse.\n\nThe sine, cosine, and tangent ratios are defined as follows:\n\nsinθ = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse)\ncosθ = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)\ntanθ = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\n\nUsing the given side lengths, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of angle θ:\n\nsinθ = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse) = 3 / 5\ncosθ = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse) = 4 / 5\ntanθ = (opposite side) / (adjacent side) = 3 / 4\n\nSo, the sinθ, cosθ, and tanθ values are:\n\nsinθ = 3/5\ncosθ = 4/5\ntanθ = 3/4"
