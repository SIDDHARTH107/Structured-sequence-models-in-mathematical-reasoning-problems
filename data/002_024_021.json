    "message_1": "A trapezium has one base that is 8cm long and another base that is 12cm long. Its height is 6cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the two non-parallel sides (the legs). We can do this by dividing the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter base to the longer base.\n\nLet's call the length of one leg \"a\" and the length of the other leg \"b\". The height of the trapezium is also the height of both right triangles, which is 6 cm. The difference in the length of the bases is 12 cm - 8 cm = 4 cm. This difference is divided equally between the two right triangles, so each triangle has a base of 2 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the legs (a and b). The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the leg) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the base and the height).\n\nFor both right triangles, we have:\n\na^2 = 6^2 + 2^2\na^2 = 36 + 4\na^2 = 40\na = √40\na ≈ 6.32 cm\n\nSince both legs are congruent in this case, we have:\n\nb ≈ 6.32 cm\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm (shorter base) + 12 cm (longer base) + 6.32 cm (leg a) + 6.32 cm (leg b)\nPerimeter ≈ 32.64 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 32.64 cm."
