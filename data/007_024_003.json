    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer x such that 2^x ≡ 8 (mod 17). \n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by expressing 8 as a power of 2. Since 8 = 2^3, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^x ≡ 2^3 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this equation. We can start by testing different values of x:\n\nFor x = 1: 2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\nFor x = 2: 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\nFor x = 3: 2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n\nWe found that when x = 3, the equation holds true: 2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 17). Therefore, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the equation is x = 3."
