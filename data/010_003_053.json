    "message_2": "A = (0, 1) ∪ {2} is a union of an open interval (0, 1) and a singleton set {2}. The open interval (0, 1) is not closed, as its complement (-∞, 0] ∪ [1, ∞) is not open. The singleton set {2} is closed, as its complement (-∞, 2) ∪ (2, ∞) is open. However, the union of a closed set and a non-closed set is not necessarily closed. In this case, the complement of A is (-∞, 0] ∪ [1, 2) ∪ (2, ∞), which is open. Therefore, A is not a closed set.\n\nB = [1, 3] is a closed interval, as its complement (-∞, 1) ∪ (3, ∞) is open. Therefore, B is not an open set.\n\nTo determine if A is a compact set, we need to check if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. A is not a compact set because it contains the open interval (0, 1), which is not compact. To see this, consider the open cover of (0, 1) consisting of the open intervals (1/n, 1 - 1/n) for n = 2, 3, 4, .... This open cover has no finite subcover, as any finite subcover would have a largest n, and the interval (1/n, 1 - 1/n) would not cover the entire interval (0, 1). Since (0, 1) is not compact and A contains (0, 1), A is not a compact set."
