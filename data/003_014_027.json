    "message_2": "To graph the function f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 1 over the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π, we first need to understand the properties of the sine function and how the constants 2 and 3 affect it.\n\nThe sine function has a period of 2π, which means that it repeats its values in intervals of 2π. The constant 3 inside the sine function affects the period of the function, making it 2π/3. This means that the function will complete one full cycle in the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π.\n\nThe constant 2 outside the sine function affects the amplitude of the function. The amplitude of the sine function is 1, so multiplying it by 2 increases the amplitude to 2. This means that the function will oscillate between -2 and 2.\n\nFinally, the constant 1 added to the function shifts the entire function up by 1 unit. This means that the function will oscillate between -1 and 3.\n\nNow, we can graph the function f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 1 over the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π. The graph will show one full cycle of the sine function, with an amplitude of 2 and oscillating between -1 and 3.\n\nThe maximum value of f(x) on this interval is 3, and the minimum value is -1. To find the values of x that correspond to these extrema, we need to solve the following equations:\n\n1. 2sin(3x) + 1 = 3\n2. 2sin(3x) + 1 = -1\n\nFor equation 1:\n\n2sin(3x) = 2\nsin(3x) = 1\n\nSince the sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 at x = π/2 + 2πn, where n is an integer, we have:\n\n3x = π/2 + 2πn\nx = (π/2 + 2πn)/3\n\nFor equation 2:\n\n2sin(3x) = -2\nsin(3x) = -1\n\nSince the sine function reaches its minimum value of -1 at x = 3π/2 + 2πn, where n is an integer, we have:\n\n3x = 3π/2 + 2πn\nx = (3π/2 + 2πn)/3\n\nIn the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π, the values of x that correspond to the maximum value of f(x) are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6, and the values of x that correspond to the minimum value of f(x) are x = -π/2 and x = π/2."
