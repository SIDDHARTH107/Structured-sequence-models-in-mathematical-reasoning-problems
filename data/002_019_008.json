    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with radius 6 cm. The area of the base (A_base) can be found using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (6 cm)^2\nA_base = π * 36 cm^2\nA_base ≈ 113.1 cm^2\n\nThe lateral surface area (A_lateral) can be found using the formula for the lateral surface area of a cone:\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nA_lateral = π * (6 cm) * (10 cm)\nA_lateral = π * 60 cm^2\nA_lateral ≈ 188.5 cm^2\n\nNow, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area (A_total):\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total ≈ 113.1 cm^2 + 188.5 cm^2\nA_total ≈ 301.6 cm^2\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the surface area of the cone is approximately 301.6 cm^2."
