    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems and the fact that 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor:\n\n1. For the prime factor 2, the Sylow 2-subgroups have order 2. By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 15 (which is 30/2), and n_2 ≡ 1 mod 2. So, n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n\n2. For the prime factor 3, the Sylow 3-subgroups have order 3. By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 10 (which is 30/3), and n_3 ≡ 1 mod 3. So, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n\n3. For the prime factor 5, the Sylow 5-subgroups have order 5. By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 6 (which is 30/5), and n_5 ≡ 1 mod 5. So, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is only one group of order 30, which is the cyclic group Z_30.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is a semi-direct product of Z_3 and Z_10, which gives a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nThese are the only two possibilities for distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 30. So, there are 2 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 30."
