    "message_2": "Let's consider the problem step by step. We have a simple graph G with 7 vertices, and we want to color the vertices with 3 colors (red, green, and blue) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nTo maximize the number of vertices with the same color, we can try to divide the vertices into 3 groups as evenly as possible. Since there are 7 vertices, we can divide them into groups of 3, 2, and 2.\n\nNow, let's try to color the vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We can start by coloring the group of 3 vertices with the same color, say red. Then, we can color the group of 2 vertices with another color, say green, and the remaining group of 2 vertices with the third color, blue.\n\nTo ensure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we can arrange the vertices in a cycle. We can place the 3 red vertices at positions 1, 3, and 5, the 2 green vertices at positions 2 and 6, and the 2 blue vertices at positions 4 and 7. This arrangement ensures that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThus, the maximum number of vertices of G that can be colored the same color is 3."
