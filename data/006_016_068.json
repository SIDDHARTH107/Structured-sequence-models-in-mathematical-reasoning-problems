    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 5000 units of a product per day. The probability of a certain type of defect occurring in any given unit is 0.03. What is the probability that at least 150 units produced on a given day will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, since we are looking for the probability of at least 150 defective units, it would be easier to find the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of having 149 or fewer defective units) and subtract it from 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of units produced (5000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective units\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.03 in this case)\n\nWe want to find the probability P(X ≥ 150), which is equal to 1 - P(X ≤ 149). We can calculate P(X ≤ 149) by summing the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 149:\n\nP(X ≤ 149) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 149\n\nCalculating this sum directly would be very time-consuming, so we can use a cumulative binomial probability calculator or statistical software to find the result.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that P(X ≤ 149) ≈ 0.0668.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least 150 defective units is:\n\nP(X ≥ 150) = 1 - P(X ≤ 149) = 1 - 0.0668 ≈ 0.9332\n\nSo, there is approximately a 93.32% chance that at least 150 units produced on a given day will be defective."
