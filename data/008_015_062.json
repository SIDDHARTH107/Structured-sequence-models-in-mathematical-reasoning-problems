    "message_2": "First, we need to rewrite the system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  1  2 -2 |\n    |  2  8 -1 |\n    | -2  0 -1 |\n\nb = |  5 |\n    |  7 |\n    | -3 |\n\nNow, we will perform the Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. In this case, A = LL^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose.\n\nHowever, the given matrix A is not positive-definite, which is a requirement for Cholesky decomposition. Therefore, we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or the inverse matrix method to solve the system. In this case, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 3:\n\nA = | -2  0 -1 |    b = | -3 |\n    |  2  8 -1 |        |  7 |\n    |  1  2 -2 |        |  5 |\n\n2. Add row 3 to row 2 and divide row 1 by -2:\n\nA = |  1  0  0.5 |    b = |  1.5 |\n    |  0  8  -2  |        |  8.5 |\n    |  1  2 -2   |        |  5   |\n\n3. Subtract row 1 from row 3:\n\nA = |  1  0  0.5 |    b = |  1.5 |\n    |  0  8  -2  |        |  8.5 |\n    |  0  2 -2.5 |        |  3.5 |\n\n4. Divide row 2 by 8 and row 3 by 2:\n\nA = |  1  0  0.5 |    b = |  1.5 |\n    |  0  1 -0.25|        |  1.0625 |\n    |  0  1 -1.25|        |  1.75 |\n\n5. Subtract row 2 from row 3:\n\nA = |  1  0  0.5 |    b = |  1.5    |\n    |  0  1 -0.25|        |  1.0625 |\n    |  0  0 -1   |        |  0.6875 |\n\n6. Solve for x, y, and z:\n\nz = -0.6875\ny = 1.0625 + 0.25 * z = 1.0625 + 0.25 * (-0.6875) = 1\nx = 1.5 - 0.5 * z = 1.5 - 0.5 * (-0.6875) = 2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2, y = 1, and z = -0.6875."
