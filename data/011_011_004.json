    "message_1": "A circle is divided into 10 regions by 5 radii. How many ways can the regions be painted in 3 colors, such that no two adjacent regions are the same color?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of ways to color the regions without any restrictions. There are 3 choices for each of the 10 regions, so there are 3^10 total ways.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways where at least one pair of adjacent regions have the same color. There are 5 pairs of adjacent regions, and for each pair, there are 3 choices for the color they share. For the remaining 8 regions, there are 3 choices for each, so there are 5 * 3^8 ways to color the regions with at least one pair of adjacent regions having the same color.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where at least two pairs of adjacent regions have the same color. There are 10 ways to choose two pairs of adjacent regions (5 ways to choose the first pair, and then 2 ways to choose the second pair). For each of these cases, there are 3 choices for the color of the first pair, 3 choices for the color of the second pair, and 3^6 choices for the remaining 6 regions. So, there are 10 * 3^2 * 3^6 ways to color the regions with at least two pairs of adjacent regions having the same color.\n\nFinally, we need to count the cases where all 5 pairs of adjacent regions have the same color. There is only 1 way to choose all 5 pairs, and there are 3 choices for the color they all share. So, there are 3 ways to color the regions with all 5 pairs of adjacent regions having the same color.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of ways to color the regions such that no two adjacent regions are the same color is:\n\n3^10 - 5 * 3^8 + 10 * 3^2 * 3^6 - 3 = 59049 - 5 * 6561 + 10 * 9 * 729 - 3 = 59049 - 32805 + 65610 - 3 = 91851. \n\nSo, there are 91,851 ways to color the regions with the given condition."
