    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph G is the size of the largest complete subgraph (or clique) in G.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nEdges: {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)}\n\nWe can see that vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} form a complete subgraph, as all possible edges between them are present: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4). This is a clique of size 4.\n\nNow, let's check if there is a larger clique in the graph. There are only two more vertices left, 5 and 6. However, vertices 5 and 6 are only connected to vertex 4, and not to vertices 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, there is no larger clique in the graph.\n\nSo, the clique number of G is 4."
