    "message_2": "To find the integral of cos^2(x) dx from 0 to π/3, we can use the power-reduction formula:\n\ncos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n∫(cos^2(x) dx) from 0 to π/3 = ∫((1 + cos(2x))/2 dx) from 0 to π/3\n\nLet's integrate term by term:\n\n∫(1/2 dx) from 0 to π/3 + ∫(cos(2x)/2 dx) from 0 to π/3\n\nThe integral of 1/2 dx is (1/2)x, and the integral of cos(2x)/2 dx is (1/4)sin(2x). Now, we can evaluate these integrals at the limits of integration:\n\n[(1/2)x] from 0 to π/3 + [(1/4)sin(2x)] from 0 to π/3\n\n= (1/2)(π/3) - (1/2)(0) + (1/4)sin(2(π/3)) - (1/4)sin(2(0))\n\n= (π/6) + (1/4)sin(2π/3) - 0\n\n= (π/6) + (1/4)(√3/2)\n\n= (π/6) + (√3/8)\n\nSo, the integral of cos^2(x) dx from 0 to π/3 is (π/6) + (√3/8)."
