    "message_2": "A Latin square of order n is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and each column. In the case of order 4, we have a 4x4 grid filled with 4 different symbols.\n\nTo count the number of different Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4x3x2x1 = 24 ways, as there are no restrictions on the placement of the symbols.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3 possible positions for the first symbol (since it cannot be in the same column as the first symbol in the first row), 2 possible positions for the second symbol, and the remaining two symbols have only one possible position each. So, there are 3x2x1x1 = 6 ways to fill the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible configurations, which are determined by the placement of the first symbol. The remaining symbols have only one possible position each. So, there are 2x1x1x1 = 2 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the placement of the symbols in the previous rows, so there is only 1 way to fill it.\n\nMultiplying the number of ways for each row, we get the total number of different Latin squares of order 4:\n\n24 (first row) x 6 (second row) x 2 (third row) x 1 (fourth row) = 288\n\nSo, there are 288 different Latin squares of order 4."
