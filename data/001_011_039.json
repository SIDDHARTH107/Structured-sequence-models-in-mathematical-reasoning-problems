    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which in this case is 12. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$\\dfrac{4(2x-5)}{12} + \\dfrac{3(3x+1)}{12} = \\dfrac{7}{6}$\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n$4(2x-5) + 3(3x+1) = 12 \\cdot \\dfrac{7}{6}$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$8x - 20 + 9x + 3 = 14$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$17x - 17 = 14$\n\nAdd 17 to both sides:\n\n$17x = 31$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 17:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{31}{17}$\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{31}{17}$"
