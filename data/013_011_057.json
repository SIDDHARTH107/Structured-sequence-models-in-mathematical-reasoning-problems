    "message_1": "In a Bertrand competition, two firms are selling identical products at a price of $100. However, there is a 50% chance that a customer will choose the cheaper product if the price is different. What should be the new price of the product for each firm to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and customers choose the firm with the lowest price. If both firms set the same price, customers are indifferent and split evenly between the two firms. To maximize profits, each firm will try to undercut the other by setting a slightly lower price. This price competition continues until the price reaches the marginal cost of production, at which point firms can no longer lower their prices without incurring losses.\n\nLet's assume the marginal cost of production is $0 (for simplicity). In this case, both firms will keep undercutting each other until the price is just above $0. However, since there is a 50% chance that a customer will choose the cheaper product if the price is different, both firms have an incentive to set a price slightly above the marginal cost to capture some profit.\n\nIn reality, the optimal price for each firm depends on the specific cost structure and demand curve. To find the exact optimal price, we would need more information about the production costs and the demand function. However, in a Bertrand competition with a 50% chance of choosing the cheaper product, both firms should set their prices slightly above the marginal cost to maximize their profits."
