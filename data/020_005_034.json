    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of tables: wooden tables and glass tables. The company can make a maximum of 60 glass tables per week and a maximum of 80 wooden tables per week. The demand for wooden tables is at most 60 tables per week and the demand for glass tables is at most 40 tables per week. The profit for a wooden table is $30 and for a glass table is $50. How many tables should the company produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wooden tables and y be the number of glass tables produced per week.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n\n1. x ≤ 80 (maximum wooden tables)\n2. y ≤ 60 (maximum glass tables)\n3. x ≤ 60 (demand for wooden tables)\n4. y ≤ 40 (demand for glass tables)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 30x + 50y\n\nSince the demand for wooden tables is at most 60 and the company can produce a maximum of 80 wooden tables, the company should produce 60 wooden tables to meet the demand. Similarly, since the demand for glass tables is at most 40 and the company can produce a maximum of 60 glass tables, the company should produce 40 glass tables to meet the demand.\n\nSo, x = 60 and y = 40.\n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum profit:\n\nP = 30(60) + 50(40) = 1800 + 2000 = $3800\n\nThe company should produce 60 wooden tables and 40 glass tables per week to maximize their profit, which will be $3800 per week."
