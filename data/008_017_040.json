    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system in matrix form. The matrix form of the given system is:\n\nA * X = B\n\nWhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  5  6 |\n    | 4  9 13 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 5 |\n    |12 |\n\nNow, we will convert the coefficient matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the given matrix A is not sparse, but we can still represent it in sparse matrix form for the sake of the exercise.\n\nThe sparse matrix representation of A is a list of non-zero elements with their row and column indices:\n\nSparse_A = [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 6), (2, 0, 4), (2, 1, 9), (2, 2, 13)]\n\nNow, we will solve the system of linear equations using the sparse matrix representation. However, it is important to note that solving linear equations using sparse matrices is more efficient when the matrix is actually sparse (i.e., has many zero elements). In this case, since the matrix is not sparse, the process will not be more efficient than using the standard matrix representation.\n\nTo solve the system of linear equations, we can use Gaussian elimination or any other suitable method. In this case, we will use the numpy library to solve the system.\n\nFirst, we will convert the sparse matrix representation back to the standard matrix representation:\n\nA = [[1, 2, 3],\n     [2, 5, 6],\n     [4, 9, 13]]\n\nB = [7, 5, 12]\n\nNow, we will use the numpy library to solve the system:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 5, 6], [4, 9, 13]])\nB = np.array([7, 5, 12])\n\nX = np.linalg.solve(A, B)\n```\n\nThe solution X is:\n\nx = 3.5\ny = -1.0\nz = 1.0\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices is x = 3.5, y = -1.0, and z = 1.0."
