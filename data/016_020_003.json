    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedra from the original tetrahedron. In each iteration, the volume of the removed tetrahedra is 1/4 of the volume of the previous iteration.\n\nIn the first iteration, we remove 1 tetrahedron with a volume of 1/4 of the original tetrahedron. In the second iteration, we remove 4 tetrahedra, each with a volume of 1/4 of the tetrahedra removed in the first iteration. In the third iteration, we remove 4^2 = 16 tetrahedra, each with a volume of 1/4 of the tetrahedra removed in the second iteration.\n\nLet's find the volume of the tetrahedra removed in each iteration:\n\n1. Original tetrahedron volume: 64 cubic units\n2. First iteration: 1 tetrahedron with a volume of 64 * (1/4) = 16 cubic units\n3. Second iteration: 4 tetrahedra, each with a volume of 16 * (1/4) = 4 cubic units\n4. Third iteration: 16 tetrahedra, each with a volume of 4 * (1/4) = 1 cubic unit\n\nNow, let's find the total number of small tetrahedra required to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron of 3 iterations:\n\n1. First iteration: 1 tetrahedron\n2. Second iteration: 4 tetrahedra\n3. Third iteration: 16 tetrahedra\n\nTotal number of small tetrahedra = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21 tetrahedra."
