    "message_1": "A tower is standing upright on level ground. A person standing at a distance of 20 meters from the tower measures the angle of elevation to the top of the tower to be 60 degrees. At what height above the ground is the tower? (Assuming that the person's eye level is 1.5 meters from the ground.)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tower (h), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the person to the tower (20 meters).\n\nWe have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 20\n\nTo find the height (h), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nh = 20 * tan(60°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nSo:\n\nh ≈ 20 * 1.732 ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nHowever, this height includes the person's eye level, which is 1.5 meters above the ground. To find the height of the tower above the ground, we need to subtract the person's eye level:\n\nHeight of the tower = h - 1.5 ≈ 34.64 - 1.5 ≈ 33.14 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the tower above the ground is approximately 33.14 meters."
