    "message_1": "Suppose there are two farmers who share a common piece of land of size 100 hectares. Each farmer can either graze their cattle on this land or use it to grow crops. The payoff for grazing cattle is $10 per hectare while the payoff for growing crops is $20 per hectare. However, if both farmers choose to graze their cattle, the land can only support a total of 140 cattle and if this limit is exceeded, the land becomes overgrazed and both farmers incur a cost of $100 each as a penalty. If both farmers choose to grow crops, the land produces a total output of 200 units. What strategy should each farmer choose in order to maximize their payoff, assuming that each player knows the other player's payoff and can coordinate their actions accordingly?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible outcomes for each combination of strategies:\n\n1. Both farmers graze cattle:\nIn this case, the land can support 140 cattle. Since there are two farmers, they can each graze 70 cattle. The payoff for each farmer would be 70 * $10 = $700. There is no overgrazing penalty in this case, so the total payoff for each farmer is $700.\n\n2. Both farmers grow crops:\nThe land produces a total output of 200 units. Since there are two farmers, they can each produce 100 units. The payoff for each farmer would be 100 * $20 = $2000.\n\n3. One farmer grazes cattle, and the other grows crops:\nIn this case, the farmer who grazes cattle can use the entire 100 hectares for grazing, resulting in a payoff of 100 * $10 = $1000. The farmer who grows crops can use the entire 100 hectares for growing crops, resulting in a payoff of 100 * $20 = $2000.\n\nBased on these outcomes, the best strategy for both farmers is to coordinate and both grow crops, as this results in the highest payoff for each farmer ($2000)."
