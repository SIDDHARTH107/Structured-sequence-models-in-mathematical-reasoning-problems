    "message_2": "To find the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the formula:\n\nFractal Dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scale factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4) and the scale factor is 1/3 (s = 1/3).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite the denominator as:\n\nD = log(4) / -log(3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the logarithms:\n\nD ≈ log(4) / -log(3) ≈ 1.2619\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve when the scale factor is set to 1/3 is approximately 1.2619."
