    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom, which is often used to study chaotic behavior in dynamical systems. The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the rate of divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories in phase space, and it is used to characterize the chaotic behavior of a system.\n\nComputing the Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon-Heiles system is a complex task that typically requires numerical methods and simulations. It is not possible to provide an exact value for the Lyapunov exponent without conducting these simulations.\n\nHowever, you can use software packages like Python with libraries such as SciPy or MATLAB to perform the necessary calculations and obtain an estimate of the Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters (α=1, β=1, γ=1, and δ=1)."
