    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path: A -> B -> D -> F. The bottleneck capacity is 3. We update the residual capacities:\n\nA -> B: 3 (3 used)\nA -> C: 5\nB -> D: 0 (3 used)\nC -> D: 5\nC -> E: 3\nD -> F: 2 (3 used)\nE -> F: 4\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: A -> C -> D -> F. The bottleneck capacity is 2. We update the residual capacities:\n\nA -> B: 3\nA -> C: 3 (2 used)\nB -> D: 0\nC -> D: 3 (2 used)\nC -> E: 3\nD -> F: 0 (2 used)\nE -> F: 4\n\n3. We find another augmenting path: A -> C -> E -> F. The bottleneck capacity is 3. We update the residual capacities:\n\nA -> B: 3\nA -> C: 0 (3 used)\nB -> D: 0\nC -> D: 3\nC -> E: 0 (3 used)\nD -> F: 0\nE -> F: 1 (3 used)\n\n4. No more augmenting paths can be found. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows on the paths we found: 3 + 2 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node F in this network is 8."
