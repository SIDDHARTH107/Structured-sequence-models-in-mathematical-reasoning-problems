    "message_2": "To find the population of rabbits after 6 months, we need to calculate $R_6$. We can do this by using the given recurrence relation and the initial values $R_0=1$ and $R_1=1$. \n\n$R_2 = R_1 + R_0 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n$R_3 = R_2 + R_1 = 2 + 1 = 3$\n\n$R_4 = R_3 + R_2 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n\n$R_5 = R_4 + R_3 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n\n$R_6 = R_5 + R_4 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n\nSo, the population of rabbits after 6 months is 13."
