    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two planes, we need to find the difference between their bearings.\n\nThe bearing of the first plane is 30 degrees, and the bearing of the second plane is 120 degrees.\n\nThe angle between the two planes is the absolute difference between their bearings:\n\nAngle = |120 - 30|\n\nAngle = |90|\n\nAngle = 90 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two planes is 90 degrees."
