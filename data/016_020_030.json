    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by iteratively removing smaller tetrahedrons from a larger one. In each iteration, the number of smaller tetrahedrons increases by a factor of 4. \n\nTo find the total number of smaller tetrahedrons after 7 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedrons = 4^n - 1, where n is the number of iterations.\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedrons = 4^7 - 1\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedrons = 16,384 - 1\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedrons = 16,383\n\nSo, 16,383 smaller tetrahedrons are required to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron through seven iterations."
