    "message_1": "A group of 5 volunteers want to paint a community center. If all 5 volunteers show up, each person will only have to work for 2 hours. However, if just 1 volunteer does not show up, each person will have to work for 5 hours. If each volunteer values their time equally and their time is worth $15 per hour, what is the cost to the group of one person not showing up to paint?",
    "message_2": "If all 5 volunteers show up, the total time spent by the group would be 5 volunteers * 2 hours = 10 hours. The total cost for the group would be 10 hours * $15 per hour = $150.\n\nIf 1 volunteer does not show up, there will be 4 volunteers left. The total time spent by the group would be 4 volunteers * 5 hours = 20 hours. The total cost for the group would be 20 hours * $15 per hour = $300.\n\nThe cost to the group of one person not showing up to paint is the difference between the total cost with 4 volunteers and the total cost with 5 volunteers, which is $300 - $150 = $150."
