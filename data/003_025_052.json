    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector of the plane, we can break down the velocity into its components along the East (x-axis) and North (y-axis) directions. We can use trigonometry to find these components.\n\nLet Vx be the component of the velocity along the East direction and Vy be the component of the velocity along the North direction.\n\nVx = V * cos(θ)\nVy = V * sin(θ)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (500 km/h) and θ is the angle (30 degrees) to the North of East.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nθ = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the components:\n\nVx = 500 * cos(π/6) = 500 * (√3/2) = 250√3 km/h\nVy = 500 * sin(π/6) = 500 * (1/2) = 250 km/h\n\nNow that we have the components, we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(Vx^2 + Vy^2) = √((250√3)^2 + (250)^2) = √(187500 + 62500) = √250000 = 500 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector is 500 km/h, which is the same as the given speed of the plane.\n\nTo find the direction of the velocity vector, we can use the arctangent function:\n\ntan(φ) = Vy / Vx = 250 / (250√3)\n\nφ = arctan(250 / (250√3)) = arctan(1/√3)\n\nφ = π/6 radians = 30 degrees\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector is 30 degrees to the North of East, which is the same as the given direction of the plane.\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector of the plane are 500 km/h and 30 degrees to the North of East, respectively."
