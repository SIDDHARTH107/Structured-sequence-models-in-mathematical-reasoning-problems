    "message_2": "A meromorphic function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on its domain except for a finite or countable number of isolated singularities, which are poles. A pole of order n is a point z_0 such that the function has a Laurent series expansion with a finite number of negative powers of (z - z_0) up to the power of -(n+1).\n\nTo find the poles of the function f(z) = (z - 1) / (z + 2), we first look for the points where the denominator is zero:\n\nz + 2 = 0\nz = -2\n\nSo, there is a pole at z = -2. To find the order of this pole, we can rewrite f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1) / (z + 2) = 1 / (z + 2) - 3 / (z + 2)\n\nNow, we can see that the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = -2 has only one negative power term, which is -3 / (z + 2). Therefore, the pole at z = -2 is of order 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) has one pole at z = -2 with order 1."
