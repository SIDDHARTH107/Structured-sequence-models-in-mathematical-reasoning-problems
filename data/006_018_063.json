    "message_2": "Given that historically 3 out of every 100 companies of this size face such an issue each year, the probability of a company experiencing at least one fraud case involving embezzlement is 3/100 or 0.03.\n\nTo find the probability of the opposite event (not experiencing any fraud case), we can subtract the probability of experiencing a fraud case from 1:\n\n1 - 0.03 = 0.97\n\nNow, we can use this probability to calculate the probability of at least one fraud case occurring in a company with 50 employees over the course of a year.\n\nThe probability of no fraud cases occurring in a company with 50 employees is (0.97)^50, since each employee has a 0.97 chance of not being involved in a fraud case.\n\nThe probability of at least one fraud case occurring is the opposite of no fraud cases occurring, so we can subtract the probability of no fraud cases from 1:\n\n1 - (0.97)^50 â‰ˆ 0.785\n\nSo, the probability that a company with 50 employees will experience at least one fraud case involving embezzlement over the course of a year is approximately 78.5%."
