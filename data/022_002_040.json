Write the explicit formula for the conformal mapping function.\n\nSolution: \nThe desired conformal map is $f(z) = \\frac{1+z}{1-z}$. We can verify that $f(0)=1$, and $f(\\mathbb{D})=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:\\mathrm{Re}(z)>0\\}$ by checking that $f$ maps the boundary of $\\mathbb{D}$ (the unit circle) to the boundary of the right half-plane (the imaginary axis). To write the explicit formula, we observe that $f(z)$ can be written as\n$$\nf(z) = \\frac{(1+z)(1+\\overline{z})}{(1-z)(1-\\overline{z})}\n= \\frac{1+\\mathrm{Re}(z)}{|1-z|^2}.\n$$\nTherefore, the preimage of a point $z$ in the right half-plane is given by the equation $\\mathrm{Re}(w)=\\frac{z}{2}$, and the preimage of $1$ is $0$.",
