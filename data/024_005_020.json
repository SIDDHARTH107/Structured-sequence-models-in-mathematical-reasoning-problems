    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 1, -1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\nLet's parameterize the surface by letting x = u and y = v. Then, the position vector of the surface is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^3 + v^3 - 3uv)\n\nNow, we need to find the first partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 6u)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, -3)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 6v)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v) • (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v) = 1 + (3u^2 - 3v)^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v) • (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u) = (3u^2 - 3v)(3v^2 - 3u)\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u) • (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u) = 1 + (3v^2 - 3u)^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 6u) • N\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, -3) • N\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 6v) • N\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which can be found by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (3u^2 - 3v, 3v^2 - 3u, 1)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms at the point (1, 1, -1), which corresponds to u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + (3 - 3)^2 = 1\nF = (3 - 3)(3 - 1) = 0\nG = 1 + (3 - 3)^2 = 1\n\nL = (0, 0, 6) • (0, 2, 1) = 6\nM = (0, 0, -3) • (0, 2, 1) = -3\nN = (0, 0, 6) • (0, 2, 1) = 6\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by solving the following equation:\n\nk^2 - (L + N)k + (LN - M^2) = 0\n\nk^2 - 12k + (6*6 - (-3)^2) = 0\nk^2 - 12k + 27 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = 6 - 3√3\nk2 = 6 + 3√3\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 1, -1) are k1 = 6 - 3√3 and k2 = 6 + 3√3."
