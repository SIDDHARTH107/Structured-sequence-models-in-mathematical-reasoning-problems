    "message_1": "Two suspects A and B are under investigation for a robbery. The police interrogates both suspects separately and offers each of them the same deal: If one of them confesses but the other remains silent, the confessor will go free and the silent one will go to jail for 10 years. If both remain silent, they will both be charged with a lesser crime and go to jail for 2 years each. If both confess, they will both go to jail for 8 years each. If suspect A confesses and suspect B remains silent, what is the maximum number of years that suspect A can avoid in jail?",
    "message_2": "If suspect A confesses and suspect B remains silent, suspect A will go free. In this scenario, the maximum number of years that suspect A can avoid in jail is 10 years (the difference between going free and the worst-case scenario of going to jail for 10 years if they remained silent and suspect B confessed)."
