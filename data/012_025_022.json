    "message_2": "To find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph G with 8 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.\n2. Since each vertex has a degree of 3, we can assume that the graph is connected and has no isolated vertices.\n3. Next, we can start constructing the Hamiltonian cycle by connecting the vertices in a way that ensures each vertex is visited exactly once.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle in G can be:\n\nA - B - C - D - E - F - G - H - A\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex A, forming a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there might be multiple Hamiltonian cycles in a graph, and the one provided above is just one example. The existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a well-known NP-complete problem, meaning that finding a solution can be computationally difficult for large graphs."
