The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a₀/2) + Σ[(aₙ * cos(n * x)) + (bₙ * sin(n * x))], where the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1] dx, from -π to π\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx, from -π to π\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx, from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's compute a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[x] dx, from -π to π\na₀ = (1/π) * [(x^2/2) evaluated from -π to π]\na₀ = (1/π) * [(π^2/2) - (-π^2/2)]\na₀ = (1/π) * (π^2)\na₀ = 0\n\nNow, let's compute aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx, from -π to π\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx = x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - ∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x)] dx\n\nNow, integrate (1/n) * sin(n * x) with respect to x:\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x)] dx = (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx = x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, we can compute aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\naₙ = (1/π) * [(π * (1/n) * sin(n * π) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * π)) - (-π * (1/n) * sin(n * (-π)) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * (-π)))]\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - cos(n * (-π)))]\naₙ = 0 (since cos(n * π) = cos(n * (-π)))\n\nFinally, let's compute bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx, from -π to π\n\nWe already computed the integral of x * sin(n * x) using integration by parts:\n\n∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx = x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nSo, bₙ = (1/π) * [x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(π * (1/n) * sin(n * π) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * π)) - (-π * (1/n) * sin(n * (-π)) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * (-π)))]\nbₙ = (1/π) * [2 * (1/n^2) * cos(n * π) - 2 * (1/n^2) * cos(n * (-π))]\nbₙ = (2/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(n * x)], where the sum is from n = 1 to infinity."
