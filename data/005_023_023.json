    "message_1": "Suppose you are analyzing the salaries of employees in a company, and you suspect there are some outliers in the data. You calculate the mean salary to be $50,000 and the standard deviation to be $10,000. \n\na) Determine the range of salaries that fall within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\nb) If you find a salary of $85,000, is it considered an outlier? \n\nc) If you remove the outlier found in part (b), what is the new mean and standard deviation of the data?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the range of salaries that fall within one standard deviation of the mean, we need to add and subtract the standard deviation from the mean. \n\nMean - Standard Deviation = $50,000 - $10,000 = $40,000\nMean + Standard Deviation = $50,000 + $10,000 = $60,000\n\nSo, the range of salaries within one standard deviation of the mean is $40,000 to $60,000.\n\nb) To determine if a salary of $85,000 is an outlier, we can use the rule of thumb that states any data point more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean is considered an outlier. \n\nMean + 2 * Standard Deviation = $50,000 + 2 * $10,000 = $70,000\n\nSince $85,000 is greater than $70,000, it is considered an outlier.\n\nc) To calculate the new mean and standard deviation after removing the outlier, we would need to know the total number of data points (salaries) and the sum of all the salaries. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the problem, so we cannot calculate the new mean and standard deviation."
