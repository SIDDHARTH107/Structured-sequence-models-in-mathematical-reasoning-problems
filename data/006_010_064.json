    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 people being affected, we can first find the probabilities of 0 and 1 person being affected and then subtract those probabilities from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of 0 people being affected:\nP(0) = (1 - 0.3)^10 = 0.7^10 ≈ 0.0282\n\nNow let's find the probability of 1 person being affected:\nP(1) = C(10, 1) * (0.3)^1 * (0.7)^9\nP(1) = 10 * 0.3 * 0.7^9 ≈ 0.1211\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 people being affected:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) ≈ 1 - 0.0282 - 0.1211 ≈ 0.8507\n\nSo, the probability of at least 2 people in a group of 10 individuals being affected by the disease is approximately 0.8507 or 85.07%."
