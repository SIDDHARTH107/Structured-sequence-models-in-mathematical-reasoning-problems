    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $100 to split with Player 2. Player 1 can choose to keep any amount of money or give any amount of money to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, both players keep their respective amounts. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. Assume that Player 2 will accept any amount of money greater than $0. What is the minimum amount of money Player 1 should give to Player 2 to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Since Player 2 will accept any amount of money greater than $0, Player 1 should give the smallest amount possible while still ensuring that Player 2 accepts the offer. In this case, the minimum amount Player 1 should give to Player 2 is $1. This way, Player 1 maximizes their own payoff by keeping $99."
