    "message_1": "In a volunteer project, 5 volunteers are needed for the project to succeed. Each volunteer has to contribute a certain amount of time into the project. One volunteer, Anna, contributes 2 hours to the project. Another volunteer, Ben, contributes 3 hours. The three remaining volunteers haven't yet decided on how much time to spend on the project. If none of them contribute, the project will fail, but if at least one of them contributes, the project will succeed, and every volunteer will reap a reward of 6 hours of community service. However, there's a cost to volunteering - for every hour of time one spends on the project, they would have to give up an hour of leisure time. \nWhat are the highest and lowest amounts of time that each of the three remaining volunteers should contribute to maximize their rewards in this situation?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their rewards, the three remaining volunteers should aim to minimize the time they spend on the project while still ensuring the project's success. Since Anna has contributed 2 hours and Ben has contributed 3 hours, the project already has 5 hours of work completed. \n\nFor the project to succeed, at least one of the remaining volunteers needs to contribute some time. The lowest amount of time one of them can contribute is 1 hour. In this case, the other two volunteers can contribute 0 hours. This way, the project will have a total of 6 hours of work completed, which is enough for it to succeed. The volunteer who contributed 1 hour will have a net gain of 5 hours of community service (6 hours reward - 1 hour of leisure time), while the other two volunteers will have a net gain of 6 hours of community service (6 hours reward - 0 hours of leisure time).\n\nAs for the highest amount of time, there is no upper limit since the volunteers can contribute as much time as they want. However, contributing more time will not increase their rewards, as the reward is fixed at 6 hours of community service. Therefore, to maximize their rewards, the remaining volunteers should aim to minimize their time contributions.\n\nIn summary, the lowest and highest amounts of time that each of the three remaining volunteers should contribute to maximize their rewards are:\n\n- Volunteer 1: 1 hour (lowest) and any higher amount (highest, but not recommended)\n- Volunteer 2: 0 hours (lowest and highest)\n- Volunteer 3: 0 hours (lowest and highest)"
