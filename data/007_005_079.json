    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 18, and 20, we first find the prime factors of each number:\n\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n20 = 2^2 * 5\n\nNext, we take the highest power of each prime factor present in the numbers:\n\n2^2, 3^2, and 5\n\nNow, multiply these prime factors together:\n\n2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 18, and 20 is 180."
