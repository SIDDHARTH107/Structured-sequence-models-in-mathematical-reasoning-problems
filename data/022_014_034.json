    "message_2": "To find the harmonic conjugate $g(z)$ of $f(z)$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of $f(z)$ with respect to the real and imaginary parts of $z$. Let $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then we have:\n\n$f(z) = \\text{Im}((x+iy)^2) + \\text{Re}(x+iy) = \\text{Im}(x^2 + 2ixy - y^2) + x = 2xy + x$.\n\nNow we find the partial derivatives of $f(z)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2y + 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2x$.\n\nLet $g(z) = u(x, y)$, where $u$ is a real-valued function of $x$ and $y$. Since $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are harmonic conjugates, they must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\n\nSubstituting the partial derivatives of $f(z)$, we get:\n\n$2y + 1 = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$ and $2x = -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\n\nNow we integrate each equation:\n\n(1) $\\int (2y + 1) dy = 2xy + y + C_1(x)$, where $C_1(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\n(2) $\\int -2x dx = -x^2 + C_2(y)$, where $C_2(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$.\n\nComparing (1) and (2), we can see that $u(x, y) = 2xy + y - x^2 + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Thus, the harmonic conjugate $g(z) = 2xy + y - x^2 + C$.\n\nNow we find the complex analytic function $h(z) = f(z) + ig(z)$:\n\n$h(z) = (2xy + x) + i(2xy + y - x^2 + C) = x(2y + 1) + i(2xy - x^2 + y + C)$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $h(2+3i)$:\n\n$h(2+3i) = 2(2\\cdot3 + 1) + i(2\\cdot2\\cdot3 - 2^2 + 3 + C) = 14 + i(6 + C)$.\n\nSo, $h(2+3i) = 14 + i(6 + C)$."
