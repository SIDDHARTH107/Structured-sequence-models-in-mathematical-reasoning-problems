    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + x^2, then the curve is defined by F(x, y) = 0. Now, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\nF_x = ∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 2x\nF_y = ∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nA point (x, y) on the curve is singular if both F_x and F_y are zero at that point. Since F_y = 2y, a singular point must have y = 0. Now we need to find the x-coordinates of the singular points by setting F_x = 0:\n\n-3x^2 + 2x = 0\nx(-3x + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible x-coordinates: x = 0 and x = 2/3. Since y = 0, the two candidate singular points are (0, 0) and (2/3, 0).\n\nNow we need to determine the type of these singular points (node or cusp) by computing the second-order partial derivatives and evaluating the discriminant Δ:\n\nF_xx = ∂²F/∂x² = -6x + 2\nF_yy = ∂²F/∂y² = 2\nF_xy = ∂²F/∂x∂y = 0\n\nThe discriminant Δ is given by Δ = F_xx * F_yy - (F_xy)^2. We evaluate Δ at each candidate singular point:\n\nAt (0, 0): Δ = (-6(0) + 2)(2) - (0)^2 = 4 > 0, so (0, 0) is a node.\n\nAt (2/3, 0): Δ = (-6(2/3) + 2)(2) - (0)^2 = (-4)(2) - 0 = -8 < 0, so (2/3, 0) is a cusp.\n\nThus, the curve has a node at (0, 0) and a cusp at (2/3, 0)."
