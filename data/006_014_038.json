    "message_1": "The probability of a technological failure occurring in a system is 0.05. If there are 2000 systems, what is the probability that at least 100 systems will experience a failure?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (failures in this case) out of n trials (systems)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a single success (failure in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (systems)\n- k is the number of successes (failures)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least 100 failures, which means we need to find the probability of 100 failures, 101 failures, 102 failures, ..., up to 2000 failures. To find the probability of at least 100 failures, we can sum up the probabilities of each of these individual cases.\n\nHowever, calculating this directly can be quite tedious and computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that:\n\nP(at least 100 failures) = 1 - P(less than 100 failures)\n\nThis means we only need to calculate the probability of 0 to 99 failures and subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of less than 100 failures:\n\nP(less than 100 failures) = P(0 failures) + P(1 failure) + ... + P(99 failures)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities using the binomial formula:\n\nn = 2000\np = 0.05\n\nP(less than 100 failures) = Σ [C(2000, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(2000-k)] for k = 0 to 99\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF). Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(less than 100 failures) ≈ 0.9838\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 100 failures:\n\nP(at least 100 failures) = 1 - P(less than 100 failures) = 1 - 0.9838 ≈ 0.0162\n\nSo, the probability that at least 100 systems will experience a failure is approximately 0.0162 or 1.62%."
