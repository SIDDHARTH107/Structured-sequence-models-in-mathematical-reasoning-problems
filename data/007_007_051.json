    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation x^2 + y^2 = 25, we can start by listing the possible values of x and y that are integers and satisfy the equation.\n\nSince 25 is a relatively small number, we can simply try out different integer values for x and y and see if they satisfy the equation. We can start with x = -5 and work our way up to x = 5, and do the same for y.\n\nHere are the integer solutions to the equation x^2 + y^2 = 25:\n\n1. x = -5, y = 0\n2. x = -4, y = -3\n3. x = -4, y = 3\n4. x = -3, y = -4\n5. x = -3, y = 4\n6. x = 0, y = -5\n7. x = 0, y = 5\n8. x = 3, y = -4\n9. x = 3, y = 4\n10. x = 4, y = -3\n11. x = 4, y = 3\n12. x = 5, y = 0\n\nThese are all the integer solutions to the Diophantine equation x^2 + y^2 = 25."
