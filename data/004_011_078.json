    "message_1": "A ladder 20 feet long leans against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is initially 5 feet away from the wall and slides away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 15 feet away from the wall?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We know that the ladder has a constant length of 20 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the relationship between x and y as:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n\nNow, we want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 15 feet and dx/dt (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall) is 2 feet per second.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of y when x = 15 feet:\n\n15^2 + y^2 = 20^2\n225 + y^2 = 400\ny^2 = 175\ny = √175\n\nNow, we'll differentiate the equation x^2 + y^2 = 20^2 with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(20^2)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe know that x = 15, dx/dt = 2, and y = √175. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\n2(15)(2) + 2(√175)(dy/dt) = 0\n60 + 2(√175)(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(√175)(dy/dt) = -60\ndy/dt = -60 / (2(√175))\ndy/dt = -30 / √175\n\nTherefore, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -30 / √175 feet per second when the bottom of the ladder is 15 feet away from the wall."
