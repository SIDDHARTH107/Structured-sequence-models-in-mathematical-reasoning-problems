    "message_2": "Let b_i be the Betti numbers of the surface, where i = 0, 1, 2. The Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index i in the Morse function D is greater than or equal to the Betti numbers b_i, i.e., k_i ≥ b_i, where k_i is the number of critical points of index i.\n\nFor a closed surface with genus g and p punctures, the Euler characteristic χ is given by:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g - p\n\nBy the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the Euler characteristic is also equal to the alternating sum of the Betti numbers:\n\nχ = b_0 - b_1 + b_2\n\nNow, let's consider the Morse inequalities for each index i:\n\nk_0 ≥ b_0\nk_1 ≥ b_1\nk_2 ≥ b_2\n\nSumming these inequalities, we get:\n\nk_0 + k_1 + k_2 ≥ b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n\nSince k = k_0 + k_1 + k_2 is the total number of critical points, we have:\n\nk ≥ b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n\nThus, the sum of the Betti numbers of the surface is bounded below by the total number of critical points k:\n\nb_0 + b_1 + b_2 ≥ k"
