    "message_1": "A certain region experiences daily temperature changes represented by the function f(t) = sin(2πt/24), where t is the number of hours since midnight. According to chaos theory, this temperature function contains unpredictable elements that make long-term weather forecasting difficult. \n\nIf the temperature at midnight is 15°C, what will the temperature be at noon the next day? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at noon the next day, we need to evaluate the function f(t) at t = 12 hours.\n\nf(12) = sin(2π(12)/24)\nf(12) = sin(π)\n\nThe sine of π is 0. Therefore, the temperature change at noon is 0°C. Since the temperature at midnight was 15°C, the temperature at noon will also be 15°C."
