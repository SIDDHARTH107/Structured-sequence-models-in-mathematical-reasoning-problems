    "message_1": "A group of 10 farmers share a field for grazing their animals. The field can only support 50 animals, but each farmer can make a profit of $10 per animal. The cost of feeding each animal beyond the capacity of the field is $2 per animal. If each farmer decides to add one more animal to their herd, what is the total profit for the group of farmers and what is the cost of overgrazing the field?",
    "message_2": "If each farmer adds one more animal to their herd, there will be a total of 10 additional animals. The field can support 50 animals, so there will be 60 animals in total.\n\nThe total profit for the group of farmers before considering the cost of overgrazing is:\n10 farmers * 10 additional animals * $10 per animal = $1000\n\nHowever, there are 10 animals beyond the capacity of the field, so the cost of overgrazing is:\n10 additional animals * $2 per animal = $20\n\nTherefore, the total profit for the group of farmers after considering the cost of overgrazing is:\n$1000 - $20 = $980"
