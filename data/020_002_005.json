    "message_1": "A company produces boxes of different sizes that are packed onto delivery trucks. The cost for producing a box of size x is given by C(x) = 10x^2 + 30x + 5, and the maximum capacity of a delivery truck is 1000 cubic meters. What is the maximum number of boxes of the same size that can be loaded onto the truck and what is the size of each box to minimize the cost of production?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of boxes of the same size that can be loaded onto the truck and the size of each box to minimize the cost of production.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. Let n be the number of boxes and x be the size of each box. Since the maximum capacity of the truck is 1000 cubic meters, we have:\n\nn * x ≤ 1000\n\nNow, we need to minimize the cost of production for each box. The cost function is given by:\n\nC(x) = 10x^2 + 30x + 5\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the critical points of the cost function, which occur when the derivative of the cost function is equal to zero. So, let's find the derivative of the cost function:\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (10x^2 + 30x + 5) = 20x + 30\n\nNow, let's set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n20x + 30 = 0\n20x = -30\nx = -30/20 = -3/2\n\nSince the size of the box cannot be negative, this critical point is not valid. However, we can still find the minimum cost by considering the endpoints of the interval [0, 1000/n]. \n\nAt x = 0, the cost function is:\n\nC(0) = 10(0)^2 + 30(0) + 5 = 5\n\nAt x = 1000/n, the cost function is:\n\nC(1000/n) = 10(1000/n)^2 + 30(1000/n) + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of n that minimizes the cost function C(1000/n). To do this, we can use the fact that the cost function is a quadratic function of x, and the minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at its vertex. The vertex of the quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c is given by the point (h, k), where:\n\nh = -b/(2a)\n\nIn our case, a = 10 and b = 30, so:\n\nh = -30/(2*10) = -3/2\n\nSince the size of the box cannot be negative, we need to find the smallest positive integer value of n such that 1000/n ≤ -3/2:\n\n1000/n ≤ -3/2\nn ≥ 1000/(-3/2)\nn ≥ 2000/3 ≈ 666.67\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible value of n is 667. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 667, and the size of each box is:\n\nx = 1000/667 ≈ 1.5 cubic meters\n\nTo minimize the cost of production, the company should produce 667 boxes of size 1.5 cubic meters each."
