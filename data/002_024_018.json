    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm, one parallel side is 12 cm, and the other parallel side is 18 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the shorter non-parallel side \"a\" and the length of the longer non-parallel side \"b\". We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in length between the two parallel sides: 18 cm - 12 cm = 6 cm. Now, we can form two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nIn both right triangles, the height is 8 cm. In the first right triangle, the base is the difference in length between the two parallel sides, which is 6 cm. In the second right triangle, the base is the length of the shorter parallel side, which is 12 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can find the lengths of \"a\" and \"b\":\n\nFor the first right triangle (side \"a\"):\na^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\na^2 = 64 + 36\na^2 = 100\na = √100\na = 10 cm\n\nFor the second right triangle (side \"b\"):\nb^2 = 8^2 + 12^2\nb^2 = 64 + 144\nb^2 = 208\nb = √208\nb ≈ 14.42 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 18 cm + 10 cm + 14.42 cm\nPerimeter ≈ 54.42 cm (rounded to two decimal places)"
