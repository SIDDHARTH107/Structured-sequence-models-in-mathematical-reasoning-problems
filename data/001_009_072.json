    "message_2": "To simplify the algebraic expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power. In this case, we have two terms with the variable x (12x and 2x) and two terms with the variable y (-8y and 5y).\n\nCombine the x terms:\n12x + 2x = 14x\n\nCombine the y terms:\n-8y + 5y = -3y\n\nNow, put the simplified terms together:\n14x - 3y\n\nSo, the simplified algebraic expression is 14x - 3y."
