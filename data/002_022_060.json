    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of $4$ cm and a major radius of $6$ cm. Find its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nIn this case, the minor radius (r) is 4 cm and the major radius (R) is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 6)\n\nVolume = (π * 16) * (12 * π)\n\nVolume = 192 * π^2\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 192π^2 cubic centimeters or approximately 1900.53 cubic centimeters."
