    "message_2": "In a block cipher with a block size of 64 bits, there are 2^64 possible plaintexts, since each bit can be either 0 or 1. Similarly, with a key size of 128 bits, there are 2^128 possible keys. So, the number of possible plaintexts is 2^64, and the number of possible keys is 2^128."
