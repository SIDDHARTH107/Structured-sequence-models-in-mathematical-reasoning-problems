    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that fills a square grid. The total distance covered by a particle following the curve can be calculated based on the order of the curve (n) and the length of each side of the largest square.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n, the total distance covered (D) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = (2^n - 1) * S\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve, and S is the length of each side of the largest square.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n=3 and a largest square with side length 1 unit:\n\nD = (2^3 - 1) * 1\nD = (8 - 1) * 1\nD = 7 units\n\nSo, the total distance covered by a particle following the Hilbert curve of order 3 with a side length of 1 unit is 7 units."
