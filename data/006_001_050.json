    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (flips)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads), which is 6 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 6) = (10C6) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^4)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 10C6:\n\n10C6 = 10! / (6!(10-6)!)\n      = 10! / (6!4!)\n      = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((6*5*4*3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n      = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1)\n      = 210\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^6) = 0.015625\n(0.5^4) = 0.0625\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625\n         â‰ˆ 0.205078125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.2051, or 20.51%."
