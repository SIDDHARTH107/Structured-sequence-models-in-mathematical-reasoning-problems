Additionally, one of the roots is located at $\\frac32i$ and one of the roots is a double root at $2$.",
    "message_2": "It is not possible to find a polynomial function that satisfies both Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra with the given roots. \n\nLiouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function (i.e., a function that is holomorphic on the entire complex plane and has a bounded absolute value) must be constant. In other words, if a function $f(z)$ satisfies $|f(z)| \\le M$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, then $f(z)$ must be a constant function.\n\nHowever, the fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots, counting multiplicity. If we want a polynomial with four roots, including a double root at $2$ and a root at $\\frac{3}{2}i$, we can construct the polynomial as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = (z - 2)^2 (z - \\frac{3}{2}i)(z - a)$$\n\nHere, $a$ is the fourth root, which we have not specified yet. This polynomial has degree 4, and thus cannot be a constant function.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to find a polynomial function that satisfies both Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra with the given roots."
