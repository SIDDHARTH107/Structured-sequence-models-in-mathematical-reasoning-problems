    "message_2": "To find the cosine of 135 degrees, we first need to convert the angle to radians. \n\n135 degrees * (π/180) = (3π/4) radians\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the cosine of the angle. The unit circle has a radius of 1, and the cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n\n135 degrees (or 3π/4 radians) lies in the second quadrant, where the x-coordinate (cosine) is negative. We can use the reference angle of 45 degrees (or π/4 radians) to find the cosine value.\n\ncos(135°) = cos(3π/4) = -cos(π/4)\n\nSince cos(π/4) = √2/2, the cosine of 135 degrees is:\n\ncos(135°) = -√2/2"
