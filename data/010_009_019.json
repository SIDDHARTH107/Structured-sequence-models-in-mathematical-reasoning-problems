    "message_2": "To find the number of triangles in a triangulation of a polygon with n vertices, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = n - 2\n\nIn this case, the polygon has 10 vertices (n = 10), so the number of triangles in its triangulation is:\n\nNumber of triangles = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nThere are 8 triangles in the triangulation of a polygon with 10 vertices."
