    "message_1": "A group of 5 friends have lost a valuable item while traveling together. They decide to offer a cash reward to whoever can correctly guess the value of the lost item. Each friend can submit any number between 1 and 100 as their guess, and the friend with the closest guess to 2/3 of the average of all guesses will win the reward. If the reward is $100, what number should each friend guess to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the guesses of the 5 friends as A, B, C, D, and E. The average of their guesses is (A + B + C + D + E) / 5. To win, a friend needs to guess closest to 2/3 of the average of all guesses. Let's denote the winning guess as W.\n\nW = (2/3) * ((A + B + C + D + E) / 5)\n\nNow, let's assume that all friends are rational and they know that the other friends are also rational. This means that they will all try to guess 2/3 of the average of the guesses. Since they all think alike, they will all guess the same number, which we can denote as X.\n\nSo, A = B = C = D = E = X.\n\nNow, let's substitute this back into the equation for W:\n\nW = (2/3) * ((X + X + X + X + X) / 5)\n\nW = (2/3) * (5X / 5)\n\nW = (2/3) * X\n\nSince all friends are guessing the same number, W = X. Therefore:\n\nX = (2/3) * X\n\nTo solve for X, we can divide both sides by (2/3):\n\nX / (2/3) = (2/3) * X / (2/3)\n\nX * (3/2) = X\n\n(3/2) * X = X\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by X:\n\n(3/2) = 1\n\nThis equation is not true, which means that our initial assumption that all friends would guess the same number is incorrect. However, we can still use the idea of iteratively guessing 2/3 of the average.\n\nIn the first iteration, if all friends assume that the others will guess uniformly between 1 and 100, the average would be 50.5 (the midpoint of the range). So, in the first iteration, each friend should guess 2/3 of 50.5:\n\nX1 = (2/3) * 50.5 ≈ 33.67\n\nIn the second iteration, if all friends assume that the others will guess around 33.67, they should guess 2/3 of 33.67:\n\nX2 = (2/3) * 33.67 ≈ 22.45\n\nWe can continue this process until the guesses converge to a stable value:\n\nX3 = (2/3) * 22.45 ≈ 14.97\nX4 = (2/3) * 14.97 ≈ 9.98\nX5 = (2/3) * 9.98 ≈ 6.65\n\nAt this point, the guesses are converging around 6.65. Therefore, to maximize their chances of winning, each friend should guess around 6.65. However, since they can only submit whole numbers, they should choose either 6 or 7 as their guess."
