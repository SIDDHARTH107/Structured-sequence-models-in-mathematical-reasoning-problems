    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first find the product of the moduli: N = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\nN_2 = N / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\nN_3 = N / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10\nN_5 = N / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n15 * x ≡ 1 (mod 2) => x = 1 (since 15 is odd)\n10 * y ≡ 1 (mod 3) => y = 1 (since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n6 * z ≡ 1 (mod 5) => z = 4 (since 6 * 4 = 24 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n\nNow we can compute the solution x:\nx = 1 * 15 * 1 + 2 * 10 * 1 + 3 * 6 * 4\nx = 15 + 20 + 72\nx = 107\n\nSince 107 is greater than the product of the moduli (30), we need to find the smallest positive integer equivalent to 107 modulo 30:\nx ≡ 107 (mod 30) => x ≡ 17 (mod 30)\n\nSo the smallest possible positive integer value of x that satisfies the given system of congruences is x = 17."
