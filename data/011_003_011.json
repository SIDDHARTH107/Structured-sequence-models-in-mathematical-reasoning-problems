    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value at a specific position can be found using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the row number (counting from 0), k is the column number (counting from 0), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nFor the 9th row and 5th column, we have n = 8 (since we start counting from 0) and k = 4 (also counting from 0). Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, the value in the 9th row and 5th column of Pascal's triangle is 70."
