    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\nlog(base 2)(8x) - log(base 2)(2) = 3\n\nWe can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b):\n\nlog(base 2)(8x/2) = 3\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 2)(4x) = 3\n\nTo solve for x, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = 4x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n8 = 4x\n\nx = 8/4\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2."
