    "message_1": "A guitar string of length 0.75 meters is plucked and generates a wave with a frequency of 440 Hz. The wave travels with a speed of 330 meters per second. Assume that the wave follows a sine function. \n\nWhat is the equation of the wave function representing this wave? What is the wavelength of the wave? What is the maximum displacement of a point on the string from its equilibrium position?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the wave function, we need to determine the wavelength and the amplitude of the wave. \n\nFirst, let's find the wavelength. We can use the formula:\n\nspeed = frequency × wavelength\n\nRearranging the formula to find the wavelength:\n\nwavelength = speed / frequency\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nwavelength = 330 m/s / 440 Hz = 0.75 meters\n\nNow that we have the wavelength, we can write the general equation for a sine wave:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase shift.\n\nThe wave number k is related to the wavelength by the formula:\n\nk = 2π / wavelength\n\nk = 2π / 0.75 ≈ 8.3776 m^(-1)\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the frequency by the formula:\n\nω = 2π * frequency\n\nω = 2π * 440 Hz ≈ 2764.6015 s^(-1)\n\nSince we don't have any information about the phase shift, we can assume it to be 0. The maximum displacement of a point on the string from its equilibrium position is represented by the amplitude A. However, we don't have enough information to determine the amplitude of the wave. \n\nSo, the equation of the wave function representing this wave is:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(8.3776x - 2764.6015t)\n\nThe wavelength of the wave is 0.75 meters, and we cannot determine the maximum displacement (amplitude) without more information."
