    "message_1": "A double pendulum consists of two pendulums attached to each other. The mass of the first pendulum is 2kg, the mass of the second pendulum is 1kg. The length of the first pendulum is 1m, the length of the second  pendulum is 0.5m. Calculate the maximum angle of displacement from the vertical that the double pendulum can achieve before exhibiting chaotic behavior.",
    "message_2": "The behavior of a double pendulum is highly complex and chaotic, and predicting the exact angle at which it will exhibit chaotic behavior is not possible using a simple formula. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations that do not have a closed-form solution.\n\nHowever, we can provide some insights into the factors that influence the chaotic behavior of a double pendulum. The chaotic behavior of a double pendulum is highly sensitive to initial conditions, such as the initial angles and angular velocities of the two pendulums. In general, the larger the initial angles, the more likely the system is to exhibit chaotic behavior.\n\nTo study the behavior of a double pendulum, one can use numerical simulations, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the equations of motion for specific initial conditions. By analyzing the results of these simulations, one can gain a better understanding of the conditions under which the double pendulum exhibits chaotic behavior.\n\nIn summary, it is not possible to provide a specific maximum angle of displacement for the given double pendulum system before it exhibits chaotic behavior. The behavior of a double pendulum is highly complex and depends on the specific initial conditions of the system. Numerical simulations can be used to study the behavior of a double pendulum under various conditions."
