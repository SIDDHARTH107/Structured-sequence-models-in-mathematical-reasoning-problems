    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but there is no numerical problem that can be formulated in Deontic logic. Deontic logic is a branch of modal logic that deals with concepts such as obligation, permission, and prohibition. It uses logical symbols and structures to express relationships between these concepts. It does not involve numerical or quantitative calculations.",
    "message_2": "That's correct. Since there is no numerical problem presented related to Deontic logic, I cannot solve any problem in this context. If you have any other mathematical problem or question, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help."
