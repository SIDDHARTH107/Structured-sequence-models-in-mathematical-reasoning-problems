    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (malfunctioning machines in this case) out of n trials (total machines)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes out of n trials, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (malfunctioning machine) on a single trial\n- n is the total number of trials (total machines)\n- k is the number of successes (malfunctioning machines) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 50 (total machines)\n- k = 3 (malfunctioning machines)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of a machine malfunctioning)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(50-3)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(50, 3):\n\nC(50, 3) = 50! / (3!(50-3)!)\nC(50, 3) = 50! / (3!47!)\nC(50, 3) = (50*49*48)/(3*2*1)\nC(50, 3) = 19600\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 19600 * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(50-3)\nP(X = 3) = 19600 * 0.000125 * 0.95^47\n\nNow, we can calculate the final probability:\n\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.243\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 out of the 50 machines will malfunction in a week is approximately 0.243 or 24.3%."
