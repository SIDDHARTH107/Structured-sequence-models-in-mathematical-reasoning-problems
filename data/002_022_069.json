    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the radius of the circular cross-section of the torus, and major_radius is the distance from the center of the circular cross-section to the center of the torus.\n\nGiven the major radius (R) is 4 cm and the minor radius (r) is 2 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 2^2) * (2 * π * 4)\nVolume = (π * 4) * (8 * π)\nVolume = 32 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is 32π^2 cubic centimeters."
