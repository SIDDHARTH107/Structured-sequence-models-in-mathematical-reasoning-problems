    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The profit per chair is $30 and the profit per table is $50. Each chair requires 3 hours of labor and each table requires 5 hours of labor. The company has 2400 hours of labor available for the next week. However, the company has a contract with a local shop that requires them to produce at least 100 chairs and 50 tables per week. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many chairs and tables should the company produce in the next week to achieve a maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe profit function is P(x, y) = 30x + 50y.\n\nThe labor constraint is 3x + 5y ≤ 2400.\n\nThe contract constraint is x ≥ 100 and y ≥ 50.\n\nTo maximize the profit, we will first find the feasible region based on the constraints:\n\n1. x ≥ 100\n2. y ≥ 50\n3. 3x + 5y ≤ 2400\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (100, 50): This point satisfies all the constraints.\n2. (100, 380): This point satisfies constraints 1 and 2, but not constraint 3.\n3. (700, 50): This point satisfies constraints 1 and 2, but not constraint 3.\n4. (600, 240): This point satisfies all the constraints and is the intersection of the line 3x + 5y = 2400 and x = 100.\n5. (360, 300): This point satisfies all the constraints and is the intersection of the line 3x + 5y = 2400 and y = 50.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(100, 50) = 30(100) + 50(50) = 3000 + 2500 = 5500\n2. P(600, 240) = 30(600) + 50(240) = 18000 + 12000 = 30000\n3. P(360, 300) = 30(360) + 50(300) = 10800 + 15000 = 25800\n\nComparing the profit values, we can see that the maximum profit of $30,000 is achieved when the company produces 600 chairs and 240 tables."
