    "message_1": "A candy company produces two types of candies: chocolate and fruit-flavored. The chocolate candy requires 2 ounces of cocoa, 3 ounces of sugar, and 1 ounce of milk to produce while the fruit-flavored candy requires 1 ounce of flavor, 2 ounces of sugar, and 2 ounces of water to produce. The company has 180 ounces of cocoa, 270 ounces of sugar, 90 ounces of milk, and 120 ounces of flavor. Also, they can use 150 ounces of water. Each chocolate candy can be sold for $0.8 and each fruit-flavored candy can be sold for $0.6. How many chocolate and fruit-flavored candies should the company produce in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate candies and y be the number of fruit-flavored candies.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 0.8x + 0.6y\n\nThe constraints based on the available ingredients are:\n\n2x ≤ 180 (cocoa constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 270 (sugar constraint)\nx ≤ 90 (milk constraint)\ny ≤ 120 (flavor constraint)\n2y ≤ 150 (water constraint)\n\nWe can simplify the constraints:\n\nx ≤ 90 (cocoa constraint)\nx + y ≤ 90 (sugar constraint)\nx ≤ 90 (milk constraint)\ny ≤ 120 (flavor constraint)\ny ≤ 75 (water constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x-axis: 0 to 100\n2. y-axis: 0 to 130\n3. x ≤ 90 (vertical line at x = 90)\n4. x + y ≤ 90 (diagonal line from (90, 0) to (0, 90))\n5. y ≤ 120 (horizontal line at y = 120)\n6. y ≤ 75 (horizontal line at y = 75)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 75), (90, 0), and (90, 75).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 0.8(0) + 0.6(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 75) = 0.8(0) + 0.6(75) = $45\n3. Profit at (90, 0) = 0.8(90) + 0.6(0) = $72\n4. Profit at (90, 75) = 0.8(90) + 0.6(75) = $72 + $45 = $117\n\nThe maximum profit is $117, which occurs when the company produces 90 chocolate candies and 75 fruit-flavored candies."
