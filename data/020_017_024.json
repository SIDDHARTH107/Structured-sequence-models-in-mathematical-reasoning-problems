    "message_1": "Here is an example numerical problem for a math student to solve using Variational optimization:\n\nA manufacturing company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The company has 1000 hours of labor and 400 units of raw material available. Product A requires 5 hours of labor and 2 units of raw material to produce, while Product B requires 3 hours of labor and 4 units of raw material to produce. The profit for Product A is $10 per unit and for Product B is $8 per unit. What is the maximum profit the company can make given the available resources? \n\nThe student will need to formulate an optimization problem to solve this problem, choosing the production quantities of products A and B that maximize profit while respecting the resource constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize):\nP(x, y) = 10x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 5x + 3y ≤ 1000\n2. Raw material constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 400\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then identify the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Labor constraint:\ny ≤ (1000 - 5x) / 3\n\n2. Raw material constraint:\ny ≤ (400 - 2x) / 4\n\nGraphing the constraints, we find the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 100), (200, 0), and (120, 80).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\nP(0, 100) = 10(0) + 8(100) = $800\nP(200, 0) = 10(200) + 8(0) = $2000\nP(120, 80) = 10(120) + 8(80) = $2000\n\nThe maximum profit is $2000, which can be achieved by producing 200 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B or by producing 120 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B."
