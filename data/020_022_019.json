    "message_1": "A company can produce two products: X and Y. To make one unit of X requires 4 units of raw material and 2 hours of labor. To make one unit of Y requires 3 units of raw material and 5 hours of labor. The company has 80 units of raw material and 1000 hours of labor available. If the profit for each unit of X is $40 and each unit of Y is $60. How many units of X and Y should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 4x + 3y ≤ 80 (since there are 80 units of raw material available)\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 5y ≤ 1000 (since there are 1000 hours of labor available)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 40x + 60y (we want to maximize this)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 80\n   y ≤ (80 - 4x)/3\n\n2. 2x + 5y ≤ 1000\n   y ≤ (1000 - 2x)/5\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   4x = 80\n   x = 20\n   Point: (20, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of constraint 2 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   2x = 1000\n   x = 500\n   Point: (500, 0) (This point is not in the feasible region as it doesn't satisfy constraint 1)\n\n3. Intersection of constraint 1 and y-axis (x = 0):\n   3y = 80\n   y ≈ 26.67\n   Point: (0, 26.67)\n\n4. Intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0):\n   5y = 1000\n   y = 200\n   Point: (0, 200) (This point is not in the feasible region as it doesn't satisfy constraint 1)\n\n5. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\n   4x + 3y = 80\n   2x + 5y = 1000\n   Multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract the second equation:\n   8x + 6y - 2x - 5y = 160 - 1000\n   6x + y = -840\n   x = (840 - y)/6\n   Substitute x in constraint 1:\n   4((840 - y)/6) + 3y = 80\n   (3360 - 4y + 18y) / 6 = 80\n   14y = 480\n   y = 480 / 14\n   y = 34.29\n   x = (840 - 34.29) / 6\n   x ≈ 134.29\n   Point: (134.29, 34.29)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function (profit) at each corner point:\n\n1. P(20, 0) = 40(20) + 60(0) = 800\n2. P(0, 26.67) = 40(0) + 60(26.67) ≈ 1600.2\n3. P(134.29, 34.29) = 40(134.29) + 60(34.29) ≈ 5360 + 2057.4 = 7417.4\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (134.29, 34.29) with a profit of approximately $7417.4. Therefore, the company should produce about 134 units of product X and 34 units of product Y to maximize profit."
