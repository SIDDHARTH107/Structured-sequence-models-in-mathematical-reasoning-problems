    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car at time t=2 seconds, we need to integrate the acceleration function a(t) with respect to time. The acceleration function is given by a(t) = 4t.\n\nLet v(t) be the velocity function. Then,\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫4t dt\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nv(t) = 2t² + C\n\nSince the car starts from rest, its initial velocity is 0. Therefore, at t=0, v(0) = 0. We can use this information to find the constant C:\n\n0 = 2(0)² + C\nC = 0\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = 2t²\n\nNow, we can find the velocity of the car at time t=2 seconds:\n\nv(2) = 2(2)² = 2(4) = 8 m/s\n\nThe velocity of the car at time t=2 seconds is 8 m/s."
