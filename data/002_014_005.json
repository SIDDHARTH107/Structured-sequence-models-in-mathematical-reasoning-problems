    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: The top and bottom faces are both rectangles with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm. The area of each face is length × width, so the area of each face is 5 × 3 = 15 square centimeters. Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 15 × 2 = 30 square centimeters.\n\n2. Front and back faces: The front and back faces are both rectangles with a width of 3 cm and a height of 4 cm. The area of each face is width × height, so the area of each face is 3 × 4 = 12 square centimeters. Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 12 × 2 = 24 square centimeters.\n\n3. Left and right faces: The left and right faces are both rectangles with a length of 5 cm and a height of 4 cm. The area of each face is length × height, so the area of each face is 5 × 4 = 20 square centimeters. Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 20 × 2 = 40 square centimeters.\n\nNow, we add the combined areas of all the faces together: 30 + 24 + 40 = 94 square centimeters.\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 square centimeters."
