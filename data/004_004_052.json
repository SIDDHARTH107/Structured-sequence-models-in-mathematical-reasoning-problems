    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 between x = 1 and x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral between the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 1) dx = (x^3/3) + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral between the limits x = 1 and x = 4:\n\nArea = [(x^3/3) + x] evaluated from 1 to 4\n\nArea = [((4^3)/3) + 4] - [((1^3)/3) + 1]\n\nArea = [(64/3) + 4] - [(1/3) + 1]\n\nArea = (64/3) + 4 - (1/3) - 1\n\nArea = (64/3) - (1/3) + 4 - 1\n\nArea = (63/3) + 3\n\nArea = 21 + 3\n\nArea = 24\n\nThe area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 between x = 1 and x = 4 is 24 square units."
