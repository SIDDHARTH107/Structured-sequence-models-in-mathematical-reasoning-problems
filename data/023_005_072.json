    "message_2": "To solve the given second-order differential equation using Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation and then solve it in the frequency domain. Finally, we will take the inverse Fourier transform to get the solution in the time domain.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ny''(t) - 4y(t) = 2e^(3t)\n\nLet's take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of y''(t), we get:\n\nF{y''(t)} = (-jω)^2 * Y(ω) = -ω^2 * Y(ω)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of 4y(t), we get:\n\nF{4y(t)} = 4 * Y(ω)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of 2e^(3t), we get:\n\nF{2e^(3t)} = 2 * ∫[e^(3t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = 2 / (3 - jω)\n\nNow, substituting the Fourier transforms into the original equation, we get:\n\n-ω^2 * Y(ω) - 4 * Y(ω) = 2 / (3 - jω)\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = 2 / [(3 - jω)(-ω^2 - 4)]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get y(t). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[Y(ω) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier transform, we need to find the residues of the poles of Y(ω) and then use the residue theorem. The poles of Y(ω) are at ω = ±2j and ω = 3.\n\nLet's find the residues at these poles:\n\nResidue at ω = 2j:\n\nRes(2j) = lim(ω→2j) [(ω - 2j) * Y(ω)] = 1 / [(3 - 2j)(-4j)]\n\nResidue at ω = -2j:\n\nRes(-2j) = lim(ω→-2j) [(ω + 2j) * Y(ω)] = 1 / [(3 + 2j)(4j)]\n\nResidue at ω = 3:\n\nRes(3) = lim(ω→3) [(ω - 3) * Y(ω)] = 1 / [(-9)]\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the inverse Fourier transform:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) * [2πi * (Res(2j) * e^(2jt) + Res(-2j) * e^(-2jt) + Res(3) * e^(3t))]\n\ny(t) = i * (Res(2j) * e^(2jt) + Res(-2j) * e^(-2jt)) + Res(3) * e^(3t)\n\nSubstituting the residues, we get:\n\ny(t) = i * [(1 / [(3 - 2j)(-4j)]) * e^(2jt) + (1 / [(3 + 2j)(4j)]) * e^(-2jt)] - (1/9) * e^(3t)\n\nNow, we need to simplify this expression and apply the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 0.\n\ny(t) = (1/4) * (e^(2jt) - e^(-2jt)) - (1/9) * e^(3t)\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = (1/4) * (1 - 1) - (1/9) * 1 = 2\ny'(0) = (1/4) * (2j - (-2j)) - (1/9) * 3 = 0\n\nThe given initial conditions are not consistent with the solution obtained using the Fourier transform method. This indicates that the Fourier transform method may not be suitable for solving this particular problem. It is recommended to use other methods, such as Laplace transform or variation of parameters, to solve this differential equation with the given initial conditions."
