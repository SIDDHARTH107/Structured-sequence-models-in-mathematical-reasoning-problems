    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A△B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA△B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8} - {2, 4, 6, 8} = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nNow, let's find (A△B)△A and A△(B△A):\n\n1. (A△B)△A = ({1, 3, 5, 7}△{2, 4, 6, 8})\nSince there are no common elements between {1, 3, 5, 7} and {2, 4, 6, 8}, their symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n(A△B)△A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\n2. A△(B△A) = {2, 4, 6, 8}△{1, 3, 5, 7}\nAgain, there are no common elements between these two sets, so their symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\nA△(B△A) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's address the second part of the question, which is to show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product. Note that the question seems to be slightly incorrect, as the symmetric difference operation (△) and the Cartesian product operation (×) are different operations and cannot be directly compared in terms of associativity. \n\nHowever, we can still demonstrate that the symmetric difference is not associative in general. To do this, we can use a counterexample. Let's consider three sets: A = {1}, B = {2}, and C = {1, 2}. Now, let's find the symmetric differences (A△B)△C and A△(B△C):\n\n1. (A△B)△C = ({1}△{2})△{1, 2}\nFirst, find the symmetric difference of A and B:\nA△B = {1, 2}\nNow, find the symmetric difference of this result with C:\n({1, 2})△{1, 2} = {} (the empty set)\n\n2. A△(B△C) = {1}△({2}△{1, 2})\nFirst, find the symmetric difference of B and C:\nB△C = {1}\nNow, find the symmetric difference of this result with A:\n{1}△{1} = {} (the empty set)\n\nIn this case, the symmetric difference is associative, as (A△B)△C = A△(B△C). However, this does not prove that the symmetric difference is always associative. We can find another counterexample to show that it is not always associative:\n\nLet A = {1}, B = {1, 2}, and C = {2}. Now, let's find the symmetric differences (A△B)△C and A△(B△C):\n\n1. (A△B)△C = ({1}△{1, 2})△{2}\nFirst, find the symmetric difference of A and B:\nA△B = {2}\nNow, find the symmetric difference of this result with C:\n{2}△{2} = {} (the empty set)\n\n2. A△(B△C) = {1}△({1, 2}△{2})\nFirst, find the symmetric difference of B and C:\nB△C = {1}\nNow, find the symmetric difference of this result with A:\n{1}△{1} = {} (the empty set)\n\nIn this case, the symmetric difference is also associative, as (A△B)△C = A△(B△C). However, this still does not prove that the symmetric difference is always associative. The symmetric difference is not associative in general, but it can be associative in specific cases, as shown in the examples above."
