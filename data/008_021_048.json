    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n2 & -4 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n3 & -6 & 3 & 12\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix. We can start by subtracting 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros. This means that the coefficient matrix is a singular matrix, as the hint suggests. In this case, the system of linear equations has either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nSince the second and third rows are all zeros, we can rewrite the system of linear equations as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx - 2y + z &= 4 \\\\\n0 &= 0 \\\\\n0 &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe second and third equations are always true, so they do not impose any restrictions on the variables x, y, and z. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nWe can express the general solution in terms of the free variables y and z:\n\n$$\nx = 4 + 2y - z\n$$\n\nSo, the general solution is given by:\n\n$$\n(x, y, z) = (4 + 2y - z, y, z)\n$$"
