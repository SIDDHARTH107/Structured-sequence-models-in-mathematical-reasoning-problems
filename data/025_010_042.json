    "message_2": "First, let's find the degree of the divisor D. The degree of a divisor is the sum of its coefficients. In this case, the divisor D is given by (p) + (q) - 2(infinity), so its degree is 1 + 1 - 2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the dimension of the space H^0(X, D). Since X is a smooth algebraic curve of genus 2, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles and zeros specified by the divisor D. The Riemann-Roch theorem states:\n\ndim H^0(X, D) - dim H^1(X, D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve X. In our case, deg(D) = 0, and g = 2, so the equation becomes:\n\ndim H^0(X, D) - dim H^1(X, D) = 0 + 1 - 2 = -1.\n\nSince the dimension of a vector space cannot be negative, we must have dim H^0(X, D) = 0. This means that there are no non-constant meromorphic functions on X with poles and zeros specified by the divisor D."
