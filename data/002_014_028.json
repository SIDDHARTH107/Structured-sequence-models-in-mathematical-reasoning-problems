    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top_bottom = 8 cm * 5 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two faces (top and bottom), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_top_bottom = 40 cm² * 2 = 80 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_front_back = 8 cm * 4 cm = 32 cm²\nSince there are two faces (front and back), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_front_back = 32 cm² * 2 = 64 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the width by the height:\nArea_left_right = 5 cm * 4 cm = 20 cm²\nSince there are two faces (left and right), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_left_right = 20 cm² * 2 = 40 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nTotal_surface_area = Total_area_top_bottom + Total_area_front_back + Total_area_left_right\nTotal_surface_area = 80 cm² + 64 cm² + 40 cm² = 184 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 184 cm²."
