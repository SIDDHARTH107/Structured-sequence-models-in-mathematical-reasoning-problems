    "message_1": "A right triangle has one side with a length of 5 cm and another side with a length of 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). In equation form, this is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, we have a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc^2 = 5^2 + 12^2\nc^2 = 25 + 144\nc^2 = 169\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = âˆš169\nc = 13 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 13 cm."
