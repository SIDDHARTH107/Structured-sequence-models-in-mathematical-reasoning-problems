    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number, we need to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We can start by coloring the graph step by step.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertices 2 and 3 with color B, as they are both adjacent to vertex 1.\n3. Color vertex 4 with color A, as it is adjacent to vertices 2 and 3, which have color B.\n4. Color vertex 5 with color B, as it is adjacent to vertex 4, which has color A.\n5. Color vertex 6 with color A, as it is adjacent to vertex 5, which has color B.\n6. Color vertex 7 with color B, as it is adjacent to vertex 6, which has color A.\n7. Color vertices 8 and 9 with color A, as they are both adjacent to vertex 7, which has color B.\n8. Color vertex 10 with color B, as it is adjacent to vertex 8, which has color A.\n\nThe graph is now colored with no two adjacent vertices having the same color, and we used only two colors (A and B). Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph is 2."
