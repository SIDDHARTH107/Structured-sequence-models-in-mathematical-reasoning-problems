    "message_1": "In a basketball team, there are 12 players. The coach wants to select a starting lineup of 5 players. How many different lineups can the coach select from the team?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different lineups the coach can select, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (12), k is the number of players in the lineup (5), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!7!)\n\nC(12, 5) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(12, 5) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(12, 5) = 95040 / 120\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nSo, the coach can select 792 different lineups from the team."
