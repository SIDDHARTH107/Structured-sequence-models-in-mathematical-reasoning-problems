    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x-3)/(x+1) = 3/(x-2), we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x-3)(x-2) = 3(x+1)\n\nNow, we will expand both sides of the equation:\n\n(2x - 3)(x - 2) = 2x^2 - 7x + 6\n3(x + 1) = 3x + 3\n\nNow, we will subtract the right side of the equation from the left side:\n\n2x^2 - 7x + 6 - 3x - 3 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 - 10x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve for x, we can either factor the equation, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. In this case, we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 2, b = -10, and c = 3. Plug these values into the formula:\n\nx = (10 ± √((-10)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (10 ± √(100 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (10 ± √76) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (10 + √76) / 4\nx = (10 - √76) / 4\n\nThese are the two solutions for x in the given equation."
