    "message_1": "Suppose you have $100,000 to invest in a portfolio consisting of two assets: stock A and stock B. The expected return of stock A is 8% with a standard deviation of 12%, and the expected return of stock B is 12% with a standard deviation of 20%. The correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.4. What is the optimal allocation of funds between the two assets to maximize the expected return of the portfolio while keeping the risk (measured by standard deviation) at a maximum of 15%?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the proportion of the investment in stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in stock B.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = x * Expected Return of Stock A + (1-x) * Expected Return of Stock B\nRp = 0.08x + 0.12(1-x)\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp = sqrt[(x^2 * σa^2) + ((1-x)^2 * σb^2) + (2 * x * (1-x) * ρ * σa * σb)]\n\nWhere σa and σb are the standard deviations of stock A and B, respectively, and ρ is the correlation coefficient between the two stocks.\n\nσp = sqrt[(x^2 * 0.12^2) + ((1-x)^2 * 0.20^2) + (2 * x * (1-x) * 0.4 * 0.12 * 0.20)]\n\nWe want to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk at a maximum of 15% (σp ≤ 0.15). To find the optimal allocation, we can set σp equal to 0.15 and solve for x:\n\n0.15 = sqrt[(x^2 * 0.12^2) + ((1-x)^2 * 0.20^2) + (2 * x * (1-x) * 0.4 * 0.12 * 0.20)]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n0.0225 = (x^2 * 0.0144) + ((1-x)^2 * 0.04) + (2 * x * (1-x) * 0.0096)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n0.0225 = 0.0144x^2 + 0.04 - 0.08x + 0.04x^2 + 0.0192x - 0.0192x^2\n\nCombining terms:\n\n0.0225 = 0.0352x^2 - 0.0608x + 0.04\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n0.0352x^2 - 0.0608x + 0.0175 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (0.0608 ± sqrt(0.0608^2 - 4 * 0.0352 * 0.0175)) / (2 * 0.0352)\n\nx ≈ 0.595 or x ≈ 0.834\n\nSince x represents the proportion of the investment in stock A, it must be between 0 and 1. Both solutions are within this range, but we want to maximize the expected return. We can plug both values of x back into the expected return equation (Rp) and see which one gives a higher return:\n\nRp(0.595) ≈ 0.08(0.595) + 0.12(1-0.595) ≈ 0.1034 or 10.34%\nRp(0.834) ≈ 0.08(0.834) + 0.12(1-0.834) ≈ 0.0927 or 9.27%\n\nThe higher expected return is achieved with x ≈ 0.595. Therefore, the optimal allocation is to invest approximately 59.5% of the funds in stock A and the remaining 40.5% in stock B. In terms of the initial $100,000 investment, this would mean investing $59,500 in stock A and $40,500 in stock B."
