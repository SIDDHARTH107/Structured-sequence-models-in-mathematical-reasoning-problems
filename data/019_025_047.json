    "message_2": "If completing homework on time is necessary for getting an A on the assignment, then at most 20 students (those who completed their homework before the deadline) are likely to get an A. However, this does not guarantee that all 20 students will get an A, as there may be other factors affecting their grades, such as the quality of their work."
