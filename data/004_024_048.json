    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as an implicit function of x. \n\nThe given equation is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + xy = 9\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) + x(dy/dx) + y = 0\n\nNow, we will solve for dy/dx:\n\n(dy/dx)(2y + x) = -2x - y\n\n(dy/dx) = (-2x - y) / (2y + x)\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at the point (1, 2):\n\n(dy/dx) = (-2(1) - 2) / (2(2) + 1)\n\n(dy/dx) = (-4) / (5)\n\n(dy/dx) = -4/5\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (1, 2) is -4/5."
