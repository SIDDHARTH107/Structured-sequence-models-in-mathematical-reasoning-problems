    "message_2": "A x B is the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB x A is the Cartesian product of sets B and A, which consists of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. For example, (1, 4) is in A x B but not in B x A, and (4, 1) is in B x A but not in A x B. Therefore, A x B is not equal to B x A."
