    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to hypothesis testing:\n\nA company claims that their new product length is 15 inches, but the quality control team suspects that the actual length may differ from the claimed length. To test this hypothesis, 25 products are selected randomly and their lengths are measured. The sample mean length of the products is found to be 14.5 inches with a standard deviation of 1.2 inches. Test the hypothesis at a 5% level of significance.\n\nWhat is the null and alternative hypothesis? What is the test statistic and p-value for the test? What is the conclusion of the test?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to define the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\nNull Hypothesis (H0): The actual length of the product is equal to the claimed length, i.e., μ = 15 inches.\nAlternative Hypothesis (H1): The actual length of the product is not equal to the claimed length, i.e., μ ≠ 15 inches.\n\nNow, we will perform a two-tailed t-test to test the hypothesis at a 5% level of significance.\n\nGiven:\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = 14.5 inches\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 1.2 inches\nClaimed length (μ) = 15 inches\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 25, which is relatively small, we will use the t-distribution. First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) and the t-score.\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n = 1.2 / √25 = 1.2 / 5 = 0.24\n\nT-score = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (14.5 - 15) / 0.24 = -0.5 / 0.24 = -2.083\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1) and α = 0.05. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.064.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.083) falls within the critical region (less than -2.064 or greater than 2.064), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nNow, let's find the p-value. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the p-value for a t-score of -2.083 with 24 degrees of freedom to be approximately 0.048.\n\nSince the p-value (0.048) is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: Based on the sample data, there is enough evidence to conclude that the actual length of the product is significantly different from the claimed length of 15 inches at a 5% level of significance."
