    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The production cost for each unit of product A is $20, and for product B, it is $30. The company has a monthly budget of $15,000 for production costs. Product A can be sold for a profit of $10 per unit, and product B can be sold for a profit of $15 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal number of units of each product to produce per month. Using the whale optimization algorithm, what is the maximum profit the company can achieve?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can provide you with a solution using linear programming, but I am unable to use the whale optimization algorithm as it is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm that requires a computer program to execute. However, I can help you set up the problem and solve it using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints (production costs and non-negativity):\n20x + 30y ≤ 15,000 (monthly budget)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem using linear programming, we can graph the constraint inequalities and find the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nGraphing the constraints:\n\n20x + 30y ≤ 15,000\ny ≤ (15,000 - 20x) / 30\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 500), and (750, 0).\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\nP(0, 500) = 10(0) + 15(500) = 7,500\nP(750, 0) = 10(750) + 15(0) = 7,500\n\nThe maximum profit is $7,500, which can be achieved by producing either 750 units of product A and 0 units of product B or 0 units of product A and 500 units of product B."
