    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3i, we will use the basic rules of differentiation for complex functions. \n\nThe derivative of a function f(z) with respect to z is given by:\n\nf'(z) = d(f(z))/dz\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3i:\n\nf'(z) = d(z^2)/dz - d(2z)/dz + d(3i)/dz\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of z^2 with respect to z is 2z. The derivative of 2z with respect to z is 2. The derivative of a constant (3i) with respect to z is 0.\n\nSo, f'(z) = 2z - 2\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at the point z = 2i:\n\nf'(2i) = 2(2i) - 2\nf'(2i) = 4i - 2\n\nThus, the derivative of the function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3i at the point z = 2i is f'(2i) = 4i - 2."
