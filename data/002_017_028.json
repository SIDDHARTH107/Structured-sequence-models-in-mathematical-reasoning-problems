    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (side^2 * √3) / 4. In this case, the side length is 7 cm.\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (7^2 * √3) / 4 = (49 * √3) / 4\n\nNow, multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * ((49 * √3) / 4) = (294 * √3) / 4 ≈ 75.93 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the hexagon is approximately 75.93 cm²."
