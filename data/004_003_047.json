    "message_1": "A rectangular plot of land measures 60 meters by 80 meters. If you want to enclose the plot with a fence and want to minimize the cost, how much fencing should you use and what will be the cost? Assume that fencing costs $15 per meter.",
    "message_2": "To enclose the rectangular plot of land, you will need to put fencing along all four sides. The total length of fencing required can be calculated using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 60 meters and the width is 80 meters. So, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (60 + 80) = 2 * 140 = 280 meters\n\nNow, to find the cost of the fencing, multiply the total length of fencing required by the cost per meter:\n\nCost = Total length of fencing * Cost per meter\nCost = 280 meters * $15 per meter = $4200\n\nSo, you will need 280 meters of fencing, and the cost will be $4200."
