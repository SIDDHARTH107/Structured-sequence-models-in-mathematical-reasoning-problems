    "message_2": "The power set of a set A is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The size of the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A.\n\nIn this case, A = {1, 2, 3}, so n = 3. Therefore, the size of the power set of A is 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A with the size of set A:\n\nSize of set A = 3 (since it has 3 elements: 1, 2, and 3)\nSize of the power set of A = 8\n\nSo, the size of the power set of A (8) is larger than the size of set A (3)."
