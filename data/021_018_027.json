    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is typically used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, we can still apply the general idea of the tabu search method to find the maximum value of the given function f(x) = -x^4 + 5x^3 - 10x + 3 over the range [-2, 3].\n\n1. Initialization: Choose an initial solution x0 and set the tabu list size (e.g., 5). Let's start with x0 = -2.\n\n2. Neighborhood search: Generate a set of neighboring solutions (e.g., by adding/subtracting a small step size, like 0.1). For x0 = -2, we can generate the following neighbors: {-2.1, -1.9, -2.2, -1.8, -2.3, -1.7}.\n\n3. Evaluation: Calculate the function values for all neighbors and choose the best one. For our example:\n   f(-2.1) = 0.9541\n   f(-1.9) = 1.6859\n   f(-2.2) = 0.3088\n   f(-1.8) = 2.6112\n   f(-2.3) = -0.2427\n   f(-1.7) = 3.6859\n\nThe best neighbor is x = -1.7 with f(x) = 3.6859.\n\n4. Update: Replace the current solution with the best neighbor and add the previous solution to the tabu list. Now, x0 = -1.7 and the tabu list contains {-2}.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy). Continue the search, updating the tabu list and avoiding previously visited solutions.\n\nAfter several iterations, we can observe that the function reaches its maximum value around x = 1.6. The exact value is f(1.6) = 4.7936.\n\nNote that the tabu search method is not guaranteed to find the global maximum, especially for continuous functions like this one. In practice, it's better to use other optimization techniques (e.g., gradient-based methods) for continuous functions. However, the tabu search method can still provide a good approximation of the maximum value."
