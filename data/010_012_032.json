    "message_2": "To find the derivative of (fog)(x) at x = 0, we first need to find the derivative of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - x^2 - x - 1) = 3x^2 - 2x - 1\ng'(x) = d/dx (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of (fog)(x) using the chain rule:\n\n(fog)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nAt x = 0:\n\nf'(g(0)) = f'(1) = 3(0)^2 - 2(0) - 1 = -1\ng'(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1\n\nNow, we can find (fog)'(0):\n\n(fog)'(0) = f'(g(0)) * g'(0) = (-1) * (1) = -1\n\nSo, the derivative of (fog)(x) at x = 0 is -1."
