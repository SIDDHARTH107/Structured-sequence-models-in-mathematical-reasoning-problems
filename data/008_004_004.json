    "message_2": "To solve this system of homogeneous linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's write down the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  3 -1 | 0\n|  4  2  2 | 0\n| -6 -6  6 | 0\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n|  4  2   2   | 0\n| -6 -6   6   | 0\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the leading terms in the second and third rows:\n\nAdd -4 times the first row to the second row:\n\n|  1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n|  0 -4   4   | 0\n| -6 -6   6   | 0\n\nAdd 6 times the first row to the third row:\n\n|  1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n|  0 -4   4   | 0\n|  0  3  -3   | 0\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -4 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n|  0  1  -1   | 0\n|  0  3  -3   | 0\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the leading term in the third row:\n\nAdd -3 times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n|  0  1  -1   | 0\n|  0  0   0   | 0\n\nNow we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n|  1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n|  0  1  -1   | 0\n|  0  0   0   | 0\n\nThe third equation is 0 = 0, which is always true, so we can ignore it.\n\nNow we can write the system of equations from the matrix:\n\nx + (3/2)y - (1/2)z = 0\ny - z = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have y = z. Now we can substitute this into the first equation:\n\nx + (3/2)z - (1/2)z = 0\nx + z = 0\n\nNow we can express x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = -z\ny = z\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system of equations, we can express the solution as a linear combination of the parameter z:\n\n(x, y, z) = z(-1, 1, 1)\n\nSo the solution to the system of homogeneous linear equations is:\n\nx = -z\ny = z\nz = z"
