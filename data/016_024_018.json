    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by successively removing squares from the original square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. \n\nAfter the first iteration, 1/9 of the area is removed. In the second iteration, 1/9 of the remaining area is removed, which is 1/9 * 8/9 = 8/81 of the original area. In the third iteration, 1/9 of the remaining area is removed, which is 1/9 * 8/9 * 8/9 = 64/729 of the original area. In the fourth iteration, 1/9 of the remaining area is removed, which is 1/9 * 8/9 * 8/9 * 8/9 = 512/6561 of the original area.\n\nTo find the remaining area after the 4th iteration, we need to subtract the removed areas from the original area:\n\nOriginal area = 81 square units\nRemoved areas = (1/9 + 8/81 + 64/729 + 512/6561) * 81\n\nCalculating the removed areas:\n\nRemoved areas = (9/81 + 8/81 + 64/729 + 512/6561) * 81\nRemoved areas = (81/729 + 64/729 + 512/6561) * 81\nRemoved areas = (145/729 + 512/6561) * 81\nRemoved areas = (1160/6561) * 81\n\nNow, subtract the removed areas from the original area:\n\nRemaining area = 81 - (1160/6561) * 81\nRemaining area = 81 * (1 - 1160/6561)\nRemaining area = 81 * (5401/6561)\nRemaining area ≈ 81 * 0.822724\n\nRemaining area ≈ 66.660216 square units\n\nSo, the area of the Sierpinski carpet after the 4th iteration is approximately 66.660216 square units."
