    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2). According to the Sylow theorems, there must exist a Sylow 3-subgroup in G, which is a subgroup of order 3^2 = 9. Let's denote this subgroup as P.\n\nNow, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides |G| = 9\n\nThe only possible values for n_3 that satisfy these conditions are 1 and 9. If n_3 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which is P. In this case, P is a normal subgroup of G since it is the only Sylow 3-subgroup. Since |P| = |G|, we have P = G, which means G is a p-group (a group of prime power order). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C9 (cyclic group of order 9)\n2. C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to. If G is isomorphic to C9, then G is cyclic and has an element of order 9. If G is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G is non-abelian and every non-identity element has order 3.\n\nLet's consider the case where G is isomorphic to C3 × C3. In this case, G would have 9 elements, and 8 of them would have order 3. However, this contradicts the fact that G is a group of order 9, as a non-abelian group of order 9 does not exist. This is because a group of order 9 must have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, which implies that the group is abelian.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3, and it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. This means that G is an abelian group with an element of order 9, and it satisfies the necessary conditions for isomorphism with the cyclic group C9."
