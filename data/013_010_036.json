    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly where two firms, A and B, simultaneously choose quantities to produce of a certain product. The total market demand is given by Q = 200 - P, where P is the market price. The marginal cost of production for each firm is $10. Suppose firm A believes that firm B will produce 75 units of the product. Determine the quantity of the product that firm A should produce in order to maximize its profits.",
    "message_2": "To determine the quantity of the product that firm A should produce to maximize its profits, we first need to find the reaction function for firm A. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity for firm A to produce given the quantity produced by firm B.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse demand function. The demand function is given by Q = 200 - P. We can rewrite this as P = 200 - Q.\n\nNow, let's denote the quantity produced by firm A as qA and the quantity produced by firm B as qB. The total quantity in the market is Q = qA + qB. \n\nWe can now substitute the inverse demand function into the total revenue function for firm A: \nTotal Revenue (TR) = P * qA = (200 - (qA + qB)) * qA = 200qA - qA^2 - qA * qB\n\nThe marginal cost (MC) for each firm is $10, so the total cost function for firm A is:\nTotal Cost (TC) = 10 * qA\n\nNow we can find the profit function for firm A:\nProfit (π) = TR - TC = (200qA - qA^2 - qA * qB) - 10qA\n\nTo maximize profits, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to qA and setting it equal to 0:\nd(π)/dqA = 200 - 2qA - qB - 10 = 0\n\nNow we can solve for qA in terms of qB:\n2qA = 190 - qB\nqA = (190 - qB) / 2\n\nThis is the reaction function for firm A. Given that firm A believes firm B will produce 75 units, we can plug this value into the reaction function to find the optimal quantity for firm A to produce:\nqA = (190 - 75) / 2 = 115 / 2 = 57.5\n\nSo, firm A should produce 57.5 units of the product to maximize its profits, given that it believes firm B will produce 75 units."
