    "message_2": "1) Determine the equation of motion of the system.\n\nTo find the equation of motion for a spring-mass system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law of motion. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position (F = -kx), and Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma).\n\nCombining these two laws, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nwhere m is the mass, a is the acceleration, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. We can rewrite this equation as:\n\na = -(k/m)x\n\nSince acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can write the equation of motion as:\n\nx''(t) = -(k/m)x(t)\n\nGiven the mass (m = 2 kg) and spring constant (k = 80 N/m), we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nx''(t) = -(80/2)x(t)\nx''(t) = -40x(t)\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The general solution for this type of equation is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and ω is the angular frequency. Since the system is initially at rest, the initial velocity is 0, and we can find the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A\nx'(0) = -A*ω*sin(0) + B*ω*cos(0) = B*ω\n\nGiven that the spring is initially stretched 5 cm (0.05 m) from its equilibrium position, we have:\n\nA = 0.05\n\nSince the initial velocity is 0:\n\n0 = B*ω\n\nSince ω cannot be 0 (otherwise there would be no oscillation), we conclude that B = 0. Therefore, the equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.05*cos(ωt)\n\n2) Find the period and frequency of its oscillations.\n\nTo find the period (T) and frequency (f) of the oscillations, we need to determine the angular frequency (ω). We can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the values for k and m:\n\nω = sqrt(80/2) = sqrt(40)\n\nThe period (T) is the time it takes for one complete oscillation and is related to the angular frequency by:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nT = 2π/sqrt(40)\n\nThe frequency (f) is the number of oscillations per unit time and is the reciprocal of the period:\n\nf = 1/T = ω/(2π) = sqrt(40)/(2π)\n\n3) Calculate the maximum speed and maximum acceleration of the system during its motion.\n\nThe maximum speed (v_max) occurs when the spring is at its equilibrium position (x = 0). To find the maximum speed, we can differentiate the displacement equation with respect to time:\n\nx'(t) = -0.05*ω*sin(ωt)\n\nAt the equilibrium position, sin(ωt) = 1, so:\n\nv_max = -0.05*ω\n\nPlugging in the value for ω:\n\nv_max = -0.05*sqrt(40) = -0.5 m/s\n\nThe maximum acceleration (a_max) occurs when the spring is at its maximum displacement (x = 0.05 m). To find the maximum acceleration, we can differentiate the velocity equation with respect to time:\n\nx''(t) = -0.05*ω^2*cos(ωt)\n\nAt the maximum displacement, cos(ωt) = 1, so:\n\na_max = -0.05*ω^2\n\nPlugging in the value for ω:\n\na_max = -0.05*(40) = -2 m/s²\n\nIn summary:\n\n1) The equation of motion is x(t) = 0.05*cos(ωt).\n2) The period is T = 2π/sqrt(40) and the frequency is f = sqrt(40)/(2π).\n3) The maximum speed is v_max = -0.5 m/s and the maximum acceleration is a_max = -2 m/s²."
