    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of the occurrence of a forest fire in a year is 0.05. What is the probability that the region will have at least one forest fire in the next 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of having at least one forest fire in the next 5 years is the probability of having no forest fires in the next 5 years.\n\nThe probability of not having a forest fire in a year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the events are independent, the probability of not having a forest fire in the next 5 years is the product of the probabilities of not having a forest fire in each year:\n\nP(no fires in 5 years) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^5 ≈ 0.7737809375\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of having at least one forest fire in the next 5 years:\n\nP(at least one fire in 5 years) = 1 - P(no fires in 5 years) ≈ 1 - 0.7737809375 ≈ 0.2262190625\n\nSo, the probability that the region will have at least one forest fire in the next 5 years is approximately 0.2262 or 22.62%."
