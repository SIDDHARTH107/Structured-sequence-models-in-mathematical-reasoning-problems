    "message_1": "Suppose you have a bag containing 10 identical red balls, 8 identical blue balls, and 6 identical green balls. In how many ways can you choose a total of 5 balls from the bag if at least 2 of them must be red?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into cases based on the number of red balls selected.\n\nCase 1: Selecting exactly 2 red balls.\nThere are 10 red balls, so we can choose 2 of them in C(10, 2) ways. We need to choose 3 more balls from the remaining 8 blue and 6 green balls, which can be done in C(14, 3) ways. So, the total number of ways for this case is C(10, 2) * C(14, 3).\n\nCase 2: Selecting exactly 3 red balls.\nWe can choose 3 red balls in C(10, 3) ways. We need to choose 2 more balls from the remaining 8 blue and 6 green balls, which can be done in C(14, 2) ways. So, the total number of ways for this case is C(10, 3) * C(14, 2).\n\nCase 3: Selecting exactly 4 red balls.\nWe can choose 4 red balls in C(10, 4) ways. We need to choose 1 more ball from the remaining 8 blue and 6 green balls, which can be done in C(14, 1) ways. So, the total number of ways for this case is C(10, 4) * C(14, 1).\n\nCase 4: Selecting all 5 red balls.\nWe can choose 5 red balls in C(10, 5) ways. Since we've already chosen all 5 balls, there are no more balls to choose. So, the total number of ways for this case is C(10, 5).\n\nNow, we add up the number of ways for each case:\n\nTotal ways = C(10, 2) * C(14, 3) + C(10, 3) * C(14, 2) + C(10, 4) * C(14, 1) + C(10, 5)\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), we can compute the total ways:\n\nTotal ways = (10! / (2! * 8!)) * (14! / (3! * 11!)) + (10! / (3! * 7!)) * (14! / (2! * 12!)) + (10! / (4! * 6!)) * (14! / (1! * 13!)) + (10! / (5! * 5!))\n\nTotal ways = (45) * (364) + (120) * (91) + (210) * (14) + (252)\n\nTotal ways = 16380 + 10920 + 2940 + 252\n\nTotal ways = 30,492\n\nSo, there are 30,492 ways to choose a total of 5 balls from the bag if at least 2 of them must be red."
