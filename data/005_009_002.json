    "message_1": "Here's a problem for a math student to solve related to Non-parametric statistics:\n\nA researcher conducted an experiment in which he asked eight participants to rank their favorite colors from 1 to 10, with 1 being their most favorite and 10 being their least favorite. The researcher wanted to test whether there is a significant difference in the preference ranking between two groups of participants (Group A and Group B). Here are the preference rankings for each group:\n\nGroup A: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10\nGroup B: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nUsing the Mann-Whitney U test, determine whether there is a significant difference in the preference rankings between Group A and Group B, with a significance level of α = 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Mann-Whitney U test, we first need to combine the two groups and rank the data from smallest to largest. Then, we will calculate the sum of ranks for each group and use the formula to find the U statistic. Finally, we will compare the U statistic to the critical value to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nCombined data: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10\n\nRanks:\nGroup A: 2.5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13.5, 15.5, 15.5\nGroup B: 1, 2.5, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13.5\n\nSum of ranks:\nGroup A: ΣR_A = 2.5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 13.5 + 15.5 + 15.5 = 81\nGroup B: ΣR_B = 1 + 2.5 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 13.5 = 59\n\nSample sizes:\nn_A = 8\nn_B = 8\n\nNow, we will calculate the U statistic for each group:\n\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1))/2 - ΣR_A = 8 * 8 + (8 * 9)/2 - 81 = 64 + 36 - 81 = 19\nU_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1))/2 - ΣR_B = 8 * 8 + (8 * 9)/2 - 59 = 64 + 36 - 59 = 41\n\nThe smaller U value is U_A = 19. Now, we need to compare this value to the critical value for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05. For a sample size of 8 in each group, the critical value is 23 (you can find this value in a Mann-Whitney U test table).\n\nSince our U value (19) is smaller than the critical value (23), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the preference rankings between Group A and Group B at a significance level of α = 0.05."
