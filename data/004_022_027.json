    "message_1": "A snack company produces two types of snacks: Pretzels and Chips. Each pretzel requires 2 ounces of flour and 1 ounce of salt to produce, while each chip requires 3 ounces of flour and 2 ounces of salt. The company has 40 ounces of flour and 25 ounces of salt available. If the profit per pretzel is $0.50 and the profit per chip is $0.40, how many of each should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of pretzels and y be the number of chips produced.\n\nThe constraints for the available ingredients are:\n2x + 3y ≤ 40 (flour constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 25 (salt constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 0.50x + 0.40y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 25\ny ≤ (25 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these inequalities. We will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the boundary lines:\n\n1. y = (40 - 2x) / 3\n2. y = (25 - x) / 2\n\nSolving for x in equation 2:\nx = 25 - 2y\n\nSubstituting this into equation 1:\ny = (40 - 2(25 - 2y)) / 3\ny = (40 - 50 + 4y) / 3\n3y = -10 + 4y\ny = 10\n\nSubstituting y back into the equation for x:\nx = 25 - 2(10)\nx = 25 - 20\nx = 5\n\nSo, the intersection point of the boundary lines is (5, 10). Now, we will check the other vertices of the feasible region, which are (0, 0), (0, 12.5), and (20, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 0.50(0) + 0.40(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 12.5) = 0.50(0) + 0.40(12.5) = $5\n3. P(20, 0) = 0.50(20) + 0.40(0) = $10\n4. P(5, 10) = 0.50(5) + 0.40(10) = $2.50 + $4 = $6.50\n\nThe maximum profit of $6.50 is achieved when the company produces 5 pretzels and 10 chips."
