    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |x - 4| + 2, we need to determine the point where the equation changes direction. This occurs at the value of x that makes the expression inside the absolute value equal to zero.\n\nx - 4 = 0\nx = 4\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y-value by plugging x = 4 back into the equation:\n\ny = |4 - 4| + 2\ny = |0| + 2\ny = 0 + 2\ny = 2\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation is (4, 2).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to determine the value of y when x = 0:\n\ny = |0 - 4| + 2\ny = |-4| + 2\ny = 4 + 2\ny = 6\n\nThe y-intercept of the absolute value equation is (0, 6)."
