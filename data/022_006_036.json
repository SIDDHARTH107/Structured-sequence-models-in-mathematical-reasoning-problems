    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the function f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2 on the closed disk |z| <= 2 in the complex plane, we can rewrite the function in terms of its real and imaginary parts.\n\nLet z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers. Then,\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)^2 - 2(x + iy) + 2\n     = (x^2 - 2x + 1) + i(2xy - 2y) + (1 + i(0))\n     = (x^2 - 2x + 2) + i(2xy - 2y)\n\nNow, we can find the modulus of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = sqrt((x^2 - 2x + 2)^2 + (2xy - 2y)^2)\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum modulus, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum modulus of a function on a closed disk occurs on the boundary of the disk. In this case, the boundary is the circle |z| = 2.\n\nSo, we can parameterize the boundary using polar coordinates:\n\nz = 2e^(it), where t is a real number in the range [0, 2Ï€].\n\nNow, we can find the maximum and minimum modulus by plugging this parameterization into f(z) and finding the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|.\n\nf(2e^(it)) = (2e^(it))^2 - 2(2e^(it)) + 2\n            = 4e^(2it) - 4e^(it) + 2\n\n|f(2e^(it))| = |4e^(2it) - 4e^(it) + 2|\n\nNow, we can find the maximum and minimum values of |f(2e^(it))| by taking the derivative with respect to t and setting it to zero.\n\nAfter evaluating the derivative and finding the critical points, we can find the maximum and minimum modulus by plugging these critical points back into |f(2e^(it))|.\n\nThe maximum modulus of f(z) on the closed disk |z| <= 2 is 10, and the minimum modulus is 0."
