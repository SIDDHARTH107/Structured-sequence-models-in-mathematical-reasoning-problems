    "message_2": "The perimeter (also called the circumference) of a circle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the radius of the circle is 7 cm, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2 * π * 7\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 7\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
