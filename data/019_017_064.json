Let $T$ be the set of true first-order sentences of this language in the standard model $(\\mathbb{N}, 0, S)$.\n\nProve that the first-order sentence $\\exists x(S(x+0)=S(x)+S(0))$ is not true in the standard model $(\\mathbb{N}, 0, S)$, but is true in some other model.",
    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given first-order sentence in the standard model $(\\mathbb{N}, 0, S)$. The sentence is:\n\n$$\\exists x(S(x+0)=S(x)+S(0))$$\n\nIn the standard model, we have the following properties:\n\n1. $0$ is the constant symbol representing the natural number $0$.\n2. $S$ is the successor function, which maps a natural number $n$ to its successor $n+1$.\n3. The addition operation $+$ is defined in the usual way for natural numbers.\n\nNow, let's simplify the given sentence using these properties:\n\n$$\\exists x(S(x+0)=S(x)+S(0))$$\n\nSince $x+0 = x$ for any natural number $x$, we can simplify the sentence to:\n\n$$\\exists x(S(x)=S(x)+S(0))$$\n\nNow, we know that $S(0) = 1$ in the standard model, so the sentence becomes:\n\n$$\\exists x(S(x)=S(x)+1)$$\n\nThis sentence is clearly false in the standard model, as there is no natural number $x$ such that its successor $S(x)$ is equal to itself plus $1$.\n\nNow, let's consider a non-standard model to show that the given sentence can be true in some other model. Let's define a new model $(\\mathbb{Z}, 0, S')$, where:\n\n1. The domain is the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. The constant symbol $0$ represents the integer $0$.\n3. The successor function $S'$ is defined as $S'(x) = x - 1$ for any integer $x$.\n\nIn this model, the given sentence becomes:\n\n$$\\exists x(S'(x+0)=S'(x)+S'(0))$$\n\nSince $x+0 = x$ for any integer $x$, we can simplify the sentence to:\n\n$$\\exists x(S'(x)=S'(x)+S'(0))$$\n\nNow, we know that $S'(0) = -1$ in this model, so the sentence becomes:\n\n$$\\exists x(S'(x)=S'(x)-1)$$\n\nIn this model, the sentence is true, as we can take $x=0$. We have $S'(0) = -1$ and $S'(0)-1 = -2$, so the equation holds:\n\n$$S'(0)=S'(0)-1$$\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the first-order sentence $\\exists x(S(x+0)=S(x)+S(0))$ is not true in the standard model $(\\mathbb{N}, 0, S)$, but is true in the non-standard model $(\\mathbb{Z}, 0, S')$."
