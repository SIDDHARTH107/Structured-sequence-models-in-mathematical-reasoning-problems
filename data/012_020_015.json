    "message_2": "A complete graph $K_n$ is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all permutations of its vertices that preserve the structure of the graph (i.e., the adjacency relations between vertices).\n\nIn the case of a complete graph $K_n$, any permutation of its vertices will preserve the adjacency relations, since all vertices are connected to each other. Therefore, the automorphism group of $K_n$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_n$, which is the group of all permutations of $n$ elements.\n\nThe size (order) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is given by the factorial of $n$, denoted as $n!$. Thus, the size of the automorphism group of a complete graph $K_n$ is $n!$."
