    "message_1": "A tree stands on a slope, and the angle of elevation from point A on the ground to the top of the tree is 35 degrees. If point A is 20 meters from the base of the tree and the slope rises at an angle of 25 degrees to the horizontal, how tall is the tree from its base to the top?",
    "message_2": "Let's label the points as follows: B is the base of the tree, C is the top of the tree, and D is the point on the ground directly below the top of the tree. We are given that angle DAC is 35 degrees, angle BAD is 25 degrees, and the distance from A to B is 20 meters. We want to find the height of the tree, which is the length of segment BC.\n\nFirst, we can find angle BAC by subtracting the angle BAD from angle DAC: 35 - 25 = 10 degrees.\n\nNow, we can use the law of sines to find the length of segment AC. The law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\nAB / sin(C) = AC / sin(B)\n\nWe know that AB = 20 meters, angle C = 10 degrees, and angle B = 25 degrees. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n20 / sin(10) = AC / sin(25)\n\nNow, we can solve for AC:\n\nAC = 20 * sin(25) / sin(10) ≈ 46.07 meters\n\nNext, we can use the sine function to find the height of the tree (segment BC). We know that sin(angle BAD) = opposite side (BC) / hypotenuse (AC). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nsin(25) = BC / 46.07\n\nNow, we can solve for BC:\n\nBC = 46.07 * sin(25) ≈ 19.21 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree from its base to the top is approximately 19.21 meters."
