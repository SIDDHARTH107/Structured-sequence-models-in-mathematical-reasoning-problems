    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first list out the possible Cayley tables for G and then show which ones satisfy the criteria for these two groups.\n\nSince G has order 6, it has 6 elements, which we will denote as {e, a, b, c, d, f}. Here, e is the identity element. We will now list out the possible Cayley tables for G.\n\nCayley Table 1 (C6):\n\n```\n  e a b c d f\ne e a b c d f\na a b c d f e\nb b c d f e a\nc c d f e a b\nd d f e a b c\nf f e a b c d\n```\n\nCayley Table 2 (D3):\n\n```\n  e a b c d f\ne e a b c d f\na a e c b f d\nb b f e d a c\nc c d f e b a\nd d c a f e b\nf f b d a c e\n```\n\nNow, let's check which of these Cayley tables satisfy the criteria for C6 and D3.\n\nC6 Criteria:\n1. The group is cyclic.\n2. There is an element of order 6.\n\nFor Cayley Table 1, we can see that it is cyclic, and the element 'a' has order 6 (a^6 = e). Therefore, Cayley Table 1 satisfies the criteria for C6.\n\nD3 Criteria:\n1. The group is not cyclic.\n2. There is an element of order 2 and an element of order 3.\n\nFor Cayley Table 2, we can see that it is not cyclic. The element 'a' has order 2 (a^2 = e), and the element 'b' has order 3 (b^3 = e). Therefore, Cayley Table 2 satisfies the criteria for D3.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 6 can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3 by listing out all possible Cayley tables for G and showing which ones satisfy the criteria for these two groups."
