    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 126 and 84 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (126) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder.\n   126 รท 84 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 42.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (126) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (42) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n\n   84 รท 42 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, we stop the process. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 42. Therefore, the GCD of 126 and 84 is 42."
