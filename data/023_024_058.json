    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) with the given conditions, we first need to find the coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. The trigonometric form of the Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nWe can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[f(x)] dx from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)] dx from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)] dx from 0 to 2π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2π)) * [∫(3) dx from 0 to π + ∫(-2) dx from π to 2π]\na_0 = (1 / (2π)) * [3π - 2π] = (1 / 2)\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [∫(3 * cos(nx)) dx from 0 to π + ∫(-2 * cos(nx)) dx from π to 2π]\na_n = (1 / π) * [(3 / n) * sin(nx) | from 0 to π - (2 / n) * sin(nx) | from π to 2π]\na_n = (1 / π) * [(3 / n) * (sin(nπ) - 0) - (2 / n) * (sin(2nπ) - sin(nπ))]\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 and sin(2nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫(3 * sin(nx)) dx from 0 to π + ∫(-2 * sin(nx)) dx from π to 2π]\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-3 / n) * cos(nx) | from 0 to π + (2 / n) * cos(nx) | from π to 2π]\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-3 / n) * (cos(nπ) - 1) + (2 / n) * (1 - cos(nπ))]\n\nNow we can plug the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n into the Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = (1 / 2) + Σ [0 * cos(nx) + ((-3 / n) * (cos(nπ) - 1) + (2 / n) * (1 - cos(nπ))) * sin(nx)]\n\nSimplifying the formula, we get:\n\nf(x) = (1 / 2) + Σ[((-3 / n) * (cos(nπ) - 1) + (2 / n) * (1 - cos(nπ))) * sin(nx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series of the function f(x) with the periodic discontinuity using the trigonometric form of the series."
