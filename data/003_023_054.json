    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nwhere |A x B| is the magnitude of the cross product, |A| is the magnitude of vector A, |B| is the magnitude of vector B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nGiven the magnitudes of A and B and the angle between them, we can plug in the values:\n\n|A x B| = 4 * 3 * sin(60°)\n\nSince sin(60°) = √3/2, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n|A x B| = 4 * 3 * (√3/2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n|A x B| = 12 * (√3/2)\n\n|A x B| = 6√3\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product of vectors A and B is 6√3."
