    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups, we will analyze its structure using the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n\nLet n_2 and n_3 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively. By Sylow's theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the possible values for n_2 and n_3:\n\nn_2 ∈ {1, 3, 9}\nn_3 ∈ {1, 4}\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then both subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P and Q are normal, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 72, so PQ = G. This implies that G is the direct product of P and Q, and thus G is isomorphic to C8 × C9. Since C8 × C9 is isomorphic to C72, in this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIf G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then the Sylow 3-subgroup Q is normal in G. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, the group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_3. The kernel of φ is the normalizer of H in G, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have |G : N_G(H)| = 3. Since Q is normal in G, it is contained in N_G(H), and thus |N_G(H)| is divisible by 9. This implies that |N_G(H)| = 9 or 18. If |N_G(H)| = 9, then G = N_G(H), which contradicts the fact that G has three Sylow 2-subgroups. Therefore, |N_G(H)| = 18, and the kernel of φ has order 4. The image of φ is a subgroup of S_3, which has order 6. Since the kernel of φ is normal in G and has order 4, G has a normal subgroup K of order 4. Then, G/K is a group of order 18, which is isomorphic to either C18 or C6 × C3. In either case, G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIf G has nine Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups, then neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal in G. In this case, G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, depending on the number of its Sylow subgroups. To determine which specific group G is isomorphic to, more information about G would be needed."
