    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal formed by iteratively replacing a straight line segment with two segments, each half the length of the original segment, and joined at a right angle. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the initial line segment of length 4 units is replaced by two segments, each of length 2 units. The total length of the curve after the first iteration is 2 + 2 = 4 units.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the two segments of length 2 units is replaced by two segments, each of length 1 unit (half of 2 units). So, there are now a total of 4 segments, each of length 1 unit. The total length of the curve after the second iteration is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 units.\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after the second iteration is 4 units."
