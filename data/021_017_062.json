    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a numerical optimization algorithm that is used to find the minimum or maximum of a function. In this case, we want to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 6x + 8 on the interval [-5, 5]. We will use a population size of 50 and a maximum number of iterations of 100.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the differential evolution algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 50 random solutions (x-values) within the interval [-5, 5].\n2. For each iteration (up to 100 iterations):\n   a. For each individual in the population:\n      i. Select three other distinct individuals from the population randomly.\n      ii. Create a mutant vector by combining the three selected individuals using a mutation factor.\n      iii. Create a trial vector by performing crossover between the mutant vector and the target individual.\n      iv. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector (i.e., compute f(x) for the trial vector).\n      v. If the trial vector has a better fitness (lower f(x) value) than the target individual, replace the target individual with the trial vector.\n3. After 100 iterations, select the individual with the best fitness (lowest f(x) value) as the solution.\n\nAfter running the differential evolution algorithm with the given parameters, we will obtain an approximate value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 6x + 8 on the interval [-5, 5]. Note that the result may not be the exact minimum value due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, but it should be a close approximation."
