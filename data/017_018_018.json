    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 32 are there? And can you list them?",
    "message_2": "There are 51 groups of order 32 in total, out of which 46 are non-abelian.\n\nListing all 46 non-abelian groups is not practical here, as their descriptions can be quite complex. However, I can provide you with some general information about these groups.\n\nThe non-abelian groups of order 32 can be classified into several families:\n\n1. Dihedral groups: There is one dihedral group of order 32, denoted by D_32.\n\n2. Quaternion groups: There is one quaternion group of order 32, denoted by Q_32.\n\n3. Semi-direct products: The remaining non-abelian groups of order 32 can be constructed as semi-direct products of smaller groups. For example, some of them can be represented as semi-direct products of cyclic groups or other non-abelian groups of smaller orders.\n\n4. Generalized Quaternion groups: Some of the non-abelian groups of order 32 can be classified as generalized quaternion groups.\n\n5. Other groups: There are other non-abelian groups of order 32 that do not fall into the above categories.\n\nTo study these groups in detail, you may want to refer to specialized literature on group theory, such as textbooks or research articles."
