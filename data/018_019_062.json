    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (A Δ B) Δ B:\n\n(A Δ B) Δ B = ({1, 5} ∪ B) - ({1, 5} ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4}) = {1, 5}\n\nNext, let's find B Δ B:\n\nB Δ B = (B ∪ B) - (B ∩ B) = ({2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5}) - {2, 3, 4, 5} = {}\n\nNow, let's find A Δ (B Δ B):\n\nA Δ {} = (A ∪ {}) - (A ∩ {}) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {}) - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSince (A Δ B) Δ B = {1, 5} and A Δ (B Δ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4}, the answers are not the same. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative in this case."
