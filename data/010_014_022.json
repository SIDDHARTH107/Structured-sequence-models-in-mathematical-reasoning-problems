Let f: X -> Y be a continuous surjection such that f^-1({y}) is a connected subset of X for each point y in Y. \n\nWhat is the rank of the cohomology group H^1(Y;Z/2Z) of the space Y with coefficients in the field Z/2Z?",
    "message_2": "To compute the rank of the cohomology group H^1(Y;Z/2Z), we first need to understand the cohomology of the circle S^1. The cohomology groups of S^1 with integer coefficients are given by:\n\nH^0(S^1;Z) = Z (the constant functions)\nH^1(S^1;Z) = Z (generated by the winding number)\nH^k(S^1;Z) = 0 for k > 1\n\nNow, we want to compute the cohomology with coefficients in the field Z/2Z. The Universal Coefficient Theorem states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H^{i-1}(Y;Z), Z/2Z) → H^i(Y;Z/2Z) → Hom(H^i(Y;Z), Z/2Z) → 0\n\nFor i = 0, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H^{-1}(Y;Z), Z/2Z) → H^0(Y;Z/2Z) → Hom(H^0(Y;Z), Z/2Z) → 0\n\nSince H^{-1}(Y;Z) = 0, we have:\n\nH^0(Y;Z/2Z) = Hom(H^0(Y;Z), Z/2Z) = Hom(Z, Z/2Z) = Z/2Z\n\nFor i = 1, we have:\n\n0 → Ext(H^0(Y;Z), Z/2Z) → H^1(Y;Z/2Z) → Hom(H^1(Y;Z), Z/2Z) → 0\n\nSince H^0(Y;Z) = Z and Ext(Z, Z/2Z) = Z/2Z, we have:\n\nH^1(Y;Z/2Z) = Z/2Z ⊕ Hom(Z, Z/2Z) = Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z\n\nThus, the rank of the cohomology group H^1(Y;Z/2Z) is 2."
