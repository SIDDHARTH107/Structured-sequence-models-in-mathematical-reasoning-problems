    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * (number of edges) / (number of vertices) + 1\n\nThis inequality is derived from the fact that if the girth of G is g, then the graph can have at most (g - 1) * (number of vertices) / 2 edges. This is because each vertex can be part of at most (g - 1) / 2 distinct cycles of length g.\n\nIn our case, the graph G has 10 vertices and 18 edges. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 18 / 10 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 3.6 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 4.6\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we can conclude that the girth of G is at most 4. However, we need to check if a graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges can have a girth of 4.\n\nConsider a graph with 10 vertices and a girth of 4. This means that the graph has no cycles of length 3. The maximum number of edges that a graph with 10 vertices and no cycles of length 3 can have is 18. This can be achieved by constructing a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, one with 5 vertices and the other with 5 vertices, and connecting every vertex in one set to every vertex in the other set. This graph has 5 * 5 = 25 edges, which is more than 18.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for a graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges to have a girth of 4. Thus, the girth of G is 4."
