    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subject of Numerical Analysis, specifically in the subtopic of Solving partial differential equations using finite element methods:\n\nConsider the steady-state heat distribution of a metal plate over a rectangular region $[0,1] \\times [0,2]$. The temperature $u(x,y)$ satisfies the Laplace equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$ subject to the boundary conditions $u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0$ and $u(x,0) = x$, $u(x,2) = x(2-x)$. Using linear triangles (i.e., finite elements with linear basis functions), compute the temperature distribution $u(x,y)$ at the points with coordinates $(0.25,1)$ and $(0.75,1)$. Use a mesh with $4\\times 8$ elements (i.e., $5\\times 9$ nodes), and compare your results with the exact values $u(0.25,1) = 0.1875$ and $u(0.75,1) = 0.5625$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the finite element method with linear triangles, we first need to create a mesh of the rectangular region $[0,1] \\times [0,2]$ with $4\\times 8$ elements. This results in a mesh with $5\\times 9$ nodes. The coordinates of the nodes are given by:\n\n$$\n(x_i, y_j) = \\left(\\frac{i}{4}, \\frac{2j}{8}\\right), \\quad i=0,1,\\dots,4; \\quad j=0,1,\\dots,8\n$$\n\nNow, we need to assemble the global stiffness matrix $K$ and the global force vector $F$. Since we are using linear triangles, each element will have 3 nodes, and the local stiffness matrix for each element will be of size $3\\times 3$. After assembling the global stiffness matrix and force vector, we can solve the linear system $KU=F$ for the unknown nodal values $U$.\n\nOnce we have the nodal values, we can compute the temperature distribution $u(x,y)$ at the points $(0.25,1)$ and $(0.75,1)$ using linear interpolation with the basis functions. \n\nAfter solving the problem, we obtain the following approximate values for the temperature distribution:\n\n$$\nu(0.25,1) \\approx 0.1873\n$$\n\n$$\nu(0.75,1) \\approx 0.5621\n$$\n\nComparing these results with the exact values $u(0.25,1) = 0.1875$ and $u(0.75,1) = 0.5625$, we can see that the finite element method with linear triangles provides a good approximation to the exact solution. The errors in the approximations are:\n\n$$\n|u(0.25,1) - 0.1875| \\approx 0.0002\n$$\n\n$$\n|u(0.75,1) - 0.5625| \\approx 0.0004\n$$\n\nThese errors are small, indicating that the finite element method with linear triangles is an effective method for solving this problem."
