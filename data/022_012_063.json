    "message_1": "Suppose we have a meromorphic function f(z) on the complex plane, and that it has a pole of order 3 at z=0 and a pole of order 2 at z=1. Additionally, f(z) has a zero of order 2 at z=2 and a zero of order 1 at z=3. Find the image of the point f(4) under the mapping defined by f(z).",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the point f(4) under the mapping defined by f(z), we need to evaluate f(z) at z = 4. However, we don't have an explicit expression for f(z). But we can use the information given about the poles and zeros to construct a function that satisfies these conditions.\n\nLet g(z) be a function with the same poles and zeros as f(z), but with constant coefficients to be determined. We can write g(z) as a ratio of two polynomials:\n\ng(z) = (A(z-2)^2 * B(z-3)) / ((z^3) * C(z-1)^2)\n\nwhere A, B, and C are constants to be determined. Note that g(z) has the same poles and zeros as f(z) with the correct orders.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that f(z) and g(z) have the same poles and zeros to deduce that f(z) = k * g(z) for some constant k. In other words, f(z) and g(z) are proportional to each other.\n\nTo find the image of the point f(4) under the mapping defined by f(z), we need to evaluate f(4). Since f(z) and g(z) are proportional, we can instead evaluate g(4):\n\ng(4) = (A(4-2)^2 * B(4-3)) / ((4^3) * C(4-1)^2)\n\ng(4) = (4A * B) / (64 * 9C)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the values of A, B, and C, we cannot find an exact value for f(4). However, we can express f(4) in terms of these constants:\n\nf(4) = k * g(4) = k * (4A * B) / (64 * 9C)\n\nSo the image of the point f(4) under the mapping defined by f(z) is k * (4A * B) / (64 * 9C), where k, A, B, and C are constants."
