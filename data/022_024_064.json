    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use separation of variables and Fourier series. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$$\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) = -\\lambda^2 T(t)$\n2. $X''(x) = -\\lambda^2 X(x)$\n3. $Y''(y) = -\\lambda^2 Y(y)$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$$T(t) = Ce^{-\\lambda^2 t}$$\n\nFor the second equation, we have the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$. The general solution is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus,\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the third equation, we have the boundary conditions $Y(0) = Y(2) = 0$. The general solution is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\sin(\\mu y) + D\\cos(\\mu y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $D = 0$ and $\\mu = m\\pi/2$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus,\n\n$$Y_m(y) = B_m\\cos(m\\pi y/2)$$\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm} \\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(m\\pi y/2)e^{-(n^2\\pi^2 + (m\\pi/2)^2)t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_{nm}$, we use the initial condition:\n\n$$10\\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{nm} \\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(m\\pi y/2)$$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $C_{10} = 10$ and all other coefficients are zero. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = 10\\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)e^{-(\\pi^2 + (\\pi/2)^2)t}$$\n\nFinally, we find the temperature at $(1/2, 1)$ at time $t = 0.005$:\n\n$$u(1/2, 1, 0.005) = 10\\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(\\pi)e^{-(\\pi^2 + (\\pi/2)^2)(0.005)}$$\n\n$$u(1/2, 1, 0.005) = 10(1)(-1)e^{-\\frac{5\\pi^2}{4}(0.005)}$$\n\n$$u(1/2, 1, 0.005) = -10e^{-\\frac{5\\pi^2}{4}(0.005)} \\approx -9.524$$\n\nSo, the temperature at the point $(1/2, 1)$ at time $t = 0.005$ is approximately $-9.524$."
