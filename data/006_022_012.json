    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, students passing the exam)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of students, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students passing the exam, which is 400)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student passing the exam, which is 0.75)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a student not passing the exam, which is 0.25)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 400) = C(500, 400) * (0.75)^400 * (0.25)^100\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(500, 400):\n\nC(500, 400) = 500! / (400!(500-400)!)\nC(500, 400) = 500! / (400!100!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 400) = (500! / (400!100!)) * (0.75)^400 * (0.25)^100\n\nCalculating this probability using a calculator or software (such as Python or Wolfram Alpha) gives:\n\nP(X = 400) â‰ˆ 0.0296\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 400 students will pass their final math exam is approximately 0.0296 or 2.96%."
