The edges of the graph are defined as follows:\n\n- A is connected to B, C, and D\n- B is connected to F\n- C is connected to F and G\n- D is connected to E, F, and G\n- E is connected to H\n- F is connected to H\n- G is not connected to any vertex\n\nWhat is the maximum number of independent vertices that can be found in this graph? And what are these vertices?",
    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in a graph is a set of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge. To find the maximum number of independent vertices, we need to select vertices that are not connected to each other.\n\nHere's one possible maximum independent set of vertices for this graph:\n\n- Vertex B\n- Vertex E\n- Vertex G\n\nThese vertices are not connected to each other, and adding any other vertex would create a connection between vertices in the set. Therefore, the maximum number of independent vertices in this graph is 3, and the vertices are B, E, and G."
