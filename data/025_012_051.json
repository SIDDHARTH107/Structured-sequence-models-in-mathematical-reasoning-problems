    "message_2": "To find the order of E(F_17), we need to count the number of points on the elliptic curve E over the finite field F_17, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe will iterate through all possible x values in F_17 and check if there exists a y value such that the point (x, y) lies on the curve E. If so, we will count the point (x, y) and its reflection (x, -y) as points on the curve.\n\nLet's start by iterating through all x values in F_17:\n\nFor x = 0 to 16, we calculate the right-hand side of the equation, x^3 - x:\n\nx = 0: RHS = 0^3 - 0 = 0\nx = 1: RHS = 1^3 - 1 = 0\nx = 2: RHS = 2^3 - 2 = 6\nx = 3: RHS = 3^3 - 3 = 24 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\nx = 4: RHS = 4^3 - 4 = 60 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\nx = 5: RHS = 5^3 - 5 = 120 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\nx = 6: RHS = 6^3 - 6 = 210 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\nx = 7: RHS = 7^3 - 7 = 336 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\nx = 8: RHS = 8^3 - 8 = 504 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\nx = 9: RHS = 9^3 - 9 = 720 ≡ 5 (mod 17)\nx = 10: RHS = 10^3 - 10 = 990 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\nx = 11: RHS = 11^3 - 11 = 1320 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\nx = 12: RHS = 12^3 - 12 = 1716 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\nx = 13: RHS = 13^3 - 13 = 2196 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\nx = 14: RHS = 14^3 - 14 = 2744 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\nx = 15: RHS = 15^3 - 15 = 3360 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\nx = 16: RHS = 16^3 - 16 = 4080 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n\nNow, for each RHS value, we check if there exists a y value in F_17 such that y^2 ≡ RHS (mod 17). If so, we count the point (x, y) and its reflection (x, -y) as points on the curve:\n\nRHS = 0: y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 17) has 1 solution: y = 0. (1 point)\nRHS = 1: y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 17) has 2 solutions: y = 1, 16. (4 points)\nRHS = 2: y^2 ≡ 2 (mod 17) has 2 solutions: y = 6, 11. (4 points)\nRHS = 3: y^2 ≡ 3 (mod 17) has 2 solutions: y = 5, 12. (4 points)\nRHS = 4: y^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17) has 2 solutions: y = 2, 15. (4 points)\nRHS = 5: y^2 ≡ 5 (mod 17) has 2 solutions: y = 3, 14. (4 points)\nRHS = 6: y^2 ≡ 6 (mod 17) has no solutions. (0 points)\nRHS = 7: y^2 ≡ 7 (mod 17) has no solutions. (0 points)\nRHS = 9: y^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17) has 2 solutions: y = 4, 13. (4 points)\n\nAdding up the points, we have 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 25 points. However, we must also include the point at infinity, so the order of E(F_17) is 25 + 1 = 26."
