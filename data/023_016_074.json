    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the piece-wise function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. The function is defined over the interval [0, π], so the period is L = π/2. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ [aₙ * cos(n * π * x / L) + bₙ * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx over the interval [0, π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫[1 * 1]dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫[-1 * 1]dx from π/2 to π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ([x] from 0 to π/2 - [x] from π/2 to π)\n\na₀ = (1/π) * (π/2 - π/2) = 0\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)]dx over the interval [0, π]\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [∫[1 * cos(n * π * x / (π/2))]dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫[-1 * cos(n * π * x / (π/2))]dx from π/2 to π]\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(2/π) * ∫[cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to π/2 - (2/π) * ∫[cos(n * x)]dx from π/2 to π]\n\naₙ = (2/π²) * ([sin(n * x)] from 0 to π/2 - [sin(n * x)] from π/2 to π)\n\naₙ = (2/π²) * (sin(n * π/2) - sin(n * π))\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, we have:\n\naₙ = (2/π²) * sin(n * π/2)\n\nNow, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)]dx over the interval [0, π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [∫[1 * sin(n * π * x / (π/2))]dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫[-1 * sin(n * π * x / (π/2))]dx from π/2 to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(2/π) * ∫[sin(n * x)]dx from 0 to π/2 - (2/π) * ∫[sin(n * x)]dx from π/2 to π]\n\nbₙ = (2/π²) * ([-cos(n * x)] from 0 to π/2 + [cos(n * x)] from π/2 to π)\n\nbₙ = (2/π²) * (-cos(n * π/2) + cos(n * π))\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n for all integer values of n, we have:\n\nbₙ = (2/π²) * (-cos(n * π/2) + (-1)^n)\n\nNow we have all the coefficients, so the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/π²) * sin(n * π/2) * cos(n * π * x / (π/2)) + (2/π²) * (-cos(n * π/2) + (-1)^n) * sin(n * π * x / (π/2))]\n\nTo find the value of f(π/4), we plug in x = π/4:\n\nf(π/4) = Σ [(2/π²) * sin(n * π/2) * cos(n * π²/8) + (2/π²) * (-cos(n * π/2) + (-1)^n) * sin(n * π²/8)]\n\nSince f(x) = 1 for 0 < x < π/2, and π/4 is in this interval, we have:\n\nf(π/4) = 1"
