    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit margins for each unit of A and B are $10 and $15 respectively. The production facility can produce no more than 200 units per day, and the available raw materials enable the production of no more than 500 units per day. The company decides that they must produce at least 50 units of product A and 100 units of product B each day. Formulate the quadratic programming problem to determine the optimal number of units of products A and B the company should produce daily to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced daily. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Production facility constraint: x + y ≤ 200\n2. Raw material constraint: x + y ≤ 500\n3. Minimum production of product A: x ≥ 50\n4. Minimum production of product B: y ≥ 100\n\nSince the problem is a linear programming problem (not quadratic), we can solve it using linear programming techniques. To find the optimal solution, we can graph the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200\n2. x + y ≤ 500 (This constraint is redundant since it is always satisfied when the production facility constraint is satisfied)\n3. x ≥ 50\n4. y ≥ 100\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (50, 100)\n2. (50, 150)\n3. (100, 100)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(50, 100) = 10(50) + 15(100) = 500 + 1500 = $2000\n2. P(50, 150) = 10(50) + 15(150) = 500 + 2250 = $2750\n3. P(100, 100) = 10(100) + 15(100) = 1000 + 1500 = $2500\n\nThe maximum profit is $2750, which occurs when the company produces 50 units of product A and 150 units of product B daily."
