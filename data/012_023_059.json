    "message_2": "To determine if there is a clique of size 3 or greater in the graph G, we can use the fact that the maximum number of edges in a graph with n vertices and no cliques of size 3 or greater is given by the Tur√°n's theorem:\n\nm = floor(n^2/4)\n\nIn our case, n = 5, so the maximum number of edges without a clique of size 3 or greater is:\n\nm = floor(5^2/4) = floor(25/4) = 6\n\nSince our graph G has 7 edges, which is greater than the maximum number of edges allowed without a clique of size 3 or greater, we can conclude that there must be a clique of size 3 or greater in the graph G.\n\nNow, let's determine the clique number of the graph. The clique number is the size of the largest clique in the graph. Since we have only 5 vertices, the largest possible clique size is 5. However, the maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5) is:\n\nedges = (5 * (5 - 1))/2 = 10\n\nSince our graph has only 7 edges, it cannot be a complete graph with 5 vertices. Therefore, the largest possible clique size is 4. The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 4 vertices (K4) is:\n\nedges = (4 * (4 - 1))/2 = 6\n\nSince our graph has 7 edges, it is possible to have a clique of size 4. Therefore, the clique number of the graph G is 4."
