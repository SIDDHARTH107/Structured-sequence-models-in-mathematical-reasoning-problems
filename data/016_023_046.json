    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal constructed using squares, at each iteration, the square is divided into 3x3 smaller squares, and 5 of them (the center and the 4 corners) are kept. So, N = 5, and the scaling factor s = 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal constructed using squares with side length 1 and an iteration of 5 steps is approximately 1.46497. Note that the number of iterations does not affect the Hausdorff dimension; it remains the same for any number of iterations."
