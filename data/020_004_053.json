    "message_1": "A factory wants to maximize its profit by producing two types of products - Product A and Product B. The production process requires raw materials, labor, and machine time. The resources are limited to 10 units of raw material, 6 units of labor, and 8 units of machine time per day. The profit per unit for Product A is $20 and for Product B is $30. The production process for each unit of Product A requires 2 units of raw material, 1 unit of labor, and 3 units of machine time. The production process for each unit of Product B requires 1 unit of raw material, 2 units of labor, and 2 units of machine time. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nThe constraints for the resources are:\n2x + y <= 10 (raw materials)\nx + 2y <= 6 (labor)\n3x + 2y <= 8 (machine time)\nx >= 0, y >= 0\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y <= 10\ny <= -2x + 10\n\n2. x + 2y <= 6\ny <= -0.5x + 3\n\n3. 3x + 2y <= 8\ny <= -1.5x + 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 0). We will now evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 3) = 20(0) + 30(3) = $90\n3. P(2, 2) = 20(2) + 30(2) = $100\n4. P(4, 0) = 20(4) + 30(0) = $80\n\nThe maximum profit of $100 is achieved when producing 2 units of Product A and 2 units of Product B."
