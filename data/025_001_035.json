    "message_2": "To determine the number of solutions in S, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve the system of equations. First, we can write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 2  1 -3 |  4 |\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 3  4 -7 | 11 |\n\nNow, we'll perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We can start by swapping Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 2  1 -3 |  4 |\n| 3  4 -7 | 11 |\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column of Rows 2 and 3. To do this, we'll subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 2 and subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 0  3 -7 |  6 |\n| 0  7 -13 | 14 |\n\nNow, we'll divide Row 2 by 3 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 0  1 -7/3 |  2 |\n| 0  7 -13 | 14 |\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 7 in the first column of Row 3. To do this, we'll subtract 7 times Row 2 from Row 3:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 0  1 -7/3 |  2 |\n| 0  0  2/3 |  0 |\n\nFinally, we'll multiply Row 3 by 3/2 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 0  1 -7/3 |  2 |\n| 0  0  1 |  0 |\n\nNow that the matrix is in row-echelon form, we can use back-substitution to find the solutions. From the third row, we have z = 0. Substituting this into the second row, we get y - (7/3)(0) = 2, so y = 2. Finally, substituting y and z into the first row, we get x - 2 + 2(0) = -1, so x = -1.\n\nThus, the set S has one solution: (-1, 2, 0). Therefore, the number of solutions in S is 1."
