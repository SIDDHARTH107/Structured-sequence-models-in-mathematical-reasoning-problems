Define a homotopy $F:X\\times [0,1] \\rightarrow Y$ by $F(x,t)=f(x)$ for all $x\\in X$ and $t\\in [0,1]$. Find the homotopy class $[F]$ of this homotopy in terms of $\\pi_1(Y,f(x_0))$.",
    "message_2": "Since the homotopy $F(x,t) = f(x)$ is constant with respect to $t$, it means that the homotopy does not change the path in $Y$ as $t$ varies. In other words, the homotopy is trivial, and it does not change the fundamental group of $Y$ at the base point $f(x_0)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the induced map $f_*: \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\to \\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$ given by $f_*([g]) = [f \\circ g]$ for any loop $g$ in $X$ based at $x_0$. The homotopy class $[F]$ can be understood as the homotopy class of the map $f$ on the level of fundamental groups, i.e., the induced map $f_*$.\n\nSince the homotopy $F$ is trivial, it means that the induced map $f_*$ does not change the homotopy class of loops in $X$. Therefore, the homotopy class $[F]$ is simply the identity map on $\\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$, i.e., $[F] = Id_{\\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the homotopy class $[F]$ of the given homotopy is the identity map on the fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$."
