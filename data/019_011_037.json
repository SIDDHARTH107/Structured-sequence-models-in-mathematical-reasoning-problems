    "message_2": "In relevance logic, a statement is considered true if the premises are relevant to the conclusion. In this case, we have the following premises and conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: P → Q (If 2+2=4, then 4+4=8)\nPremise 2: P (2+2=4)\n\nWe need to determine the truth value of Q (4+4=8).\n\nSince both premises are true and the conclusion (Q) is relevant to the premises, the truth value of the statement in relevance logic is true."
