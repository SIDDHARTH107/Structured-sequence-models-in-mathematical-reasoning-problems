    "message_1": "Suppose there are five farmers who use a common land to graze their cattle. Each farmer can graze a maximum of 10 cows, but if all of them increase their cattle beyond this number, the land will become overgrazed, and the productivity of the land will decrease. The cost of maintaining one cow is $50, and the income from selling one cow is $200. If a farmer grazes more than 10 cows, the productivity of his portion of the land decreases by 20%. Assuming that all the farmers are rational, what is the optimal number of cows to graze for each farmer?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation for one farmer. If a farmer grazes 10 cows or fewer, the income from each cow is $200, and the cost is $50, so the net income per cow is $150. If a farmer grazes more than 10 cows, the productivity of his portion of the land decreases by 20%, so the income from each cow is reduced to $200 * 0.8 = $160. The cost remains the same at $50, so the net income per cow is $160 - $50 = $110.\n\nNow, let's compare the net income for each farmer when they graze 10 cows and when they graze 11 cows:\n\n- If each farmer grazes 10 cows, the total net income for each farmer is 10 cows * $150 = $1500.\n- If each farmer grazes 11 cows, the total net income for each farmer is 10 cows * $150 + 1 cow * $110 = $1610.\n\nSince the net income is higher when each farmer grazes 11 cows, it is rational for each farmer to graze 11 cows. However, if all farmers graze 11 cows, the land will become overgrazed, and the productivity of the land will decrease. This means that the income from each cow will be reduced to $160 for all cows, not just the 11th cow. In this case, the total net income for each farmer would be 11 cows * $110 = $1210.\n\nGiven this information, it is not rational for all farmers to graze 11 cows, as the total net income for each farmer would be lower than if they grazed only 10 cows. Therefore, the optimal number of cows to graze for each farmer is 10 cows, as this maximizes their net income without causing the land to become overgrazed."
