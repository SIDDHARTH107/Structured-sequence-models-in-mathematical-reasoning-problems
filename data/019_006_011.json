    "message_1": "I apologize, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem related to deontic logic as it deals with the principles of obligation, permission, and prohibition, rather than numerical calculations. It is a branch of logic that focuses on the analysis of normative concepts and propositional attitudes that can be expressed through sentences such as \"it is obligatory to\" or \"it is permissible to.\" Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other mathematical problems or questions related to a different topic, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help."
