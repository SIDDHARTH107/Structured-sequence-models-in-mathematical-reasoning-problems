    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. \n\nThe prime factorization of each number is:\n7 = 7^1\n11 = 11^1\n13 = 13^1\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\nLCM = 7^1 × 11^1 × 13^1 = 7 × 11 × 13 = 1001\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 11, and 13 is 1001."
