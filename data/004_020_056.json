A constant force of magnitude 50 pounds is applied to the crate up the ramp. Find the work done in pulling the crate all the way to the top of the ramp using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done in pulling the crate all the way to the top of the ramp, we'll use the formula for work:\n\nW = ∫F(x) dx\n\nwhere W is the work done, F(x) is the force applied, and x is the distance along the ramp.\n\nSince the force is constant (50 pounds), we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nW = ∫(50) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the component of the force that is parallel to the ramp. To do this, we can use the angle of the ramp (30 degrees) and the cosine function:\n\nF_parallel = F * cos(θ)\nF_parallel = 50 * cos(30°)\n\nConverting the angle to radians:\n\n30° = (30 * π) / 180 = π/6 radians\n\nF_parallel = 50 * cos(π/6) = 50 * (√3/2) = 25√3 pounds\n\nNow, we can integrate the force component parallel to the ramp with respect to the distance along the ramp:\n\nW = ∫(25√3) dx from 0 to 20\n\nW = 25√3 * ∫dx from 0 to 20\n\nW = 25√3 * [x] from 0 to 20\n\nW = 25√3 * (20 - 0)\n\nW = 25√3 * 20\n\nW = 500√3\n\nThe work done in pulling the crate all the way to the top of the ramp is 500√3 foot-pounds."
