    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. G has an element of order 8 if and only if G is isomorphic to C8.\n2. G has an element of order 4 but no element of order 8 if and only if G is isomorphic to Q8 or D4.\n3. G has no element of order 4 or 8 if and only if G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nLet's start by finding the possible orders of elements in G. Since G has order 8, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\nNow, let's construct the multiplication table for G. Let G = {e, a, b, c, d, f, g, h}, where e is the identity element. We will use the properties of groups to fill in the table.\n\n1. The identity element e has order 1, so e * e = e.\n2. Each element in G has an inverse, so for each element x, there exists an element y such that x * y = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 8.\nSuppose a has order 8. Then, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, and G is a cyclic group generated by a. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: G has an element of order 4 but no element of order 8.\nSuppose a has order 4. Then, a^4 = e, and a^2 has order 2. Let b be an element in G not in the subgroup generated by a. Then, the subgroup generated by b must have order 2, so b^2 = e. Now, we have two possibilities:\n\n- If a * b = b * a, then G is an abelian group, and the elements of G can be written as {e, a, a^2, a^3, b, a * b, a^2 * b, a^3 * b}. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 4, which is isomorphic to C8. However, this contradicts our assumption that G has no element of order 8. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n- If a * b â‰  b * a, then G is a non-abelian group. In this case, G is isomorphic to either Q8 or D4.\n\nCase 3: G has no element of order 4 or 8.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Then, G is a group with 8 elements, where each element has order 1 or 2. This is the structure of the dihedral group D4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn conclusion, given a group G of order 8, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4."
