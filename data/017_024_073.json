    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find all possible group structures. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3. We will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups to find the possible group structures.\n\nFor the 2-group, we have the following possibilities:\n1. Z_32 x Z_2\n2. Z_16 x Z_4\n3. Z_16 x Z_2 x Z_2\n4. Z_8 x Z_8\n5. Z_8 x Z_4 x Z_2\n6. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n7. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_4\n8. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2\n9. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n10. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n\nFor the 3-group, we have the following possibilities:\n1. Z_3\n\nNow, we will use the direct product of the 2-group and 3-group structures to find the possible group structures of order 96. However, we will exclude the abelian ones.\n\n1. Z_32 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Abelian)\n2. Z_16 x Z_4 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n3. Z_16 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n4. Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n5. Z_8 x Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n6. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n7. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n8. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n9. Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Non-abelian)\n10. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 (Abelian)\n\nWe have 8 non-abelian group structures of order 96. However, some of these structures might be isomorphic to each other. To find the isomorphic classes, we can use the Schur Multiplier and the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem. After analyzing these structures, we find that there are 6 distinct isomorphic classes of non-abelian groups of order 96:\n\n1. Z_16 x Z_4 x Z_3\n2. Z_16 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3\n3. Z_8 x Z_8 x Z_3\n4. Z_8 x Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3\n5. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3\n6. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3\n\nSo, there are 6 non-abelian groups of order 96, and we have listed their isomorphic classes."
