    "message_1": "Sure, here's a multi-objective optimization problem that a math student can solve:\n\nA company produces two products: product A and product B. The production of product A requires 3 units of raw material X and 2 units of raw material Y. The production of product B requires 2 units of raw material X and 4 units of raw material Y. The company has 1500 units of raw material X and 2000 units of raw material Y available for production. Each unit of A earns a profit of $30 and each unit of B earns a profit of $40. The company wants to maximize its profit while also ensuring that it uses all available raw material. \nWhat is the optimal production quantity of each product that will maximize the company's profit while using all of the available raw material?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations and inequalities based on the given information. Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the raw materials are:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 1500 (raw material X)\n2x + 4y ≤ 2000 (raw material Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 30x + 40y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 1500\n2y ≤ -3x + 1500\ny ≤ -1.5x + 750\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 2000\n4y ≤ -2x + 2000\ny ≤ -0.5x + 500\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. Now we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 750 and y = -0.5x + 500:\n\n-1.5x + 750 = -0.5x + 500\n-1x = -250\nx = 250\n\ny = -0.5(250) + 500 = 375\n\nThe intersection point is (250, 375).\n\n2. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 750 and x = 0:\n\ny = -1.5(0) + 750 = 750\n\nThe intersection point is (0, 750).\n\n3. Intersection of y = -0.5x + 500 and x = 0:\n\ny = -0.5(0) + 500 = 500\n\nThe intersection point is (0, 500).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each corner point:\n\nP(250, 375) = 30(250) + 40(375) = 7500 + 15000 = 22,500\nP(0, 750) = 30(0) + 40(750) = 0 + 30000 = 30,000\nP(0, 500) = 30(0) + 40(500) = 0 + 20000 = 20,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 750) with a profit of $30,000. Therefore, the optimal production quantity is 0 units of product A and 750 units of product B."
