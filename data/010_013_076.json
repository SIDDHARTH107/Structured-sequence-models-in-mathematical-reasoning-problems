    "message_2": "Since $E$ is a rank 3 vector bundle over $S^1$, we can write it as a direct sum of line bundles, i.e., $E = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus L_3$. The determinant bundle is given by $\\mathrm{det}(E) = L_1 \\otimes L_2 \\otimes L_3$. We are given that $\\mathrm{det}(E)$ is trivial, which means that $L_1 \\otimes L_2 \\otimes L_3 \\cong \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the trivial line bundle.\n\nNow, we know that line bundles over $S^1$ are classified by their winding numbers (or degrees). Let $n_i$ be the winding number of $L_i$. Then, the condition $L_1 \\otimes L_2 \\otimes L_3 \\cong \\mathcal{O}$ implies that $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 0$.\n\nThe number of sections of a line bundle over $S^1$ is given by the absolute value of its winding number. Therefore, the number of sections of $E$ is given by the product of the number of sections of its constituent line bundles, i.e., $|n_1| \\cdot |n_2| \\cdot |n_3|$.\n\nSince $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 0$, we have the following possibilities for the winding numbers:\n\n1. $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (0, 0, 0)$\n2. $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (1, -1, 0)$ (and permutations)\n3. $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (2, -1, -1)$ (and permutations)\n\nIn the first case, the number of sections is $|0| \\cdot |0| \\cdot |0| = 0$.\n\nIn the second case, there are 3 permutations, and for each permutation, the number of sections is $|1| \\cdot |-1| \\cdot |0| = 0$. So, the total number of sections in this case is also 0.\n\nIn the third case, there are 3 permutations, and for each permutation, the number of sections is $|2| \\cdot |-1| \\cdot |-1| = 2$. So, the total number of sections in this case is $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sections that exist in $E$ is $0 + 0 + 6 = \\boxed{6}$."
