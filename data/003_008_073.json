    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle. So, let's first find the angle between the base and the height. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then using inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nLet the base be side a, the height be side b, and the hypotenuse be side c. We have:\n\na = 8 cm\nb = 10 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 8^2 + 10^2\nc^2 = 64 + 100\nc^2 = 164\nc = √164 ≈ 12.81 cm\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the base and the height. We can use the inverse tangent function (arctan) for this:\n\nangle = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nangle = arctan(b/a)\nangle = arctan(10/8)\nangle ≈ 51.34°\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 10 cm * sin(51.34°)\nArea ≈ 0.5 * 8 * 10 * 0.788\nArea ≈ 31.52 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 31.52 square centimeters."
