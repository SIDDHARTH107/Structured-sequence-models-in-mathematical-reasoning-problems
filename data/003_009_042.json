    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. Since the triangle has two equal sides of length 8 cm and a base of length 10 cm, it is an isosceles triangle. Let's denote the equal sides as a and b (both 8 cm) and the base as c (10 cm).\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle between the equal sides (angle C). The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n10² = 8² + 8² - 2 * 8 * 8 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 64 + 64 - 128 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 128 - 128 * cos(C)\n\n128 * cos(C) = 28\n\ncos(C) = 28 / 128\ncos(C) ≈ 0.21875\n\nNow we can find angle C:\n\nC = arccos(0.21875)\nC ≈ 77.47°\n\nSince it's an isosceles triangle, the other two angles (A and B) are equal. We can find one of them using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nA + B + C = 180°\nA + A + 77.47° = 180°\n2A = 180° - 77.47°\n2A = 102.53°\nA = 51.265°\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of the third side (c). The Law of Sines states:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe can use the first part of the equation to find c:\n\nc / sin(C) = a / sin(A)\n\nc = (a * sin(C)) / sin(A)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nc = (8 * sin(77.47°)) / sin(51.265°)\n\nc ≈ 10.00 cm\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 8 + 8 + 10\nPerimeter = 26 cm"
