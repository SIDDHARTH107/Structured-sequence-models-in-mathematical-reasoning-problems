    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and group properties.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k is the highest power of p dividing the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k (called a Sylow p-subgroup).\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted n_p, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nSince G has order 16 = 2^4, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1, which means that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. This implies that this subgroup is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\n1. If G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to C16. A cyclic group of order 16 has a unique element of order 16, and all other non-identity elements have orders that are divisors of 16. Since G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, this is a possibility.\n\n2. If G is the dihedral group D8, then G has order 16 and is non-abelian. D8 has 8 rotational symmetries and 8 reflectional symmetries. The rotational subgroup is cyclic of order 8 and is a normal subgroup of D8. The reflectional elements have order 2. Since G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, this is also a possibility.\n\n3. If G is a non-abelian group of order 16 that is not isomorphic to D8, then G must have a different structure than D8. One such possibility is the quaternion group Q16, which has elements of order 4 and is non-abelian. Another possibility is a semi-direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 or 8. In either case, G would have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, making this a possibility as well.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional information about G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16. All three possibilities are consistent with the given information."
