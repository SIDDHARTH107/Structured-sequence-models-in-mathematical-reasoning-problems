    "message_1": "Given a game with two players A and B. A can make a truthful statement or lie about the payoff they receive from their actions. If A makes a truthful statement, then it is more likely for the players to achieve a high payoff. If A lies, the players are less likely to achieve a high payoff. \n\nSuppose A and B play the game 5 times. If A always lies, then the payoff matrix is given by:\n\n|      | B cooperates | B defects |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| A lie | 0, 3        | 1, 1     |\n| A lie | 0, 3        | 1, 1     |\n| A lie | 0, 3        | 1, 1     |\n| A lie | 0, 3        | 1, 1     |\n| A lie | 0, 3        | 1, 1     |\n\nIf A always tells the truth, then the payoff matrix is given by:\n\n|        | B cooperates | B defects |\n|--------|-------------|----------|\n| A truth | 3, 0        | 1, 1     |\n| A truth | 3, 0        | 1, 1     |\n| A truth | 3, 0        | 1, 1     |\n| A truth | 3, 0        | 1, 1     |\n| A truth | 3, 0        | 1, 1     |\n\nAssuming that B always cooperates, what would be the expected value of the game for player A if they always tell the truth compared to if they always lie?",
    "message_2": "If B always cooperates, we can find the expected value of the game for player A by looking at the payoffs in the \"B cooperates\" column for both cases (A always lies and A always tells the truth).\n\nWhen A always lies and B cooperates, the payoff for A in each of the 5 games is 0. So, the total payoff for A when they always lie is 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nWhen A always tells the truth and B cooperates, the payoff for A in each of the 5 games is 3. So, the total payoff for A when they always tell the truth is 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the game for player A when they always tell the truth is 15, and when they always lie, it is 0."
