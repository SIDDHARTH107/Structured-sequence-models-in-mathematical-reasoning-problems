    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a base of 6cm, a top length of 10cm, and a height of 8cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 is 6cm, base2 is 10cm, and the height is 8cm. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 10) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (16) * 8\nArea = 8 * 8\nArea = 64 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 64 square centimeters."
