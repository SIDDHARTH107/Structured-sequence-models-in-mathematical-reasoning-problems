The cost of producing x units is given by the function:\n\nC(x) = 100x + 5000/x\n\nUse Newton's method to determine the minimum cost and the number of units that should be produced to achieve this minimum cost.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost, we need to find the critical points of the cost function C(x) by taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero. Then, we will use Newton's method to find the value of x that gives the minimum cost.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the cost function C(x):\n\nC(x) = 100x + 5000/x\nC'(x) = d/dx (100x) + d/dx (5000/x)\n\nUsing the power rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\nC'(x) = 100 - 5000/x^2\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting C'(x) equal to zero:\n\n0 = 100 - 5000/x^2\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for x^2:\n\n5000/x^2 = 100\nx^2 = 5000/100\nx^2 = 50\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the value of x that gives the minimum cost. Newton's method is an iterative process with the following formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nIn our case, f(x) = C'(x) and f'(x) = C''(x). First, let's find the second derivative of the cost function:\n\nC''(x) = d/dx (100 - 5000/x^2)\nC''(x) = 0 + d/dx (-5000/x^2)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nC''(x) = 10000/x^3\n\nNow, let's apply Newton's method. We will start with an initial guess of x_0 = 5 (since x^2 = 50, x ≈ 7.07). We will perform a few iterations to get a more accurate value for x:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - C'(x_0) / C''(x_0)\nx_1 = 5 - (100 - 5000/5^2) / (10000/5^3)\nx_1 = 5 - (100 - 200) / (10000/125)\nx_1 = 5 - (-100) / 80\nx_1 = 5 + 1.25\nx_1 = 6.25\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - C'(x_1) / C''(x_1)\nx_2 = 6.25 - (100 - 5000/6.25^2) / (10000/6.25^3)\nx_2 ≈ 7.07\n\nSince the value of x has stabilized around 7.07, we can stop the iterations here. Now, let's find the minimum cost by plugging this value of x into the cost function:\n\nC(7.07) = 100(7.07) + 5000/7.07\nC(7.07) ≈ 707 + 707\nC(7.07) ≈ 1414\n\nSo, the minimum cost is approximately $1414, and the company should produce about 7 units to achieve this minimum cost."
