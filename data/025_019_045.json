    "message_2": "The Fano surface of four skew lines in a 3-dimensional projective space is a surface that contains all the lines connecting the four skew lines. In this case, the Fano surface is a smooth quadric surface.\n\nThe degree of a surface is the number of intersection points with a generic line in the projective space. For a smooth quadric surface, the degree is 2. Therefore, the degree of the Fano surface of four skew lines in a 3-dimensional projective space is 2."
