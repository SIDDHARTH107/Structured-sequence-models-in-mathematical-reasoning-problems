Show that the set S = f^(-1)(c) is a smooth submanifold of M and compute its dimension. \n\nFor example, if M is a 3-dimensional manifold, and f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, find the dimension of the submanifold S = f^(-1)(1).",
    "message_2": "To show that S is a smooth submanifold of M, we will use the Regular Level Set Theorem. The theorem states that if f: M -> R is a smooth function and c is a regular value of f, then the level set S = f^(-1)(c) is a smooth submanifold of M, and its dimension is given by dim(S) = dim(M) - dim(R).\n\nIn our case, f: M -> R is a smooth function, and we are given that c is a regular value of f. Therefore, by the Regular Level Set Theorem, S = f^(-1)(c) is a smooth submanifold of M.\n\nNow, let's compute the dimension of S. Since M is an n-dimensional manifold and f maps to R (which is 1-dimensional), the dimension of S is given by:\n\ndim(S) = dim(M) - dim(R) = n - 1.\n\nFor the example given, M is a 3-dimensional manifold, and f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2. We want to find the dimension of the submanifold S = f^(-1)(1). In this case, n = 3, and thus:\n\ndim(S) = dim(M) - dim(R) = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSo, the dimension of the submanifold S = f^(-1)(1) is 2."
