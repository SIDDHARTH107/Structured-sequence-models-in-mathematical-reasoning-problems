    "message_2": "The Laplacian of a function u(x, y) is given by the sum of its second partial derivatives with respect to x and y, i.e.,\n\nLaplacian(u) = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y².\n\nFirst, let's find the second partial derivatives of u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2.\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x,\n∂²u/∂x² = 2,\n\n∂u/∂y = -2y,\n∂²u/∂y² = -2.\n\nNow, we can find the Laplacian of u(x, y):\n\nLaplacian(u) = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nSo, the Laplacian of the given harmonic function u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 is 0."
