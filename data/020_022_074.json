    "message_1": "A company has a total of 1,000 units to allocate between 2 products, A and B. Product A generates a profit of $5 per unit sold while Product B generates a profit of $8 per unit sold. However, Product B requires more resources and can only produce a maximum of 600 units while Product A can produce up to 800 units. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 1000 (total units constraint)\n2. x ≤ 800 (Product A constraint)\n3. y ≤ 600 (Product B constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 1000 is a straight line with slope -1 and y-intercept 1000. When x = 0, y = 1000, and when y = 0, x = 1000.\n2. x = 800 is a vertical line at x = 800.\n3. y = 600 is a horizontal line at y = 600.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 600), (400, 600), (800, 200), and (800, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 600) = 5(0) + 8(600) = $4800\n2. P(400, 600) = 5(400) + 8(600) = $6800\n3. P(800, 200) = 5(800) + 8(200) = $6000\n4. P(800, 0) = 5(800) + 8(0) = $4000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (400, 600), with a profit of $6800. Therefore, the company should produce 400 units of Product A and 600 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
