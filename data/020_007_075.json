    "message_2": "To find the best possible work schedule that takes into account the preferences of every employee, we can try to assign employees to their most preferred shifts first and then adjust as needed to ensure each shift has two employees.\n\n1. Assign employees to their 1st choice shifts:\n   - Shift 1: Employees 1 and 2\n   - Shift 2: Employees 3 and 4\n   - Shift 3: Employees 5 and 6\n\nThis schedule already satisfies the condition of having 2 employees per shift. Since all employees are assigned to their 1st choice shifts, this is the best possible work schedule.\n\nThe best possible work schedule is:\n\n- Shift 1: Employees 1 and 2\n- Shift 2: Employees 3 and 4\n- Shift 3: Employees 5 and 6"
