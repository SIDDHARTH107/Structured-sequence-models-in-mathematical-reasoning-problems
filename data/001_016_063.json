    "message_2": "To simplify the expression (2^3 * 2^5) / 2^4, we can use the properties of exponents.\n\nWhen multiplying two exponents with the same base, we can add the exponents: 2^(3+5) = 2^8.\n\nNow we have the expression 2^8 / 2^4. When dividing two exponents with the same base, we can subtract the exponents: 2^(8-4) = 2^4.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 2^4."
