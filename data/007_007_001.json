    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 8x + 15y = 127 in positive integers x and y, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the general solution for x and y.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 15 using the Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n15 = 1 * 8 + 7\n8 = 1 * 7 + 1\n7 = 7 * 1\n\nThe GCD of 8 and 15 is 1, which means there exists a solution for the given Diophantine equation.\n\nNow, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients for the Bézout's identity:\n\n1 = 8 - 1 * 7\n1 = 8 - 1 * (15 - 1 * 8)\n1 = 2 * 8 - 1 * 15\n\nSo, the Bézout's identity is 1 = 2 * 8 - 1 * 15.\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the Bézout's identity by 127:\n\n127 = 2 * 8 * 127 - 1 * 15 * 127\n\nNow, we have:\n\n127 = 254 * 8 - 127 * 15\n\nThis gives us a particular solution for the Diophantine equation:\n\n8x + 15y = 127\n8(254) + 15(-127) = 127\n\nNow, we can find the general solution for x and y:\n\nx = 254 - 15t\ny = -127 + 8t\n\nwhere t is an integer.\n\nWe are looking for positive integer solutions for x and y, so we need to find a value of t that makes both x and y positive:\n\nx = 254 - 15t > 0\ny = -127 + 8t > 0\n\nSolving for t in both inequalities:\n\nt < 254/15\nt > 127/8\n\nThe smallest integer value of t that satisfies both inequalities is t = 17.\n\nNow, we can find the positive integer solution for x and y:\n\nx = 254 - 15(17) = 254 - 255 = -1\ny = -127 + 8(17) = -127 + 136 = 9\n\nHowever, x is negative, so we need to find the next value of t that gives us positive integer solutions for x and y. Let's try t = 18:\n\nx = 254 - 15(18) = 254 - 270 = -16\ny = -127 + 8(18) = -127 + 144 = 17\n\nAgain, x is negative. Let's try t = 19:\n\nx = 254 - 15(19) = 254 - 285 = 31\ny = -127 + 8(19) = -127 + 152 = 25\n\nNow, we have a positive integer solution for x and y:\n\nx = 31\ny = 25\n\nSo, the positive integer solution for the Diophantine equation 8x + 15y = 127 is x = 31 and y = 25."
