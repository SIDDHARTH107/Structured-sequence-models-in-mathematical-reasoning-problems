    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can apply the Sylow theorems. In particular, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 25.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let H be this normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is cyclic. Thus, H is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5, denoted by C_5.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of G/H is 25/5 = 5, which is prime. Therefore, G/H is also cyclic and isomorphic to C_5.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and G/H, which are both isomorphic to C_5. Hence, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted by C_5 × C_5.\n\nIf n_5 = 25, then G has 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, each of order 5. Since the total number of elements in these subgroups is 25 * (5 - 1) = 100, which is greater than the order of G, this case is not possible.\n\nTherefore, G must be either cyclic (if it is isomorphic to a single cyclic group of order 25) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (if it is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5)."
