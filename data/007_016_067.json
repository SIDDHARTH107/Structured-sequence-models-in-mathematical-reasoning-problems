    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain primes greater than 400, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 400 and see if they satisfy the condition.\n\n401 is not prime (divisible by 13 and 31).\nThe next prime is 409. 2 * 409 + 1 = 819, which is not prime (divisible by 3).\nThe next prime is 419. 2 * 419 + 1 = 839, which is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 400 is 419."
