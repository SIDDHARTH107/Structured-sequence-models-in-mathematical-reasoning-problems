    "message_2": "A symplectic 4-ball is a 4-dimensional ball, and its volume can be found using the formula for the volume of an n-dimensional ball:\n\nV = (π^(n/2) * R^n) / Γ(n/2 + 1),\n\nwhere V is the volume, R is the radius, n is the dimension, and Γ is the gamma function.\n\nFor a symplectic 4-ball (n = 4) with radius R = 3, we have:\n\nV = (π^(4/2) * 3^4) / Γ(4/2 + 1)\nV = (π^2 * 81) / Γ(3)\nV = (9π^2) / 2\n\nSo, the volume of the symplectic 4-ball with radius 3 is (9π^2) / 2."
