The cable is 10 meters long and has a speed of propagation of 300,000,000 meters per second. What is the frequency of the wave? Using Fourier analysis, find the expression for the wave in terms of its spectral components.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the wave, we can look at the given function f(t) = sin(100πt). The argument of the sine function is 100πt, which can be written as 2πft, where f is the frequency. Therefore, we have:\n\n100π = 2πf\n\nSolving for f, we get:\n\nf = 100π / 2π = 50 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the wave is 50 Hz.\n\nNow, let's find the expression for the wave in terms of its spectral components using Fourier analysis. Since the given function is a sine function, we can use the Fourier sine series representation:\n\nf(t) = Σ [B_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere B_n is the Fourier coefficient for the nth harmonic, ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf), and n is an integer representing the harmonic number.\n\nFor the given function f(t) = sin(100πt), we can see that it is already in the Fourier sine series form with only one term. Therefore, the spectral components of the wave are:\n\nB_1 = 1 (since the coefficient of sin(100πt) is 1)\nn = 1 (since it is the first harmonic)\nω = 100π (angular frequency)\n\nSo, the expression for the wave in terms of its spectral components is:\n\nf(t) = sin(100πt)\n\nThis means that the wave has only one spectral component, which is the first harmonic with an amplitude of 1 and an angular frequency of 100π rad/s."
