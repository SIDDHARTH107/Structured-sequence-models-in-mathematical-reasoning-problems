(Hint: The Peano curve is a fractal that never ends, but you can approximate its length by adding up the length of the line segments used to construct it.)",
    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that is constructed by iteratively dividing each line segment into three equal parts and connecting the endpoints in a specific pattern. With each iteration, the curve becomes more complex and fills more space, but its length increases.\n\nLet's denote the length of the Peano curve after n iterations as L_n. Initially, L_0 = 1 (a single line segment of length 1).\n\nIn the first iteration, each line segment is divided into three equal parts, and the curve is constructed by connecting these parts. This results in a curve with 9 segments, each of length 1/3. So, L_1 = 9 * (1/3) = 3.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 9 segments is again divided into three equal parts, resulting in 9^2 = 81 segments, each of length (1/3)^2. So, L_2 = 81 * (1/3)^2 = 9.\n\nIn general, after n iterations, there will be 9^n segments, each of length (1/3)^n. Therefore, the length of the Peano curve after n iterations can be calculated as:\n\nL_n = 9^n * (1/3)^n\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the Peano curve becomes a fractal that never ends. However, we can approximate its length by calculating L_n for a large value of n. Keep in mind that the curve will never have a finite length, as it keeps increasing with each iteration."
