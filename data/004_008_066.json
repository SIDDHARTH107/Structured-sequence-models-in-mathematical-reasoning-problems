    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a given point, we need to find the derivative of the equation with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given x-coordinate.\n\nThe given equation is y = 3x^2 + 2x - 1.\n\nLet's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(3x^2 + 2x - 1)/dx = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at the given point (2, 17):\n\ndy/dx(2) = 6(2) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (2, 17) is 14."
