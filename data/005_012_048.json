    "message_2": "To calculate the minimum sample size required to estimate the population mean with a 95% confidence interval, we can use the formula:\n\nn = (Z * σ / E)^2\n\nwhere n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for a 95% confidence interval), σ is the population standard deviation, and E is the margin of error.\n\nGiven the population standard deviation (σ) is 10 and the margin of error (E) is 2, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96 * 10 / 2)^2\n\nn = (9.8)^2\n\nn ≈ 96.04\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size required is 97."
