    "message_1": "A company wants to produce two types of smartphones, A and B. The production cost of type A is $120 per unit and the production cost of type B is $150 per unit. The selling price for type A is $200 per unit and for type B is $240 per unit. The company wants to determine the number of units of each type they should produce to maximize their profit.\n\nWrite down the optimization problem with the objective function and constraints, and find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A smartphones produced and y be the number of units of type B smartphones produced.\n\nObjective function (Profit):\nThe profit function P(x, y) is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. The total revenue is the selling price of each type multiplied by the number of units produced, and the total cost is the production cost of each type multiplied by the number of units produced.\n\nP(x, y) = (200x + 240y) - (120x + 150y)\nP(x, y) = 80x + 90y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Non-negativity constraint: The number of units produced cannot be negative.\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\n2. Production capacity constraint: The company has a limited production capacity. Let's assume the company can produce a maximum of M units of smartphones in total.\nx + y ≤ M\n\nThe optimization problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 80x + 90y\nSubject to:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx + y ≤ M\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the feasible region and analyzing the corner points.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the value of M (maximum production capacity), we cannot find the exact optimal solution. If the value of M is provided, we can find the optimal solution by analyzing the corner points of the feasible region."
