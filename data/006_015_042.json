    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time, given the average rate of occurrence (λ).\n\nIn this case, the average time between attacks is 30 minutes, so the average rate of occurrence (λ) is 1 attack per 30 minutes. We want to find the probability of an attack occurring every 15 minutes, which means we want to find the probability of 2 attacks occurring in a 30-minute interval.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given interval, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), λ is the average rate of occurrence, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-1) * (1^2)) / 2!\nP(X = 2) = (0.3679 * 1) / 2\nP(X = 2) = 0.3679 / 2\nP(X = 2) = 0.18395\n\nSo, the probability of a cyber attack occurring on a network every 15 minutes, given that the average time between attacks is 30 minutes, is approximately 18.4%."
