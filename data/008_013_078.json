    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants (11, -3, 23).\n\nA = |  2  3  4 |\n    | -2  2  1 |\n    |  4  7  2 |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | -3 |\n    | 23 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nWe will use Doolittle's method for LU decomposition, which states that the diagonal elements of L are all 1.\n\n1. First, we find the elements of the first row of U and the first column of L:\n\nu11 = a11 = 2\nl11 = 1 (by Doolittle's method)\nl21 = a21 / u11 = -2 / 2 = -1\nl31 = a31 / u11 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\n2. Next, we find the elements of the second row of U and the second column of L:\n\nu12 = a12 = 3\nu22 = a22 - l21 * u12 = 2 - (-1) * 3 = 5\nl22 = 1 (by Doolittle's method)\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * u12) / u22 = (7 - 2 * 3) / 5 = 1/5\n\n3. Finally, we find the elements of the third row of U and the third column of L:\n\nu13 = a13 = 4\nu23 = a23 - l21 * u13 = 1 - (-1) * 4 = 5\nu33 = a33 - l31 * u13 - l32 * u23 = 2 - 2 * 4 - 1/5 * 5 = -5\nl33 = 1 (by Doolittle's method)\n\nNow we have the L and U matrices:\n\nL = |  1   0   0 |\n    | -1   1   0 |\n    |  2  1/5  1 |\n\nU = |  2   3   4  |\n    |  0   5   5  |\n    |  0   0  -5  |\n\nStep 2: Solve the system L * Y = B for Y\n\n1. y1 = b1 / l11 = 11 / 1 = 11\n2. y2 = (b2 - l21 * y1) / l22 = (-3 - (-1) * 11) / 1 = 8\n3. y3 = (b3 - l31 * y1 - l32 * y2) / l33 = (23 - 2 * 11 - 1/5 * 8) / 1 = 4\n\nY = | 11 |\n    |  8  |\n    |  4  |\n\nStep 3: Solve the system U * X = Y for X\n\n1. z = y3 / u33 = 4 / -5 = -4/5\n2. y = (y2 - u23 * z) / u22 = (8 - 5 * (-4/5)) / 5 = 2\n3. x = (y1 - u12 * y - u13 * z) / u11 = (11 - 3 * 2 - 4 * (-4/5)) / 2 = 1\n\nX = |  1  |\n    |  2  |\n    | -4/5|\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = -4/5."
