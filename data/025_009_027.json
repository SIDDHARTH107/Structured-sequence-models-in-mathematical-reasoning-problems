    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the curve equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^5 - 3x^3 - 4x - 1$. The partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -5x^4 - 9x^2 - 4$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$-5x^4 - 9x^2 - 4 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now we need to find the x values that satisfy the first equation:\n\n$-5x^4 - 9x^2 - 4 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x^2$. Let $u = x^2$, then the equation becomes:\n\n$-5u^2 - 9u - 4 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$u = \\frac{-(-9) \\pm \\sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4(-5)(-4)}}{2(-5)}$\n\n$u = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 80}}{-10}$\n\n$u = \\frac{9 \\pm 1}{-10}$\n\nSo we have two possible values for $u$:\n\n$u_1 = \\frac{9 + 1}{-10} = -1$\n\n$u_2 = \\frac{9 - 1}{-10} = -\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nSince $u = x^2$, we have:\n\n$x^2 = -1$ has no real solutions.\n\n$x^2 = -\\frac{4}{5}$ has no real solutions.\n\nThus, there are no singular points on the curve with real coordinates."
