    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a Rail fence cipher with a depth of 3. Find the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "A Rail fence cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of the plaintext in a zigzag pattern along a number of \"rails\". In this case, we have a depth of 3, which means we will have 3 rails. Let's write the message \"HELLO WORLD\" along the rails in a zigzag pattern:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, let's read the characters along the rails from left to right, top to bottom:\n\nHORELWLDLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message using a Rail fence cipher with a depth of 3 is \"HORELWLDLO\"."
