    "message_2": "To determine the maximum possible dimension of the intersection cohomology module $M$, we first need to understand the relationship between the Betti numbers $b_i$ and the dimensions of the cohomology groups.\n\nFor a complex projective algebraic variety $X$ of dimension $d$, the Betti numbers $b_i$ are the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. In particular, we have $b_i = \\dim H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nThe intersection cohomology module $M$ is a graded module, with each graded piece $M^i$ corresponding to the intersection cohomology group $IH^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. The dimension of $M$ is the sum of the dimensions of its graded pieces, i.e., $\\dim M = \\sum_i \\dim M^i$.\n\nNow, we are given that $b_1 = 4$ and $b_2 = 6$. Since $X$ is a complex projective algebraic variety, it follows from the Hodge decomposition theorem that the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ are isomorphic to the direct sum of the Hodge groups $H^{p,q}(X)$, where $p+q=i$. In particular, we have\n$$\nb_1 = \\dim H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = \\sum_{p+q=1} \\dim H^{p,q}(X),\n$$\nand\n$$\nb_2 = \\dim H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = \\sum_{p+q=2} \\dim H^{p,q}(X).\n$$\n\nSince $X$ is a complex projective algebraic variety, its Hodge numbers satisfy the Hodge symmetry property, i.e., $h^{p,q}(X) = h^{q,p}(X)$, where $h^{p,q}(X) = \\dim H^{p,q}(X)$. Therefore, we have\n$$\nb_1 = h^{1,0}(X) + h^{0,1}(X) = 2h^{1,0}(X),\n$$\nand\n$$\nb_2 = h^{2,0}(X) + h^{1,1}(X) + h^{0,2}(X) = h^{2,0}(X) + h^{1,1}(X) + h^{2,0}(X) = 2h^{2,0}(X) + h^{1,1}(X).\n$$\n\nFrom the given information, we have $2h^{1,0}(X) = 4$ and $2h^{2,0}(X) + h^{1,1}(X) = 6$. Solving these equations, we get $h^{1,0}(X) = 2$, $h^{2,0}(X) = 1$, and $h^{1,1}(X) = 4$.\n\nNow, the intersection cohomology groups $IH^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ are related to the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ by the decomposition theorem. In particular, we have\n$$\n\\dim M^i = \\dim IH^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\leq \\dim H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = b_i,\n$$\nfor all $i$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible dimension of $M$ is given by\n$$\n\\dim M \\leq \\sum_i b_i = b_1 + b_2 = 4 + 6 = 10.\n$$\n\nThus, the maximum possible dimension of the intersection cohomology module $M$ is 10."
