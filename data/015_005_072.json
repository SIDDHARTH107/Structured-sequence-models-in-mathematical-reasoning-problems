    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of a dynamical system to initial conditions. For the Rössler system, the equations are given by:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the parameters of the system. To calculate the Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize the system around a fixed point and find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The fixed points of the Rössler system can be found by setting the derivatives equal to zero and solving for x, y, and z:\n\n0 = -y - z\n0 = x + ay\n0 = b + z(x - c)\n\nSolving these equations, we find one fixed point at (x*, y*, z*) = (c, -b/a, -b/a). Now, we need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n\nJ = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y  ∂f/∂z | = |  0   -1   -1  |\n    | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y  ∂g/∂z |   |  1    a    0  |\n    | ∂h/∂x  ∂h/∂y  ∂h/∂z |   |  z    0   x-c |\n\nNext, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the fixed point (c, -b/a, -b/a):\n\nJ* = |  0   -1   -1  |\n       |  1    a    0  |\n       | -b/a  0   c-c |\n\nJ* = |  0   -1   -1  |\n       |  1   0.2   0  |\n       | -1   0    0  |\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of J*. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\ndet(J* - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The determinant of the matrix is:\n\n| -λ   -1   -1  |\n|  1   0.2-λ  0  |\n| -1    0   -λ  |\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get the characteristic equation:\n\n(-λ)((0.2-λ)(-λ) - 0) - (-1)(1(-1) - (-1)(0)) + (-1)(1(0) - (-1)(-1)) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nλ^3 - 0.2λ^2 + λ - 0.2 = 0\n\nTo find the roots of this cubic equation, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or specialized software. Using a numerical solver, we find the eigenvalues to be approximately:\n\nλ1 ≈ -0.10\nλ2 ≈ 0.05 + 0.97i\nλ3 ≈ 0.05 - 0.97i\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is given by the real part of the largest eigenvalue, which in this case is λ1 ≈ -0.10. Therefore, the Lyapunov exponent for the Rössler system with the given parameters is approximately -0.10, or -0.1 when rounded to the nearest hundredth."
