    "message_2": "To solve the given optimization problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of 20 nests (solutions) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the objective function f(x, y).\n3. Perform the following steps for a maximum of 1000 iterations or until the minimum tolerance of 0.01 is reached:\n   a. Generate a new solution (cuckoo) by modifying a randomly chosen nest using the step size of 0.1.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. If the new solution is better than the worst nest in the population, replace the worst nest with the new solution.\n   d. Randomly choose a fraction of nests to be abandoned and replaced with new random solutions.\n   e. Evaluate the fitness of the new nests and update the best solution found so far.\n\nSince the cuckoo search algorithm is a stochastic optimization algorithm, it involves random processes, and the results may vary in different runs. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific solution for this problem. However, you can implement the cuckoo search algorithm in a programming language like Python and run it to find the minimum value of f(x, y) and the values of x and y that minimize it.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, y):\n    return 3 * x**2 + 2 * y**2 - x * y - 7\n\ndef generate_random_solution(bounds):\n    return [np.random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(len(bounds))]\n\ndef cuckoo_search(bounds, n_nests=20, max_iter=1000, step_size=0.1, tolerance=0.01):\n    nests = [generate_random_solution(bounds) for _ in range(n_nests)]\n    best_nest = min(nests, key=lambda nest: f(*nest))\n    best_fitness = f(*best_nest)\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        new_nest = [best_nest[i] + step_size * np.random.normal() for i in range(len(bounds))]\n        new_fitness = f(*new_nest)\n\n        if new_fitness < best_fitness:\n            worst_nest = max(nests, key=lambda nest: f(*nest))\n            nests.remove(worst_nest)\n            nests.append(new_nest)\n            best_nest = new_nest\n            best_fitness = new_fitness\n\n        nests_to_abandon = np.random.choice(nests, size=int(n_nests * 0.1), replace=False)\n        for nest in nests_to_abandon:\n            nests.remove(nest)\n            new_nest = generate_random_solution(bounds)\n            nests.append(new_nest)\n\n        if abs(best_fitness - f(*min(nests, key=lambda nest: f(*nest)))) < tolerance:\n            break\n\n    return best_nest, best_fitness\n\nbounds = [(-10, 10), (-10, 10)]\nbest_solution, min_value = cuckoo_search(bounds)\nprint(f\"Minimum value of f(x, y): {min_value}\")\nprint(f\"Values of x and y that minimize f(x, y): {best_solution}\")\n```\n\nRun this code to obtain the minimum value of f(x, y) and the values of x and y that minimize it. Note that the results may vary in different runs due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm."
