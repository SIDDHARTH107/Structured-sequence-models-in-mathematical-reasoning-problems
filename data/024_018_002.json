    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 at the point (1/2, √3/2, 0) in the direction of the vector v = (1/√2, 1/√2, 0), we first need to find the tangent plane at the given point and then find the curvature of the curve obtained by intersecting the tangent plane with the surface.\n\nThe surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 is a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin. The gradient of the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 at the point (1/2, √3/2, 0) is given by:\n\n∇F(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n∇F(1/2, √3/2, 0) = (1, √3, 0)\n\nThe tangent plane at the point (1/2, √3/2, 0) is given by the equation:\n\n1(x - 1/2) + √3(y - √3/2) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nx + √3y - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the curve obtained by intersecting the tangent plane with the surface. To do this, we substitute the equation of the tangent plane into the equation of the surface:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + √3y - 2)^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nz^2 = 3x^2 - 4√3xy + 12y^2 - 4z^2 + 8z - 4\n\nThis is the equation of a conic section in the x-y plane. To find the curvature of this curve at the point (1/2, √3/2, 0), we need to find the second fundamental form of the surface and evaluate it at the given point.\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by:\n\nII = Ldu^2 + 2Mdudv + Ndv^2\n\nwhere L, M, and N are the coefficients of the second fundamental form, and u and v are the coordinates in the tangent plane.\n\nWe have the gradient ∇F(1/2, √3/2, 0) = (1, √3, 0), and the normal vector to the tangent plane is N = (1, √3, 0). We can find the coefficients L, M, and N by taking the second derivatives of F(x, y, z) with respect to x, y, and z:\n\nF_xx = 2, F_yy = 2, F_zz = 2\nF_xy = 0, F_xz = 0, F_yz = 0\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients L, M, and N:\n\nL = N • F_xx = (1, √3, 0) • (2, 0, 0) = 2\nM = N • F_xy = (1, √3, 0) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nN = N • F_yy = (1, √3, 0) • (0, 2, 0) = 2√3\n\nNow, we can find the curvature of the curve at the point (1/2, √3/2, 0) in the direction of the vector v = (1/√2, 1/√2, 0):\n\nK = (Lv^2 + 2Muv + Nu^2) / (Eu^2 + 2Fuv + Gu^2)\n\nwhere E, F, and G are the coefficients of the first fundamental form.\n\nWe have E = F_x^2 + F_y^2 + F_z^2 = 1^2 + (√3)^2 + 0^2 = 4, F = 0, and G = 4.\n\nNow, we can find the curvature K:\n\nK = (2(1/√2)^2 + 2*0(1/√2)(1/√2) + 2√3(1/√2)^2) / (4(1/√2)^2 + 2*0(1/√2)(1/√2) + 4(1/√2)^2)\n\nK = (1/2 + 0 + 3/2) / (2 + 0 + 2)\n\nK = 2/4\n\nK = 1/2\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 at the point (1/2, √3/2, 0) in the direction of the vector v = (1/√2, 1/√2, 0) is 1/2."
