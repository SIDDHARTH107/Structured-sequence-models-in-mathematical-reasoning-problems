    "message_1": "Suppose there are three individuals - Alice, Bob, and Charles - in a room, and they each know a unique secret. Alice knows secret A, Bob knows secret B, and Charles knows secret C. However, none of them knows their own secret, but they are aware that each secret is one of the letters A, B, or C. \n\nUsing epistemic logic, how can they figure out their own secret without telling each other their secrets?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the process of elimination and reasoning. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. Alice asks Bob if he knows Charles's secret. If Bob knows Charles's secret, then Alice would know her own secret, since there are only three secrets (A, B, or C). However, Bob does not know Charles's secret, so he says \"No.\"\n\n2. Now, Charles knows that Bob doesn't know his secret. If Charles's secret were A, then Bob's secret would be either B or C. Since Alice knows that Bob doesn't know Charles's secret, she would be able to deduce that her secret must be C (the only remaining option). However, Alice doesn't say anything, so Charles concludes that his secret cannot be A.\n\n3. Now, Alice knows that Charles's secret is either B or C. If Alice's secret were B, then Charles's secret would be C. But if Alice's secret were C, then Charles's secret would be B. Since Alice knows that Charles has deduced that his secret is not A, she can now deduce her own secret based on Charles's secret. If Charles's secret were B, then her secret would be C. If Charles's secret were C, then her secret would be B.\n\n4. Now, Bob knows that Alice and Charles have both deduced their own secrets. If Bob's secret were A, then Alice's secret would be B, and Charles's secret would be C. If Bob's secret were B, then Alice's secret would be C, and Charles's secret would be A. Since Bob knows that Alice and Charles have deduced their own secrets, he can now deduce his own secret based on their secrets. If Alice's secret were B, then his secret would be A. If Alice's secret were C, then his secret would be B.\n\n5. Since each person has deduced their own secret based on the secrets of the others, they have successfully figured out their own secrets without telling each other their secrets. Alice knows her secret is B, Bob knows his secret is A, and Charles knows his secret is C."
