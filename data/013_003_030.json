    "message_1": "Suppose that two players are playing the Ultimatum game with a total of $100. Player 1 proposes a split of the money, and player 2 must either accept or reject the proposal. If player 2 accepts, the money is divided as proposed, and if player 2 rejects, neither player gets any money. Find the largest proposed amount that player 1 can offer to player 2, such that player 2 accepts the proposal, under the following conditions: \n\n1. Player 2's minimum acceptable offer is $30.\n2. If player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money.",
    "message_2": "Under these conditions, the largest proposed amount that player 1 can offer to player 2 is $30. \n\nThis is because player 2's minimum acceptable offer is $30, and if player 1 offers anything less than that, player 2 will reject the proposal, resulting in neither player getting any money. Therefore, to ensure that player 2 accepts the proposal and both players receive some money, player 1 should offer $30 to player 2."
