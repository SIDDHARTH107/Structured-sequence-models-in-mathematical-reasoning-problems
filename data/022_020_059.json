    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nSubstituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this constant as $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nWe solve these ODEs with the given boundary conditions:\n\n1. $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$\n2. $Y(0) = 0$\n3. $Y(\\pi/4) = \\sin(3x)$\n\nFor the first ODE, we have the general solution:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$X(0) = B = 0$\n$X(\\pi) = A\\sin(\\lambda \\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\lambda \\pi = n\\pi$ for some integer n. Thus, $\\lambda = n$ and the solution for X(x) is:\n\n$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(nx)$\n\nFor the second ODE, we have the general solution:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y) + D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = C = 0$\n$Y(\\pi/4) = D\\sinh(n\\pi/4) = \\sin(3x)$\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$u_n(x, y) = X_n(x)Y_n(y) = A_n\\sin(nx)D_n\\sinh(ny)$\n\nWe need to find the coefficients $A_n$ and $D_n$ such that the boundary condition $u(x, \\pi/4) = \\sin(3x)$ is satisfied. To do this, we use Fourier series:\n\n$\\sin(3x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(nx)\\sinh(n\\pi/4)$\n\nWe can find the coefficients $A_n$ by multiplying both sides by $\\sin(mx)$ and integrating from 0 to $\\pi$:\n\n$\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(3x)\\sin(mx) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sinh(n\\pi/4)\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(nx)\\sin(mx) dx$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\n$A_n\\sinh(n\\pi/4) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(3x)\\sin(nx) dx$\n\nNow, we can find $A_n$:\n\n$A_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi\\sinh(n\\pi/4)}\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(3x)\\sin(nx) dx$\n\nFinally, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(nx)\\sinh(ny)$\n\nwhere\n\n$A_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi\\sinh(n\\pi/4)}\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(3x)\\sin(nx) dx$"
