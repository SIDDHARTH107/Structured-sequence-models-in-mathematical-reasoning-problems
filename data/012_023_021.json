    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of vertices in a complete subgraph (clique) of G, we can use the Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives an upper bound on the number of edges in a graph that does not contain a complete subgraph with a certain number of vertices.\n\nLet n be the number of vertices in the graph, and r be the number of vertices in the complete subgraph we want to avoid. According to Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a graph without a complete subgraph of size r is given by:\n\nedges <= (r-2)/(r-1) * (n^2)/2\n\nIn our case, we have n = 6 and edges = 8. We want to find the largest r such that the inequality holds.\n\nFor r = 3 (avoiding a triangle):\nedges <= (3-2)/(3-1) * (6^2)/2\n8 <= 1 * 18\n8 <= 18\n\nThe inequality holds, so we can have a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges without a triangle (r = 3). Now let's check for r = 4 (avoiding a complete subgraph with 4 vertices):\n\nedges <= (4-2)/(4-1) * (6^2)/2\n8 <= 2/3 * 18\n8 <= 12\n\nThe inequality does not hold, so we cannot have a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges without a complete subgraph with 4 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of vertices in a complete subgraph (clique) of G is 4."
