    "message_1": "In a message encrypted with a substitution cipher, the frequency analysis of the letters showed that the most frequent letter is \"E\", with a frequency of 12.5%. What is the second most frequent letter?",
    "message_2": "In the English language, the second most frequent letter is \"T\" with a frequency of approximately 9.1%. However, this is for unencrypted text. In an encrypted message using a substitution cipher, the second most frequent letter could be any other letter depending on the specific cipher used. To determine the second most frequent letter in the encrypted message, you would need to perform a frequency analysis on the encrypted text."
