    "message_1": "A merchant wants to choose two large prime numbers p and q for implementing an elliptic curve cryptography system. If he chooses p and q to be 107 and 137 respectively, then what is the number of points on the elliptic curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field, we need to know the curve equation and the field size. In this case, we are given two prime numbers p and q, but we don't have the curve equation. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the merchant wants to use these prime numbers to define the field size, we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. If the field size is defined by the product of p and q, then the field size is n = p * q = 107 * 137 = 14659.\n\n2. To find the number of points on the elliptic curve over the field of size n, we need to use Hasse's theorem, which states that the number of points N on the curve is bounded by the following inequality:\n\nn + 1 - 2√n ≤ N ≤ n + 1 + 2√n\n\n3. Calculate the bounds using Hasse's theorem:\n\n14659 + 1 - 2√14659 ≤ N ≤ 14659 + 1 + 2√14659\n\n14660 - 2(121) ≤ N ≤ 14660 + 2(121)\n\n14660 - 242 ≤ N ≤ 14660 + 242\n\n14418 ≤ N ≤ 14902\n\nSo, the number of points on the elliptic curve is between 14418 and 14902. However, without the curve equation, we cannot determine the exact number of points on the elliptic curve."
