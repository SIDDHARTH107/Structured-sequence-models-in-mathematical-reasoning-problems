    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph G, we can use the Handshaking Theorem. The Handshaking Theorem states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, there are 7 vertices, each with a degree of 3. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is:\n\n7 * 3 = 21\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Theorem, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\n21 = 2 * (number of edges)\n\nTo find the number of edges, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n(number of edges) = 21 / 2\n\n(number of edges) = 10.5\n\nHowever, the number of edges must be an integer, so it is not possible to have a graph with 7 vertices, each with a degree of 3. There must be an error in the problem statement or the graph is not simple (i.e., it contains loops or multiple edges between vertices)."
