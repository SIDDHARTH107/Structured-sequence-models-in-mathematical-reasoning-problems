    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 1 -2  4 | -6 |\n| 3  1 -2 |  7 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -6 |\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 3  1 -2 |  7 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -6 |\n| 0  7 -9 | 17 |\n| 0  7 -14| 25 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row and second column:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 / 7\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -6 |\n| 0  1 -9/7 | 17/7 |\n| 0  7 -14| 25 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 7 in the third row and second column:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 7 * Row 2\n\n| 1 -2  4 | -6 |\n| 0  1 -9/7 | 17/7 |\n| 0  0  1 |  4 |\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = 4\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny - (9/7)z = 17/7\ny - (9/7)(4) = 17/7\ny = 17/7 + 36/7\ny = 53/7\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx - 2y + 4z = -6\nx - 2(53/7) + 4(4) = -6\nx = -6 + 106/7 - 16\nx = -22/7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = -22/7, y = 53/7, z = 4"
