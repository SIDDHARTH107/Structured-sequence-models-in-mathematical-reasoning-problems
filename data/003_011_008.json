    "message_1": "An airplane is flying at a height of 5000 feet above the ground level. The pilot spots a building on the ground and measures the angle of depression to be 25 degrees. Find the distance between the airplane and the building, rounded to the nearest hundredth. (Hint: use tangent function)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the airplane and the building as x, and the horizontal distance between the airplane's vertical projection on the ground and the building as y. We can use the tangent function to solve this problem.\n\nThe angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line of sight from the airplane and the line connecting the airplane to the building. Since the angle of depression is 25 degrees, we can write the equation:\n\ntan(25°) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(25°) = (5000 feet) / y\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 5000 feet / tan(25°)\ny ≈ 5000 feet / 0.4663\ny ≈ 10719.16 feet\n\nNow that we have the horizontal distance y, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance x between the airplane and the building:\n\nx^2 = y^2 + (5000 feet)^2\nx^2 = (10719.16 feet)^2 + (5000 feet)^2\nx^2 ≈ 114,908,896.67 + 25,000,000\nx^2 ≈ 139,908,896.67\n\nNow, we can find x by taking the square root:\n\nx ≈ √139,908,896.67\nx ≈ 11828.99 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the airplane and the building is approximately 11,828.99 feet, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
