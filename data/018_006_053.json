    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set, and let A be a subset of U such that A is divisible by 3 and U has 50 elements. If the complement of A has 20 elements, prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the complement of A as A'. According to the problem, A' has 20 elements. Since A is a subset of U and A' is also a subset of U, we can say that A ∪ A' is a subset of U as well.\n\nNow, we know that the number of elements in the union of two sets A and B is given by the formula:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|\n\nIn our case, A and A' are disjoint sets, meaning they have no elements in common, i.e., |A ∩ A'| = 0. This is because A consists of elements divisible by 3, while A' consists of elements not divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of elements in the union of A and A' becomes:\n\n|A ∪ A'| = |A| + |A'| - 0\n|A ∪ A'| = |A| + |A'|\n\nWe are given that |A'| = 20. To find |A|, we know that U has 50 elements and A is a subset of U with elements divisible by 3. The elements divisible by 3 in U are {3, 6, 9, ..., 48}, which are 16 elements in total (since 48/3 = 16). So, |A| = 16.\n\nNow, we can find the number of elements in the union of A and A':\n\n|A ∪ A'| = |A| + |A'|\n|A ∪ A'| = 16 + 20\n|A ∪ A'| = 36\n\nSince A ∪ A' is a subset of U and has 36 elements, and U has 50 elements, we need to prove that the remaining 14 elements in U are also in A ∪ A'. \n\nThe remaining 14 elements in U are those that are not divisible by 3 and not in A'. These elements are divisible by either 2 or 5 or both (i.e., 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 25, 28, 32, 35, 40, 44). However, we can see that these elements are already included in A' since A' consists of elements not divisible by 3. Therefore, A ∪ A' includes all 50 elements of U.\n\nIn conclusion, since A ∪ A' includes all elements of U and is a subset of U, we can say that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to U."
