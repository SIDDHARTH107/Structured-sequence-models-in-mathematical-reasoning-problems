    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we first introduce the cost functional J(u) and the Hamiltonian H. The cost functional is given by:\n\nJ(u) = ∫[0, 10] u(t)^2 dt\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by:\n\nH(y, p, u) = p(t)(u(t) - y(t)) + u(t)^2\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. y'(t) = ∂H/∂p = u(t) - y(t)\n2. p'(t) = -∂H/∂y = p(t)\n3. u(t) = -∂H/∂u = p(t) - 2u(t)\n\nNow, we solve the differential equations for y(t) and p(t):\n\n1. y'(t) + y(t) = u(t)\n2. p'(t) - p(t) = 0\n\nwith initial conditions y(0) = 1 and p(10) = 0.\n\nSolving the second equation, we get:\n\np(t) = C1 * exp(t)\n\nwhere C1 is a constant. Since p(10) = 0, we have:\n\n0 = C1 * exp(10) => C1 = 0\n\nThus, p(t) = 0 for all t.\n\nNow, we can solve for u(t) using the third condition:\n\nu(t) = p(t) - 2u(t) => u(t) = 0\n\nSince u(t) = 0, the differential equation for y(t) becomes:\n\ny'(t) + y(t) = 0\n\nSolving this equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we get:\n\ny(t) = exp(-t)\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the condition y(10) = 2.5. This is because the constraint on the integral of u(t)^2 is not active, i.e., the optimal control does not need to use the full available control energy (1/4) to achieve the desired final condition.\n\nTo find the optimal control that satisfies the final condition, we can adjust the costate equation by introducing a Lagrange multiplier λ:\n\np'(t) - p(t) = λ\n\nSolving this equation with the boundary condition p(10) = 0, we get:\n\np(t) = λ(exp(t) - exp(10))\n\nNow, we can solve for u(t) using the third condition:\n\nu(t) = p(t) - 2u(t) => u(t) = λ(exp(t) - exp(10))/3\n\nSubstituting this expression for u(t) into the differential equation for y(t), we get:\n\ny'(t) + y(t) = λ(exp(t) - exp(10))/3\n\nSolving this equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we get:\n\ny(t) = exp(-t) + λ(exp(t) - exp(10))(exp(-t) - 1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the value of λ that satisfies the final condition y(10) = 2.5:\n\n2.5 = exp(-10) + λ(exp(10) - exp(10))(exp(-10) - 1/3)\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = (2.5 - exp(-10))/(exp(-10) - 1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the optimal control u(t):\n\nu(t) = λ(exp(t) - exp(10))/3\n\nThis is the optimal control that satisfies the given constraint and the final condition y(10) = 2.5."
