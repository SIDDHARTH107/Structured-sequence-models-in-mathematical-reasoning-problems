    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x + 2)/(2x - 1) as x approaches 2, we can simply substitute the value of x with 2 in the function:\n\nf(2) = (3(2) + 2)/(2(2) - 1)\nf(2) = (6 + 2)/(4 - 1)\nf(2) = 8/3\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (3x + 2)/(2x - 1) as x approaches 2 is 8/3."
