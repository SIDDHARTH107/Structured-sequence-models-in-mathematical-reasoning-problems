    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The 2nd order Hilbert curve is constructed by taking the 1st order curve and replacing each segment with a scaled-down copy of the entire curve.\n\nThe 1st order Hilbert curve consists of 4 segments, which form a 2x2 square. When constructing the 2nd order curve, each of these 4 segments is replaced by a scaled-down copy of the entire 1st order curve, which consists of 4 segments each. Therefore, the 2nd order Hilbert curve consists of 4 * 4 = 16 segments.\n\nHowever, if you are asking for the number of unit squares that the curve passes through, then the 2nd order Hilbert curve passes through a 4x4 grid of unit squares, which is a total of 4 * 4 = 16 unit squares."
