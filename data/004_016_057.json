    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that for a continuous and differentiable function on the interval [a, b], there exists at least one point c in the interval such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval.\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling from point A to point B in 2 hours at an average speed of 60 mph. We can represent the car's position as a function of time, s(t), where s is the position and t is the time.\n\nThe average speed of the car is given by the total distance traveled divided by the time taken. Since the car travels at an average speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, the total distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = Average Speed × Time\nDistance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be at least one point during the trip where the car's instantaneous speed (the derivative of the position function, s'(t)) is equal to the average speed.\n\nIn this case, the average speed is 60 mph. Therefore, according to the Mean Value Theorem, the car must have reached a maximum speed of at least 60 mph at some point during the trip."
