    "message_1": "Let A be a subset of a universal set U such that U contains 50 elements. If A has 20 elements, how many elements are in the complement of A? Using this information, prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "Let A be a subset of a universal set U such that U contains 50 elements, and A has 20 elements. The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since there are 50 elements in U and 20 elements in A, there must be 50 - 20 = 30 elements in A'.\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to U. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, the union of A and A' (denoted as A ∪ A') contains all elements that are in A or in A'.\n\nSince A contains 20 elements and A' contains 30 elements, and there are no overlapping elements between A and A' (by definition of a complement), the union of A and A' contains 20 + 30 = 50 elements.\n\nRecall that U also contains 50 elements. Since A ∪ A' contains all elements in A or A', and there are no elements outside of A and A' (as they are subsets of U), it follows that A ∪ A' must contain all elements in U. Therefore, the union of A and its complement A' is equal to U."
