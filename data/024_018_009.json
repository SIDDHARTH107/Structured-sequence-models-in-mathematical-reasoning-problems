    "message_1": "A student is asked to find the sectional curvature of a surface S defined by the equation: \n\nz = x^2 + y^2\n\nat the point P(1, 2, 5). \n\nWhat is the sectional curvature at this point for the plane spanned by the tangent vectors v = ∂/∂x + 2∂/∂y and w = ∂/∂y?",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface S.\n\nGiven the equation z = x^2 + y^2, we can find the gradient of z:\n\n∇z = (∂z/∂x, ∂z/∂y) = (2x, 2y)\n\nNow, we can find the unit normal vector N at point P(1, 2, 5):\n\nN = ∇z/||∇z|| = (2, 4, -1)/sqrt(21)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = |<v, v>  <v, w>|\n      |<w, v>  <w, w>|\n\nwhere <., .> denotes the dot product. We have:\n\n<v, v> = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5\n<v, w> = 1*0 + 2*1 = 2\n<w, v> = 2\n<w, w> = 0^2 + 1^2 = 1\n\nSo, the first fundamental form is:\n\nI = |5  2|\n      |2  1|\n\nNext, we need to compute the second fundamental form. We have:\n\nL = <∂^2z/∂x^2, N> = 2*(-1)/sqrt(21) = -2/sqrt(21)\nM = <∂^2z/∂x∂y, N> = 0\nN = <∂^2z/∂y^2, N> = 2*(-1)/sqrt(21) = -2/sqrt(21)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = | L  M |\n         | M  N |\n\nII = | -2/sqrt(21)  0          |\n         | 0                 -2/sqrt(21) |\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature K:\n\nK = (det(II))/(det(I)) = ((-2/sqrt(21))^2 - 0) / (5*1 - 2*2) = 4/21 / 1 = 4/21\n\nSo, the sectional curvature at point P(1, 2, 5) for the plane spanned by the tangent vectors v and w is K = 4/21."
