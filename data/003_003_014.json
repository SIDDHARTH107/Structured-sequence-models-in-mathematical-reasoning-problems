    "message_2": "At a 45-degree angle (π/4 radians) on the unit circle, the exact values of sine, cosine, and tangent are as follows:\n\n1. Sine (sin): sin(45°) = sin(π/4) = √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071\n2. Cosine (cos): cos(45°) = cos(π/4) = √2 / 2 ≈ 0.7071\n3. Tangent (tan): tan(45°) = tan(π/4) = sin(π/4) / cos(π/4) = (√2 / 2) / (√2 / 2) = 1\n\nSo, sin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2 / 2, and tan(45°) = 1."
