    "message_2": "The Rössler System is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are parameters. In this case, a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7.\n\nTo find the maximum value of the x-coordinate of the chaotic attractor, we need to numerically simulate the system and observe the behavior of the x-coordinate. This can be done using numerical integration methods like the Runge-Kutta method.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that chaotic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and the maximum x-coordinate value may vary depending on the initial conditions chosen. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an exact maximum value for the x-coordinate without specifying the initial conditions and the duration of the simulation.\n\nIn general, the maximum x-coordinate value of the chaotic attractor for the Rössler System with the given parameters can be found within a range, but an exact value cannot be provided without more information."
