    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of the given graph, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum number of edges in a graph with 12 vertices without any cycles (i.e., a tree). This can be done using the formula: E = V - 1, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. In this case, E = 12 - 1 = 11.\n\n2. Since the given graph has 30 edges, which is 19 more edges than a tree with 12 vertices, there must be at least one cycle in the graph.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possible girths of the graph. The smallest cycle in a graph is a triangle (3-cycle). If the graph has a girth of 3, then it must contain at least one triangle.\n\n4. The maximum number of edges in a graph with 12 vertices and no triangles (i.e., girth > 3) can be calculated using the TurÃ¡n's theorem. For a graph with n vertices and girth > 3, the maximum number of edges is given by the formula: E = (n^2)/4. In this case, E = (12^2)/4 = 36.\n\n5. Since the given graph has 30 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a graph with 12 vertices and girth > 3, the girth of the graph must be 3. Therefore, the girth of the given graph is 3."
