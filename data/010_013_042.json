    "message_1": "Consider a vector bundle $E$ over a compact topological space $X$ such that $E$ is of rank $r$. If the Euler characteristic of $E$ is given by $\\chi(E)=2$, and the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(E)$ is non-zero, what is the value of the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(E)$?",
    "message_2": "To determine the value of the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(E)$, we need to consider the properties of the vector bundle $E$ and the topological space $X$. Since $E$ is a rank $r$ vector bundle, we know that the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_i(E)$ are elements of the cohomology groups $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, r$.\n\nGiven that the Euler characteristic $\\chi(E) = 2$, we can infer that the Euler characteristic of the base space $X$ is also 2. This is because the Euler characteristic of a vector bundle is the product of the Euler characteristics of the base space and the fiber. In this case, the fiber is a real vector space of dimension $r$, so its Euler characteristic is 1. Thus, $\\chi(E) = \\chi(X) \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(E)$. Since it is non-zero, this implies that the vector bundle $E$ is non-orientable. In particular, this means that there exists a loop in $X$ such that the orientation of the fibers is reversed when going around the loop.\n\nTo determine the value of the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(E)$, we need to consider the possible values of $r$. If $r$ is odd, then $w_2(E)$ must be zero, as the Stiefel-Whitney classes of odd rank vector bundles are trivial in dimensions greater than or equal to the rank. If $r$ is even, then $w_2(E)$ can be non-zero, but its value depends on the specific structure of the vector bundle and the base space.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the vector bundle $E$ and the topological space $X$, we cannot determine the exact value of the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(E)$. However, we can conclude that if the rank $r$ is odd, then $w_2(E) = 0$. If $r$ is even, then $w_2(E)$ can be non-zero, but its value depends on the specific structure of the vector bundle and the base space."
