    "message_1": "A student flips a coin 50 times and gets 32 heads. What is the probability of getting heads in a single flip of the same coin?",
    "message_2": "The probability of getting heads in a single flip of a fair coin is 1/2 or 50%. However, based on the student's results of flipping the coin 50 times and getting 32 heads, we can estimate the probability of getting heads for this specific coin as follows:\n\nProbability of getting heads = (Number of heads) / (Total number of flips)\nProbability of getting heads = 32 / 50\nProbability of getting heads = 0.64 or 64%\n\nSo, based on the student's results, the estimated probability of getting heads in a single flip of the same coin is 64%. Keep in mind that this is an empirical probability based on a limited number of flips, and it may not accurately represent the true probability of the coin."
