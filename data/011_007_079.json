    "message_2": "To find the number of different starting lineups, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFor the center position, the coach has 3 choices, so there are C(3,1) ways to choose a center:\nC(3,1) = 3! / (1!(3-1)!) = 3! / (1!2!) = 6 / (1*2) = 3 ways\n\nFor the forward positions, the coach has 4 choices and needs to choose 2, so there are C(4,2) ways to choose the forwards:\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = 24 / (2*2) = 6 ways\n\nFor the guard positions, the coach has 4 choices and needs to choose 2, so there are C(4,2) ways to choose the guards:\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = 24 / (2*2) = 6 ways\n\nTo find the total number of different starting lineups, we multiply the number of ways to choose each position:\n3 (centers) * 6 (forwards) * 6 (guards) = 108 different starting lineups."
