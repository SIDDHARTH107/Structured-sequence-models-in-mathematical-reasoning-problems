    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges. Find out whether the graph has a perfect matching or not. If it has a perfect matching, give one possible matching.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices of the graph such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, every vertex is paired with another vertex through an edge, and no vertex is left unpaired.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices. Since the given graph has 7 vertices, which is an odd number, it cannot have a perfect matching."
