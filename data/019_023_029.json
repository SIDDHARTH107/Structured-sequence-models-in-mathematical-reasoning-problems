    "message_2": "To find the first 4 terms of this sequence, we will use the given recursive formula:\n\na1 = 2 (given)\n\na2 = 3a1 + 4 = 3(2) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n\na3 = 3a2 + 4 = 3(10) + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34\n\na4 = 3a3 + 4 = 3(34) + 4 = 102 + 4 = 106\n\nSo, the first 4 terms of this sequence are 2, 10, 34, and 106."
