    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest clique in the graph. In the given graph, we can see that there is a clique of size 3, which includes vertices 1, 3, and 4. Every vertex in this set is directly connected to every other vertex in the set. There is no clique of size 4 in the graph, as vertex 2 is not connected to vertex 3.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of the given graph is 3."
