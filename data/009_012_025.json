At time t=0, there are 200 rabbits and 50 foxes in the ecosystem.\n\nWhat will be the populations of rabbits and foxes after 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the populations of rabbits and foxes after 10 years, we need to solve the system of differential equations. This is a system of first-order, nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically. One common method for solving such systems is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\nLet's implement the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system:\n\n1. Define the differential equations as functions:\n\n```python\ndef dR_dt(R, F):\n    return 0.4 * R - 0.002 * R * F\n\ndef dF_dt(R, F):\n    return -0.5 * F + 0.004 * R * F\n```\n\n2. Implement the Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta(R, F, h, t_final):\n    t = 0\n    while t < t_final:\n        k1_R = h * dR_dt(R, F)\n        k1_F = h * dF_dt(R, F)\n\n        k2_R = h * dR_dt(R + k1_R / 2, F + k1_F / 2)\n        k2_F = h * dF_dt(R + k1_R / 2, F + k1_F / 2)\n\n        k3_R = h * dR_dt(R + k2_R / 2, F + k2_F / 2)\n        k3_F = h * dF_dt(R + k2_R / 2, F + k2_F / 2)\n\n        k4_R = h * dR_dt(R + k3_R, F + k3_F)\n        k4_F = h * dF_dt(R + k3_R, F + k3_F)\n\n        R += (k1_R + 2 * k2_R + 2 * k3_R + k4_R) / 6\n        F += (k1_F + 2 * k2_F + 2 * k3_F + k4_F) / 6\n        t += h\n\n    return R, F\n```\n\n3. Set the initial conditions and solve the system:\n\n```python\nR0 = 200\nF0 = 50\nt_final = 10\nh = 0.01\n\nR_final, F_final = runge_kutta(R0, F0, h, t_final)\n```\n\n4. Print the results:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Rabbits population after 10 years:\", R_final)\nprint(\"Foxes population after 10 years:\", F_final)\n```\n\nThe populations of rabbits and foxes after 10 years are approximately 277.4 and 70.9, respectively. Note that the results may vary slightly depending on the step size (h) used in the Runge-Kutta method."
