    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nFirst, we can check if the graph G satisfies Euler's formula for planar graphs: V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. In this case, V = 6 and E = 8. If the graph is planar, then F = E - V + 2 = 8 - 6 + 2 = 4.\n\nNow, let's check if the graph G contains any subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. We can see that the graph G does not have enough vertices to contain a subdivision of K5, as K5 has 5 vertices and G has only 6 vertices. \n\nNext, we check for a subdivision of K3,3. A K3,3 graph has two sets of 3 vertices, where each vertex in one set is connected to all vertices in the other set. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we can see that there is no such partition of the vertices in G. For example, if we try to partition the vertices into sets {1, 3, 4} and {2, 5, 6}, we can see that vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 6, which contradicts the requirement for K3,3.\n\nSince the graph G does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3, and it satisfies Euler's formula for planar graphs, we can conclude that the graph G is planar."
