    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 1| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 1 = 7\nSolving for x, we get:\n3x = 8\nx = 8/3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 1 = -7\nSolving for x, we get:\n3x = -6\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation |3x - 1| = 7 are x = 8/3 and x = -2."
