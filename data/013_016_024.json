The insurance would be provided by a third-party provider, and the premiums would be split evenly between the company and the employees. If an employee gets sick, they can either choose to stay home and not come to work, or they can come to work and receive a reduced salary for the day. The company believes that the chances of any given employee getting sick on a given day is 10%. The employee's income for the day is \\$100 if they come to work, and \\$75 if they stay home.\n\nAssuming risk-neutral employees, what is the maximum premium that the company can pay to the third-party insurance provider and still break even, given the above conditions?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the premium paid by the company as P. Since the premium is split evenly between the company and the employees, the total premium paid to the third-party insurance provider is 2P.\n\nWhen an employee gets sick, they have two options: stay home or come to work. If they stay home, they receive $75. If they come to work, they receive $100, but the company has to pay the medical expenses. Let's denote the medical expenses as M.\n\nThe company breaks even when the expected cost of medical expenses equals the expected savings from employees staying home when sick. The probability of an employee getting sick is 10%, so the expected cost of medical expenses is 0.1 * M. The expected savings from employees staying home when sick is 0.1 * ($100 - $75) = $2.50.\n\nTo find the maximum premium the company can pay and still break even, we need to equate the expected cost of medical expenses with the expected savings from employees staying home when sick:\n\n0.1 * M = 2.50\n\nSolving for M, we get:\n\nM = $25\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum premium the company can pay, given that the total premium paid to the third-party insurance provider is 2P:\n\n2P = M\n\n2P = $25\n\nP = $12.50\n\nSo, the maximum premium that the company can pay to the third-party insurance provider and still break even is $12.50."
