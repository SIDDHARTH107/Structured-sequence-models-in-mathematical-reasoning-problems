    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [sin(2x)]\n\nHere, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2.\n\nNow, apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = cos(2x) * 2\n\nf'(x) = 2cos(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = pi/4:\n\nf'(pi/4) = 2cos(2(pi/4))\n\nf'(pi/4) = 2cos(pi/2)\n\nSince cos(pi/2) = 0, the derivative at x = pi/4 is:\n\nf'(pi/4) = 2 * 0 = 0"
