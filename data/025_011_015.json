    "message_2": "To find the order of the quotient group $E/G$, we first need to find the order of the subgroup $G$. The subgroup $G$ is generated by the points $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Let's find the orders of these points individually.\n\nFor the point $(1,0)$, we have $y^2 = x^3 - x \\Rightarrow 0^2 = 1^3 - 1$. This point lies on the curve, so it is a valid point. Now, let's find its order. We need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n(1,0) = O$, where $O$ is the point at infinity (the identity element in the group of points on an elliptic curve). Since $(1,0)$ is a point of order 2 (i.e., $2(1,0) = O$), its order is 2.\n\nFor the point $(0,1)$, we have $y^2 = x^3 - x \\Rightarrow 1^2 = 0^3 - 0$. This point also lies on the curve. To find its order, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n(0,1) = O$. Since $(0,1)$ is a point of order 3 (i.e., $3(0,1) = O$), its order is 3.\n\nNow, we have the orders of the individual generators of the subgroup $G$. Since the orders of the generators are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(2,3) = 1), the order of the subgroup $G$ is the product of the orders of its generators, which is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nTo find the order of the quotient group $E/G$, we need to find the order of the group $E$ and then divide it by the order of the subgroup $G$. The order of the group $E$ can be found using the Hasse's theorem, which states that the order of an elliptic curve group is approximately equal to the number of points on the curve over a finite field. However, we don't have enough information about the field in this problem to determine the order of $E$.\n\nWithout more information about the field, we cannot determine the order of the quotient group $E/G$."
