    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) from x=0 to x=π/4, we will first find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nLet's use integration by substitution to find the antiderivative:\n\nLet u = sin(x), so du/dx = cos(x) and dx = du/cos(x).\n\nNow, substitute u and dx into the integral:\n\n∫sin(x)cos(x)dx = ∫u du/cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to express cos(x) in terms of u. Since u = sin(x), we can use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n\ncos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x) = 1 - u^2\ncos(x) = √(1 - u^2)\n\nNow substitute this into the integral:\n\n∫u du/√(1 - u^2)\n\nNow, we can integrate this function with respect to u:\n\n∫u du/√(1 - u^2) = (-1/2)√(1 - u^2) + C\n\nNow, substitute back sin(x) for u:\n\n(-1/2)√(1 - sin^2(x)) + C = (-1/2)√(cos^2(x)) + C = (-1/2)cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we have the antiderivative, so we can evaluate the definite integral from x=0 to x=π/4:\n\n[(-1/2)cos(x)](from 0 to π/4) = (-1/2)cos(π/4) - (-1/2)cos(0)\n\ncos(π/4) = √2/2, cos(0) = 1\n\n(-1/2)(√2/2) - (-1/2)(1) = -√2/4 + 1/2\n\nSo, the definite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) from x=0 to x=π/4 is -√2/4 + 1/2."
