    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 9. We will consider two cases: when the center of G is non-trivial and when it is trivial.\n\nCase 1: The center of G is non-trivial.\nLet Z(G) denote the center of G. Since G has order 9, we know that |G| = 9 = 3^2. By the class equation, we have |G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)], where the sum is taken over a set of representatives x of the distinct non-central conjugacy classes of G, and C(x) denotes the centralizer of x in G. Since |G| is a power of a prime, it follows that either |Z(G)| = 1 (trivial) or |Z(G)| = 9.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Z(G) is non-trivial, so |Z(G)| = 9. This means that Z(G) = G, and thus G is an abelian group. Since G has order 9, it must be isomorphic to either C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). However, C3 × C3 has four elements of order 3, while a cyclic group of order 9 has only two elements of order 3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nCase 2: The center of G is trivial.\nIn this case, |Z(G)| = 1. By the class equation, we have |G| = 1 + ∑[G:C(x)]. Since |G| = 9, the sum on the right must be a multiple of 3. The only possibility is that there is one non-central conjugacy class with size 3 and one with size 6. Let x be a representative of the conjugacy class of size 3. Then |C(x)| = |G|/3 = 3. Since x is not in the center, C(x) is a proper subgroup of G. Let H = C(x). Then H is a subgroup of G with order 3.\n\nNow, let y be an element of G not in H. Then the order of y must be either 1, 3, or 9. Since y is not in H, its order cannot be 1 or 3. Thus, the order of y is 9, and G is generated by y. This means that G is a cyclic group of order 9, which contradicts our assumption that the center of G is trivial.\n\nTherefore, there is no group G of order 9 with a trivial center. This means that any group of order 9 must have a non-trivial center and is thus isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
