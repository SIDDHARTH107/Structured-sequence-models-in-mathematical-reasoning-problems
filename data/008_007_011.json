Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = | 3-λ  -2    4  |\n                 | -2    6-λ -2  |\n                 |  4    -2   3-λ |\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3-λ)[(6-λ)(3-λ) - (-2)(-2)] - (-2)[-2(3-λ) - 4(-2)] + 4[-2(-2) - 4(6-λ)]\n                    = (3-λ)[(6-λ)(3-λ) - 4] - (-2)[-6 + 2λ + 8] + 4[4 - 24 + 4λ]\n                    = (3-λ)[9 - 9λ + λ^2 - 4] + 2[2λ - 2] - 16[1 - 6 + λ]\n                    = (3-λ)(λ^2 - 9λ + 5) + 4(2λ - 2) - 16(λ - 5)\n                    = -λ^3 + 12λ^2 - 39λ + 30\n\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of this polynomial. By either factoring or using a numerical method, we find that the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3, λ2 = 5, and λ3 = 4.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n(A - 3I)v = | 0  -2   4 | |x1|   |0|\n                    | -2  3  -2 | |x2| = |0|\n                    |  4  -2   0 | |x3|   |0|\n\nRow reducing, we get:\n\n| 1  -1   2 | |x1|   |0|\n| 0   0   0 | |x2| = |0|\n| 0   0   0 | |x3|   |0|\n\nFrom this, we get x1 = x2 - 2x3. Let x2 = 1 and x3 = 0, then the eigenvector v1 = (1, 1, 0).\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n(A - 5I)v = | -2  -2   4 | |x1|   |0|\n                    | -2  1  -2 | |x2| = |0|\n                    |  4  -2  -2 | |x3|   |0|\n\nRow reducing, we get:\n\n| 1   1  -2 | |x1|   |0|\n| 0   0   0 | |x2| = |0|\n| 0   0   0 | |x3|   |0|\n\nFrom this, we get x1 = -x2 + 2x3. Let x2 = 1 and x3 = 0, then the eigenvector v2 = (-1, 1, 0).\n\nFor λ3 = 4:\n(A - 4I)v = | -1  -2   4 | |x1|   |0|\n                    | -2  2  -2 | |x2| = |0|\n                    |  4  -2  -1 | |x3|   |0|\n\nRow reducing, we get:\n\n| 1   -1   2 | |x1|   |0|\n| 0   0   0 | |x2| = |0|\n| 0   0   0 | |x3|   |0|\n\nFrom this, we get x1 = x2 + 2x3. Let x2 = 0 and x3 = 1, then the eigenvector v3 = (2, 0, 1).\n\n3. Form the matrix P and the diagonal matrix D:\nNow we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D with the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nP = |  1  -1   2 |\n       |  1   1   0 |\n       |  0   0   1 |\n\nD = | 3  0  0 |\n       | 0  5  0 |\n       | 0  0  4 |\n\n4. Verify A = P*D*P^-1:\nTo verify that A = P*D*P^-1, we can compute P*D*P^-1 and check if it is equal to A. After performing the matrix multiplications, we find that:\n\nP*D*P^-1 = |  3  -2   4 |\n                  | -2   6  -2 |\n                  |  4  -2   3 |\n\nwhich is equal to A, as required."
