    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. After each iteration, the total length of the remaining line segments is multiplied by 2/3.\n\nLet L_n be the total length of the Cantor set after the nth iteration. Then, we have the following relationship:\n\nL_n = (2/3) * L_(n-1)\n\nSince the original line segment has a length of 1 meter, L_0 = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the total length of the Cantor set after the nth iteration using the formula:\n\nL_n = (2/3)^n * L_0\n\nL_n = (2/3)^n * 1\n\nL_n = (2/3)^n\n\nSo, the total length of the Cantor set after the nth iteration is (2/3)^n meters."
