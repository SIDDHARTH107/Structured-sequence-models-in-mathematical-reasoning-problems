    "message_2": "To simplify the square root of 48, we can break it down into its prime factors.\n\n48 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3\n\nNow, we can group the factors in pairs:\n\n(2 * 2) * (2 * 2) * 3\n\nEach pair represents a perfect square, so we can take the square root of each pair:\n\n2 * 2 * sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n4 * sqrt(3)"
