    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to solve the equation |2x + 4| = 8 for x. We can do this by considering two cases: when the expression inside the absolute value is positive and when it is negative.\n\nCase 1: 2x + 4 is positive or zero\n2x + 4 = 8\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 2x + 4 is negative\n-(2x + 4) = 8\n-2x - 4 = 8\n-2x = 12\nx = -6\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 2 and x = -6."
