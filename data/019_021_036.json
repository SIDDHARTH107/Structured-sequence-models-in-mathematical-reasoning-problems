If they choose option 1, they have a 50% chance of earning a profit of $100,000 and a 50% chance of earning no profit. If they choose option 2, they have a 60% chance of earning a profit of $80,000 and a 40% chance of earning no profit. If they choose option 3, they have a 70% chance of earning a profit of $60,000 and a 30% chance of earning no profit. Which option should the company choose based on the highest expected value?",
    "message_2": "To determine the highest expected value, we need to calculate the expected value for each option. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then summing the results.\n\nOption 1:\nExpected value = (0.5 * $100,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $50,000 + $0 = $50,000\n\nOption 2:\nExpected value = (0.6 * $80,000) + (0.4 * $0) = $48,000 + $0 = $48,000\n\nOption 3:\nExpected value = (0.7 * $60,000) + (0.3 * $0) = $42,000 + $0 = $42,000\n\nBased on the highest expected value, the company should choose Option 1, as it has the highest expected value of $50,000."
