    "message_1": "Suppose you have $100,000 to invest in a portfolio consisting of two stocks, Stock A and Stock B. Stock A has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 15%, and Stock B has an expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 10%. The correlation between the two stocks is 0.5. Determine the optimal allocation to Stock A and Stock B that will minimize the portfolio's standard deviation while achieving a target expected return of 9%.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation between Stock A and Stock B, we will use the concept of portfolio theory. We will first calculate the weights of each stock in the portfolio that will achieve the target expected return of 9%. Then, we will calculate the portfolio's standard deviation and minimize it.\n\nLet wA be the weight of Stock A in the portfolio and wB be the weight of Stock B. Since there are only two stocks in the portfolio, wA + wB = 1.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = wA * E(RA) + wB * E(RB)\n\nwhere E(RA) is the expected return of Stock A (10%) and E(RB) is the expected return of Stock B (8%).\n\nWe want to achieve a target expected return of 9%, so:\n\n0.09 = wA * 0.10 + wB * 0.08\n\nNow, we need to find the portfolio's standard deviation (σp) and minimize it. The formula for the standard deviation of a two-stock portfolio is:\n\nσp = √[wA^2 * σA^2 + wB^2 * σB^2 + 2 * wA * wB * ρAB * σA * σB]\n\nwhere σA is the standard deviation of Stock A (15%), σB is the standard deviation of Stock B (10%), and ρAB is the correlation between the two stocks (0.5).\n\nWe can substitute wB = 1 - wA in the formula for Rp and solve for wA:\n\n0.09 = wA * 0.10 + (1 - wA) * 0.08\n0.09 = 0.10wA + 0.08 - 0.08wA\n0.01 = 0.02wA\nwA = 0.5\n\nNow, we can find wB:\n\nwB = 1 - wA = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, the optimal allocation is 50% in Stock A and 50% in Stock B. Now, let's calculate the portfolio's standard deviation:\n\nσp = √[0.5^2 * 0.15^2 + 0.5^2 * 0.10^2 + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.15 * 0.10]\nσp = √[0.25 * 0.0225 + 0.25 * 0.01 + 0.25 * 0.0075]\nσp = √[0.005625 + 0.0025 + 0.001875]\nσp = √0.01\n\nThe portfolio's standard deviation is 10%.\n\nThe optimal allocation to minimize the portfolio's standard deviation while achieving a target expected return of 9% is 50% in Stock A and 50% in Stock B."
