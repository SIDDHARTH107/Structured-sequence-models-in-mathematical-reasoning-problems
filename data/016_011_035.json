    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, which means it is made up of smaller copies of itself. It is formed by dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the middle square and the four corner squares, leaving only the four squares in the middle of each side. This process is repeated for each of the remaining squares, and so on.\n\nTo calculate the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal, we need to consider the number of iterations and the side length of the initial square. In this case, the side length is given as 100 units, but the number of iterations is not specified. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal increases with each iteration, so without knowing the number of iterations, we cannot provide an exact value for the perimeter.\n\nHowever, we can provide a general formula for the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal after n iterations:\n\nPerimeter = Initial side length * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 100 units. To find the perimeter after a specific number of iterations, simply plug in the value of n into the formula."
