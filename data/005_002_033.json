A sample of 50 cans was taken from a production line and their average volume was found to be 352 milliliters. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average volume of the cans.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average volume of the cans, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean (352 milliliters)\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\nσ = population standard deviation (5 milliliters)\nn = sample size (50 cans)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard Error = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNext, we will calculate the margin of error (Z * Standard Error):\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 352 ± 1.3859\n\nLower Limit = 352 - 1.3859 ≈ 350.6141 milliliters\nUpper Limit = 352 + 1.3859 ≈ 353.3859 milliliters\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average volume of the cans is approximately (350.6141, 353.3859) milliliters."
