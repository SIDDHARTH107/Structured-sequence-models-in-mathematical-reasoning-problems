    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we will use the fact that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 12, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will now find the subgroups corresponding to each of these orders.\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element, has order 1.\n\n2. Subgroups of order 2: These subgroups are generated by elements of order 2. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/2) has order 2, where n is the order of the group. So, the subgroup generated by g^6 has order 2: {e, g^6}.\n\n3. Subgroups of order 3: These subgroups are generated by elements of order 3. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/3) has order 3. So, the subgroup generated by g^4 has order 3: {e, g^4, g^8}.\n\n4. Subgroups of order 4: These subgroups are generated by elements of order 4. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/4) has order 4. So, the subgroup generated by g^3 has order 4: {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}.\n\n5. Subgroups of order 6: These subgroups are generated by elements of order 6. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/6) has order 6. So, the subgroup generated by g^2 has order 6: {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}.\n\n6. The whole group G itself has order 12 and is generated by g: {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9, g^10, g^11}.\n\nNow, we will prove that each of these subgroups is cyclic. A subgroup H of a group G is cyclic if there exists an element h in H such that every element of H can be written as a power of h.\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {e} is cyclic, as it is generated by the identity element e.\n\n2. The subgroup {e, g^6} is cyclic, as it is generated by g^6.\n\n3. The subgroup {e, g^4, g^8} is cyclic, as it is generated by g^4.\n\n4. The subgroup {e, g^3, g^6, g^9} is cyclic, as it is generated by g^3.\n\n5. The subgroup {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10} is cyclic, as it is generated by g^2.\n\n6. The whole group G is cyclic, as it is generated by g.\n\nThus, all the subgroups of G are cyclic."
