    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nUsing the Sylow theorems, we can determine the following:\n\n- There must be a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9.\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 9 (the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. This means there can be 1 or 3 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 8 (the index of the Sylow 3-subgroup) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. This means there can be 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If there is 1 Sylow 2-subgroup and 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, the group is a direct product of the two subgroups, and there are 2 possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup (Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_4) and 1 possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup (Z_9). This gives us 2 possibilities in this case.\n\n2. If there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, the group is a semi-direct product of the two subgroups. There are 2 possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup (Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_4) and 1 possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup (Z_9). There are also 2 possible actions of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup in each case, giving us a total of 4 possibilities in this case.\n\n3. If there is 1 Sylow 2-subgroup and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, the group is a semi-direct product of the two subgroups. There are 2 possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup (Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_4) and 1 possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup (Z_9). There is only 1 possible action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup in each case, giving us a total of 2 possibilities in this case.\n\nAdding up the possibilities from each case, we find that there are 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
