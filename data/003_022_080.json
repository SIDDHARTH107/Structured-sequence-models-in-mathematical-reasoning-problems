    "message_2": "The dot product of two vectors A and B can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors and θ is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, the magnitudes of the forces are 10 N and 20 N, and the angle between them is 60 degrees. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDot product = 10 * 20 * cos(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 1/2, the dot product is:\n\nDot product = 10 * 20 * (1/2) = 100 N²"
