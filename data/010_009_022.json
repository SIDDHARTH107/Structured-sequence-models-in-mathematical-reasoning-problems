    "message_2": "First, we need to find the area of the given triangle. Since it is a right-angled triangle (5-12-13 Pythagorean triple), we can use the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 12\nArea = 30 square units\n\nNow, we want to divide this triangle into four smaller triangles of equal areas. Each of these smaller triangles will have an area of 30/4 = 7.5 square units.\n\nTo minimize the altitude of the triangle, we should try to maximize the base of the smaller triangles. Let's consider dividing the triangle into four smaller triangles by drawing lines from the vertices to the midpoint of the opposite sides.\n\n1. Draw a line from the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse (13/2).\n2. Draw a line from the vertex opposite the side of length 5 to the midpoint of the side of length 5 (5/2).\n3. Draw a line from the vertex opposite the side of length 12 to the midpoint of the side of length 12 (6).\n\nNow, we have four smaller triangles. Let's consider the triangle formed by the right angle vertex and the midpoints of the sides of length 5 and 12. This triangle has a base of 6 (half of the side of length 12) and an area of 7.5 square units.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n7.5 = (1/2) * 6 * height\nheight = 7.5 / 3\nheight = 2.5 units\n\nTherefore, the shortest possible altitude of the triangle is 2.5 units."
