In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of the sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of the sets A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of the sets A and B is {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nThe union and intersection of sets are commutative, so:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets B and A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of the sets B and A is {1, 4}.\n\nSince A Δ B = {1, 4} and B Δ A = {1, 4}, the symmetric difference is commutative."
