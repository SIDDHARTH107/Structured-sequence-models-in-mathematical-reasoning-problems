    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H(p_x, p_y, x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)$\n\nwhere $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + ax^2y - \\frac{b}{3}y^3$ is the potential energy, and $a$ and $b$ are parameters.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions and is used to characterize the chaotic behavior of the system. To compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon-Heiles system with parameters $a=1$ and $b=1.4$, one would need to numerically integrate the equations of motion and calculate the Lyapunov exponent using an algorithm such as the one proposed by Benettin et al. (1980).\n\nThis task requires advanced numerical methods and specialized software, which is beyond the scope of this platform. However, you can find various resources and tools online to help you perform these calculations, such as the Python package \"chaospy\" or the software \"Maxima.\""
