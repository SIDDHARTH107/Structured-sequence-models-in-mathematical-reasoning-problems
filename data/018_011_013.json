    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which is represented by A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, A ∩ B = {5}, since 5 is the only element that appears in both sets.\n\nNext, we need to find the Cartesian product of the intersection (A ∩ B) and set C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nIn this case, the Cartesian product (A ∩ B) x C is the set of all ordered pairs (a, c) where a is an element of {5} and c is an element of {0,1}.\n\nSo, (A ∩ B) x C = {(5,0), (5,1)}"
