    "message_2": "To find the production level that maximizes the profit, we first need to find the profit function P(x). The profit function is the difference between the revenue function R(x) and the cost function C(x).\n\nThe revenue function R(x) is the selling price per unit times the number of units produced, which is given by R(x) = 1200x.\n\nNow, we can find the profit function P(x) by subtracting the cost function C(x) from the revenue function R(x):\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 1200x - (8000 + 4x + 0.2x^2)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 1200x - 8000 - 4x - 0.2x^2\nP(x) = -0.2x^2 + 1196x - 8000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -0.4x + 1196\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-0.4x + 1196 = 0\n-0.4x = -1196\nx = 2990\n\nSince the coefficient of the x^2 term in the profit function is negative (-0.2), this critical point corresponds to a maximum. Therefore, the production level that maximizes the profit is 2990 units per day."
