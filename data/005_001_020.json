    "message_1": "A juice company claims that its orange juice contains at least 50% real fruit juice. To test this claim, a researcher takes a random sample of 40 bottles and measures the percentage of fruit juice in each bottle. The mean percentage of fruit juice in the sample is found to be 48%, with a standard deviation of 4%. \n\nAssuming that the percentage of fruit juice in the sample follows a normal distribution, can we reject the company's claim at the 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean percentage of fruit juice is at least 50% (μ ≥ 50%), and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean percentage of fruit juice is less than 50% (μ < 50%).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (48 - 50) / (4 / sqrt(40))\n\nt = -2 / (4 / 6.3246)\n\nt = -2 / 0.6325\n\nt = -3.1623\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test at the 5% significance level with 39 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.685.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.1623) is less than the critical t-value (-1.685), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is evidence to suggest that the true mean percentage of fruit juice is less than 50%, and we can reject the company's claim at the 5% significance level."
