If H^i(X, L^j) = 0 for all i and j such that i + j = 2n, show that L is ample.",
    "message_2": "To show that L is ample, we need to show that for any coherent sheaf F on X, there exists a positive integer m such that H^i(X, F ⊗ L^m) = 0 for all i > 0.\n\nWe will use Serre's vanishing theorem, which states that for a coherent sheaf F on a projective variety X and an ample line bundle L, there exists a positive integer m such that H^i(X, F ⊗ L^m) = 0 for all i > 0.\n\nLet F be a coherent sheaf on X. Since L is a line bundle on X with H^i(X, L) ≠ 0 for some i, by Serre's vanishing theorem, there exists a positive integer m_1 such that H^i(X, F ⊗ L^m_1) = 0 for all i > 0.\n\nNow, consider the sheaf F ⊗ L^m_1. We know that H^i(X, L^j) = 0 for all i and j such that i + j = 2n. Therefore, H^i(X, (F ⊗ L^m_1) ⊗ L^j) = 0 for all i and j such that i + j = 2n.\n\nLet m = m_1 + j. Then, H^i(X, F ⊗ L^m) = 0 for all i > 0 and all m ≥ m_1. This shows that L is ample, as required."
