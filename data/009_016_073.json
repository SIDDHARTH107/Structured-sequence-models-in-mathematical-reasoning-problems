    "message_1": "A conducting sphere of radius 10 cm has a charge of 5 microcoulombs uniformly distributed over its surface. Find the potential at a distance of 20 cm from the center of the sphere, assuming the region outside the sphere is at zero potential. Use Laplace's equation for electrostatics.",
    "message_2": "To find the potential at a distance of 20 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the formula for the electric potential due to a point charge:\n\nV = kQ/r\n\nwhere V is the electric potential, k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge of the sphere, and r is the distance from the center of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the charge Q = 5 microcoulombs = 5 × 10^-6 C and the distance r = 20 cm = 0.2 m, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2) × (5 × 10^-6 C) / (0.2 m)\n\nV = 224.75 × 10^3 V\n\nThe potential at a distance of 20 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 224.75 kV."
