    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = 0, we can try to factor it.\n\nThe given polynomial is a cubic polynomial, and we can attempt to factor it using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root, then it must be of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor the given polynomial, the constant term is 6 and the leading coefficient is 1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are the factors of 6: ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial:\n\n1. f(1) = 1^3 + 6(1)^2 + 11(1) + 6 = 1 + 6 + 11 + 6 = 24 ≠ 0\n2. f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) + 6 = -1 + 6 - 11 + 6 = 0\n\nSince f(-1) = 0, x = -1 is a root of the polynomial. Now we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n          x^2 + 5x + 6\n    ______________________\nx - 1 | x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6\n          - (x^3 - x^2)\n    ______________________\n                7x^2 + 11x + 6\n                - (7x^2 - 7x)\n    ______________________\n                          4x + 6\n                          - (4x - 4)\n    ______________________\n                                10\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the polynomial can be factored as (x + 1)(x^2 + 5x + 6).\n\nNow we can factor the quadratic part further:\n\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\n\nSo the fully factored polynomial is:\n\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)\n\nThe solutions to the equation x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = 0 are:\n\nx = -1, x = -2, and x = -3."
