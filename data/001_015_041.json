    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a form that allows us to isolate x. \n\nGiven the equation: 2^(x+1) = 16\n\nFirst, we can rewrite 16 as a power of 2: 16 = 2^4\n\nNow, we have: 2^(x+1) = 2^4\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 4\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 4 - 1\nx = 3\n\nSo, x = 3."
