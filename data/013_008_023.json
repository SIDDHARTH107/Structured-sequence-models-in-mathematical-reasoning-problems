    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem based on Public Goods Game:\n\nIn a public goods game, there are 10 players who each have 10 tokens to begin with. Every round, each player can choose to either keep their tokens or contribute them to a public pot. The tokens in the public pot are then multiplied by a factor of 2 and divided equally among all players, regardless of whether they contributed or not. For example, if every player contributes 5 tokens, then the public pot will have 50 tokens, which will be multiplied by 2 to make 100 tokens. These 100 tokens will then be divided equally among all 10 players, giving each player 10 tokens.\n\nAssuming that all players act rationally and selfishly, how many tokens should each player contribute to maximize their individual payoff over multiple rounds?",
    "message_2": "In a Public Goods Game, rational and selfish players will try to maximize their individual payoff by free-riding, i.e., not contributing any tokens to the public pot while benefiting from the contributions of others. This is because contributing to the public pot will not provide them with a higher return than keeping their tokens.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\nIf a player contributes 1 token to the public pot, the pot will have 1 token. After multiplying by 2, it becomes 2 tokens. When divided among the 10 players, each player receives 0.2 tokens. The player who contributed 1 token now has 9 tokens (10 - 1) plus the 0.2 tokens received from the public pot, resulting in a total of 9.2 tokens. This is less than the initial 10 tokens they started with.\n\nIf all players contribute 1 token each, the public pot will have 10 tokens. After multiplying by 2, it becomes 20 tokens. When divided among the 10 players, each player receives 2 tokens. The player who contributed 1 token now has 9 tokens (10 - 1) plus the 2 tokens received from the public pot, resulting in a total of 11 tokens. However, a selfish player who contributes 0 tokens will have 10 tokens plus the 2 tokens received from the public pot, resulting in a total of 12 tokens. This means that contributing 1 token is not the best strategy for a rational, selfish player.\n\nIn conclusion, rational and selfish players should contribute 0 tokens to maximize their individual payoff over multiple rounds. This is because contributing any tokens will not provide them with a higher return than keeping their tokens, and they can still benefit from the contributions of others. However, this strategy leads to a suboptimal outcome for the group as a whole, as the total payoff for all players would be higher if everyone contributed to the public pot. This is known as the \"free-rider problem\" in the context of public goods."
