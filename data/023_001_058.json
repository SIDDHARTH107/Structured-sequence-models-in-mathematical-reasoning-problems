    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given periodic function f(x) = 1 for 0 <= x < 2π, we will use the definition of Fourier coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier series of a periodic function f(x) with period 2π is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients for the given function f(x) = 1.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[1]dx from 0 to 2π\na_0 = (1/π) * [x] from 0 to 2π\na_0 = (1/π) * (2π - 0)\na_0 = 2\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[1 * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * [sin(nx)/n] from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * (sin(2πn)/n - sin(0)/n)\na_n = 0 (since sin(2πn) = sin(0) = 0)\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[1 * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(nx)/n] from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1/π) * (-cos(2πn)/n + cos(0)/n)\nb_n = (1/π) * (1/n) (since cos(2πn) = cos(0) = 1)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series of f(x) using the coefficients:\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[0 * cos(nx) + (1/πn) * sin(nx)]\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = 1 for 0 <= x < 2π is:\n\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[(1/πn) * sin(nx)]"
