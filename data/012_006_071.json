Also determine whether the graph G contains a Hamiltonian path or not. If yes, list the vertices in order of the path.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G contains an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has at most two vertices with odd degrees. In this case, we have:\n\nOdd degree vertices: vertex 2, vertex 3, vertex 5, vertex 9, and vertex 10 (5 odd degree vertices)\n\nSince there are more than two vertices with odd degrees, the graph G does not contain an Eulerian path.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the graph G contains a Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. Unfortunately, there is no general algorithm to determine whether a graph has a Hamiltonian path or not, as it is an NP-complete problem. However, we can try to find a Hamiltonian path manually.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian path is:\nvertex 4 -> vertex 1 -> vertex 6 -> vertex 8 -> vertex 5 -> vertex 2 -> vertex 3 -> vertex 9 -> vertex 10 -> vertex 7\n\nSo, the graph G contains a Hamiltonian path. The path is: 4-1-6-8-5-2-3-9-10-7."
