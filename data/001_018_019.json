    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log(base 3) 27 - log(base 3) 9, we can use the logarithmic property:\n\nlog(base b) a - log(base b) c = log(base b) (a/c)\n\nApplying this property, we get:\n\nlog(base 3) 27 - log(base 3) 9 = log(base 3) (27/9)\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\n27/9 = 3\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\nlog(base 3) 3\n\nSince 3 is the base of the logarithm and 3^1 = 3, the expression simplifies to:\n\n1\n\nTherefore, log(base 3) 27 - log(base 3) 9 = 1."
