    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to compute the first, second, and third derivatives of the given vector function r(t).\n\nr(t) = < 2t, 4 - t^2, 3t^2 >\nr'(t) = < 2, -2t, 6t >\nr''(t) = < 0, -2, 6 >\nr'''(t) = < 0, 0, 0 >\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at t = 1:\n\nr'(1) = < 2, -2, 6 >\nr''(1) = < 0, -2, 6 >\nr'''(1) = < 0, 0, 0 >\n\nNext, we need to find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) using the following formulas:\n\nCurvature (k) = || r'(t) x r''(t) || / || r'(t) ||^3\nTorsion (τ) = (r'(t) • (r''(t) x r'''(t))) / || r'(t) x r''(t) ||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(1) x r''(1) = < 2, -2, 6 > x < 0, -2, 6 > = < -24, -12, -4 >\n\nNow, let's find the magnitudes:\n\n|| r'(1) || = sqrt(2^2 + (-2)^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(44)\n|| r'(1) x r''(1) || = sqrt((-24)^2 + (-12)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(736)\n\nNow we can find the curvature (k):\n\nk = || r'(1) x r''(1) || / || r'(1) ||^3 = sqrt(736) / (sqrt(44))^3 = sqrt(736) / 44^(3/2) ≈ 0.171\n\nSince r'''(1) = < 0, 0, 0 >, the torsion (τ) is 0 because the numerator of the torsion formula will be 0.\n\nτ = 0\n\nSo, the curvature of the curve at t = 1 is approximately 0.171, and the torsion is 0."
