    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using finite element methods, we will first discretize the domain and then approximate the solution using basis functions. We will use a simple rectangular mesh for discretization and linear basis functions for approximation.\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Divide the rectangular domain into a grid of equally spaced points. Let's choose a grid with 5 points along the x-axis and 4 points along the y-axis. The grid spacing will be Δx = 1 and Δy = 1.\n\n2. Approximate the solution: We will use linear basis functions to approximate the solution. For each element in the grid, we will use the four corner nodes to define the basis functions.\n\n3. Assemble the system of equations: For each element, we will compute the element stiffness matrix and load vector, and then assemble them into the global stiffness matrix and load vector.\n\n4. Apply boundary conditions: We will apply the given boundary conditions to the global stiffness matrix and load vector.\n\n5. Solve the system of equations: We will solve the resulting linear system of equations to obtain the nodal values of the approximate solution.\n\n6. Evaluate the solution at the point (2,1): To find the numerical solution at the point (2,1), we will use the nodal values and the basis functions to interpolate the solution.\n\nAfter following these steps, we will obtain the numerical solution u(x,y) at the point (2,1). However, due to the complexity of the finite element method and the need for specialized software to perform the calculations, it is not possible to provide an exact numerical value for u(2,1) in this response. To obtain the numerical value, you can use finite element software such as FEniCS, COMSOL, or ANSYS, or write your own code using a programming language like Python or MATLAB."
