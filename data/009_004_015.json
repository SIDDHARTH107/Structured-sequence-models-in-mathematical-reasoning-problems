If the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position by 0.2 meters and released, find the equation of motion and the time period of oscillation. Assume that there is no damping present in the system.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position (F = -kx), where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n\nCombining these two laws, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nSince acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for mass (m = 0.5 kg) and spring constant (k = 10 N/m):\n\n0.5(d^2x/dt^2) = -10x\n\nDividing both sides by 0.5, we get:\n\n(d^2x/dt^2) = -20x\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. To find the angular frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the given values for k and m:\n\nω = sqrt(10/0.5) = sqrt(20)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions. At t = 0, the mass is displaced by 0.2 meters and released, so x(0) = 0.2 and dx/dt(0) = 0. Plugging these values into the general solution:\n\n0.2 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\n0 = -A*sqrt(20)*sin(0) + B*sqrt(20)*cos(0)\n\nFrom the first equation, we get A = 0.2 since cos(0) = 1 and sin(0) = 0. From the second equation, we get B = 0 since sin(0) = 0 and cos(0) = 1. Therefore, the equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.2*cos(sqrt(20)*t)\n\nTo find the time period of oscillation, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value for ω:\n\nT = 2π/sqrt(20)\n\nSo, the time period of oscillation is T = 2π/sqrt(20) seconds."
