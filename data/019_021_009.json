    "message_2": "Since Player A moves first, Player B will observe Player A's move and then make their decision. We need to determine what Player B would do in response to each of Player A's moves and then decide which move is best for Player A based on that.\n\nIf Player A chooses U:\n- Player B will choose L, as they get a payoff of 2 instead of 1 if they choose R.\n\nIf Player A chooses D:\n- Player B will choose R, as they get a payoff of 3 instead of 0 if they choose L.\n\nNow, let's compare the payoffs for Player A based on these responses:\n\nIf Player A chooses U, their payoff will be 3 (since Player B will choose L).\nIf Player A chooses D, their payoff will be 2 (since Player B will choose R).\n\nSince 3 > 2, Player A should choose U to get the highest payoff."
