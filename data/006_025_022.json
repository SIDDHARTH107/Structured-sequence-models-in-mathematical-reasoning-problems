    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of hitting the move exactly k times\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 20 times)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, 17 times)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.75)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.25)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 17) = C(20, 17) * (0.75)^17 * (0.25)^3\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(20, 17), which is the number of combinations of 20 items taken 17 at a time:\n\nC(20, 17) = 20! / (17! * (20-17)!)\nC(20, 17) = 20! / (17! * 3!)\n\nUsing the factorial function:\n\nC(20, 17) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17!)/(17! * 3 * 2 * 1)\nC(20, 17) = (20 * 19 * 18)/(3 * 2 * 1)\nC(20, 17) = 1140\n\nNow, let's plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 17) = 1140 * (0.75)^17 * (0.25)^3\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 17) = 1140 * 0.0201 * 0.015625\nP(X = 17) â‰ˆ 0.3594\n\nSo, the probability of the dancer hitting the move exactly 17 times out of 20 is approximately 0.3594 or 35.94%."
