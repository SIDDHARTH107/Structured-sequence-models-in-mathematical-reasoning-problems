    "message_2": "To encrypt a 512-bit message using a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits, we first need to divide the message into blocks of 64 bits each. \n\n512 bits / 64 bits per block = 8 blocks\n\nEach block goes through 16 rounds of encryption. Therefore, the total number of encryption steps required for all 8 blocks is:\n\n8 blocks * 16 rounds per block = 128 encryption steps"
