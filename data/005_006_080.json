    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 250g\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 10g\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 245g\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 10g / √50 ≈ 1.414g\n\nNext, we will calculate the z-score, which represents how many standard errors away the sample mean is from the population mean:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nz = (245g - 250g) / 1.414g ≈ -3.536\n\nNow, we will use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability that the average weight of the sample bags will be less than 245g. The z-table gives us the area to the left of the z-score, which represents the probability.\n\nP(z < -3.536) ≈ 0.0002\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the sample bags will be less than 245g is approximately 0.02% or 0.0002."
