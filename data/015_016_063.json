    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium points of the system, we need to set the derivatives equal to zero and solve for x, y, and z:\n\n$$0 = a(y - x - f(x))$$\n$$0 = x - y + z$$\n$$0 = -b\\cdot y$$\n\nFirst, we can solve the third equation for y:\n\n$$y = 0$$\n\nNow, substitute y = 0 into the second equation:\n\n$$0 = x - 0 + z$$\n$$x = z$$\n\nNow, substitute y = 0 and x = z into the first equation:\n\n$$0 = a(0 - z - f(z))$$\n\nSince a ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by a:\n\n$$0 = -z - f(z)$$\n\nNow, we need to solve for z:\n\n$$z = -f(z)$$\n$$z = -0.15z^3 + 1.5z$$\n\nThis equation has three solutions: z = 0, z = ±√10. To find the corresponding x values, we use x = z:\n\n$$x = 0, x = ±√10$$\n\nSo, we have three equilibrium points: (0, 0, 0), (√10, 0, √10), and (-√10, 0, -√10).\n\nNow, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. To do this, we will linearize the system around each equilibrium point by finding the Jacobian matrix:\n\n$$J(x, y, z) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(a(y - x - f(x))) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(a(y - x - f(x))) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(a(y - x - f(x))) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x - y + z) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x - y + z) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x - y + z) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-b\\cdot y) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-b\\cdot y) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-b\\cdot y)\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$J(x, y, z) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-a - \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x} & a & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -b & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point and find the eigenvalues:\n\n1. At (0, 0, 0):\n\n$$J(0, 0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-a - \\frac{\\partial f(0)}{\\partial x} & a & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -b & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-a & a & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -b & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ₁ = -a, λ₂ = -1, and λ₃ = 0. Since one of the eigenvalues is positive, the equilibrium point (0, 0, 0) is unstable.\n\n2. At (√10, 0, √10) and (-√10, 0, -√10):\n\nWe can analyze these two points together since they are symmetric. The Jacobian matrix at these points is:\n\n$$J(±√10, 0, ±√10) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-a - \\frac{\\partial f(±√10)}{\\partial x} & a & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -b & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are complex with negative real parts. Therefore, the equilibrium points (√10, 0, √10) and (-√10, 0, -√10) are stable.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chua circuit has three equilibrium points: (0, 0, 0), (√10, 0, √10), and (-√10, 0, -√10). The equilibrium point (0, 0, 0) is unstable, while the equilibrium points (√10, 0, √10) and (-√10, 0, -√10) are stable."
