First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n```\n| 1   2   3 |  8i\n| 2  -3   1 | -6 + 5i\n| 3   1   2 |  2 - i\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1\n\n```\n| 1   2   3 |  8i\n| 0  -7  -5 | -22 + 5i\n| 0  -5  -7 | -22 - 25i\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7 to make the second element of the second row equal to 1.\n\nRow2 = Row2 / -7\n\n```\n| 1   2   3 |  8i\n| 0   1  5/7 | 22/7 - 5i/7\n| 0  -5  -7 | -22 - 25i\n```\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 + 5 * Row2\n\n```\n| 1   2   3 |  8i\n| 0   1  5/7 | 22/7 - 5i/7\n| 0   0 -20/7 | -6 - 20i\n```\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -20/7 to make the third element of the third row equal to 1.\n\nRow3 = Row3 / (-20/7)\n\n```\n| 1   2   3 |  8i\n| 0   1  5/7 | 22/7 - 5i/7\n| 0   0   1  | 3/5 + i\n```\n\nStep 5: Back substitution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = 3/5 + i\n\nNow substitute the value of z in the second row to find y:\n\ny + 5/7 * (3/5 + i) = 22/7 - 5i/7\ny = 22/7 - 5i/7 - 5/7 * (3/5 + i)\n\ny = (22 - 3)/7 - (5i - 5i)/7\ny = 19/7 - 0i\n\nSo, y = 19/7\n\nNow substitute the values of y and z in the first row to find x:\n\nx + 2 * (19/7) + 3 * (3/5 + i) = 8i\nx = 8i - 6 - 9i\n\nSo, x = -6 + i\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -6 + i\ny = 19/7\nz = 3/5 + i"
