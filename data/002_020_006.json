    "message_1": "If the radius of a sector of a circle is 5 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees, what is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the central angle (θ) is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ns = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 5\ns = (1/6) × 2 × 3.14159 × 5\ns ≈ 5.23599 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the length of the arc (s) to the two radii (each 5 cm):\n\nPerimeter = s + 2r\nPerimeter ≈ 5.23599 + 2 × 5\nPerimeter ≈ 5.23599 + 10\nPerimeter ≈ 15.23599 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 15.24 cm."
