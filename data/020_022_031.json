    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two different types of items: type A and type B. Each item of type A requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor time to produce, and each item of type B requires 1 hour of machine time and 3 hours of labor time to produce. The company has 200 hours of machine time and 300 hours of labor time available per week. The profit for each item of type A is $5, and the profit for each item of type B is $10. How many of each item should the company produce per week to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A items produced and y be the number of type B items produced.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor time can be written as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 200 (machine time constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 300 (labor time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 10y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 200\ny ≤ -2x + 200\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 300\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 100\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We will find these vertices by solving the system of equations:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\n\n2x + y = 200\nx + 3y = 300\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 60\ny = 80\n\nThe other vertices are where each constraint intersects the x and y axes:\n\nConstraint 1:\nx = 0, y = 200\nx = 100, y = 0\n\nConstraint 2:\nx = 0, y = 100\nx = 300, y = 0\n\nHowever, the point (300, 0) is not in the feasible region, as it does not satisfy the machine time constraint.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 100) = 5(0) + 10(100) = $1000\n2. P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 10(0) = $500\n3. P(60, 80) = 5(60) + 10(80) = $1400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 60 items of type A and 80 items of type B, resulting in a profit of $1400 per week."
