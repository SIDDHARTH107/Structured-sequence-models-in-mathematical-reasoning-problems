    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events occurring, we can multiply the probabilities of each event. \n\nProbability of home burglary = 0.05\nProbability of car theft = 0.10\n\nProbability of both events occurring = Probability of home burglary * Probability of car theft\n= 0.05 * 0.10\n= 0.005\n\nSo, the probability of both a home burglary and a car theft occurring in the same night in that particular neighborhood is 0.005 or 0.5%."
