    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 10 |\n| 1 -2  3 | -1 |\n| 3  4 -2 |  5 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get a 1 in the top-left corner.\n\n| 1 -2  3 | -1 |\n| 2  3  1 | 10 |\n| 3  4 -2 |  5 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n|  1  -2   3 |  -1 |\n|  0   7  -5 |  12 |\n|  0  10 -11 |  8  |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row and second column.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 / 7\n\n|  1  -2   3 |  -1 |\n|  0   1  -5/7 | 12/7 |\n|  0  10 -11 |   8  |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 10 in the second column below the 1.\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 10 * Row 2\n\n|  1  -2    3  |  -1  |\n|  0   1  -5/7 | 12/7 |\n|  0   0   1/7 |  4/7 |\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nz = 1/7 * (4/7) = 4/49\n\ny = 12/7 + 5/7 * z = 12/7 + 5/7 * (4/49) = 12/7 + 20/49 = (84 + 20) / 49 = 104/49\n\nx = -1 + 2 * y - 3 * z = -1 + 2 * (104/49) - 3 * (4/49) = -1 + 208/49 - 12/49 = (-49 + 208 - 12) / 49 = 147/49\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 3\ny = 104/49\nz = 4/49"
