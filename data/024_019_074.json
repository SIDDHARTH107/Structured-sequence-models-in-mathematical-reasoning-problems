    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact surface S without boundary, the following equation holds:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\nGiven that S has a constant Gaussian curvature equal to 6, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n6 ∫∫_S dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nLet A be the total area of the surface S. Then, we have:\n\n6A = 2πχ(S)\n\nNow, we need to find the Euler characteristic χ(S):\n\nχ(S) = (6A) / (2π)\n\nSince we don't have any information about the area A of the surface S, we cannot find the exact value of the Euler characteristic χ(S). However, we can express it in terms of the area A:\n\nχ(S) = (3A) / π"
