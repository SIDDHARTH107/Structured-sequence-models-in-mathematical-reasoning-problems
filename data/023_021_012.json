    "message_2": "To determine the expression for the electric field strength of the wave at any point in space using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the general expression for the electric field strength as a function of distance from the antenna.\n\nThe electric field strength (E) of a radio wave in free space can be expressed as:\n\nE(r) = k * P_t / r\n\nwhere E(r) is the electric field strength at a distance r from the antenna, k is a constant, and P_t is the power of the transmitted wave.\n\nGiven that the electric field strength is 2 V/m at a distance of 10 meters from the antenna, we can find the value of k * P_t:\n\n2 V/m = k * P_t / 10 m\n\nk * P_t = 20\n\nNow, we can express the electric field strength as a function of distance:\n\nE(r) = 20 / r\n\nNext, we will use the Fourier transform to find the expression for the electric field strength in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫ f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn our case, the function f(t) is the electric field strength E(r) as a function of distance r:\n\nE(r) = 20 / r\n\nTo find the Fourier transform of E(r), we need to express r in terms of time t. Since the radio wave has a frequency of 100 MHz, its angular frequency ω is:\n\nω = 2π * 100 * 10^6\n\nThe speed of light in free space (c) is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s. The relationship between distance r, time t, and the speed of light c is:\n\nr = c * t\n\nNow, we can express E(r) in terms of time t:\n\nE(t) = 20 / (c * t)\n\nFinally, we can find the Fourier transform of E(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫ (20 / (c * t)) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThis integral does not have a closed-form solution. However, the expression for the electric field strength in the frequency domain is given by the Fourier transform F(ω) of E(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫ (20 / (c * t)) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThis expression represents the electric field strength of the radio wave at any point in space in the frequency domain."
