    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph G with 8 vertices, we need to know the maximum degree of the graph (i.e., the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex). The maximum degree of a graph is denoted as Δ(G).\n\nThe minimum number of colors required to properly color a graph is called the chromatic number and is denoted as χ(G). According to the Greedy Coloring Algorithm, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1.\n\nWithout information about the maximum degree (Δ(G)) of the graph, we cannot determine the exact minimum number of colors required. However, we can provide a range:\n\n1. If the graph is disconnected (i.e., there are vertices with no edges), then the minimum number of colors required is 1.\n2. If the graph is connected and has a maximum degree of 1 (i.e., it is a tree or a cycle with an even number of vertices), then the minimum number of colors required is 2.\n3. If the graph is connected and has a maximum degree of 2 (i.e., it is a cycle with an odd number of vertices), then the minimum number of colors required is 3.\n4. If the graph is connected and has a maximum degree of 3 or more, then the minimum number of colors required is between 3 and Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn conclusion, without knowing the maximum degree of the graph, we cannot determine the exact minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph G with 8 vertices."
