    "message_2": "Yes, the above graph is planar. A graph is planar if it can be drawn in a plane without any edges crossing each other. The given graph can be drawn without any edge crossings as shown below:\n\n```\n        A\n       / \\\n      B---C\n     /     \\\n    D-------F\n     \\     /\n      E---/\n```\n\nIn this representation, no edges cross each other, so the graph is planar."
