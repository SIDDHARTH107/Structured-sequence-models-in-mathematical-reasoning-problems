    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA x B = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are common to both A x B and B. Since B contains single elements and A x B contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between the two sets.\n\n(A x B) ∩ B = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are common to both B and B, which is just B itself.\n\nB ∩ B = B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find A x (B ∩ B), which is the same as A x B since B ∩ B = B.\n\nA x (B ∩ B) = A x B = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to intersection for these sets. We need to compare (A x B) ∩ B and A x (B ∩ B).\n\n(A x B) ∩ B = ∅\nA x (B ∩ B) = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nSince (A x B) ∩ B ≠ A x (B ∩ B), the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection for these sets."
