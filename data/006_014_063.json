    "message_1": "In a communication system, the probability of a certain type of failure occurring is 0.02. If the system has 100 independent components, what is the probability that at least 2 components will fail due to this type of failure?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 components will fail, we can first find the probability that 0 or 1 component will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet p = 0.02 be the probability of failure for a single component, and q = 1 - p = 0.98 be the probability of success (no failure) for a single component.\n\nThe probability that 0 components will fail is simply q^100, since all 100 components must succeed.\n\nThe probability that exactly 1 component will fail is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n-k)\n\nwhere n = 100 (number of components), k = 1 (number of failures), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(100, 1) = 100! / (1!(100-1)!) = 100\n\nP(X = 1) = 100 * 0.02^1 * 0.98^99 ≈ 0.2707\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least 2 components will fail:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.98^100 - 0.2707 ≈ 0.9323\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 components will fail due to this type of failure is approximately 0.9323 or 93.23%."
