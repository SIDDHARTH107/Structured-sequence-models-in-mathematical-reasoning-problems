The company has eight machines that can be used to produce the products, but not all machines are suitable for every product. The following table shows the time required for each product on each machine, as well as the profit earned for each product:\n\n| Product | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 | Machine 5 | Machine 6 | Machine 7 | Machine 8 | Profit per unit |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|\n| A       | 6         | 2         | 8         | 5         | 9         | 3         | 7         | 1         | \\$20            |\n| B       | 3         | 6         | 4         | 8         | 7         | 2         | 1         | 9         | \\$30            |\n| C       | 4         | 3         | 2         | 6         | 5         | 12        | 8         | 7         | \\$35            |\n| D       | 8         | 12        | 6         | 9         | 10        | 7         | 15        | 2         | \\$10            |\n| E       | 1         | 2         | 3         | 4         | 5         | 6         | 7         | 8         | \\$25            |\n\nEach machine can only produce one product at a time, and each product must be produced in its entirety (i.e., you can't produce half of Product A and then switch to producing half of Product B). The company has only 80 hours of total manufacturing time available per week. How many units of each product should the company produce each week to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profits, we need to find the most efficient use of the machines and the 80 hours of manufacturing time available. We can do this by calculating the profit per hour for each product on each machine and then assigning the machines to the products with the highest profit per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the profit per hour for each product on each machine:\n\n| Product | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 | Machine 5 | Machine 6 | Machine 7 | Machine 8 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 3.33      | 10        | 2.5       | 4         | 2.22      | 6.67      | 2.86      | 20        |\n| B       | 10        | 5         | 7.5       | 3.75      | 4.29      | 15        | 30        | 3.33      |\n| C       | 8.75      | 11.67     | 17.5      | 5.83      | 7         | 2.92      | 4.38      | 5         |\n| D       | 1.25      | 0.83      | 1.67      | 1.11      | 1         | 1.43      | 0.67      | 5         |\n| E       | 25        | 12.5      | 8.33      | 6.25      | 5         | 4.17      | 3.57      | 3.13      |\n\nNow, let's assign the machines to the products with the highest profit per hour:\n\n- Machine 1: Product E (25)\n- Machine 2: Product C (11.67)\n- Machine 3: Product C (17.5)\n- Machine 4: Product A (4)\n- Machine 5: Product A (2.22)\n- Machine 6: Product B (15)\n- Machine 7: Product B (30)\n- Machine 8: Product A (20)\n\nNow we need to calculate how many units of each product can be produced within the 80-hour limit:\n\n- Product A: (Machine 4: 80/5) + (Machine 5: 80/9) + (Machine 8: 80/1) = 16 + 8.89 + 80 = 104.89 units\n- Product B: (Machine 6: 80/2) + (Machine 7: 80/1) = 40 + 80 = 120 units\n- Product C: (Machine 2: 80/3) + (Machine 3: 80/2) = 26.67 + 40 = 66.67 units\n- Product D: 0 units\n- Product E: (Machine 1: 80/1) = 80 units\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, we need to round down the number of units for each product:\n\n- Product A: 104 units\n- Product B: 120 units\n- Product C: 66 units\n- Product D: 0 units\n- Product E: 80 units\n\nSo, the company should produce 104 units of Product A, 120 units of Product B, 66 units of Product C, 0 units of Product D, and 80 units of Product E each week to maximize profits."
