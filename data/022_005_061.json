    "message_2": "To find the residue of the given function at its pole, we first need to find the order of the pole. Let's factor the denominator to find the poles of the function:\n\nDenominator: z^2 + 4z + 13\n\nWe can complete the square to rewrite the denominator as:\n\n(z + 2)^2 + 9\n\nNow, we can see that the function has two poles at z = -2 Â± 3i. Since we are interested in the pole at z = -2 + 3i, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2z + 5) / [(z - (-2 + 3i))((z - (-2 - 3i))]\n\nNow, let's find the order of the pole at z = -2 + 3i. Since the denominator has a linear factor (z - (-2 + 3i)), the order of the pole is 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the residue of the function at the pole z = -2 + 3i. Since the order of the pole is 1, we can use the formula:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> -2 + 3i) [(z - (-2 + 3i)) * f(z)]\n\n= lim (z -> -2 + 3i) [(z + 2 - 3i) * (z^2 + 2z + 5) / ((z + 2 - 3i)(z + 2 + 3i))]\n\n= lim (z -> -2 + 3i) [(z^2 + 2z + 5) / (z + 2 + 3i)]\n\nNow, we can substitute the pole z = -2 + 3i into the expression:\n\nResidue = ((-2 + 3i)^2 + 2(-2 + 3i) + 5) / (-2 + 3i + 2 + 3i)\n\n= ((-2 + 3i)^2 + 5) / (6i)\n\n= (4 - 12i + 9i^2 + 5) / (6i)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we have:\n\n= (4 - 12i - 9 + 5) / (6i)\n\n= (-1 - 12i) / (6i)\n\nNow, we can divide both the real and imaginary parts by 6i:\n\nResidue = (-1/6i) - 2\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary unit in the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nResidue = (-1/6i) * (-i/(-i)) - 2\n\n= (1/6)i - 2\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z + 5)/(z^2 + 4z + 13) at its pole z = -2 + 3i is (1/6)i - 2."
