Using the Feistel cipher structure with 4 rounds, encrypt the plaintext block using the following round functions:\n\nF(K,R) = (K+R) mod 16\n\nwhere K is the 8-bit key and R is the 8-bit right half of the plaintext block.\n\nWhat is the ciphertext obtained after 4 rounds of encryption?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the plaintext block as P, and the left and right halves of the plaintext block as L0 and R0, respectively. We will use the given round function F(K, R) = (K + R) mod 16 for the Feistel cipher structure.\n\nRound 1:\nL1 = R0\nR1 = L0 ⊕ F(K, R0) = L0 ⊕ (K + R0) mod 16\n\nRound 2:\nL2 = R1\nR2 = L1 ⊕ F(K, R1) = R0 ⊕ (K + R1) mod 16\n\nRound 3:\nL3 = R2\nR3 = L2 ⊕ F(K, R2) = R1 ⊕ (K + R2) mod 16\n\nRound 4:\nL4 = R3\nR4 = L3 ⊕ F(K, R3) = R2 ⊕ (K + R3) mod 16\n\nAfter 4 rounds of encryption, the ciphertext is the concatenation of L4 and R4. Without the specific values of the plaintext block and the key, we cannot provide the exact ciphertext. However, the general form of the ciphertext after 4 rounds of encryption is (R3, R2 ⊕ (K + R3) mod 16)."
