    "message_2": "To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers that can be expressed as the difference between two consecutive perfect squares, we will use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume that there are only finitely many prime numbers that can be expressed as the difference between two consecutive perfect squares. Let's call these primes p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nNow, consider the number N = (p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n)^2 + 1. This number is clearly larger than any of the primes p_i, and it is not divisible by any of them, as it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any p_i.\n\nNow, let's express N as the difference between two consecutive perfect squares:\n\nN = (x + 1)^2 - x^2, where x is an integer.\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\nN = x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 2x + 1.\n\nSince N is odd, it can be expressed as the sum of an even number (2x) and an odd number (1).\n\nNow, we know that N is not divisible by any of the primes p_i, so it must have a prime factor q that is not in the list of primes p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. Since q is a prime factor of N, we have:\n\nN = q * k, where k is an integer.\n\nSubstituting the expression for N, we get:\n\n2x + 1 = q * k.\n\nSince q is not in the list of primes p_i, it must be the case that q can be expressed as the difference between two consecutive perfect squares. But this contradicts our initial assumption that there are only finitely many such primes.\n\nTherefore, our assumption is false, and there must be infinitely many prime numbers that can be expressed as the difference between two consecutive perfect squares."
