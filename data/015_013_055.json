    "message_2": "We are given the logistic equation 𝑥ₙ₊₁ = 4𝑥ₙ(1-𝑥ₙ) and the initial condition x₀ = 0.5. We will find the first five terms of the sequence by iterating the equation.\n\n1. x₁ = 4 * x₀ * (1 - x₀) = 4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 4 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 1\n2. x₂ = 4 * x₁ * (1 - x₁) = 4 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 4 * 1 * 0 = 0\n3. x₃ = 4 * x₂ * (1 - x₂) = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 4 * 0 * 1 = 0\n4. x₄ = 4 * x₃ * (1 - x₃) = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 4 * 0 * 1 = 0\n5. x₅ = 4 * x₄ * (1 - x₄) = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 4 * 0 * 1 = 0\n\nSo, the first five terms of the sequence are: 0.5, 1, 0, 0, 0."
