    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B. The Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C. The Cartesian product (A × B) × C is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) ∈ (A × B) and c ∈ C. So, (A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}.\n\nNext, let's find B × C. The Cartesian product B × C is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b ∈ B and c ∈ C. So, B × C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × C). The Cartesian product A × (B × C) is the set of all ordered pairs (a, (b, c)) where a ∈ A and (b, c) ∈ (B × C). So, A × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}.\n\nNow, we need to prove that (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are equal. To do this, we can show that each element in (A × B) × C can be mapped to an element in A × (B × C) and vice versa.\n\nLet's define a function f: (A × B) × C → A × (B × C) as follows:\n\nf(((a, b), c)) = (a, (b, c))\n\nNow, let's apply this function to each element in (A × B) × C:\n\nf(((1, 3), 5)) = (1, (3, 5))\nf(((1, 4), 5)) = (1, (4, 5))\nf(((2, 3), 5)) = (2, (3, 5))\nf(((2, 4), 5)) = (2, (4, 5))\n\nAs we can see, the function f maps each element in (A × B) × C to an element in A × (B × C). Since the function f is bijective, we can conclude that (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are equal."
