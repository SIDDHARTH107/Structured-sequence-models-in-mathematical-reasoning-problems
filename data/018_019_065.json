    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of two sets, we need to find the elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. Let's first find A △ B:\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find (A △ B) △ C:\n\n(A △ B) △ C = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {1, 3, 4, 5} - {4} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow let's find B △ C:\n\nB △ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nNow let's find A △ (B △ C):\n\nA △ (B △ C) = (A ∪ {2, 5}) - (A ∩ {2, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 5} - {2} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) △ C = {1, 3, 5} and A △ (B △ C) = {1, 3, 5}. Since both expressions are equal, we have verified that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative."
