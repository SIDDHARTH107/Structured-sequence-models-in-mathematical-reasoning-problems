    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = z^2 + 1 along the path γ(t) = 1 + 3it, t ∈ [0, 1], we first need to substitute γ(t) into the function f(z).\n\nLet z = γ(t) = 1 + 3it. Then, we have:\n\nf(γ(t)) = (1 + 3it)^2 + 1\n\nExpanding the square, we get:\n\nf(γ(t)) = (1 + 6it - 9t^2) + 1\n\nSimplifying, we obtain:\n\nf(γ(t)) = -9t^2 + 6it + 2\n\nNow, we have the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = z^2 + 1 along the path γ(t) = 1 + 3it, t ∈ [0, 1]:\n\nf(γ(t)) = -9t^2 + 6it + 2"
