    "message_1": "Consider the chemical reaction A → B, where the rate of change of concentration of A with respect to time t is given by d[A]/dt = -k[A]^2, where k = 0.02 L/mol/min is the rate constant. If the initial concentration of A is 0.1 mol/L, what is the concentration of A after 10 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to integrate the given rate equation to find the concentration of A as a function of time. The rate equation is:\n\nd[A]/dt = -k[A]^2\n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\nd[A]/[A]^2 = -k dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/[A]^2) d[A] = ∫(-k) dt\n\nLet's solve the integrals:\n\n-1/[A] = -kt + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition. At t = 0, [A] = 0.1 mol/L:\n\n-1/0.1 = -0.02 * 0 + C\nC = -10\n\nNow, we have the equation for the concentration of A as a function of time:\n\n-1/[A] = -kt - 10\n\nWe want to find the concentration of A after 10 minutes, so we plug in t = 10 and k = 0.02 L/mol/min:\n\n-1/[A] = -0.02 * 10 - 10\n-1/[A] = -10.2\n\nNow, we solve for [A]:\n\n[A] = -1/-10.2\n[A] ≈ 0.098 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of A after 10 minutes is approximately 0.098 mol/L."
