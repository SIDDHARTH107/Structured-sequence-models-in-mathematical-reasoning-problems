    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of X, we will use the concept of loops and homotopy. A loop is a continuous map f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = f(1) = p, where p is the base point (1, 0) in our case. Two loops are homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other without breaking the loop or leaving the space X.\n\nThe fundamental group of X, denoted π_1(X, p), is the set of homotopy classes of loops based at p, with the group operation being concatenation of loops.\n\nNow, let's consider the unit circle X. We can parameterize a loop on X by f(t) = (cos(2πt), sin(2πt)), where t ∈ [0, 1]. This loop traces the unit circle exactly once, starting and ending at the base point p = (1, 0).\n\nAny other loop on X can be obtained by winding around the circle an integer number of times, say n times. We can parameterize such a loop by g(t) = (cos(2πnt), sin(2πnt)). Note that if n is negative, the loop winds around the circle in the opposite direction.\n\nNow, let's consider two loops g_n(t) = (cos(2πnt), sin(2πnt)) and g_m(t) = (cos(2πmt), sin(2πmt)), where n and m are integers. The concatenation of these loops is a loop that winds around the circle n + m times. Therefore, the homotopy class of the concatenated loop is represented by g_(n+m)(t).\n\nThis shows that the fundamental group π_1(X, p) is isomorphic to the group of integers ℤ, with the group operation being addition. The isomorphism can be given by the map that sends the homotopy class of g_n(t) to the integer n.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of the unit circle X based at point p = (1, 0) is isomorphic to the group of integers ℤ."
