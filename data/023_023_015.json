    "message_1": "Suppose you have a network that transmits a signal composed of a square wave with a frequency of 100 Hz. The system has a transfer function H(f) = 1/(1+jf/100), where f is the frequency in Hz. Using the Fourier transform, determine the frequency response of the network at the following frequencies: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz.",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency response of the network at the given frequencies, we need to evaluate the transfer function H(f) at those frequencies. \n\nRecall that j is the imaginary unit, where j^2 = -1.\n\n1. For f = 50 Hz:\nH(50) = 1 / (1 + j(50/100))\nH(50) = 1 / (1 + j(1/2))\nH(50) = 1 / (1 + j/2)\n\n2. For f = 100 Hz:\nH(100) = 1 / (1 + j(100/100))\nH(100) = 1 / (1 + j)\nH(100) = 1 / (1 + j)\n\n3. For f = 150 Hz:\nH(150) = 1 / (1 + j(150/100))\nH(150) = 1 / (1 + j(3/2))\nH(150) = 1 / (1 + 3j/2)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at each frequency.\n\n1. For f = 50 Hz:\nMagnitude: |H(50)| = |1 / (1 + j/2)| = 1 / sqrt(1^2 + (1/2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(5/4) = 2/sqrt(5)\nPhase: ∠H(50) = -tan^(-1)(1/2) (since the imaginary part is positive)\n\n2. For f = 100 Hz:\nMagnitude: |H(100)| = |1 / (1 + j)| = 1 / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = 1 / sqrt(2)\nPhase: ∠H(100) = -tan^(-1)(1) (since the imaginary part is positive)\n\n3. For f = 150 Hz:\nMagnitude: |H(150)| = |1 / (1 + 3j/2)| = 1 / sqrt(1^2 + (3/2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(13/4) = 2/sqrt(13)\nPhase: ∠H(150) = -tan^(-1)(3/2) (since the imaginary part is positive)\n\nSo, the frequency response of the network at the given frequencies is:\n\n1. At 50 Hz: H(50) = (2/sqrt(5)) ∠ -tan^(-1)(1/2)\n2. At 100 Hz: H(100) = (1/sqrt(2)) ∠ -tan^(-1)(1)\n3. At 150 Hz: H(150) = (2/sqrt(13)) ∠ -tan^(-1)(3/2)"
