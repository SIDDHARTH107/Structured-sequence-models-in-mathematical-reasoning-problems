    "message_2": "An isometry of $S^2$ is a distance-preserving transformation that maps the sphere onto itself. In other words, it is a rigid motion of the sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The group of isometries of $S^2$ is the orthogonal group $O(3)$, which consists of all $3 \\times 3$ orthogonal matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$. \n\nThe orthogonal group $O(3)$ can be decomposed into two disjoint subsets: the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$, which consists of orthogonal matrices with determinant $1$, and the set of orthogonal matrices with determinant $-1$. The elements of $SO(3)$ correspond to proper rotations, while the elements with determinant $-1$ correspond to improper rotations (reflections and rotoreflections).\n\nTo count the number of isometries of $S^2$, we need to count the number of elements in $O(3)$. However, this is not a finite group, so there are infinitely many isometries of $S^2$. \n\nIf we restrict our attention to a finite subgroup of $O(3)$, such as the group of symmetries of a Platonic solid, then we can count the number of isometries in that subgroup. For example, the group of symmetries of an icosahedron has 60 elements, so there are 60 isometries of $S^2$ that correspond to the symmetries of an icosahedron."
