    "message_1": "Suppose two friends have agreed to go on a hunting trip. They can either hunt a stag or a hare. If they hunt a stag together, they will be able to catch it and share the meat. If one of them hunts a hare while the other hunts a stag, the one who hunts the hare will get a hare to eat and the one who hunted the stag will go home empty-handed. However, if both of them hunt a hare, they can both eat but will not have the chance to share the larger meat of a stag. Suppose the payoff for hunting a stag together is 10 units of meat, while hunting a hare yields only 4 units. If the cost for each person to hunt is 2 units, what should they choose and why?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best choice, we can analyze the possible outcomes and their respective payoffs. There are three possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both friends hunt a stag.\n2. One friend hunts a stag, and the other hunts a hare.\n3. Both friends hunt a hare.\n\nScenario 1: Both friends hunt a stag\nIf both friends hunt a stag, they will share the 10 units of meat. Since there are two of them, each will get 5 units of meat. After accounting for the cost of hunting (2 units), each friend will have a net gain of 3 units of meat (5 - 2 = 3).\n\nScenario 2: One friend hunts a stag, and the other hunts a hare\nIn this scenario, the friend who hunts a hare will get 4 units of meat. After accounting for the cost of hunting (2 units), they will have a net gain of 2 units of meat (4 - 2 = 2). The friend who hunts a stag will go home empty-handed, so their net gain is -2 units of meat (0 - 2 = -2).\n\nScenario 3: Both friends hunt a hare\nIf both friends hunt a hare, they will each get 4 units of meat. After accounting for the cost of hunting (2 units), each friend will have a net gain of 2 units of meat (4 - 2 = 2).\n\nComparing the scenarios, we can see that the best choice for both friends is to hunt a stag together (Scenario 1), as it results in the highest net gain of 3 units of meat for each friend. This choice requires cooperation and trust between the friends, as they both need to commit to hunting the stag to achieve the best outcome."
