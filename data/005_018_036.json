    "message_1": "A researcher wants to study the time it takes for light bulbs to burn out. The researcher selects a sample of 50 bulbs and follows each bulb until it burns out. The data shows that 20% of the bulbs had burned out by the end of the first year, 40% by the end of the second year, and 50% by the end of the third year. What is the probability that a light bulb selected at random will burn out within the first 2.5 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a light bulb selected at random will burn out within the first 2.5 years, we need to interpolate the data between the second and third years. \n\nAt the end of the second year, 40% of the bulbs had burned out. At the end of the third year, 50% had burned out. We can assume a linear relationship between these two points for simplicity.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of burned-out bulbs between the second and third years is 50% - 40% = 10%. Since we want to find the probability at 2.5 years, which is halfway between the second and third years, we can assume that half of this 10% increase has occurred by 2.5 years.\n\nSo, at 2.5 years, the percentage of burned-out bulbs is 40% + (10% / 2) = 40% + 5% = 45%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a light bulb selected at random will burn out within the first 2.5 years is 45%."
