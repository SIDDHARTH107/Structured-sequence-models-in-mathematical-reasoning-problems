    "message_2": "Let the curvatures of the initial circles be $k_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $k_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $k_3 = \\frac{1}{7}$. The Descartes Circle Theorem states that for any four mutually tangent circles with curvatures $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$, the following equation holds:\n\n$k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2 = 2(k_1k_2 + k_1k_3 + k_1k_4 + k_2k_3 + k_2k_4 + k_3k_4)$.\n\nWe can use this theorem to find the curvature of the fourth circle tangent to the initial three circles:\n\n$k_4 = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{k_1k_2 + k_1k_3 + k_2k_3}$.\n\nFor the Apollonian gasket, we choose the positive solution:\n\n$k_4 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{7} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{7}} = \\frac{41}{42}$.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the 4th generation. The sum of the curvatures of the circles in the 1st generation is $k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{41}{42}$. The sum of the curvatures of the circles in the 2nd generation is $3k_4 = 3\\cdot\\frac{41}{42} = \\frac{123}{42}$. \n\nFor the 3rd and 4th generations, we can use the fact that each new circle's curvature is the sum of the curvatures of the three circles it is tangent to, plus twice the square root of the product of those curvatures. Thus, the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the 3rd generation is $3(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4) = 3\\cdot\\frac{82}{42} = \\frac{246}{42}$, and the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the 4th generation is $6(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4) = 6\\cdot\\frac{82}{42} = \\frac{492}{42}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the curvatures of the circles in the 4th generation of the Apollonian gasket is $\\frac{492}{42} = \\boxed{\\frac{246}{21}}$."
