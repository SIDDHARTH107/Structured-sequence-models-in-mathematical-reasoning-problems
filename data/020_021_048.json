    "message_1": "A factory has three machines that can produce a total of 100 units per hour. Machine A produces 20 units per hour, machine B produces 25 units per hour, and machine C produces 30 units per hour. All three machines must be used to produce the required number of units. What is the optimal scheduling of production to maximize the total number of units produced per hour?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total number of units produced per hour, we should have all three machines running simultaneously. Since machine A produces 20 units per hour, machine B produces 25 units per hour, and machine C produces 30 units per hour, the optimal scheduling of production would be:\n\nMachine A: 20 units per hour\nMachine B: 25 units per hour\nMachine C: 30 units per hour\n\nWhen all three machines are running simultaneously, they will produce a total of 20 + 25 + 30 = 75 units per hour."
