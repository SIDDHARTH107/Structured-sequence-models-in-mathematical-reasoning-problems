    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a 2-dimensional manifold can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ(M) = V - E + F\n\nwhere V, E, and F are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively. However, for a closed surface like the one described in the problem, we can use the formula:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere g is the genus of the surface (the number of handles). In this case, the genus is 3, so we have:\n\nχ(M) = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the given 2-dimensional manifold M with genus 3 is -4."
