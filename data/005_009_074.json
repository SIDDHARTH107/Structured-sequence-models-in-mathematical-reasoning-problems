    "message_1": "A researcher wants to test whether the median age of students in a certain school is significantly different from 15 years. They sample 10 students and record their ages: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, can the researcher reject the null hypothesis that the median age of students in the school is not different from 15 years at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we first need to calculate the differences between the observed ages and the hypothesized median (15 years), and then rank the absolute differences. Here are the differences and their absolute values:\n\nAge | Difference | Absolute Difference\n----|------------|--------------------\n13  | -2         | 2\n14  | -1         | 1\n15  |  0         | 0\n16  |  1         | 1\n17  |  2         | 2\n18  |  3         | 3\n19  |  4         | 4\n20  |  5         | 5\n21  |  6         | 6\n22  |  7         | 7\n\nNow we rank the absolute differences, ignoring the zero difference:\n\nAbsolute Difference | Rank\n--------------------|-----\n1                   | 1\n1                   | 1\n2                   | 3\n2                   | 3\n3                   | 5\n4                   | 6\n5                   | 7\n6                   | 8\n7                   | 9\n\nSince there are two 1's, we take the average of their ranks (1+2)/2 = 1.5. Similarly, for the two 2's, we take the average of their ranks (3+4)/2 = 3.5. Now we calculate the sum of the ranks for positive differences and the sum of the ranks for negative differences:\n\nPositive Differences | Rank | Negative Differences | Rank\n---------------------|------|----------------------|-----\n1                    | 1.5  | -1                   | 1.5\n2                    | 3.5  | -2                   | 3.5\n3                    | 5    |                      |\n4                    | 6    |                      |\n5                    | 7    |                      |\n6                    | 8    |                      |\n7                    | 9    |                      |\n\nSum of positive ranks: 1.5 + 3.5 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 40.5\nSum of negative ranks: 1.5 + 3.5 = 5\n\nThe test statistic W is the smaller of the two sums of ranks, so W = 5. For a sample size of 10 and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value for a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test is 8. Since our test statistic W = 5 is less than the critical value of 8, we reject the null hypothesis that the median age of students in the school is not different from 15 years at a significance level of 0.05."
