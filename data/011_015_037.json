(Hint: this is an example of the Ramsey Number R(3,3))",
    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,3) represents the smallest number of people in a group such that there are either 3 people who are all friends with each other or 3 people who don't know each other. In this case, R(3,3) = 6.\n\nTo find the smallest number of connections needed, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person in the group. This person can have a connection (friendship) with any of the other 5 people in the group. Since we are looking for either 3 friends or 3 strangers, we can divide these connections into 2 categories: friends and strangers.\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, if this person has at least 3 friends or 3 strangers, we can guarantee that there are either 3 people who are all friends with each other or 3 people who don't know each other. So, this person needs to have at least 3 connections (either friends or strangers).\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, where this person has exactly 3 friends and 2 strangers. In this case, we need to analyze the connections between the 3 friends. If any of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who are all friends. If none of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then they form a group of 3 people who don't know each other.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of connections needed to guarantee that there are either 3 people who are all friends with each other or 3 people who don't know each other is 3."
