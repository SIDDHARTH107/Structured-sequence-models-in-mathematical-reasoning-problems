    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct orbits of the action of the group G = {1, σ} on the solution set of the given equation, we first need to understand the action of the permutation (xy) on the variables x, y, and z.\n\nThe permutation (xy) swaps the variables x and y, leaving z unchanged. Thus, the action of σ on the polynomial equation is given by:\n\nσ(x³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz) = y³ + x³ + z³ - 3yxz = x³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz\n\nSince the polynomial equation remains unchanged under the action of σ, we can say that the polynomial equation is invariant under the action of the group G.\n\nNow, let's consider the solution set of the given equation. A point (x, y, z) is a solution if it satisfies the equation:\n\nx³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz = 0\n\nThe action of σ on the solution set is given by:\n\nσ(x, y, z) = (y, x, z)\n\nIf (x, y, z) is a solution, then (y, x, z) is also a solution, as the polynomial equation is invariant under the action of σ. Therefore, the orbits of the action of G on the solution set are pairs of points of the form {(x, y, z), (y, x, z)}.\n\nHowever, there is one exception: if x = y, then the action of σ on (x, y, z) is (y, x, z) = (x, y, z), and the orbit consists of a single point. This occurs when the solution set lies on the plane x = y.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of distinct orbits of the action of the group G on the solution set of the given equation is determined by the number of pairs of distinct solutions {(x, y, z), (y, x, z)} and the number of single-point orbits on the plane x = y. The exact number of orbits depends on the specific solutions of the equation, but this analysis provides a framework for understanding the structure of the orbits under the action of G."
