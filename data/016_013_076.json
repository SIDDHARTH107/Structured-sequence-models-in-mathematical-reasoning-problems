    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, after each iteration, there are N = 8 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of S = 3.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet is:\n\nD = log(8) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension remains the same after any number of iterations, so the dimension after 5 iterations is still approximately 1.8928."
