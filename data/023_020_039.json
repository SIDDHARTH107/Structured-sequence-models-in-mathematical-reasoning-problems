    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = x/(1-x^2) on the interval (-1, 1), we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, we only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of an odd function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, in this case, L = 1.\n\nTo find the b_n coefficients, we use the formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx) from -L to L\n\nFor our function, this becomes:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫(x/(1-x^2) * sin(nπx) dx) from -1 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x/(1-x^2) and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = (1+x^2)/(1-x^2)^2 dx and v = -cos(nπx)/(nπ)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\n∫(u * dv) = uv - ∫(v * du)\n\nb_n = 2 * ([-x*cos(nπx)/(nπ(1-x^2)) + ∫(cos(nπx)*(1+x^2)/(nπ(1-x^2)^2) dx]) from -1 to 1\n\nThe first term in the brackets, -x*cos(nπx)/(nπ(1-x^2)), is an odd function, so its integral over the symmetric interval (-1, 1) will be zero. Thus, we only need to consider the second term:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫(cos(nπx)*(1+x^2)/(nπ(1-x^2)^2) dx) from -1 to 1\n\nThis integral does not have a closed-form solution, so we cannot find an explicit formula for b_n. However, we can still analyze the convergence of the Fourier series.\n\nTo determine if the Fourier series converges uniformly, we can use the Dirichlet's criterion. The criterion states that if the function f(x) has a finite number of maxima and minima in the interval and has a finite number of discontinuities, then the Fourier series converges uniformly.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = x/(1-x^2) has a vertical asymptote at x = ±1, which means it has an infinite number of maxima and minima in the interval (-1, 1). Therefore, the Fourier series does not converge uniformly according to Dirichlet's criterion."
