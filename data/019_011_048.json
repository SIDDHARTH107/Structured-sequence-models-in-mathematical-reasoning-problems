    "message_2": "In relevance logic, a proposition is considered true if it is both relevant and true. In this case, the proposition states that \"x is both an even number and an odd number.\" Since x is a natural number between 1 and 10, we can list all the possible values of x: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposition for each value of x:\n\n1. x = 1: odd, not even\n2. x = 2: even, not odd\n3. x = 3: odd, not even\n4. x = 4: even, not odd\n5. x = 5: odd, not even\n6. x = 6: even, not odd\n7. x = 7: odd, not even\n8. x = 8: even, not odd\n9. x = 9: odd, not even\n10. x = 10: even, not odd\n\nIn each case, x is either even or odd, but never both. Therefore, the proposition \"x is both an even number and an odd number\" is false for all values of x between 1 and 10 in relevance logic."
