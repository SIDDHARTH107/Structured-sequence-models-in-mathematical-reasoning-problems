    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 40, we first need to examine the prime factorization of 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nNow, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups for the prime factors of 40.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1, which means there is a unique (and thus normal) 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possibilities are n_5 = 1 or n_5 = 8. If n_5 = 1, there is a unique (and thus normal) 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5.\n\nNow, we consider the possibilities for the structure of the group:\n\n1. If both the 2-Sylow and 5-Sylow subgroups are normal, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups, which would be isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_5. However, this group is abelian, so it doesn't fit our requirement of being non-abelian.\n\n2. If the 2-Sylow subgroup is normal and there are 8 distinct 5-Sylow subgroups, then the group is a semidirect product of the 2-Sylow subgroup (of order 8) by the 5-Sylow subgroup (of order 5). In this case, we need to determine the number of distinct non-trivial homomorphisms from the 5-Sylow subgroup to the automorphism group of the 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\nThe 2-Sylow subgroup is of order 8, so its possible structures are Z_8 or Z_2 × Z_4. The automorphism group of Z_8 is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_4, and the automorphism group of Z_2 × Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_4. The 5-Sylow subgroup is of order 5, so it is isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_5 to the automorphism groups of the possible 2-Sylow subgroups:\n\n- For Z_8, the automorphism group is Z_2 × Z_4. There are 4 non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_5 to Z_2 × Z_4.\n- For Z_2 × Z_4, the automorphism group is Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_4. There are 4 non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_5 to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_4.\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 4 = 8 distinct non-trivial homomorphisms, which correspond to 8 distinct non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nSo, there are 8 distinct non-abelian groups of order 40."
