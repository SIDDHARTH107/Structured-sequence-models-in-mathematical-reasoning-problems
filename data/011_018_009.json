    "message_2": "To find the number of different fruit baskets that can be made, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, the 15 types of fruit), k is the number of items we want to choose (in this case, 5 types of fruit for the basket), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!)\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 1,307,674,368,000\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, let's plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(15, 5) = 1,307,674,368,000 / (120 × 3,628,800)\n\nC(15, 5) = 1,307,674,368,000 / 435,456,000\n\nC(15, 5) = 3,003\n\nSo, there are 3,003 different fruit baskets that can be made from these 15 types of fruit."
