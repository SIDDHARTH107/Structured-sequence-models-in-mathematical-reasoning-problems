    "message_1": "Suppose the weight of apples follows a normal distribution with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. If a sample of 36 apples is selected, what is the probability that the sample mean weight will be between 145 and 155 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 36 apples, which is large enough to apply the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nThe mean (μ) of the weight of apples is 150 grams, and the standard deviation (σ) is 20 grams. Since we have a sample size of 36 apples (n = 36), we can calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean using the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 20 / √36\nSE = 20 / 6\nSE = 3.33 grams (approximately)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean weight will be between 145 and 155 grams. To do this, we will use z-scores, which represent the number of standard errors a value is from the mean. We will calculate the z-scores for both 145 and 155 grams using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nFor 145 grams:\nz1 = (145 - 150) / 3.33\nz1 = -5 / 3.33\nz1 ≈ -1.50\n\nFor 155 grams:\nz2 = (155 - 150) / 3.33\nz2 = 5 / 3.33\nz2 ≈ 1.50\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean weight will be between these two z-scores. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the area under the curve between these two z-scores.\n\nP(-1.50 < z < 1.50) = P(z < 1.50) - P(z < -1.50)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(z < 1.50) ≈ 0.9332\nP(z < -1.50) ≈ 0.0668\n\nNow, subtract the probabilities:\n\nP(-1.50 < z < 1.50) = 0.9332 - 0.0668\nP(-1.50 < z < 1.50) ≈ 0.8664\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample mean weight of the 36 apples will be between 145 and 155 grams is approximately 0.8664 or 86.64%."
