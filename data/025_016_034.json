    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to birational geometry:\n\nSuppose we have the algebraic variety defined by the equation  $x^2+y^2+z^2-3=0$ in $\\mathbb{C}^3$. Let $C$ be the curve on this variety defined by the equations $x=y$ and $z=0$. Show that $C$ is birational to the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1$, and find an explicit birational map from $C$ to $\\mathbb{A}^1$.",
    "message_2": "To show that $C$ is birational to the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1$, we need to find a rational map between them. Let's first find the parametrization of the curve $C$.\n\nSince $C$ is defined by the equations $x=y$ and $z=0$, we can substitute these into the equation of the algebraic variety:\n\n$x^2 + x^2 + 0^2 - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2x^2 = 3 \\Rightarrow x^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow, let $t = x = y$. Then, $t^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$, and the curve $C$ can be parametrized as $(t, t, 0)$, where $t^2 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's find a birational map from $C$ to $\\mathbb{A}^1$. We can define the map $\\phi: C \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb{A}^1$ as follows:\n\n$\\phi(t, t, 0) = t$.\n\nThis map is well-defined since $t$ is uniquely determined by the point $(t, t, 0)$ on the curve $C$. Moreover, it is a rational map since it is given by a rational function of the coordinates.\n\nNow, let's find the inverse map $\\phi^{-1}: \\mathbb{A}^1 \\dashrightarrow C$. Given a point $t \\in \\mathbb{A}^1$, we can define the inverse map as follows:\n\n$\\phi^{-1}(t) = (t, t, 0)$.\n\nThis map is well-defined since the point $(t, t, 0)$ on the curve $C$ is uniquely determined by the parameter $t$. Moreover, it is a rational map since it is given by a rational function of the coordinates.\n\nThus, we have found an explicit birational map between the curve $C$ and the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1$. The curve $C$ is birational to the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1$."
