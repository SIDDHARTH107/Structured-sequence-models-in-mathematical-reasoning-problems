    "message_2": "First, let's find the slope of the line connecting the points (1, 6) and (3, 12).\n\nThe slope formula is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Plugging in the given points, we get:\n\nm = (12 - 6) / (3 - 1) = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 1, which represents the slope of the tangent line at any point x.\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4\n\nWe want to find a point c in the interval (1, 3) such that the slope of the tangent line of f(x) at x = c is equal to the slope of the line connecting the points (1, 6) and (3, 12), which we found to be 3.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation:\n\n3x^2 - 4 = 3\n\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get:\n\n3x^2 = 7\n\nDividing by 3, we get:\n\nx^2 = 7/3\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nx = ±√(7/3)\n\nSince we are looking for a point c in the interval (1, 3), we can ignore the negative solution and take the positive one:\n\nc = √(7/3)\n\nSo, the point c in the interval (1, 3) such that the slope of the line connecting the points (1, 6) and (3, 12) is equal to the slope of the tangent line of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 1 at x = c is c = √(7/3)."
