    "message_2": "1. A x (B ∪ {6})'\nFirst, we need to find the union of B and {6}. B ∪ {6} = {4, 5, 6}.\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∪ {6}). A x (B ∪ {6}) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)}.\nFinally, we need to find the complement of A x (B ∪ {6}). Since the complement is not well-defined without a universal set, we cannot find the exact complement. However, we can say that the complement will be all the ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ (B ∪ {6})' (i.e., b is not in {4, 5, 6}).\n\n2. (A x B)' ∩ (A x {5})'\nFirst, we need to find the Cartesian product of A and B. A x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\nNow, we need to find the complement of A x B. As mentioned earlier, the complement is not well-defined without a universal set. However, we can say that the complement will be all the ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B' (i.e., b is not in {4, 5}).\n\nNext, we need to find the Cartesian product of A and {5}. A x {5} = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)}.\nNow, we need to find the complement of A x {5}. Again, the complement is not well-defined without a universal set. However, we can say that the complement will be all the ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ {5}' (i.e., b is not 5).\n\nFinally, we need to find the intersection of (A x B)' and (A x {5})'. Since both complements are not well-defined without a universal set, we cannot find the exact intersection. However, we can say that the intersection will be all the ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A, b ∈ B', and b ∈ {5}' (i.e., b is not in {4, 5})."
