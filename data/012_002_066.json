    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this graph G, we can color the vertices as follows:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1)\n3. Color vertex 3 with color C (since it's adjacent to both vertex 1 and 2)\n4. Color vertex 4 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 and 3)\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertex 2 and 3)\n\nSo, we have used 3 colors (A, B, and C) to color the vertices of the graph G without any two adjacent vertices having the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
