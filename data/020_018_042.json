The following table denotes the payoffs for each player:\n\n|        | Player 1 | Player 2 |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| A      | 5        | 2        |\n| B      | 3        | 3        |\n| C      | 2        | 5        |\n\nIf Player 1 chooses strategy A, what should Player 2 choose to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "If Player 1 chooses strategy A, we can look at the payoffs for Player 2 in the table:\n\n|        | Player 1 | Player 2 |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| A      | 5        | 2        |\n\nIn this case, Player 2's payoff is 2 when they choose strategy A. However, we need to compare this with the payoffs for Player 2 when they choose strategies B and C:\n\n|        | Player 1 | Player 2 |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| B      | 3        | 3        |\n| C      | 2        | 5        |\n\nIf Player 2 chooses strategy B, their payoff is 3. If they choose strategy C, their payoff is 5.\n\nTo maximize their payoff, Player 2 should choose strategy C, as it gives them the highest payoff of 5 when Player 1 chooses strategy A."
