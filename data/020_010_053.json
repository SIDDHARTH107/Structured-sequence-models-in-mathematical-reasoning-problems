    "message_1": "Suppose there are two factories A and B that produce a certain product. The demand for the product is uncertain, but it is known that the demand will be between 1000 to 2000 units with equal probability. Factory A is reliable and can produce 700 to 1200 units with equal probability, whereas factory B is less reliable and can only produce 500 to 800 units with equal probability. The cost of production at factory A is $1000 per unit, whereas at factory B it is $1200 per unit. The manufacturer wants to determine the optimal number of units to produce at each factory such that the total cost is minimized under the worst-case demand scenario. What is the optimal production strategy that minimizes the total cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost under the worst-case demand scenario, we need to consider the maximum possible demand (2000 units) and the production capacities of both factories. We will aim to produce as many units as possible in factory A due to its lower cost per unit and then produce the remaining units in factory B.\n\nLet x be the number of units produced in factory A and y be the number of units produced in factory B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y >= 2000 (to meet the maximum demand)\n2. 700 <= x <= 1200 (factory A's production capacity)\n3. 500 <= y <= 800 (factory B's production capacity)\n\nOur objective is to minimize the total cost, which is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 1000x + 1200y\n\nSince factory A has a lower cost per unit, we should maximize its production capacity. Therefore, we set x = 1200. Now we need to find the minimum value of y that satisfies the constraints:\n\n1200 + y >= 2000\ny >= 800\n\nSo, y = 800.\n\nThus, the optimal production strategy is to produce 1200 units in factory A and 800 units in factory B. This will minimize the total cost under the worst-case demand scenario:\n\nCost = 1000(1200) + 1200(800) = $1,200,000 + $960,000 = $2,160,000."
