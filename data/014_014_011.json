    "message_2": "First, we need to create a 5x5 matrix using the key \"HELLO\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as it is combined with I in the Playfair cipher). We will remove duplicate letters from the key and then fill in the matrix.\n\nKey without duplicates: \"HELO\"\nMatrix:\nH E L O A\nB C D F G\nI K M N P\nQ R S T U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we will encrypt the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher technique. We will break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters) and apply the rules of the cipher. If a pair has the same letter, we will insert an 'X' between them. In this case, we don't need to do that.\n\nDigraphs: MA TH EM AT IC SX\n\nApplying the Playfair cipher rules:\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if needed).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if needed).\n3. If neither of the above applies, form a rectangle with the two letters and replace them with the letters on the same row but at the other pair of corners.\n\nMA -> PK\nTH -> YD\nEM -> OA\nAT -> TS\nIC -> FN\nSX -> UV\n\nEncrypted message: PKYDOATSFNUV"
