    "message_2": "To identify outliers using the interquartile range method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order.\n2. Find the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2, or median), and the third quartile (Q3).\n3. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n4. Find the lower and upper bounds for outliers by calculating Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR, respectively.\n5. Identify any data points that fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound as outliers.\n\nLet's follow these steps for the given data set:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order:\n77, 78, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 96\n\n2. Find Q1, Q2, and Q3:\n- Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the overall median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the lower half is 77, 78, 84, 85, and 87. The median of this lower half is 84.\n- Q2 is the overall median. In this case, it's the average of 87 and 89, which is 88.\n- Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the overall median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the upper half is 89, 90, 91, 92, and 96. The median of this upper half is 90.\n\n3. Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 90 - 84 = 6\n\n4. Find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n- Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 84 - 1.5 * 6 = 84 - 9 = 75\n- Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 90 + 1.5 * 6 = 90 + 9 = 99\n\n5. Identify any outliers:\nAll the data points fall within the lower and upper bounds (75 and 99), so there are no outliers in this data set."
