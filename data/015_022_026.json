    "message_1": "What is the value of the Mackey-Glass equation at time t=200, given that the parameters are β=0.2, γ=0.1, τ=17, and the initial value x(0)-1.5? The Mackey-Glass equation is given by dx/dt = β*x(t-τ)/(1+x(t-τ)^γ) - γ*x(t). Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation, we need to numerically integrate the differential equation using a numerical method such as the Euler method or the Runge-Kutta method. However, this requires programming skills and cannot be done by simply providing an analytical solution.\n\nI recommend using a programming language like Python or MATLAB to implement a numerical method and solve the equation for the given parameters and initial conditions."
