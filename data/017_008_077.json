    "message_1": "What are the different possible multiplication tables for a group of order 8, and which of those tables correspond to the cyclic group C8, quaternion group Q8, and dihedral group D4 respectively?",
    "message_2": "There are three main groups of order 8: the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, and the dihedral group D4. Each group has a distinct multiplication table based on its group operation.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8:\n\nThe cyclic group C8 has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} with addition modulo 8 as the group operation. The multiplication table for C8 is:\n\n```\n+ | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n--+---------------\n0 | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n1 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0\n2 | 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1\n3 | 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2\n4 | 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3\n5 | 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4\n6 | 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5\n7 | 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n```\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8:\n\nThe quaternion group Q8 has elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with quaternion multiplication as the group operation. The multiplication table for Q8 is:\n\n```\n*  |  1 -1  i -i  j -j  k -k\n---+------------------------\n1  |  1 -1  i -i  j -j  k -k\n-1 | -1  1 -i  i -j  j -k  k\ni  |  i -i -1  1  k -k -j  j\n-i | -i  i  1 -1 -k  k  j -j\nj  |  j -j -k  k -1  1  i -i\n-j | -j  j  k -k  1 -1 -i  i\nk  |  k -k  j -j -i  i -1  1\n-k | -k  k -j  j  i -i  1 -1\n```\n\n3. Dihedral group D4:\n\nThe dihedral group D4 has elements {r0, r1, r2, r3, s0, s1, s2, s3} with the operation being a combination of rotation and reflection. The multiplication table for D4 is:\n\n```\n*  | r0 r1 r2 r3 s0 s1 s2 s3\n---+------------------------\nr0 | r0 r1 r2 r3 s0 s1 s2 s3\nr1 | r1 r2 r3 r0 s1 s2 s3 s0\nr2 | r2 r3 r0 r1 s2 s3 s0 s1\nr3 | r3 r0 r1 r2 s3 s0 s1 s2\ns0 | s0 s1 s2 s3 r0 r1 r2 r3\ns1 | s1 s2 s3 s0 r1 r2 r3 r0\ns2 | s2 s3 s0 s1 r2 r3 r0 r1\ns3 | s3 s0 s1 s2 r3 r0 r1 r2\n```\n\nIn summary, the multiplication tables for the cyclic group C8, quaternion group Q8, and dihedral group D4 are distinct and based on their respective group operations."
