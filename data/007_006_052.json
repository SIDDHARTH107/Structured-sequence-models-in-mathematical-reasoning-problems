The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide the larger number (300) by the smaller number (120) and find the remainder.\n300 รท 120 = 2 with a remainder of 60.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, divide the previous divisor (120) by the remainder from the previous step (60).\n120 รท 60 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder (60) is the GCD of 120 and 300.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 120 and 300 is 60."
