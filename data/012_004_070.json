    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (A, C, 1), (B, D, 2), (A, B, 3), (C, D, 4), (B, C, 5), (A, D, 6)\n\nNow, let's build the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge (A, C, 1) to the tree.\n2. Add edge (B, D, 2) to the tree.\n3. Add edge (A, B, 3) to the tree. Adding this edge does not form a cycle.\n\nAt this point, we have connected all the vertices, so we have found the minimum spanning tree.\n\nMinimum spanning tree edges: (A, C, 1), (B, D, 2), (A, B, 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of the minimum spanning tree:\n\nTotal weight = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the minimum spanning tree has a total weight of 6."
