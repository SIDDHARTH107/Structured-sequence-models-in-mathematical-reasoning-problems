    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of these groups. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are 1, 3, and 9. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal. If there are 3 or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, they may or may not be normal.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are 1 and 4. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal. If there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, they may or may not be normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups based on the normality of their Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal: In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, so the structure is Z_8 x Z_9. This gives us one non-isomorphic group.\n\n2. Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, but Sylow 3-subgroup is not: In this case, we have a semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_9. There are two possible actions of Z_9 on Z_8, which give us two non-isomorphic groups: Z_8 x Z_9 (which we already counted) and Z_8 ⋊ Z_9.\n\n3. Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, but Sylow 2-subgroup is not: In this case, we have a semi-direct product of Z_9 and Z_8. There are four possible actions of Z_8 on Z_9, which give us four non-isomorphic groups: Z_9 x Z_8 (which is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_9), Z_9 ⋊ Z_2 x Z_4, Z_9 ⋊ Z_4 x Z_2, and Z_9 ⋊ Z_8.\n\n4. Neither Sylow 2-subgroup nor Sylow 3-subgroup is normal: In this case, we have a semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_9 with non-normal Sylow subgroups. However, this case does not yield any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. Z_8 x Z_9\n2. Z_8 ⋊ Z_9\n3. Z_9 ⋊ Z_2 x Z_4\n4. Z_9 ⋊ Z_4 x Z_2\n5. Z_9 ⋊ Z_8"
