    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative ring R = K<x,y>/(yx-xy-1), where K is a commutative field. Let M be the R-module given by M = R/(x,y)^2, where (x,y)^2 is the ideal generated by x and y in R. Determine the dimension of the vector space Ext_R^1(M,M), where Ext_R^1 denotes the first Ext group.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of Ext_R^1(M,M), we will use the long exact sequence of Ext groups associated with a short exact sequence of R-modules. Consider the short exact sequence of R-modules:\n\n0 → R → R → M → 0,\n\nwhere the first map is the multiplication by (x,y)^2 and the second map is the quotient map.\n\nApplying the functor Hom_R(-,M) to this sequence, we get the long exact sequence of Ext groups:\n\n0 → Hom_R(M,M) → Hom_R(R,M) → Hom_R(R,M) → Ext_R^1(M,M) → Ext_R^1(R,M) → Ext_R^1(R,M) → ...\n\nSince R is a free module, we have Ext_R^1(R,M) = 0. Thus, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → Hom_R(M,M) → Hom_R(R,M) → Hom_R(R,M) → Ext_R^1(M,M) → 0.\n\nThis implies that Ext_R^1(M,M) is isomorphic to the cokernel of the map Hom_R(R,M) → Hom_R(R,M). Let's analyze the maps involved.\n\nThe R-module M is isomorphic to R/(x,y)^2 as an R-module, so Hom_R(R,M) is isomorphic to M as a K-vector space. Since M = R/(x,y)^2, as a K-vector space, M has basis {1, x, y}. Therefore, Hom_R(R,M) has dimension 3 as a K-vector space.\n\nNow, consider the map φ: Hom_R(R,M) → Hom_R(R,M) induced by the multiplication by (x,y)^2. This map sends an R-linear map f to the map g = f∘(x,y)^2. Since (x,y)^2 annihilates M, the image of φ consists of the zero map only. Therefore, the cokernel of φ is isomorphic to Hom_R(R,M) itself, which has dimension 3 as a K-vector space.\n\nHence, the dimension of the vector space Ext_R^1(M,M) is 3."
