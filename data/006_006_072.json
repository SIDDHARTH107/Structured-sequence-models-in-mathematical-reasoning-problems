    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw shooting percentage of 80%. If she takes 10 free throws in a game, what is the probability that she will make exactly 8 of them?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of making exactly k free throws\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of free throws (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful free throws (8 in this case)\n- p is the probability of making a single free throw (0.8 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 8), which is the number of ways to choose 8 successful free throws out of 10:\n\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!)\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * 2!)\nC(10, 8) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(10, 8) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\nC(10, 8) = 45\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=8) = C(10, 8) * 0.8^8 * (1-0.8)^(10-8)\nP(X=8) = 45 * 0.8^8 * 0.2^2\nP(X=8) = 45 * 0.16777216 * 0.04\nP(X=8) â‰ˆ 0.301989888\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 8 out of 10 free throws is approximately 30.2%."
