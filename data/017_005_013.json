    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 27 = 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which must be normal. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since |P| = 3^3 = 27, we have P = G, and G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nNow, suppose n_3 = 27. Then there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the classification of groups of order p^2, P is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. In either case, P has a normal subgroup Q of order 3.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the size of the orbit of P under this action is equal to the index of the stabilizer of P in G, which is [G : N_G(P)]. Since the size of the orbit divides the order of G, we have [G : N_G(P)] = 3.\n\nLet R be a subgroup of G such that |R| = 3. Then |G| = |N_G(P)||R|, so |N_G(P)| = 9. Since |N_G(P)| > |P|, we have P ⊆ N_G(P). Thus, N_G(P) is a group of order 9 containing P as a normal subgroup.\n\nNow, let H = P × R. Since P and R are normal subgroups of N_G(P) and their intersection is trivial, H is a subgroup of N_G(P) of order 27. Furthermore, since P is normal in N_G(P) and R is normal in G, H is normal in G. Since |H| = |G|, we have H = G, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
