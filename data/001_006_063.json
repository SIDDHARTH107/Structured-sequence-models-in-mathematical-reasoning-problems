    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 4x - 3, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3.\n\nx = -4 / (2 * 2)\nx = -4 / 4\nx = -1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(-1)² + 4(-1) - 3\ny = 2(1) - 4 - 3\ny = 2 - 4 - 3\ny = -5\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (-1, -5).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = -1\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² + 4x - 3\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4² - 4(2)(-3))) / (2 * 2)\n\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-4 ± √40) / 4\n\nx = (-4 ± 2√10) / 4\n\nThe x-intercepts are:\n\nx = (-4 + 2√10) / 4 and x = (-4 - 2√10) / 4\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The vertex is (-1, -5).\n- The axis of symmetry is x = -1.\n- The x-intercepts are x = (-4 + 2√10) / 4 and x = (-4 - 2√10) / 4."
