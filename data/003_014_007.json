    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and vertical shift of the function f(x) = 3cos(2x + π/6), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a cosine function: A*cos(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, the function is f(x) = 3cos(2x + π/6). Comparing this to the general form, we can see that:\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the cosine function. In this case, A = 3. Therefore, the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient inside the cosine function, which is B. The period is given by the formula (2π)/B. In our case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π)/2 = π. Therefore, the period is π.\n\nVertical Shift (D): In our function, there is no constant added or subtracted outside the cosine function, which means there is no vertical shift. Therefore, the vertical shift is 0.\n\nSo, for the function f(x) = 3cos(2x + π/6), the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and the vertical shift is 0."
