    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we first write the given system in matrix form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & -4 \\\\\n6 & -8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n8 \\\\\n16\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve the system. First, we form the augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n3 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n6 & -8 & 16\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nWe can simplify the second row by dividing it by 2:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n3 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n3 & -4 & 8\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we subtract the first row from the second row to eliminate the x term in the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n3 & -4 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second equation is 0 = 0, which means the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, and we cannot find a unique solution for x and y."
