    "message_2": "In the context of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau threefolds, the Hodge numbers (h11 and h21) of the original threefold and its mirror partner are interchanged. So, if the original Calabi-Yau threefold has Hodge numbers h11 = 100 and h21 = 2, then its mirror symmetric Calabi-Yau threefold will have Hodge numbers h11 = 2 and h21 = 100."
