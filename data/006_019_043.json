    "message_1": "In a certain country, the probability of a voter voting for the incumbent political party is 0.6, while the probability of voting for the opposition party is 0.4. Find the probability that out of a random sample of 9 voters, at least 5 will vote for the incumbent party.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 out of 9 voters will vote for the incumbent party, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (voters), k is the number of successes (votes for the incumbent party), p is the probability of success (0.6), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 5 voters voting for the incumbent party, we need to calculate the probabilities for 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 voters and sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9)\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(9, 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^4 = 126 * 0.07776 * 0.0256 = 0.250822656\nP(X = 6) = C(9, 6) * 0.6^6 * 0.4^3 = 84 * 0.046656 * 0.064 = 0.200658944\nP(X = 7) = C(9, 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^2 = 36 * 0.0279936 * 0.16 = 0.151559424\nP(X = 8) = C(9, 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^1 = 9 * 0.01679616 * 0.4 = 0.060466176\nP(X = 9) = C(9, 9) * 0.6^9 * 0.4^0 = 1 * 0.010077696 * 1 = 0.010077696\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 0.250822656 + 0.200658944 + 0.151559424 + 0.060466176 + 0.010077696 = 0.673584896\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 out of 9 voters will vote for the incumbent party is approximately 0.674 or 67.4%."
