Find d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1, i.e., (5 * d) % 192 = 1.\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\n\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for e = 5 and φ(n) = 192:\n\ngcd(5, 192) = 1 = 5 * 77 - 192 * 2\n\nFrom the equation above, we can see that the modular multiplicative inverse of 5 (mod 192) is 77.\n\nSo, the private key d is 77."
