    "message_2": "The complement of a set X, denoted as X', contains all the elements that are not in X. Since X contains all the elements from 1 to 10, its complement would be an empty set, as there are no elements left outside of X in this context.\n\nThe intersection between a set and its complement is always an empty set, as they do not share any common elements by definition. Therefore, the intersection between X and its complement is the empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
