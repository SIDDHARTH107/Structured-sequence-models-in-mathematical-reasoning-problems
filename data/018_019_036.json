    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ C, we first need to find the symmetric difference of A △ B, and then find the symmetric difference of the result with C.\n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFirst, let's find A △ B:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA △ B = {1, 4} (We remove the elements in the intersection from the union)\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) △ C:\n\n(A △ B) = {1, 4}\nC = {2, 4, 5}\n\n(A △ B) ∪ C = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n(A △ B) ∩ C = {4}\n\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 2, 5} (We remove the elements in the intersection from the union)\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ C is {1, 2, 5}."
