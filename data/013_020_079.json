    "message_2": "Let's denote the average of all the numbers chosen by A. The target number to be closest to is (2/3)A. Since there are 100 players, including you, the sum of all the numbers chosen is 100A.\n\nNow, let's consider the other 99 players. Let B be the average of their chosen numbers. The sum of their numbers is 99B. Since your number is also included in the total sum, we can write:\n\n100A = 99B + your number\n\nNow, we want to choose a number that is closest to (2/3)A. Let's express A in terms of B:\n\nA = (99B + your number) / 100\n\nNow, we want to find (2/3)A:\n\n(2/3)A = (2/3)((99B + your number) / 100)\n\nSince we want to maximize our chances of winning, we should assume that the other players are also rational and will choose numbers that are close to (2/3) of the average of their numbers. So, we can assume that A ≈ B. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(2/3)A ≈ (2/3)((99(2/3)A + your number) / 100)\n\nSolving for your number:\n\nyour number ≈ (2/3)(100A - 99(2/3)A)\n\nyour number ≈ (2/3)(100A - 66A)\n\nyour number ≈ (2/3)(34A)\n\nSince A is the average of all the numbers chosen, it must be between 0 and 100. Therefore, the maximum value of A is 100. In this case:\n\nyour number ≈ (2/3)(34 * 100)\n\nyour number ≈ (2/3)(3400)\n\nyour number ≈ 2266.67\n\nHowever, since the number must be between 0 and 100, we should choose the maximum possible number, which is 100.\n\nSo, to maximize your chances of winning, you should choose the number 100."
