    "message_2": "The survey indicates that 600 out of 1000 voters, or 60%, plan to vote for Candidate A. With a margin of error of +/- 3%, the actual percentage of voters who plan to vote for Candidate A could be anywhere between 57% and 63%.\n\nIn order for Candidate A to win the election, they need to receive more than 50% of the votes. Since the lower end of the margin of error (57%) is greater than 50%, it is very likely that Candidate A will win the election. However, we cannot provide an exact probability without more information about the distribution of voter preferences within the margin of error."
