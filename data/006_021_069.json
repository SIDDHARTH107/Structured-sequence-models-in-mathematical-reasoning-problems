    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes (hurricanes) in n trials (years), C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success (hurricane), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no hurricane).\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (years), p = 0.2 (probability of a hurricane), and we want to find the probability of at least 2 hurricanes, so we need to calculate the probabilities for x = 2, 3, 4, and 5 and then add them up.\n\nP(at least 2 hurricanes) = P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probabilities for each value of x:\n\nP(2) = C(5, 2) * 0.2^2 * 0.8^3 = 10 * 0.04 * 0.512 = 0.2048\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * 0.2^3 * 0.8^2 = 10 * 0.008 * 0.64 = 0.0512\nP(4) = C(5, 4) * 0.2^4 * 0.8^1 = 5 * 0.0016 * 0.8 = 0.0064\nP(5) = C(5, 5) * 0.2^5 * 0.8^0 = 1 * 0.00032 * 1 = 0.00032\n\nNow, add up the probabilities:\n\nP(at least 2 hurricanes) = 0.2048 + 0.0512 + 0.0064 + 0.00032 = 0.26272\n\nSo, the probability that a hurricane will occur in the region in at least 2 out of the next 5 years is approximately 0.26272 or 26.27%."
