The edges connecting them have capacities as follows:\n\n- A to B: 5 units\n- A to C: 3 units\n- B to C: 4 units\n- B to D: 2 units\n- C to D: 5 units\n\nIf we want to send as many units of flow as possible from A to D, what is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent through the network?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from A to D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the capacities of the edges until there are no more augmenting paths available.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from A to D: A -> B -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 units (the edge B to D). We update the capacities as follows:\n\n- A to B: 3 units (5 - 2)\n- A to C: 3 units\n- B to C: 4 units\n- B to D: 0 units (2 - 2)\n- C to D: 5 units\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: A -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 3 units (the edge A to C). We update the capacities as follows:\n\n- A to B: 3 units\n- A to C: 0 units (3 - 3)\n- B to C: 4 units\n- B to D: 0 units\n- C to D: 2 units (5 - 3)\n\n3. Finally, we find one more augmenting path: A -> B -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 units (the edge B to C). We update the capacities as follows:\n\n- A to B: 1 unit (3 - 2)\n- A to C: 0 units\n- B to C: 2 units (4 - 2)\n- B to D: 0 units\n- C to D: 0 units (2 - 2)\n\nNow, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows along the paths we found: 2 units (A -> B -> D) + 3 units (A -> C -> D) + 2 units (A -> B -> C -> D) = 7 units. So, the maximum flow that can be sent through the network from A to D is 7 units."
