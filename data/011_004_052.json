    "message_1": "A clothing store offers a promotion where customers can buy 5 shirts, 3 pants, and 2 hats as a bundle for a discounted price. If there are 10 different shirt designs, 5 different pant designs, and 4 different hat designs available, how many unique bundles can be created under the promotion? (Hint: use multinomial coefficients formula)",
    "message_2": "To find the number of unique bundles that can be created under the promotion, we can use the combination formula for each type of clothing item and then multiply the results together.\n\nFor shirts, there are 10 different designs, and customers can choose 5 of them. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 10 and k = 5.\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 10! / (5!5!) = 252\n\nFor pants, there are 5 different designs, and customers can choose 3 of them. In this case, n = 5 and k = 3.\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = 10\n\nFor hats, there are 4 different designs, and customers can choose 2 of them. In this case, n = 4 and k = 2.\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = 6\n\nNow, we multiply the number of combinations for each type of clothing item together to find the total number of unique bundles:\n\nTotal Bundles = 252 (shirts) * 10 (pants) * 6 (hats) = 15120\n\nSo, there are 15,120 unique bundles that can be created under the promotion."
