    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we should first find the largest side, which is 7. The smallest angle will be opposite to the largest side. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle opposite the largest side.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, a = 4, b = 6, and c = 7. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for angle C:\n\n7² = 4² + 6² - 2(4)(6) * cos(C)\n49 = 16 + 36 - 48 * cos(C)\n49 = 52 - 48 * cos(C)\n\nNow, isolate cos(C):\n\n-3 = -48 * cos(C)\ncos(C) = 3/48\ncos(C) = 1/16\n\nNow, find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 1/16:\n\nC = arccos(1/16)\nC ≈ 86.41°\n\nNow that we have the largest angle, we can use the Law of Sines to find the smallest angle. The Law of Sines states:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe can use the side lengths and the angle we found to solve for the smallest angle, which is opposite the smallest side (side a = 4):\n\n4/sin(A) = 7/sin(86.41°)\n\nNow, isolate sin(A):\n\nsin(A) = 4 * sin(86.41°) / 7\nsin(A) ≈ 0.5636\n\nNow, find the angle A by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.5636:\n\nA = arcsin(0.5636)\nA ≈ 34.48°\n\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 34.48°."
