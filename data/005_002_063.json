    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the product, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the Z-table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\n\nGiven the information provided:\nSample Mean = 980 hours\nStandard Deviation = 50 hours\nSample Size = 25 products\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 50 / √25 = 50 / 5 = 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 980 ± (1.96 * 10)\n\nLower Limit = 980 - (1.96 * 10) = 980 - 19.6 = 960.4 hours\nUpper Limit = 980 + (1.96 * 10) = 980 + 19.6 = 999.6 hours\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the product is (960.4 hours, 999.6 hours)."
