    "message_2": "To perform AES-128 encryption, we first need to convert the plaintext message and the key into hexadecimal format. Then, we can use a library or tool that supports AES-128 encryption to obtain the ciphertext.\n\n1. Convert the plaintext message \"MATH\" and the key \"SECRETKEY\" into hexadecimal format:\n   MATH -> 4D 41 54 48\n   SECRETKEY -> 53 45 43 52 45 54 4B 45 59\n\nHowever, AES-128 requires a 128-bit (16-byte) key, and our key \"SECRETKEY\" is only 9 bytes long. We need to pad the key with null bytes (00) to make it 16 bytes long:\n   SECRETKEY (padded) -> 53 45 43 52 45 54 4B 45 59 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n2. Perform AES-128 encryption using a library or tool:\n   Plaintext: 4D 41 54 48\n   Key: 53 45 43 52 45 54 4B 45 59 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\nSince I am an AI language model, I cannot execute code or use external libraries. However, you can use a programming language like Python with a library like PyCryptodome to perform the encryption. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nfrom Crypto.Util.Padding import pad\n\nplaintext = bytes.fromhex(\"4D 41 54 48\")\nkey = bytes.fromhex(\"53 45 43 52 45 54 4B 45 59 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\")\n\ncipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)\nciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(plaintext, 16))\n\nprint(ciphertext.hex().upper())\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the resulting ciphertext in hexadecimal form. Note that the actual encryption process involves multiple steps like key expansion, substitution, permutation, and mixing of data, which are not shown here."
