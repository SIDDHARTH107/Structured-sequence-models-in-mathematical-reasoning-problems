    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector a onto vector b, we can use the formula:\n\nproj_b(a) = (a · b / ||b||^2) * b\n\nwhere a · b is the dot product of a and b, and ||b|| is the magnitude of b.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of a and b:\n\na · b = (3 * -1) + (4 * 2) = -3 + 8 = 5\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of b:\n\n||b|| = √((-1)^2 + 2^2) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNow, let's square the magnitude of b:\n\n||b||^2 = (√5)^2 = 5\n\nNow, we can find the projection of a onto b:\n\nproj_b(a) = (a · b / ||b||^2) * b = (5 / 5) * (-1, 2) = (1) * (-1, 2) = (-1, 2)\n\nSo, the projection of vector a onto vector b is (-1, 2)."
