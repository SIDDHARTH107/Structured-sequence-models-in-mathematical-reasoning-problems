    "message_2": "To find the expected value of $X_t$, we can use the property of linearity of expectation. Let $E[X_t]$ denote the expected value of $X_t$. We can rewrite the given stochastic differential equation as:\n\n$$ dX_t = X_t dt + \\sqrt{t} dW_t $$\n\nTaking the expectation on both sides, we get:\n\n$$ E[dX_t] = E[X_t dt] + E[\\sqrt{t} dW_t] $$\n\nSince the expected value of the Wiener process increment $dW_t$ is zero, we have:\n\n$$ E[dX_t] = E[X_t dt] $$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$ \\frac{dE[X_t]}{dt} = E[X_t] $$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $E[X_t]$. To solve this ODE, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\n$$ \\mu(t) = e^{\\int dt} = e^t $$\n\nMultiplying both sides of the ODE by the integrating factor, we get:\n\n$$ e^t \\frac{dE[X_t]}{dt} = e^t E[X_t] $$\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the derivative of the product $e^t E[X_t]$ with respect to $t$. So, we can write:\n\n$$ \\frac{d(e^t E[X_t])}{dt} = e^t E[X_t] $$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$$ e^t E[X_t] = \\int e^t E[X_t] dt + C $$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To find the value of $C$, we use the initial condition $X_0 = 1$. At $t = 0$, we have:\n\n$$ e^0 E[X_0] = 1 + C \\Rightarrow C = 0 $$\n\nSo, the solution for the expected value of $X_t$ is:\n\n$$ E[X_t] = e^{-t} (e^t E[X_0]) = e^{-t} (e^t \\cdot 1) = 1 $$\n\nThus, the expected value of $X_t$ is 1 for any $t \\geq 0$."
