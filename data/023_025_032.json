    "message_1": "A cylindrical rod of radius $r=2$ cm and length $L=10$ cm has a thermal conductivity function $k(r) = 0.1r^3$ W/mK where $r$ is the distance from the center of the rod. If the ends are maintained at temperatures of $100$ and $50$ degrees Celsius, use the Fourier transform to find the temperature as a function of position $T(r)$ within the rod.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution within the rod, we need to solve the heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation for a cylindrical rod is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(rk(r)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right) = 0$$\n\nwhere $T(r)$ is the temperature as a function of the radial position $r$, and $k(r) = 0.1r^3$ is the thermal conductivity function. \n\nFirst, we plug in the thermal conductivity function into the heat equation:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r(0.1r^3)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right) = 0$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(0.1r^4\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right) = 0$$\n\nIntegrate with respect to $r$:\n\n$$0.1r^4\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} = C_1$$\n\nDivide by $0.1r^4$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} = \\frac{C_1}{0.1r^4}$$\n\nIntegrate with respect to $r$ again:\n\n$$T(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{0.3r^3} + C_2$$\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions. At $r = 0$, the temperature is finite, so $C_1 = 0$. At $r = 2$ cm, the temperature is $T_1 = 100$ degrees Celsius, and at $r = 10$ cm, the temperature is $T_2 = 50$ degrees Celsius. \n\nSince $C_1 = 0$, the temperature function simplifies to:\n\n$$T(r) = C_2$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n$$T(2) = 100 = C_2$$\n$$T(10) = 50 = C_2$$\n\nHowever, this system of equations has no solution, which indicates that the problem is ill-posed. The temperature function cannot be determined using the given information and the heat equation in its current form. The problem may need to be reformulated or additional information may be required to find a solution."
