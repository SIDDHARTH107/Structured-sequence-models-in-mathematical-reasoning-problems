    "message_2": "The quotient rule states that if we have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nIn this case, we have g(x) = 2x - 5 and h(x) = 6x + 1. First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(2x - 5)/dx = 2\nh'(x) = d(6x + 1)/dx = 6\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = (2 * (6x + 1) - (2x - 5) * 6) / (6x + 1)^2\nf'(x) = (12x + 2 - 12x + 30) / (6x + 1)^2\nf'(x) = (32) / (6x + 1)^2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (2x−5)/(6x+1) is f'(x) = 32 / (6x + 1)^2."
