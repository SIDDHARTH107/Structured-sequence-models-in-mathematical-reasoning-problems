    "message_2": "To determine the number of runs required to cover all possible combinations of levels for each factor in an orthogonal array, you can use the formula:\n\nNumber of runs = L^(k)\n\nwhere L is the number of levels for each factor and k is the number of factors.\n\nIn this case, there are 2 levels for each factor and 4 factors:\n\nNumber of runs = 2^(4) = 16\n\nSo, 16 runs are required to cover all the possible combinations of levels for each factor in this experiment."
