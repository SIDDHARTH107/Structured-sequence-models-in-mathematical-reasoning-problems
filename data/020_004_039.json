    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question:\n\nA company needs to maximize its profits given the following constraints: \n\n- They have a total of 150 units of resource A and 200 units of resource B available.\n- Producing one unit of product X requires 3 units of resource A and 4 units of resource B.\n- Producing one unit of product Y requires 2 units of resource A and 5 units of resource B.\n- The profit per unit of product X is $10 and the profit per unit of product Y is $12.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn, and how many units of each product should they produce to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 12y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 150 (resource A constraint)\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 200 (resource B constraint)\n3. x ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product X)\n4. y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product Y)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 150 -> y = (150 - 3x) / 2\n2. 4x + 5y = 200 -> y = (200 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe intersection points of these lines with the axes are:\n- (0, 75) for line 1 with the y-axis\n- (50, 0) for line 1 with the x-axis\n- (0, 40) for line 2 with the y-axis\n- (50, 0) for line 2 with the x-axis\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (50, 0), and (30, 20). We'll now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 12(40) = $480\n3. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 12(0) = $500\n4. P(30, 20) = 10(30) + 12(20) = $540\n\nThe maximum profit is $540, which is achieved when the company produces 30 units of product X and 20 units of product Y."
