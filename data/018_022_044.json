    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A ⊖ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ⊖ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ⊖ B) × B and B × (A ⊖ B).\n\n(A ⊖ B) × B = {1, 4} × {2, 3, 4} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nB × (A ⊖ B) = {2, 3, 4} × {1, 4} = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A ⊖ B) × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\nB × (A ⊖ B) = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nThis proves that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
