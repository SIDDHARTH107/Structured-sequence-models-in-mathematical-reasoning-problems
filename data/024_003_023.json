    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 at point P(1, -1, 2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's find the tangent plane at point P. We need the gradient of f(x, y):\n\n∇f(x, y) = (df/dx, df/dy) = (2x, 2y)\n\nAt point P(1, -1, 2), the gradient is:\n\n∇f(1, -1) = (2, -2)\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane at P is given by:\n\nN = (2, -2, -1)\n\nNow, let's find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂x> = <(1, 0, 2x), (1, 0, 2x)> = 1 + 4x^2\nF = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂y> = <(1, 0, 2x), (0, 1, 2y)> = 4xy\nG = <∂r/∂y, ∂r/∂y> = <(0, 1, 2y), (0, 1, 2y)> = 1 + 4y^2\n\nAt point P(1, -1, 2), we have:\n\nE(P) = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF(P) = 4(1)(-1) = -4\nG(P) = 1 + 4(-1)^2 = 5\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <∂²r/∂x², N> = <(0, 0, 2), (2, -2, -1)> = -2\nM = <∂²r/∂x∂y, N> = <(0, 0, 0), (2, -2, -1)> = 0\nN = <∂²r/∂y², N> = <(0, 0, 2), (2, -2, -1)> = -2\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (-2 * -2 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - (-4)^2) = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at point P(1, -1, 2) is K = 4/9."
