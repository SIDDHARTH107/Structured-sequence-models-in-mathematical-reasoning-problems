    "message_2": "To determine the electromagnetic field at a distance of 5mm from the center of the coaxial cable, we will first find the magnetic field (B) and the electric field (E) using Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform.\n\n1. Magnetic Field (B):\n\nThe magnetic field (B) in a coaxial cable can be found using Ampere's law:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current (2A), and r is the distance from the center of the cable (5mm = 0.005m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2A) / (2 * π * 0.005m)\nB = (8π × 10^(-7) Tm) / 0.01m\nB = 8 × 10^(-4) T\n\n2. Electric Field (E):\n\nThe electric field (E) in a coaxial cable can be found using Gauss's law:\n\nE = (λ / (2 * π * ε₀ * r))\n\nwhere E is the electric field, λ is the linear charge density (charge per unit length), ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/Nm²), and r is the distance from the center of the cable (0.005m).\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear charge density (λ). Since the cable is carrying a current (I) of 2A and has a length (L) of 10m, we can find the total charge (Q) in the cable:\n\nQ = I * L = 2A * 10m = 20 C\n\nNow, we can find the linear charge density (λ):\n\nλ = Q / L = 20 C / 10m = 2 C/m\n\nNow, we can find the electric field (E):\n\nE = (2 C/m) / (2 * π * 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/Nm² * 0.005m)\nE = 1 / (π * 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/Nm² * 0.005m)\nE ≈ 7.2 × 10^7 N/C\n\nNow, we have both the magnetic field (B) and the electric field (E) at a distance of 5mm from the center of the coaxial cable:\n\nB = 8 × 10^(-4) T\nE ≈ 7.2 × 10^7 N/C"
