    "message_2": "Given that A implies B, we can represent this as $A \\Rightarrow B$. In Intuitionistic logic, if there is a proof of A, then there must be a proof of B as well. \n\nNow, we want to find the smallest possible value of the logical connective \"or\" that makes the proposition \"either A or B holds\" true. In other words, we want to find the minimum requirement for $A \\lor B$ to be true.\n\nSince $A \\Rightarrow B$, if there is a proof of A, then there is also a proof of B. In this case, $A \\lor B$ is true because there is a proof of A. On the other hand, if there is a proof of B, then $A \\lor B$ is also true. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the logical connective \"or\" that makes the proposition \"either A or B holds\" true in the context of Intuitionistic logic is when there is a proof of either A or B. In this case, the minimum requirement for $A \\lor B$ to be true is the existence of a proof of either A or B."
