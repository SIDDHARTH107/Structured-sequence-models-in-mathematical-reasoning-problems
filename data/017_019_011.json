    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. We will find the Sylow p-subgroups for p = 2 and p = 3.\n\nFor p = 2, the Sylow 2-subgroups have order 4. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nFor p = 3, the Sylow 3-subgroups have order 9. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possible value for n_3 is 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups of order 36 based on the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If both the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup are normal, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups. Since there are two possible isomorphism types for groups of order 4 (C4 and C2 × C2) and two possible isomorphism types for groups of order 9 (C9 and C3 × C3), there are 2 * 2 = 4 possible isomorphism types for the direct product. These are C4 × C9 (which is isomorphic to C36), C4 × (C3 × C3), C2 × C2 × C9, and C2 × C2 × (C3 × C3). The last three groups are non-abelian.\n\n2. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal and the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, then we have a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are 2 possible isomorphism types for groups of order 4 (C4 and C2 × C2) and two possible isomorphism types for groups of order 9 (C9 and C3 × C3). For each pair of isomorphism types, there are two possible actions of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup (trivial and non-trivial), giving a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible semi-direct products. However, some of these semi-direct products are isomorphic to the direct products in case 1, so we need to subtract those. We are left with 8 - 4 = 4 non-isomorphic semi-direct products, all of which are non-abelian.\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 4 = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 36. These groups are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3 (which is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × (C3 × C3)), or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 36 (C4 × (C3 × C3), C2 × C2 × C9, and the four non-isomorphic semi-direct products)."
