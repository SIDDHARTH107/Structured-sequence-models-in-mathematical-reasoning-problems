    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 120: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order: n(G) = (p^(k+1) - 1)/(p - 1), where p is a prime factor and k is its exponent in the prime factorization.\n3. Calculate the number of groups for each prime factor:\n   - For 2^3: n(G) = (2^(3+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (16 - 1)/1 = 15\n   - For 3: n(G) = (3^(1+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4\n   - For 5: n(G) = (5^(1+1) - 1)/(5 - 1) = (25 - 1)/4 = 6\n4. Multiply the number of groups for each prime factor: 15 * 4 * 6 = 360\n\nTherefore, there are 360 non-isomorphic groups of order 120 among the 488 possible groups."
