    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of vertices (v) and edges (e) in the graph G. The degree sequence is (2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4), which means there are 6 vertices in the graph. To find the number of edges, we can sum the degrees of all vertices and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice):\n\n(2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9\n\nSo, there are 9 edges in the graph G.\n\nNow, let's use Euler's formula to find the number of faces (f):\n\nv - e + f = 2\n6 - 9 + f = 2\nf = 5\n\nSince we have found the number of faces, we can now check if the graph G satisfies the inequality for planar graphs, which is:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nSubstituting the values of v and e, we get:\n\n9 ≤ 3(6) - 6\n9 ≤ 18 - 6\n9 ≤ 12\n\nThe inequality holds true, so the graph G could be planar. However, we need to check if there are any subgraphs that violate Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nIn this case, the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph G is 4, which means it cannot contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5, as K5 requires vertices with a degree of at least 5. Additionally, the graph G does not have enough vertices to form a K3,3 subgraph.\n\nTherefore, the graph G does not violate Kuratowski's theorem, and we can conclude that the graph G is planar."
