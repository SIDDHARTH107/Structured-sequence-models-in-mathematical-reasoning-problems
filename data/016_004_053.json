    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a complex and intricate fractal, and calculating the area of its complement (the region outside the set) is not a straightforward task. However, we can approximate the area of the largest connected component in the complement of the Mandelbrot set within a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\nThe area of the circle with radius 2 is given by A = πr^2, where r = 2. So, A = π(2^2) = 4π ≈ 12.57 square units.\n\nThe largest connected component in the complement of the Mandelbrot set is known as the \"exterior cardioid.\" It is the region outside the main cardioid shape of the Mandelbrot set. The area of the main cardioid can be approximated as 5/8π ≈ 1.96 square units.\n\nTo find the area of the largest connected component in the complement of the Mandelbrot set, we can subtract the area of the main cardioid from the area of the circle:\n\nArea of largest connected component ≈ 12.57 - 1.96 ≈ 10.61 square units.\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area is approximately 10.61 square units."
