    "message_1": "In a group of 5 volunteers, each volunteer can either work alone or contribute towards hiring a professional fundraiser. If all 5 volunteers choose to work alone, they will each raise $50 for a total of $250. If the volunteers pool their resources to hire a fundraiser, it will cost $200, and they will raise a total of $800. However, if less than all 5 volunteers contribute towards hiring a fundraiser, they will receive less reward. What is the best strategy for each volunteer? What strategy will result in the highest reward for the group as a whole?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the different scenarios to determine the best strategy for each volunteer and the group as a whole.\n\n1. All volunteers work alone:\nIn this case, each volunteer raises $50, and the total amount raised is 5 * $50 = $250.\n\n2. All volunteers contribute towards hiring a fundraiser:\nThe cost of hiring the fundraiser is $200, and the total amount raised is $800. After paying the fundraiser, the net amount raised is $800 - $200 = $600. In this case, each volunteer would receive an equal share of the net amount, which is $600 / 5 = $120 per volunteer.\n\n3. Less than 5 volunteers contribute towards hiring a fundraiser:\nLet's denote the number of volunteers contributing towards hiring the fundraiser as 'x'. The cost of hiring the fundraiser remains $200, and the remaining volunteers (5 - x) work alone, raising $50 each. The total amount raised by the group would be less than $800, so let's denote it as $800 - k, where k is the reduction in the amount raised due to less than 5 volunteers contributing.\n\nIn this scenario, the net amount raised is ($800 - k) - $200 = $600 - k. The x volunteers who contributed towards hiring the fundraiser would share this net amount equally, receiving ($600 - k) / x per volunteer. The remaining (5 - x) volunteers would still receive $50 each.\n\nTo maximize the reward for the group as a whole, we want to maximize the net amount raised, which is $600 - k. Since k is the reduction in the amount raised due to less than 5 volunteers contributing, the maximum net amount raised will be achieved when all 5 volunteers contribute towards hiring the fundraiser.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy for each volunteer and the group as a whole is for all 5 volunteers to contribute towards hiring the professional fundraiser. This will result in a net amount raised of $600, with each volunteer receiving $120."
