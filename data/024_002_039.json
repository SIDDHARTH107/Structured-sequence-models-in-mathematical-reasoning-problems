    "message_2": "A geodesic path on the surface of a sphere is the shortest path between two points on the sphere, which is a segment of a great circle. In this case, we are looking for the geodesic path on the surface of a hemisphere with a radius of 5 units, starting from the North Pole (0, 0, 5) and ending at the Equator (5, 0, 0).\n\nTo find the length of the geodesic path, we can use the spherical distance formula. First, we need to find the angular separation between the two points. Since the North Pole is at the top of the hemisphere and the point on the Equator is at the edge of the hemisphere, the angular separation is 90 degrees or π/2 radians.\n\nNow we can use the spherical distance formula:\n\nd = r * θ\n\nwhere d is the distance, r is the radius of the sphere (5 units), and θ is the angular separation in radians (π/2).\n\nd = 5 * (π/2)\n\nd = (5π)/2\n\nSo, the length of the geodesic path is (5π)/2 units."
