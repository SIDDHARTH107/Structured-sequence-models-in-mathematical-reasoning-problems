(Hint: Use the formula for calculating the Hausdorff dimension.) \n\n[Insert image here with the Vicsek fractal with caption: The self-similarity of the Vicsek fractal.]",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, each line segment is replaced with four segments of length 1/3. Therefore, N = 4 and s = 3.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.2619."
