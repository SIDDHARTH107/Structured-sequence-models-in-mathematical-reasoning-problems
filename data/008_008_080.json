Supplier A can provide 3 casual shirts and 1 formal shirt per day at a cost of $10 per casual shirt and $12 per formal shirt. Supplier B can provide 2 casual shirts and 2 formal shirts per day at a cost of $8 per casual shirt and $14 per formal shirt. The store wants to determine how many shirts to order from each supplier in order to minimize their daily cost while meeting their demand of at least 10 casual shirts and 5 formal shirts per day.\n\nUsing matrix methods, what is the optimal number of shirts the store should order from each supplier and what is the minimum cost the store will need to pay?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of shirts ordered from Supplier A and y be the number of shirts ordered from Supplier B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Casual shirts: 3x + 2y ≥ 10\n2. Formal shirts: x + 2y ≥ 5\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the cost, which is given by:\n\nCost = 10(3x) + 12(x) + 8(2y) + 14(2y) = 30x + 44y\n\nNow, we will solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≥ 10\n   y ≥ (10 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. x + 2y ≥ 5\n   y ≥ (5 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of these inequalities. We will now find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the boundary lines:\n\n1. y = (10 - 3x) / 2\n2. y = (5 - x) / 2\n\nSolving for x in equation 2:\n\nx = 5 - 2y\n\nSubstituting this into equation 1:\n\ny = (10 - 3(5 - 2y)) / 2\n\nSolving for y:\n\n2y = 10 - 15 + 6y\n-4y = -5\ny = 5/4\n\nNow, substituting y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 5 - 2(5/4)\nx = 5 - 5/2\nx = 5/2\n\nSo, the optimal solution is x = 5/2 and y = 5/4. However, since we cannot order a fraction of a shirt, we will round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the store should order 3 shirts from Supplier A and 2 shirts from Supplier B.\n\nNow, we will calculate the minimum cost:\n\nCost = 30(3) + 44(2) = 90 + 88 = $178\n\nThe minimum cost the store will need to pay is $178 per day."
