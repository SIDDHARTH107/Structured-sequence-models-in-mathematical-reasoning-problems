In this case, we will use the function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the integer we want to factor (901,481,051).\n\n2. Initialize two variables, x and y, with an arbitrary starting value, usually 2. So, x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n\n   a. Update x using the function: x = f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N\n   b. Update y twice using the function: y = f(f(y)) = f(y^2 + 1) mod N\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and N.\n\nNow, let's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = (2^2 + 1) mod 901,481,051 = 5\ny = ((2^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 901,481,051 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 901,481,051) = GCD(21, 901,481,051) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = (5^2 + 1) mod 901,481,051 = 26\ny = ((26^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 901,481,051 = 677\nGCD(|26 - 677|, 901,481,051) = GCD(651, 901,481,051) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = (26^2 + 1) mod 901,481,051 = 677\ny = ((677^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 901,481,051 = 72,889,934\nGCD(|677 - 72,889,934|, 901,481,051) = GCD(72,889,257, 901,481,051) = 13\n\nWe have found a non-trivial factor: 13."
