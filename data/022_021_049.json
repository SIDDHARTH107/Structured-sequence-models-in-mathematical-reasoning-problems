    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the given function, we will use the linearity property of Laplace transforms and the known Laplace transforms of cosine, sine, and t functions.\n\nThe linearity property states that the Laplace transform of a linear combination of functions is equal to the linear combination of their Laplace transforms. In other words, if F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t) and G(s) is the Laplace transform of g(t), then:\n\nL{a*f(t) + b*g(t)} = a*F(s) + b*G(s)\n\nNow, let's find the Laplace transforms of the individual functions:\n\n1. L{cos(2t)}: The Laplace transform of cos(at) is given by s/(s^2 + a^2). So, for cos(2t), we have:\n\nL{cos(2t)} = s/(s^2 + 2^2) = s/(s^2 + 4)\n\n2. L{sin(5t)}: The Laplace transform of sin(at) is given by a/(s^2 + a^2). So, for sin(5t), we have:\n\nL{sin(5t)} = 5/(s^2 + 5^2) = 5/(s^2 + 25)\n\n3. L{2t}: The Laplace transform of at is given by a!/(s^(a+1)). So, for 2t, we have:\n\nL{2t} = 2!/(s^(2+1)) = 2/(s^3)\n\nNow, we can use the linearity property to find the Laplace transform of the given function:\n\nL{5*cos(2t) - 3*sin(5t) + 2t} = 5*L{cos(2t)} - 3*L{sin(5t)} + L{2t}\n\n= 5*(s/(s^2 + 4)) - 3*(5/(s^2 + 25)) + 2/(s^3)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the given function is:\n\nF(s) = 5s/(s^2 + 4) - 15/(s^2 + 25) + 2/(s^3)"
