    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the equation y - 2x = 5 in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\ny - 2x = 5\ny = 2x + 5\n\nNow we can graph the line y = 2x + 5 on the coordinate plane. The y-intercept is 5, so we can start by plotting the point (0, 5). The slope is 2, which means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. From the y-intercept, we can move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up to find another point on the line, (1, 7). We can draw a line through these two points to represent the equation y = 2x + 5.\n\nSince the inequality is y - 2x > 5, we want to shade the region above the line. This means that for any point in the shaded region, the y-coordinate will be greater than the corresponding y-coordinate on the line.\n\nNow let's check if the point (3, 7) is a solution to the inequality y - 2x > 5.\n\nSubstitute the coordinates of the point into the inequality:\n\n7 - 2(3) > 5\n7 - 6 > 5\n1 > 5\n\nThis statement is false, so the point (3, 7) is not a solution to the inequality y - 2x > 5."
