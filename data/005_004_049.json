The battery life (in hours) of each smartphone was recorded. Conduct an ANOVA test at a 5% level of significance to determine if there is a significant difference in the average battery life of the three types of smartphones. \n\nHere are the battery life values for each type of smartphone:\n\nType A: 6, 7, 9, 8, 6, 7, 10 \nType B: 5, 8, 7, 6, 9, 7 \nType C: 11, 10, 8, 12, 14, 10, 9",
    "message_2": "To conduct an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following values:\n\n1. Mean battery life for each type of smartphone\n2. Grand mean (overall mean battery life)\n3. Sum of squares within groups (SSW)\n4. Sum of squares between groups (SSB)\n5. Mean square within groups (MSW)\n6. Mean square between groups (MSB)\n7. F statistic\n8. Compare F statistic with the critical value from the F-distribution table\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean battery life for each type of smartphone:\n\nType A mean: (6+7+9+8+6+7+10)/7 = 7.57\nType B mean: (5+8+7+6+9+7)/6 = 7\nType C mean: (11+10+8+12+14+10+9)/7 = 10.57\n\nStep 2: Calculate the grand mean:\n\nGrand mean: (7.57*7 + 7*6 + 10.57*7)/20 = 8.39\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW):\n\nSSW = Σ(Σ(x_ij - mean_i)^2) for each group i and observation j\nSSW = (1.57^2 + 0.57^2 + 1.43^2 + 0.43^2 + 1.57^2 + 0.57^2 + 2.43^2) + (2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 0^2) + (3.43^2 + 2.43^2 + 0.43^2 + 4.43^2 + 6.43^2 + 2.43^2 + 1.43^2)\nSSW = 30.86\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB):\n\nSSB = Σn_i*(mean_i - grand_mean)^2 for each group i\nSSB = 7*(7.57-8.39)^2 + 6*(7-8.39)^2 + 7*(10.57-8.39)^2\nSSB = 38.14\n\nStep 5: Calculate the mean square within groups (MSW):\n\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of groups)\nMSW = 30.86 / (20 - 3)\nMSW = 2.05\n\nStep 6: Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB):\n\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1)\nMSB = 38.14 / (3 - 1)\nMSB = 19.07\n\nStep 7: Calculate the F statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW\nF = 19.07 / 2.05\nF = 9.3\n\nStep 8: Compare F statistic with the critical value from the F-distribution table:\n\nAt a 5% level of significance, with degrees of freedom (numerator) = 2 and degrees of freedom (denominator) = 17, the critical value from the F-distribution table is approximately 3.59.\n\nSince the calculated F statistic (9.3) is greater than the critical value (3.59), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in the average battery life of the three types of smartphones at a 5% level of significance."
