    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. At each iteration, the number of small triangular faces increases.\n\nAt the first iteration (level 1), there are 4 small tetrahedra, each with 4 triangular faces, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 triangular faces.\n\nAt each subsequent iteration, the number of triangular faces is multiplied by 4. So, to find the total number of triangular faces at the sixth level, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of faces at level n = 16 * 4^(n-1)\n\nFor the sixth level (n = 6):\n\nNumber of faces at level 6 = 16 * 4^(6-1) = 16 * 4^5 = 16 * 1024 = 16,384\n\nSo, there are 16,384 small triangular faces in the construction of the Sierpinski tetrahedron when it has been iterated to the sixth level."
