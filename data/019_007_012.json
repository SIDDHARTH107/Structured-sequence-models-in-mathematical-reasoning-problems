    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Non-monotonic logic is a branch of mathematical logic concerned with reasoning that does not satisfy the monotonicity property. It's more about the patterns of thought and inference used in reasoning. Therefore, it's difficult to provide a precise numerical problem for the student to solve. However, I can give you an example of a non-monotonic inference.\n\nStatement 1: All birds can fly.\nStatement 2: Penguins are birds.\nInference: Penguins can fly.\n\nThis inference is non-monotonic because it depends on additional assumptions about penguins, such as geographic location and physical health, which are not explicitly stated in the initial statements.",
    "message_2": "You are correct that non-monotonic logic deals with reasoning that does not satisfy the monotonicity property. However, the example you provided is not an example of non-monotonic inference. Instead, it is an example of a syllogism with a false premise. Let me provide a proper example of non-monotonic reasoning.\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\nStatement 1: If it is raining, John will carry an umbrella.\nStatement 2: It is not raining.\n\nFrom these statements, we can make a non-monotonic inference:\n\nInference: John is not carrying an umbrella.\n\nThis inference is non-monotonic because if we add more information to the statements, the inference may no longer hold. For example, if we add the following statement:\n\nStatement 3: John always carries an umbrella on Tuesdays.\n\nIf it is a Tuesday, then the inference \"John is not carrying an umbrella\" may no longer be true, even though it is still not raining. This demonstrates the non-monotonic nature of the reasoning, as adding more information can change the conclusions drawn."
