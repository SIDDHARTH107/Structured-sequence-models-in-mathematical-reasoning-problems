    "message_1": "A company produces large containers that are supposed to weigh exactly 1000 kg. The production manager suspects that there may be some outliers in the data, and wants to detect them using the upper fence rule. After randomly selecting 10 containers and weighing them, the weights in kg were as follows:\n\n981, 999, 1000, 1005, 1010, 1035, 1036, 1045, 1050, 1060\n\nDetermine the upper fence and identify any outliers in the data set.",
    "message_2": "To determine the upper fence and identify any outliers, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), and the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n981, 999, 1000, 1005, 1010, 1035, 1036, 1045, 1050, 1060\n\nStep 2: Find Q1 (the median of the lower half) and Q3 (the median of the upper half):\nThere are 10 data points, so the lower half consists of the first 5 data points and the upper half consists of the last 5 data points.\n\nLower half: 981, 999, 1000, 1005, 1010\nUpper half: 1035, 1036, 1045, 1050, 1060\n\nQ1 = Median of lower half = 1000\nQ3 = Median of upper half = 1045\n\nStep 3: Calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 1045 - 1000 = 45\n\nStep 4: Determine the upper fence:\nUpper fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 1045 + 1.5 * 45 = 1045 + 67.5 = 1112.5\n\nStep 5: Identify any outliers:\nAny data point greater than the upper fence is considered an outlier. In this case, there are no data points greater than 1112.5, so there are no outliers in the data set."
