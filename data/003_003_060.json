    "message_2": "To find the exact values of sine and cosine of 30 degrees using the unit circle, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\n30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the sine and cosine values for π/6 radians (30 degrees). On the unit circle, the sine value corresponds to the y-coordinate, and the cosine value corresponds to the x-coordinate.\n\nFor a 30-degree angle (π/6 radians), the coordinates on the unit circle are:\n\nx = cos(π/6) = √3/2\ny = sin(π/6) = 1/2\n\nSo, the exact values of sine and cosine of the angle 30 degrees are:\n\nsin(30°) = sin(π/6) = 1/2\ncos(30°) = cos(π/6) = √3/2"
