    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between years of experience and salary, we will first need to find the mean and standard deviation of both variables. Then, we will use the formula:\n\nr = Σ((x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / (n * σ_x * σ_y)\n\nwhere x and y are the individual data points, x̄ and ȳ are the means of x and y, σ_x and σ_y are the standard deviations of x and y, and n is the number of data points.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean and standard deviation of years of experience (x) and salary (y):\n\nYears of Experience (x): 2, 5, 3, 7, 9, 4, 6\nSalary (y): 28, 36, 32, 45, 52, 34, 41\n\nMean of x (x̄) = (2 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 4 + 6) / 7 = 36 / 7 ≈ 5.14\nMean of y (ȳ) = (28 + 36 + 32 + 45 + 52 + 34 + 41) / 7 = 268 / 7 ≈ 38.29\n\nNow, let's find the standard deviation of x (σ_x) and y (σ_y):\n\nσ_x = √[(Σ(x - x̄)²) / n] = √[((2 - 5.14)² + (5 - 5.14)² + (3 - 5.14)² + (7 - 5.14)² + (9 - 5.14)² + (4 - 5.14)² + (6 - 5.14)²) / 7] ≈ 2.19\n\nσ_y = √[(Σ(y - ȳ)²) / n] = √[((28 - 38.29)² + (36 - 38.29)² + (32 - 38.29)² + (45 - 38.29)² + (52 - 38.29)² + (34 - 38.29)² + (41 - 38.29)²) / 7] ≈ 7.61\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = Σ((x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / (n * σ_x * σ_y) = ((2 - 5.14)(28 - 38.29) + (5 - 5.14)(36 - 38.29) + (3 - 5.14)(32 - 38.29) + (7 - 5.14)(45 - 38.29) + (9 - 5.14)(52 - 38.29) + (4 - 5.14)(34 - 38.29) + (6 - 5.14)(41 - 38.29)) / (7 * 2.19 * 7.61) ≈ 0.98\n\nThe correlation coefficient between years of experience and salary is approximately 0.98, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables."
