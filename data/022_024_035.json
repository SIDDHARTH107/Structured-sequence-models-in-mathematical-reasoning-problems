    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation u(t, x) = a∙e^(-kx^2)e^(-kt) with a = 2, k = 0.1, t = 4, and x = 3i, we will plug in the given values into the equation:\n\nu(4, 3i) = 2∙e^(-0.1(3i)^2)e^(-0.1∙4)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (3i)^2:\n\n(3i)^2 = (3i)(3i) = 9i^2 = 9(-1) = -9\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\n\nu(4, 3i) = 2∙e^(-0.1(-9))e^(-0.4)\n\nNext, calculate the exponents:\n\ne^(-0.1(-9)) = e^(0.9)\ne^(-0.4) = e^(-0.4)\n\nNow, plug these values back into the equation:\n\nu(4, 3i) = 2∙e^(0.9)e^(-0.4)\n\nFinally, multiply the exponential terms and the constant:\n\nu(4, 3i) = 2∙(e^(0.9)∙e^(-0.4))\n\nu(4, 3i) = 2∙e^(0.9 - 0.4)\n\nu(4, 3i) = 2∙e^(0.5)\n\nThis is the solution to the heat equation with the given values."
