    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the heat equation, u_t = k u_xx, where u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, k is a constant, and subscripts denote differentiation. Suppose the temperature is initially given by u(x,0) = 2x - x^2, for 0 <= x <= 2. What is the temperature distribution u(x,t) for all subsequent times t > 0, subject to the boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(2,t) = 0? Take k = 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = k X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by kX(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nT'(t) + λT(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = X(2) = 0. The eigenvalues are λ_n = (nπ/2)^2 for n = 1, 2, 3, ... and the corresponding eigenfunctions are X_n(x) = sin(nπx/2).\n\nNow, solve the second equation for T(t):\n\nT'(t) + λT(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n\nNow, we have the solutions X_n(x) and T_n(t) for each eigenvalue λ_n. The general solution is a linear combination of these:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(nπx/2) e^(-(nπ/2)^2 t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = 2x - x^2:\n\n2x - x^2 = Σ [A_n sin(nπx/2)]\n\nWe can find A_n by taking the inner product of both sides with sin(mπx/2) and integrating from 0 to 2:\n\n∫(2x - x^2)sin(mπx/2) dx = A_m\n\nCalculate the integral:\n\nA_m = (8/((mπ)^2))(-1)^((m-1)/2) for m odd, and 0 for m even.\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution u(x, t) is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(8/((mπ)^2))(-1)^((m-1)/2) sin(mπx/2) e^(-(mπ/2)^2 t)] for odd m"
