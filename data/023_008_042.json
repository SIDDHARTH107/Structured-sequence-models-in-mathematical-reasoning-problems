    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of a non-periodic function, we need to extend the function to make it periodic. Let's extend the function f(x) = x^2 + 5 with a period of 4 (from -2 to 2). Now, we can find the Fourier coefficients using the Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period (L = 2 in our case), and a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients. We can find these coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)dx] from -L to L\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\n\nLet's find the first three Fourier coefficients (a_0, a_1, and b_1):\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 + 5 dx] from -2 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)x^3 + 5x] from -2 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)(8) + 5(2) - (1/3)(-8) - 5(-2)]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(16/3) + 10 + (16/3) + 10]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(32/3) + 20]\na_0 = (1/2) * (104/3)\na_0 = 52/3\n\nNow, let's find a_1:\n\na_1 = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 + 5) * cos(πx/2) dx] from -2 to 2\n\nSince the function is even, we can simplify the integral:\n\na_1 = (1) * ∫[(x^2 + 5) * cos(πx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a simple closed-form solution. We can either use numerical methods to approximate the value or leave it as an integral expression.\n\nNow, let's find b_1:\n\nb_1 = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 + 5) * sin(πx/2) dx] from -2 to 2\n\nSince the function is even and sin is odd, the integral will be zero:\n\nb_1 = 0\n\nSo, the first three Fourier coefficients are:\n\na_0 = 52/3\na_1 = ∫[(x^2 + 5) * cos(πx/2) dx] from 0 to 2 (or a numerical approximation)\nb_1 = 0"
