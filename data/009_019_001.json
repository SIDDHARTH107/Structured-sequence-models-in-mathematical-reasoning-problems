    "message_2": "To find the expected value and standard deviation of X_t at time t = 5 years, we can use the properties of geometric Brownian motion. For a geometric Brownian motion, the expected value and variance of the logarithm of the process at time t are given by:\n\nE[ln(X_t)] = ln(X_0) + (mu - sigma^2/2) * t\nVar[ln(X_t)] = sigma^2 * t\n\nwhere X_0 is the initial value, mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, and t is the time.\n\nGiven the values X_0 = 100, mu = 0.05, sigma = 0.2, and t = 5 years, we can calculate the expected value and variance of ln(X_t):\n\nE[ln(X_t)] = ln(100) + (0.05 - 0.2^2/2) * 5\nE[ln(X_t)] = ln(100) + (0.05 - 0.02) * 5\nE[ln(X_t)] = ln(100) + 0.03 * 5\nE[ln(X_t)] = 4.60517 + 0.15\nE[ln(X_t)] = 4.75517\n\nVar[ln(X_t)] = 0.2^2 * 5\nVar[ln(X_t)] = 0.04 * 5\nVar[ln(X_t)] = 0.2\n\nNow, we can find the expected value and standard deviation of X_t:\n\nE[X_t] = exp(E[ln(X_t)]) = exp(4.75517) ≈ 116.232\nSD[X_t] = exp(E[ln(X_t)]) * sqrt(exp(Var[ln(X_t)]) - 1) = 116.232 * sqrt(exp(0.2) - 1) ≈ 116.232 * 0.2212 ≈ 25.724\n\nSo, the expected value of X_t at time t = 5 years is approximately 116.232, and the standard deviation is approximately 25.724."
