    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 3 -2  1 |\n    | 1  5 -3 |\n    | 2 -1  4 |\n\nB = | 1 |\n    | 7 |\n    | 6 |\n\nNow, let's perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\n1. Initialize L and U matrices:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 0  1  0 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nU = | 3 -2  1 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n\n2. Perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix and update the L matrix accordingly:\n\nFirst, eliminate the 1 in the (2,1) position:\n\nL21 = A21 / U11 = 1 / 3\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 1/3  1  0 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nU = | 3 -2  1 |\n    | 0  5.6667 -2.6667 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n\nNext, eliminate the 2 in the (3,1) position:\n\nL31 = A31 / U11 = 2 / 3\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 1/3  1  0 |\n    | 2/3  0  1 |\n\nU = | 3 -2  1 |\n    | 0  5.6667 -2.6667 |\n    | 0  0  3.6667 |\n\nNow we have the L and U matrices. Next, we need to solve the following two systems of linear equations:\n\nL * Y = B\nU * X = Y\n\nFirst, solve for Y in L * Y = B:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | Y1 |   | 1 |\n| 1/3  1  0 | | Y2 | = | 7 |\n| 2/3  0  1 | | Y3 |   | 6 |\n\nY1 = 1\nY2 = 7 - 1/3 * Y1 = 6\nY3 = 6 - 2/3 * Y1 = 4\n\nY = | 1 |\n    | 6 |\n    | 4 |\n\nNext, solve for X in U * X = Y:\n\n| 3 -2  1 | | X1 |   | 1 |\n| 0  5.6667 -2.6667 | | X2 | = | 6 |\n| 0  0  3.6667 | | X3 |   | 4 |\n\nX3 = 4 / 3.6667 ≈ 1.0909\nX2 = (6 + 2.6667 * X3) / 5.6667 ≈ 1.5455\nX1 = (1 + 2 * X2 - X3) / 3 ≈ 0.3636\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nX = | 0.3636 |\n    | 1.5455 |\n    | 1.0909 |"
