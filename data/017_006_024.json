    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 35 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, we have that the prime factorization of the order of G is 5^1 * 7^1. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup in G.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup of G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 = 1.\n2. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). Thus, n_7 = 1.\n\nSince n_5 = n_7 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Now, we have |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, which are both prime numbers. Therefore, P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nSince P and Q are normal subgroups of G, we can consider their direct product P x Q. The order of P x Q is |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35, which is the same as the order of G. Moreover, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element, because the orders of P and Q are coprime.\n\nBy the recognition theorem for direct products, we have that G is isomorphic to P x Q, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nNow, we need to consider the case where G is cyclic. If G is cyclic, then G has an element of order 35. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 35, which is also a direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 35 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
