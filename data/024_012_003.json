    "message_2": "The Hodge star operator is used to map a differential form to another differential form of complementary degree on a manifold. In this case, we have a 3-dimensional manifold and the given differential form is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$, which is a 3-form.\n\nIn a 3-dimensional manifold, the Hodge star operator maps a 3-form to a 0-form (scalar function). The Hodge star of a 3-form $\\omega$ is defined as:\n\n$*\\omega = \\frac{1}{3!} \\omega_{ijk} \\epsilon^{ijk}$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{ijk}$ are the components of the 3-form and $\\epsilon^{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol. In our case, the 3-form is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$, so the components are:\n\n$\\omega_{123} = 1$\n\nand all other components are zero. Therefore, the Hodge star of the given 3-form is:\n\n$*(dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) = \\frac{1}{3!} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\epsilon^{123} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nSo, the Hodge star operator on the 3-dimensional manifold with differential form $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ at the point $(1,2,3)$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$."
