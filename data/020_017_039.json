    "message_1": "A cable company is installing a fiber optic network in a small town. The cost of laying down the cable is proportional to the distance traveled. The company has the option to lay the cable directly from point A to point B or to go around an obstacle at point P.\n\n- The distance between A and P is 12 km.\n- The distance between P and B is 8 km.\n- The straight-line distance between A and B is 15 km.\n\nIf the cost per km of laying the cable is $2000, what is the minimum cost for the cable company to install the network? Should the company go directly from A to B or go around the obstacle at P?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the cost of laying the cable directly from A to B:\n\nCost_direct = Distance_AB * Cost_per_km\nCost_direct = 15 km * $2000/km\nCost_direct = $30,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of laying the cable around the obstacle at P:\n\nCost_around = (Distance_AP + Distance_PB) * Cost_per_km\nCost_around = (12 km + 8 km) * $2000/km\nCost_around = 20 km * $2000/km\nCost_around = $40,000\n\nComparing the two costs:\n\nCost_direct = $30,000\nCost_around = $40,000\n\nThe minimum cost for the cable company to install the network is $30,000, and they should go directly from A to B."
