    "message_1": "A population of 1000 rabbits on an island is growing at a rate proportional to the population (i.e. the growth rate is 0.2 rabbits per day per rabbit). Assuming that there are no predators and no limitations of resources, find the population function P(t) that describes the number of rabbits on the island after t days, and compute how many rabbits will be on the island after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "To find the population function P(t), we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(rt)\n\nwhere P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, t is the time in days, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, P0 = 1000 rabbits, r = 0.2 rabbits per day per rabbit, and we want to find P(t) after t days.\n\nP(t) = 1000 * e^(0.2t)\n\nNow, we want to find the population after 10 days (t = 10):\n\nP(10) = 1000 * e^(0.2 * 10)\nP(10) = 1000 * e^2\nP(10) ≈ 1000 * 7.38906\nP(10) ≈ 7389.06\n\nAfter 10 days, there will be approximately 7389 rabbits on the island."
