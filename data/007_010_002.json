    "message_2": "Let's call the number x. We are given the following information:\n\n1. x is divisible by 3, so x = 3a for some integer a.\n2. x leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so x = 5b + 1 for some integer b.\n3. x is divisible by 7, so x = 7c for some integer c.\n4. x leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 9, so x = 9d + 4 for some integer d.\n\nFrom (1) and (3), we know that x is divisible by both 3 and 7, so it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is 21. Thus, x = 21e for some integer e.\n\nNow, we can rewrite (2) and (4) using this information:\n\n5. 21e = 5b + 1\n6. 21e = 9d + 4\n\nLet's solve equation (5) for b:\n\n5b = 21e - 1\nb = (21e - 1)/5\n\nSince b is an integer, (21e - 1) must be divisible by 5. We can find the smallest positive integer e that satisfies this condition by testing e = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor e = 1: 21(1) - 1 = 20, which is divisible by 5.\nFor e = 2: 21(2) - 1 = 41, which is not divisible by 5.\nFor e = 3: 21(3) - 1 = 62, which is not divisible by 5.\nFor e = 4: 21(4) - 1 = 83, which is not divisible by 5.\nFor e = 5: 21(5) - 1 = 104, which is divisible by 5.\n\nSo the smallest positive integer e that satisfies equation (5) is e = 1 or e = 5. Let's check if any of these values also satisfy equation (6):\n\nFor e = 1: 21(1) = 21, which is not in the form 9d + 4.\nFor e = 5: 21(5) = 105, which is in the form 9d + 4 (with d = 11).\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of x is 21 * 5 = 105."
