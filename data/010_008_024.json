    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nFrom the given simplicial complex, we can count:\n\nV = 5 (vertices: A, B, C, D, E)\nE = 7 (edges: AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, CD)\nF = 4 (faces: ABC, ACD, ADE, outer face)\n\nNow, we can calculate the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = V - E + F = 5 - 7 + 4 = 2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this simplicial complex is 2."
