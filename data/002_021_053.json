    "message_2": "To find the area of the slice of pizza, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then find the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 45-degree central angle.\n\n1. Find the area of the entire pizza:\nThe pizza has a diameter of 20 inches, so its radius is 10 inches (half of the diameter). The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA = π(10)^2\nA = 100π square inches\n\n2. Find the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 45-degree central angle:\nA full circle has 360 degrees, so the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 45-degree central angle is 45/360.\n\nFraction = 45/360 = 1/8\n\n3. Find the area of the slice of pizza:\nMultiply the area of the entire pizza by the fraction corresponding to the 45-degree central angle.\n\nArea of slice = (1/8) * 100π\nArea of slice = 12.5π square inches\n\n4. Round the answer to the nearest hundredth:\nArea of slice ≈ 12.5 * 3.14\nArea of slice ≈ 39.25 square inches\n\nSo, the area of the slice of pizza with a 45-degree central angle is approximately 39.25 square inches."
