    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the leadership hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves in nature. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the GWO algorithm to minimize the given function f(x) within the given constraints.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the GWO parameters\n- Population size (n) = 20 (number of wolves)\n- Maximum iterations (Max_iter) = 100\n- Lower and upper bounds of x: lb = -5, ub = 5\n\nStep 2: Initialize the positions of the grey wolves\nGenerate 20 random positions for the wolves within the given constraints.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each wolf\nCalculate the fitness value (f(x)) for each wolf using the given function.\n\nStep 4: Update the alpha, beta, and delta wolves\nFind the three best wolves (lowest fitness values) and label them as alpha, beta, and delta.\n\nStep 5: Update the position of each wolf\nFor each iteration, update the position of each wolf using the following equations:\n\nA = 2 * a * rand() - a\nC = 2 * rand()\n\nX_new = X_alpha - A * abs(C * X_alpha - X)\n\nwhere a decreases linearly from 2 to 0 over the iterations, rand() is a random number between 0 and 1, and X_alpha is the position of the alpha wolf.\n\nStep 6: Check the boundaries\nEnsure that the new positions of the wolves are within the given constraints.\n\nStep 7: Update the fitness values\nCalculate the new fitness values for each wolf and update the alpha, beta, and delta wolves if necessary.\n\nStep 8: Repeat steps 5-7 for the maximum number of iterations (100).\n\nStep 9: Obtain the optimal solution\nAfter the maximum iterations, the position of the alpha wolf represents the optimal solution.\n\nPlease note that the GWO algorithm is a numerical optimization method, and it is not possible to provide an exact solution here. To implement the GWO algorithm, you can use programming languages like Python, MATLAB, or any other suitable language. The final solution will be an approximation of the global minimum within the given constraints."
