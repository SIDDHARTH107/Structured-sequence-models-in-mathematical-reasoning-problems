    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4πr², where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 units, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nA = 4π(5)²\nA = 4π(25)\nA = 100π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14 and round the answer to two decimal places:\n\nA ≈ 100 * 3.14\nA ≈ 314.00\n\nThe surface area of the sphere with a radius of 5 units is approximately 314.00 square units."
