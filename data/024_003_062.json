    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface using the variables u and v, where x = u, y = v, and z = u^2 - v^2. Then, the position vector of the surface is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the first partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNext, we need to find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, -2v) = -4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, -2v) • (0, 1, -2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, -2)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, -2) • (0, 0, 1) = -2\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, -2) • (0, 0, 1) = -2\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface, which is given by the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, -2v) = (4uv, 4u^2 + 4v^2, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 0), we have u = 1 and v = -1. Plugging these values into the coefficients, we get:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = -4(1)(-1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(-1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2\nM = -2\nN = -2\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (2 * -2 - (-2)^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2) = (-4 - 4) / (25 - 16) = -8 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1, -1, 0) on the surface is K = -8/9."
