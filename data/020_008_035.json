    "message_1": "A company needs to transport goods from its warehouse to four different retail stores located in different parts of the city. There are five potential delivery routes to choose from, each with a different distance and time requirement. The goal is to determine the most efficient delivery route that allows the company to deliver goods to all four stores while minimizing the total distance traveled. Help the company solve this problem by finding the shortest possible distance, given the distance matrix below:\n\n|  Route  | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 |\n|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|\n|    1    |    7    |    5    |   10    |    8    |\n|    2    |   12    |   11    |    6    |   13    |\n|    3    |    3    |    9    |   11    |   14    |\n|    4    |    8    |   13    |   10    |    9    |\n|    5    |    6    |    7    |   12    |   11    |",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we need to compare the total distance for each route. We will add up the distances for each store for every route and then compare the results.\n\nRoute 1: 7 (Store 1) + 5 (Store 2) + 10 (Store 3) + 8 (Store 4) = 30\nRoute 2: 12 (Store 1) + 11 (Store 2) + 6 (Store 3) + 13 (Store 4) = 42\nRoute 3: 3 (Store 1) + 9 (Store 2) + 11 (Store 3) + 14 (Store 4) = 37\nRoute 4: 8 (Store 1) + 13 (Store 2) + 10 (Store 3) + 9 (Store 4) = 40\nRoute 5: 6 (Store 1) + 7 (Store 2) + 12 (Store 3) + 11 (Store 4) = 36\n\nComparing the total distances, we can see that Route 1 has the shortest distance with a total of 30 units. Therefore, the company should choose Route 1 to minimize the total distance traveled while delivering goods to all four stores."
