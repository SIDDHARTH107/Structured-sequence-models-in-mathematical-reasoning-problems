    "message_2": "To find out how many students do not take any of these lessons, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students taking music or art lessons = Students taking music lessons + Students taking art lessons - Students taking both music and art lessons\n\nTotal students taking music or art lessons = 18 (music) + 14 (art) - 8 (both)\n\nTotal students taking music or art lessons = 24\n\nNow, to find out how many students do not take any of these lessons, we can subtract the total students taking music or art lessons from the total number of students in the class.\n\nStudents not taking any lessons = Total students - Total students taking music or art lessons\n\nStudents not taking any lessons = 30 - 24\n\nStudents not taking any lessons = 6\n\nSo, 6 students do not take any of these lessons."
