    "message_1": "A researcher is studying the relationship between the number of hours studied and the score obtained on a math test by a group of students. Using regression analysis, the researcher found a linear equation to predict the score based on the number of hours studied, which is: \n\nScore = 45 + 7*(Number of hours studied)\n\nIf a student studies for 5 hours, what is the predicted score on the math test according to this equation?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted score for a student who studies for 5 hours, we can plug the number of hours studied into the equation:\n\nScore = 45 + 7*(Number of hours studied)\n\nScore = 45 + 7*(5)\n\nScore = 45 + 35\n\nScore = 80\n\nSo, the predicted score on the math test for a student who studies for 5 hours is 80."
