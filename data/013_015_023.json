    "message_1": "Suppose a principal wants to hire a sales agent to expand their business. The agent's effort directly affects the sales outcome, but the agent's effort is unobservable to the principal. The agent's payoff function is represented by \n\nU(e) = (e-10)^2 - 2\n\nwhere e is the agent's level of effort. The principal's payoff function is represented by:\n\nV(s,e) = 20e - s^2\n\nwhere s is the level of investment made by the principal. What is the agent's optimal effort level if the principal invests $40 in the project?",
    "message_2": "To find the agent's optimal effort level, we need to maximize the agent's payoff function U(e) with respect to e. To do this, we will take the first derivative of U(e) with respect to e and set it equal to zero.\n\nU(e) = (e - 10)^2 - 2\n\nFirst, let's expand the equation:\n\nU(e) = e^2 - 20e + 100 - 2\n\nNow, take the first derivative with respect to e:\n\ndU(e)/de = 2e - 20\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for e:\n\n2e - 20 = 0\n2e = 20\ne = 10\n\nThe agent's optimal effort level is e = 10. However, we also need to consider the principal's investment of $40. The principal's payoff function is:\n\nV(s, e) = 20e - s^2\n\nPlug in the values of s = 40 and e = 10:\n\nV(40, 10) = 20(10) - 40^2\nV(40, 10) = 200 - 1600\nV(40, 10) = -1400\n\nThe principal's payoff is negative, which means the investment of $40 is not optimal for the principal. However, the question asks for the agent's optimal effort level given the principal's investment of $40, which is e = 10."
