    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and its two parallel sides measure 10 cm and 15 cm respectively. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two non-parallel sides. Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side (10 cm) to the longer parallel side (15 cm). This line will be the height of both right triangles and will have a length of 8 cm.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles with heights of 8 cm. Let's call the base of the smaller right triangle x and the base of the larger right triangle y. Since the bases of these two triangles together form the difference between the two parallel sides (15 cm - 10 cm = 5 cm), we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 5\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the other two sides (a and b) of the trapezium:\n\na^2 = x^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = y^2 + 8^2\n\nWe can solve for x and y using the equation x + y = 5. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact values of x and y, we can express a and b in terms of x:\n\na^2 = x^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = (5 - x)^2 + 8^2\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 15 + a + b\n\nSince we don't have exact values for a and b, we can express the perimeter in terms of x:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 15 + sqrt(x^2 + 8^2) + sqrt((5 - x)^2 + 8^2)\n\nThis equation represents the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x. Without more information, we cannot find the exact perimeter, but this equation can be used to find the perimeter for any given value of x."
