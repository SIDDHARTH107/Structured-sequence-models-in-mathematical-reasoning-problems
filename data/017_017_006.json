    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the Sylow theorems state the following:\n\n1. For any prime power p^k dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of order p^k in G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted by n_p, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 30. We have that 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. We will consider the Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nLet n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_3 divides 30 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G.\n\nLet n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_5 divides 30 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime (3 and 5 are coprime), by the second Sylow theorem, PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 3 * 5 / 1 = 15, since P ∩ Q = {e} (the identity element) as the orders of P and Q are coprime.\n\nIf either n_3 = 1 or n_5 = 1, then we have a normal Sylow subgroup, and thus, the product PQ is also normal in G. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 15, and by the factor group theorem, G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and Q. In this case, there exists an element g in G with order 15 (as the order of the element is the least common multiple of the orders of P and Q).\n\nIf both n_3 = 10 and n_5 = 6, then there are 10 * (3 - 1) = 20 elements of order 3 and 6 * (5 - 1) = 24 elements of order 5 in G. However, this is a contradiction, as it would mean there are 44 non-identity elements in G, but G only has 29 non-identity elements. Therefore, either n_3 = 1 or n_5 = 1, and there exists an element g in G with order 15.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_2 divides 30 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G, and thus there exists an element g in G with order 2.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists an element g in G such that g has order 15 or order 2."
