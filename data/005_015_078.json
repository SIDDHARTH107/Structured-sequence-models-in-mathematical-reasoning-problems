They categorize the customers into five clusters based on the following criteria:\n\n- Cluster 1: High spender\n- Cluster 2: Medium spender, frequent buyer\n- Cluster 3: Low spender, frequent buyer\n- Cluster 4: Low spender, infrequent buyer\n- Cluster 5: High spender, infrequent buyer\n\nThe data shows that 20% of the customers fall under Cluster 1, 30% under Cluster 2, 25% under Cluster 3, 15% under Cluster 4, and 10% under Cluster 5. \n\nIf the supermarket has a total of 10,000 customers in the month, how many customers belong to Cluster 1?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of customers in Cluster 1, we can multiply the total number of customers by the percentage of customers in Cluster 1.\n\nNumber of customers in Cluster 1 = (Total number of customers) x (Percentage of customers in Cluster 1)\n\nNumber of customers in Cluster 1 = 10,000 x 0.20 = 2,000 customers."
