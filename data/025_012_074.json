    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through points P(3, -3) and Q(4, -8) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the finite field F7, we first need to find the slope of the line. Since we are working in the finite field F7, all calculations will be done modulo 7.\n\nThe slope (m) of the line can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nHere, P = (x1, y1) = (3, -3) and Q = (x2, y2) = (4, -8). Note that -3 is equivalent to 4 in F7 and -8 is equivalent to 6 in F7. So, we have:\n\nm = (6 - 4) / (4 - 3) = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the values for m, x1, and y1, we get:\n\ny - 4 = 2(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation and express it in the form y = mx + b:\n\ny = 2x - 6 + 4\ny = 2x - 2\n\nSince we are working in F7, we can simplify the constant term:\n\ny = 2x - 2 (mod 7)\ny = 2x + 5 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through points P(3, -3) and Q(4, -8) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the finite field F7 is:\n\ny = 2x + 5 (mod 7)"
