    "message_2": "First, we note that there is no non-abelian group of order 10, since the only non-abelian group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, is the dihedral group Dp. Therefore, we only need to consider whether G is isomorphic to C10 or D5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there can be either 1 or 5 such subgroups. Similarly, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G divides 2 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5, so there must be exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is the only 5-Sylow subgroup, it is normal in G. If there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup Q, then Q is also normal in G. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 2 and a normal subgroup of order 5. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and thus G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is a cyclic group of order 10, i.e., G is isomorphic to C10.\n\nIf there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups, none of them are normal in G. In this case, G cannot be a cyclic group, since a cyclic group of order 10 has a unique subgroup of order 2. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. To determine which one, we can examine the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G. If there is only one, G is isomorphic to C10, and if there are five, G is isomorphic to D5."
