    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, product A and product B. The production of each product requires a certain number of machine hours on two machines. The available hours on machine 1 is 200 hours and on machine 2 is 150 hours per week. Product A requires 2 hours on machine 1 and 3 hours on machine 2, while product B requires 4 hours on machine 1 and 1 hour on machine 2. The profit per unit of product A is $50 and per unit of product B is $80. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. Using firefly algorithm, determine the optimal number of each product that the company should produce.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is not suitable for solving this linear programming problem directly. Instead, we can use the graphical method or the simplex method to find the optimal solution. Here, we will use the graphical method.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 80y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 200 (Machine 1)\n3x + y ≤ 150 (Machine 2)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ (200 - 2x) / 4\n   y ≤ 50 - 0.5x\n\n2. 3x + y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ 150 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's the area enclosed by the x-axis, y-axis, y = 50 - 0.5x, and y = 150 - 3x.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x-axis and y = 50 - 0.5x:\n   x = 0, y = 50\n\n2. Intersection of y-axis and y = 150 - 3x:\n   x = 50, y = 0\n\n3. Intersection of y = 50 - 0.5x and y = 150 - 3x:\n   50 - 0.5x = 150 - 3x\n   2.5x = 100\n   x = 40, y = 20\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit(0, 50) = 50(0) + 80(50) = $4,000\n2. Profit(50, 0) = 50(50) + 80(0) = $2,500\n3. Profit(40, 20) = 50(40) + 80(20) = $4,000\n\nThe optimal solution is to produce 40 units of product A and 20 units of product B, which will result in a maximum weekly profit of $4,000."
