    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n$3x^2 - 15x = 3x(x - 5)$\n\nDenominator:\n$15x - 45 = 15(x - 3)$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the rational expression as:\n\n$\\dfrac{3x^2 - 15x}{15x - 45} = \\dfrac{3x(x - 5)}{15(x - 3)}$\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factor of $3x$:\n\n$\\dfrac{3x(x - 5)}{15(x - 3)} = \\dfrac{3x}{15} \\cdot \\dfrac{x - 5}{x - 3}$\n\n$\\dfrac{3x}{15}$ simplifies to $\\dfrac{1}{5}$, so the final simplified expression is:\n\n$\\dfrac{1}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{x - 5}{x - 3} = \\dfrac{x - 5}{5(x - 3)}$"
