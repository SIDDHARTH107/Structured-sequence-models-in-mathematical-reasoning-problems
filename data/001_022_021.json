    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, -2) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nThe factors of -2 are ±1 and ±2. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±2. We can test these values to see if any of them are roots.\n\nFor x = 1:\ny = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 2 = 1 - 4 + 5 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 is a root of the polynomial. Now we can use synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n  1 |  1  -4   5  -2\n     |     1  -3   2\n  -----------------\n        1  -3   2   0\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 - 3x + 2. Now we can find the roots of this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 2.\n\nx = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nx = (3 ± √(9 - 8)) / 2\nx = (3 ± √1) / 2\n\nSo, the two remaining roots are:\n\nx = (3 + 1) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\nx = (3 - 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nHowever, we already found that x = 1 is a root, so the only other x-intercept is x = 2.\n\nThus, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2 are x = 1 and x = 2."
