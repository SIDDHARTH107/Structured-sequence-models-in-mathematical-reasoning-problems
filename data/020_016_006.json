    "message_1": "Given a rectangular metal sheet (2 meters by 1 meter) of thickness 5 mm, cut out a rectangular piece of maximum volume from one of its corners. What are the dimensions of the cut out rectangle that will maximize the volume?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the dimensions of the cut-out rectangle as x, y, and z, where x and y are the lengths along the 2-meter and 1-meter sides of the metal sheet, and z is the height (thickness) of the cut-out rectangle. Since the thickness of the metal sheet is 5 mm (0.005 meters), we have the constraint 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.005.\n\nThe volume V of the cut-out rectangle can be expressed as:\n\nV = xyz\n\nWe want to maximize this volume, subject to the constraints 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.005.\n\nTo do this, we can use calculus. First, we'll find the partial derivatives of V with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂V/∂x = yz\n∂V/∂y = xz\n∂V/∂z = xy\n\nNow we'll set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x, y, and z:\n\nyz = 0\nxz = 0\nxy = 0\n\nSince we want to maximize the volume, we can't have any of the dimensions equal to zero. Therefore, we can ignore the trivial solutions (x=0, y=0, z=0) and focus on the critical points where the partial derivatives are equal to zero.\n\nHowever, there are no critical points in the interior of the domain (0 < x < 2, 0 < y < 1, 0 < z < 0.005) because the partial derivatives are never simultaneously equal to zero. This means that the maximum volume must occur on the boundary of the domain.\n\nOn the boundary, we have the following cases:\n\n1. x = 0 or x = 2: In this case, the cut-out rectangle would have no volume, as one of its dimensions would be zero.\n\n2. y = 0 or y = 1: Similarly, the cut-out rectangle would have no volume, as one of its dimensions would be zero.\n\n3. z = 0 or z = 0.005: In this case, the cut-out rectangle would have the maximum possible thickness (z = 0.005). Since the other dimensions are unconstrained, we can choose x = 2 and y = 1 to maximize the volume.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cut-out rectangle that will maximize the volume are x = 2 meters, y = 1 meter, and z = 0.005 meters (5 mm). The maximum volume is V = (2)(1)(0.005) = 0.01 cubic meters."
