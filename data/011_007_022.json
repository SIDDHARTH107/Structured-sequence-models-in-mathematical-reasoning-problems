    "message_1": "A pizza parlor offers four sizes of pizza: small (8\"), medium (12\"), large (16\"), and extra-large (18\"). A family of four always orders two different sizes, with the larger size being cut into twice as many pieces as the smaller size. If there are 6 ways to place an order of two pizzas, how many different ways are there to order pizzas for this family? \n\nFind the recurrence relation for the function representing the number of ways to order pizzas for any family size of n.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the 6 ways to place an order of two pizzas for the family of four. Since the larger pizza is cut into twice as many pieces as the smaller pizza, we can represent the number of pieces for each size as follows:\n\n- Small (8\"): 4 pieces\n- Medium (12\"): 8 pieces\n- Large (16\"): 12 pieces\n- Extra-large (18\"): 16 pieces\n\nNow, we can list the possible combinations of two different sizes that would provide enough pieces for a family of four:\n\n1. Small (4 pieces) + Medium (8 pieces)\n2. Small (4 pieces) + Large (12 pieces)\n3. Small (4 pieces) + Extra-large (16 pieces)\n4. Medium (8 pieces) + Large (12 pieces)\n5. Medium (8 pieces) + Extra-large (16 pieces)\n6. Large (12 pieces) + Extra-large (16 pieces)\n\nNow, let's find the recurrence relation for the function representing the number of ways to order pizzas for any family size of n. Let P(n) be the number of ways to order pizzas for a family of size n.\n\nSince there are 4 sizes of pizzas, the base case would be P(1) = 4, as there are 4 ways to order a single pizza for a family of one.\n\nFor n > 1, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1. The family orders a small pizza and another pizza of a different size.\n2. The family orders a medium pizza and another pizza of a different size (excluding the small pizza, as it has already been considered in case 1).\n3. The family orders a large pizza and another pizza of a different size (excluding the small and medium pizzas, as they have already been considered in cases 1 and 2).\n4. The family orders an extra-large pizza and another pizza of a different size (excluding the small, medium, and large pizzas, as they have already been considered in cases 1, 2, and 3).\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation can be represented as:\n\nP(n) = P(n-1) + 3 for n > 1\n\nThis recurrence relation represents the number of ways to order pizzas for any family size of n, taking into account the constraint that the larger pizza is cut into twice as many pieces as the smaller pizza."
