    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a Hill cipher encrypted message \"FPT\". You also know that the key matrix used for encrypting this message is a 3x3 matrix with determinant 3. Decrypt this message and find the original plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Hill cipher encrypted message \"FPT\" with a 3x3 key matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext to numerical values using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n2. Find the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26.\n3. Multiply the ciphertext vector by the inverse key matrix modulo 26.\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back to letters.\n\nHowever, we don't have the key matrix itself, only the determinant value (3). Unfortunately, we cannot uniquely determine the key matrix or its inverse with just the determinant value. There are multiple 3x3 matrices with a determinant of 3, and each of them would result in a different decryption.\n\nTo decrypt the message, we would need the actual key matrix or more information about it."
