    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation: \n\n𝑢𝑡 = 𝑢𝑥𝑥 + 2𝑢𝑦𝑦 + sin(𝑥)cos(𝑦) on the rectangular domain [0, π] × [0, 1]. \n\nApply the finite element method using linear triangular elements with 𝑅 = {(𝑥, 𝑦) ∈ ℝ^2 | 𝑥 ∈ [0, 𝜋], 𝑦 ∈ [0, 1]} to find an approximation to the solution 𝑢(𝑥, 𝑦) with 𝑢(0, 𝑦) = 𝑢(𝜋, 𝑦) = 0 and 𝑢(𝑥, 0) = 𝑢(𝑥, 1) = 1/2 for all 𝑥 ∈ [0, 𝜋] and 𝑦 ∈ [0, 1]. Use 𝑁 = 10 equal subintervals in each direction.",
    "message_2": "To apply the finite element method, we first need to discretize the domain and create a mesh. We will use N=10 equal subintervals in each direction, so the mesh size will be h_x = π/10 in the x-direction and h_y = 1/10 in the y-direction.\n\nNext, we need to define the basis functions. Since we are using linear triangular elements, we will use the hat functions as our basis functions. For a given node (i, j), the hat function φ_ij is defined as:\n\nφ_ij(x, y) = 1 at node (i, j)\nφ_ij(x, y) = 0 at all other nodes\n\nNow, we will approximate the solution u(x, y) as a linear combination of these basis functions:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ ∑(c_ij * φ_ij(x, y))\n\nTo find the coefficients c_ij, we will use the Galerkin method, which requires that the residual of the PDE is orthogonal to the basis functions. The residual is given by:\n\nR(x, y) = u_t - u_xx - 2u_yy - sin(x)cos(y)\n\nWe will integrate the product of the residual and the basis functions over the domain R and set it equal to zero:\n\n∫∫_R R(x, y) * φ_ij(x, y) dx dy = 0\n\nNow, we need to compute the integrals involving the derivatives of u(x, y) with respect to x and y. We can use the weak form of the PDE, which involves integrating by parts:\n\n∫∫_R (u_xx * φ_ij + 2u_yy * φ_ij) dx dy = ∫∫_R (u_x * φ_ij_x + 2u_y * φ_ij_y) dx dy - ∫_∂R (u_x * φ_ij * n_x + 2u_y * φ_ij * n_y) ds\n\nHere, n_x and n_y are the components of the outward normal vector to the boundary ∂R.\n\nNow, we can substitute the approximation of u(x, y) into the weak form of the PDE and solve for the coefficients c_ij:\n\n∫∫_R (∑(c_ij * φ_ij_x) * φ_ij_x + 2∑(c_ij * φ_ij_y) * φ_ij_y) dx dy = ∫∫_R sin(x)cos(y) * φ_ij(x, y) dx dy + ∫_∂R (1/2 * φ_ij * n_x + 1/2 * φ_ij * n_y) ds\n\nThis is a linear system of equations that can be solved for the coefficients c_ij. Once we have the coefficients, we can approximate the solution u(x, y) using the linear combination of basis functions.\n\nNote that this is a time-dependent PDE, so we need to solve this linear system at each time step to obtain the solution u(x, y, t)."
