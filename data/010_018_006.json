    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of critical points of index i as c_i. In this case, we have c_0 = 3 (minima), c_1 = 1 (saddle of index 1), and c_2 = 2 (saddles of index 2). We want to find the total number of 1-dimensional cells, which we will denote as e_1.\n\nWe can use the Euler-Poincaré formula for a closed surface, which states that:\n\nχ = Σ (-1)^i c_i\n\nwhere χ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. Since we have a closed surface, we know that χ = 2.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of c_i into the formula:\n\n2 = 3 - c_1 + 2\n\nSolving for c_1, we get:\n\nc_1 = 3\n\nNow, we can use the Morse inequalities to find the number of 1-dimensional cells. The Morse inequalities state that:\n\nc_i - e_i + c_(i-1) ≥ 0\n\nFor i = 1, we have:\n\nc_1 - e_1 + c_0 ≥ 0\n\nPlugging in the values of c_1 and c_0, we get:\n\n3 - e_1 + 3 ≥ 0\n\nSolving for e_1, we get:\n\ne_1 ≤ 6\n\nHowever, we also know that e_1 must be greater than or equal to the number of critical points of index 1, which is 1 in this case. Therefore, we have:\n\n1 ≤ e_1 ≤ 6\n\nSince we are looking for the total number of 1-dimensional cells, we can conclude that there are at most 6 1-dimensional cells in this Morse-Smale complex."
