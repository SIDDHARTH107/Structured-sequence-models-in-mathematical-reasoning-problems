    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation, we first rewrite it in terms of $x$ and $y$. Since $\\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{2}(x - iy)$, we have $x = 2\\Re(\\bar{z})$ and $y = -2\\Im(\\bar{z})$. Now, we can compute the partial derivatives with respect to $\\bar{z}$ using the chain rule:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\bar{z}} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\bar{z}}$\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 2$ and $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = -i2$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 2\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - 2i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$\n\nNow, we are given that $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 0$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$2\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - 2i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$\n\nThis is a Cauchy-Riemann equation, which implies that $u(x, y)$ is the real part of an analytic function. Let $v(x, y)$ be the imaginary part of the analytic function, such that $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ is analytic. Then, $f'(z) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + i^2\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = i\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right)$.\n\nSince $f'(z) = 0$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nNow, we have a system of partial differential equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = i\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$, we obtain:\n\n$u(x, y) = iv(x, y) + g(y)$\n\nwhere $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$. Now, we apply the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$. This gives us:\n\n$\\cos(x) = iv(x, 0) + g(0)$\n\nSince $\\cos(x)$ is a real function, we must have $v(x, 0) = 0$ and $g(0) = \\cos(x)$. Therefore, $g(y) = \\cos(x)$, and we have:\n\n$u(x, y) = iv(x, y) + \\cos(x)$\n\nSince $v(x, y)$ is the imaginary part of an analytic function, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations as well. Thus, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$, we obtain:\n\n$v(x, y) = -\\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} dx + h(y)$\n\nwhere $h(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$. Since $v(x, 0) = 0$, we have $h(0) = 0$. Thus, we can write the analytic function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = iv(x, y) + \\cos(x) - i\\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} dx$\n\nSince the given partial differential equation is satisfied by any analytic function with the given boundary condition, this is the general solution to the problem."
