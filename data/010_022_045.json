    "message_1": "A mathematical student needs to find the contact structure of a given 3-dimensional space curve in Euclidean 3-space. The student is given the parametric equations of the curve as x(t) = t^3 - 3t and y(t) = t^4 - 2t^2. The student needs to evaluate the contact form equation, alpha = dz - ydx, where z is the height function of the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the contact structure of the given 3-dimensional space curve, we first need to compute the derivatives of x(t) and y(t) with respect to t. \n\nx(t) = t^3 - 3t\ny(t) = t^4 - 2t^2\n\nNow, let's find the derivatives:\n\ndx/dt = d(x(t))/dt = 3t^2 - 3\ndy/dt = d(y(t))/dt = 4t^3 - 4t\n\nNow, we need to find the height function z(t). Since we are given a 3-dimensional space curve in Euclidean 3-space, we can assume that the height function z(t) is a function of x(t) and y(t). Therefore, we can write z(t) = z(x(t), y(t)). To find the contact form equation, we need to compute the total derivative of z(t) with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = (∂z/∂x)(dx/dt) + (∂z/∂y)(dy/dt)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for dx/dt and dy/dt:\n\ndz/dt = (∂z/∂x)(3t^2 - 3) + (∂z/∂y)(4t^3 - 4t)\n\nNow, we can write the contact form equation as:\n\nalpha = dz - ydx = (dz/dt)dt - y(t)(dx/dt)dt\n\nalpha = [(∂z/∂x)(3t^2 - 3) + (∂z/∂y)(4t^3 - 4t)]dt - [t^4 - 2t^2](3t^2 - 3)dt\n\nNow, we can factor out dt:\n\nalpha = [(∂z/∂x)(3t^2 - 3) + (∂z/∂y)(4t^3 - 4t) - (t^4 - 2t^2)(3t^2 - 3)]dt\n\nThis is the contact form equation for the given 3-dimensional space curve. The student can now analyze the contact structure by studying the properties of this equation."
