    "message_1": "In a survival analysis study of cancer patients, 100 patients were followed up for a period of 2 years. At the end of the study, 30 patients had died while the remaining 70 were still alive. The survival function for this study is estimated to be S(t) = 0.7^t, where t denotes time in years since the beginning of the study. \n\nWhat is the probability that a patient will survive for more than 1 year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a patient will survive for more than 1 year, we can use the survival function S(t) = 0.7^t. In this case, we want to find the probability of survival at t = 1 year. \n\nS(1) = 0.7^1\nS(1) = 0.7\n\nThe probability that a patient will survive for more than 1 year is 0.7 or 70%."
