    "message_1": "The national average for the SAT math section is 500 with a standard deviation of 100. A group of 30 students at a particular school take the SAT math section and score an average of 530. Is this a statistically significant difference from the national average at the 0.05 level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the difference is statistically significant, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the sample mean and the national average (µ = 500).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between the sample mean and the national average (µ ≠ 500).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the t-statistic.\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √n)\nt = (530 - 500) / (100 / √30)\nt = 30 / (100 / √30)\nt ≈ 1.643\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 0.05 level of significance with 29 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29).\nUsing a t-table or calculator, the critical t-value is approximately ±2.045.\n\nStep 4: Compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value.\nSince the calculated t-statistic (1.643) is less than the critical t-value (2.045), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the average SAT math score of the group of 30 students and the national average at the 0.05 level of significance."
