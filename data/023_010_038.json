    "message_2": "To apply the 2D Fourier Transform and calculate the magnitude image, phase image, and power spectrum, we need the actual pixel values of the greyscale image. Since the pixel values are not provided, I cannot perform the calculations directly. However, I can explain the steps to perform these calculations.\n\n1. Magnitude Image:\nTo compute the magnitude image, first apply the 2D Fourier Transform (2D-FT) to the greyscale image. The 2D-FT will result in a complex-valued matrix of the same size (512 x 512). The magnitude image is obtained by calculating the magnitude of each complex value in the transformed matrix.\n\nMagnitude Image (i, j) = sqrt(Real^2 + Imaginary^2)\n\n2. Phase Image:\nThe phase image is obtained by calculating the phase (angle) of each complex value in the transformed matrix.\n\nPhase Image (i, j) = atan2(Imaginary, Real)\n\n3. Power Spectrum:\nThe power spectrum is obtained by calculating the square of the magnitude image.\n\nPower Spectrum (i, j) = Magnitude Image (i, j)^2\n\nAfter performing these calculations, you can round off the numerical values to two decimal places. Note that without the actual pixel values of the greyscale image, it is not possible to provide the numerical results for the magnitude image, phase image, and power spectrum."
