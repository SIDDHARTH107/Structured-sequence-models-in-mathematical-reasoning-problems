    "message_2": "First, let's find the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of a group of order 72.\n\nA group of order 72 has the prime factorization 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. According to Sylow's Theorems:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (denoted by n_2) must divide the index of the 2-subgroup, which is 3^2 = 9. So, n_2 must be a divisor of 9.\n2. n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (denoted by n_3) must divide the index of the 3-subgroup, which is 2^3 = 8. So, n_3 must be a divisor of 8.\n4. n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we find that the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are n_2 = 1 or 9, and the possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider a group G of order 72 containing a normal Sylow subgroup of order either 2 or 3. We will show that G is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 1: G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8.\nSince P_2 is normal in G, G acts on P_2 by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P_2), where Aut(P_2) is the automorphism group of P_2. The order of Aut(P_2) is at most 8, so the image of G under this homomorphism has order at most 8. Thus, G/P_2 is a subgroup of Aut(P_2), and G is an extension of P_2 by G/P_2. Since there are 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, G must be isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nCase 2: G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9.\nSince P_3 is normal in G, G acts on P_3 by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P_3), where Aut(P_3) is the automorphism group of P_3. The order of Aut(P_3) is at most 6, so the image of G under this homomorphism has order at most 6. Thus, G/P_3 is a subgroup of Aut(P_3), and G is an extension of P_3 by G/P_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 72 containing a normal Sylow subgroup of order either 2 or 3 is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72."
