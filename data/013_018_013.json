    "message_1": "A basic signaling game involves two players: a sender and a receiver. The sender chooses between two messages and the receiver receives a signal indicating which message the sender has chosen. Let's say the sender has a probability of 0.6 of choosing message 1, and a probability of 0.4 of choosing message 2. The receiver has a payoff of 1 if he correctly guesses which message the sender chose, and a payoff of 0 otherwise. Determine the expected payoff for the receiver.",
    "message_2": "To determine the expected payoff for the receiver, we need to consider the probabilities of the sender choosing each message and the receiver's payoff for correctly guessing each message.\n\nLet's denote the probability of the sender choosing message 1 as P(M1) = 0.6 and the probability of the sender choosing message 2 as P(M2) = 0.4.\n\nIf the receiver correctly guesses message 1, their payoff is 1. The probability of this happening is P(M1) * P(correct guess | M1) = 0.6 * 1 = 0.6.\n\nIf the receiver correctly guesses message 2, their payoff is also 1. The probability of this happening is P(M2) * P(correct guess | M2) = 0.4 * 1 = 0.4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected payoff for the receiver by adding the payoffs for each correct guess multiplied by their respective probabilities:\n\nExpected Payoff = (Payoff for correct guess of M1 * P(M1)) + (Payoff for correct guess of M2 * P(M2))\nExpected Payoff = (1 * 0.6) + (1 * 0.4)\nExpected Payoff = 0.6 + 0.4\nExpected Payoff = 1\n\nThe expected payoff for the receiver in this signaling game is 1."
