    "message_2": "The scaling factor for the self-similarity transformation of the Barnsley fern can be found by dividing the length of the largest leaflet by the length of the stem.\n\nScaling factor = (Length of largest leaflet) / (Length of stem)\n\nScaling factor = 0.5 / 1\n\nScaling factor = 0.5\n\nThe scaling factor used in the self-similarity transformation of the Barnsley fern is 0.5."
