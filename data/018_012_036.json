For the intersection to be associative, we need to show that (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = (A ∩ B) × (B ∩ A).\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × A) = ∅ (empty set) because there are no elements in common between A × B and B × A.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} because these are the elements in common between A and B.\n\n(B ∩ A) = {2, 3} because these are the elements in common between B and A.\n\n(A ∩ B) × (B ∩ A) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nSince (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = ∅ and (A ∩ B) × (B ∩ A) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}, the intersection is not associative."
