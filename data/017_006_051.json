    "message_2": "Yes, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 3. We will justify this by using the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet the order of G be 15, which can be factored as 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is also 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Let P = <a> and Q = <b>, where a has order 3 and b has order 5. Since P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|, and since P and Q have relatively prime orders, their intersection is the identity element, so |P ∩ Q| = 1. Thus, |PQ| = |P||Q| = 3 * 5 = 15.\n\nSince PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, PQ = G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5, respectively, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 5."
