Both eigenvalues are positive, so the equilibrium point (0, 0) is an unstable node.\n\n2) At (0, ±√5):\n\nJ = | -20  -8  |\n    |  8   -20 |\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = -16 and λ₂ = -24. Both eigenvalues are negative, so the equilibrium points (0, √5) and (0, -√5) are stable nodes.\n\nIn conclusion, the equilibrium points of the system are (0, 0), (0, √5), and (0, -√5). The point (0, 0) is an unstable node, while the points (0, √5) and (0, -√5) are stable nodes."
