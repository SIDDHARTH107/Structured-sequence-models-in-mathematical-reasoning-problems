    "message_2": "To use Newton's method for solving a system of nonlinear equations, we need to find the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. Let's denote the given system of equations as:\n\nF(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) = (x^2 + y^2 - 16, x^2 - y^2 - 4)\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | df1/dx  df1/dy |\n          | df2/dx  df2/dy |\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n          | 2x -2y |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, J^(-1)(x, y):\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = 1/det(J) * |  -2y  -2y |\n                          | -2x   2x  |\n\nwhere det(J) = (2x)(-2y) - (2y)(2x) = -4xy + 4xy = 0.\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the Jacobian matrix is singular, and its inverse does not exist. Therefore, we cannot use Newton's method to solve this system of nonlinear equations.\n\nHowever, we can solve this system using other methods. From the second equation, we have:\n\nx^2 = y^2 + 4\n\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\n(y^2 + 4) + y^2 = 16\n\n2y^2 = 12\ny^2 = 6\ny = ±√6\n\nNow, substitute the values of y back into the equation for x^2:\n\nx^2 = 6 + 4\nx^2 = 10\nx = ±√10\n\nSo, the solutions to the system of equations are:\n\n(x, y) = (√10, √6), (√10, -√6), (-√10, √6), and (-√10, -√6)\n\nCorrect to 4 decimal places, the solutions are:\n\n(x, y) = (3.1623, 2.4495), (3.1623, -2.4495), (-3.1623, 2.4495), and (-3.1623, -2.4495)"
