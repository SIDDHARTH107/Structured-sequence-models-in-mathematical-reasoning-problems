    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 8 vertices and degree sequence {3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1}. Is it possible for such a graph to exist? If yes, draw a possible graph G. If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if such a graph exists, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 3+3+3+2+2+1+1+1 = 16. Since 16 is an even number, it is possible for such a graph to exist.\n\nNow, let's try to draw a possible graph G with the given degree sequence. We can label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with degrees 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\n1. Connect vertices A, B, and C to form a triangle. This satisfies their degree of 3.\n2. Connect vertex D to vertices A and B. This satisfies D's degree of 2.\n3. Connect vertex E to vertices B and C. This satisfies E's degree of 2.\n4. Connect vertex F to vertex A. This satisfies F's degree of 1.\n5. Connect vertex G to vertex C. This satisfies G's degree of 1.\n6. Connect vertex H to vertex D. This satisfies H's degree of 1.\n\nThe resulting graph G with the given degree sequence is as follows:\n\n```\n  F       G\n   \\     /\n    A---C\n   / \\ / \\\n  D---B---E\n   \\\n    H\n```\n\nSo, it is possible for a graph G with 8 vertices and the given degree sequence to exist."
