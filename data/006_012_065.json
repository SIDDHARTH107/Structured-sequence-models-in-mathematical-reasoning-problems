    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a theft occurring in a particular neighborhood in one month, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, thefts) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-位) * 位^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events (thefts) occurring in the given interval (one month)\n- 位 (lambda) is the average number of events (thefts) per interval (one month)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the average number of thefts per year to the average number of thefts per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide the annual average by 12:\n\n位 = 3 thefts/year / 12 months/year = 0.25 thefts/month\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a theft occurring in one month (k = 1):\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.25) * 0.25^1) / 1! = (0.7788 * 0.25) / 1 = 0.1947\n\nSo, the probability of a theft occurring in the neighborhood in one month is approximately 19.47%."
