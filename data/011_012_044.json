    "message_2": "Using the Inclusion-Exclusion principle, we can find the number of students who like either math or science (or both) by adding the number of students who like math and the number of students who like science, and then subtracting the number of students who like both subjects (to avoid double-counting).\n\nSo, the number of students who like math or science is:\n\n20 (students who like math) + 15 (students who like science) - 10 (students who like both) = 25 students."
