    "message_1": "Consider the set of integers from 1 to 10 inclusive. How many ways can we partition this set into three non-empty subsets such that the largest element in each subset is odd?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the three subsets as A, B, and C. Since the largest element in each subset must be odd, the largest elements in A, B, and C must be 9, 7, and 5, respectively. This is because 9 is the largest odd integer in the set, and we cannot have two subsets with the same largest element.\n\nNow, let's distribute the remaining elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10) into the three subsets.\n\n1. Subset A (largest element 9): We can add any of the remaining elements to this subset. There are 2^7 - 1 = 127 ways to do this (subtracting 1 because the subset cannot be empty).\n\n2. Subset B (largest element 7): Since 9 is not in this subset, we can add any of the remaining elements except for 8 and 10 (because they would become the largest element). There are 2^5 - 1 = 31 ways to do this.\n\n3. Subset C (largest element 5): Since 9 and 7 are not in this subset, we can add any of the remaining elements except for 6 (because it would become the largest element). There are 2^4 - 1 = 15 ways to do this.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted some cases. When we multiply the number of ways for each subset (127 * 31 * 15), we also count the cases where some elements are not included in any subset. To correct for this, we will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet's consider the cases where at least one element is not included in any subset:\n\n1. One element is not included: There are 7 elements to choose from, so there are 7 cases.\n\n2. Two elements are not included: There are 7 choose 2 = 21 ways to choose two elements to exclude.\n\n3. Three elements are not included: There are 7 choose 3 = 35 ways to choose three elements to exclude.\n\n4. Four elements are not included: There are 7 choose 4 = 35 ways to choose four elements to exclude.\n\n5. Five elements are not included: There are 7 choose 5 = 21 ways to choose five elements to exclude.\n\n6. Six elements are not included: There are 7 choose 6 = 7 ways to choose six elements to exclude.\n\n7. All seven elements are not included: There is only 1 way to do this.\n\nNow, we apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n\nTotal ways = (127 * 31 * 15) - (7 - 21 + 35 - 35 + 21 - 7 + 1) = 58545 - (1) = 58544\n\nSo, there are 58,544 ways to partition the set of integers from 1 to 10 inclusive into three non-empty subsets such that the largest element in each subset is odd."
