    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  3 -1 | 4 |\n| 4  6 -2 | 4 |\n| 6  9 -3 | 6.5 |\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 | 2   |\n| 4  6   -2   | 4   |\n| 6  9   -3   | 6.5 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the first row. Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 | 2   |\n| 0  0    0   | -4  |\n| 0  0    0   | -5.5|\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros in the coefficient matrix, which means the system is either dependent (infinite solutions) or inconsistent (no solution). To determine which case it is, we look at the constants on the right side of the augmented matrix.\n\nSince the second and third rows are not equal to zero (i.e., -4 and -5.5), the system is inconsistent, meaning there is no solution to this system of linear equations."
