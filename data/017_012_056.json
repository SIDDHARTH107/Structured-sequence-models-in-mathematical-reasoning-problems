    "message_2": "First, let's check if the group G is abelian. If it is, then we can determine if it's isomorphic to C16. If it's not abelian, we can check if it's isomorphic to D8 or some other non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nA group is abelian if the multiplication table is symmetric about the main diagonal. In other words, for all elements x and y in G, x * y = y * x. Let's check a few entries to see if this holds:\n\n- a * b = d, but b * a = f, so G is not abelian.\n\nSince G is not abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to C16, which is an abelian group. Now let's check if G is isomorphic to D8, the dihedral group of order 16.\n\nD8 has the following presentation: D8 = {r, s | r^8 = e, s^2 = e, s * r * s = r^(-1)}. We need to find elements in G that satisfy these conditions.\n\n- First, let's find an element of order 8. We can see that a^8 = e (a * a * a * a * a * a * a * a = e). So, we can set r = a.\n- Next, we need to find an element of order 2. We can see that b^2 = e (b * b = e). So, we can set s = b.\n- Finally, we need to check if s * r * s = r^(-1). In G, b * a * b = a^7, which is indeed r^(-1) since r = a.\n\nSince we found elements in G that satisfy the conditions for D8, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to D8."
