    "message_2": "To show that G is cyclic, we need to prove that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince the order of G is 7 (a prime number), by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 7. The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup containing the identity element e.\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element g in G, where g ≠ e. We will show that the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has order 7, which would imply that G is cyclic.\n\nThe order of ⟨g⟩ is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e. Since the order of G is 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of ⟨g⟩ must divide 7. The only possibilities are 1 and 7. If the order of ⟨g⟩ is 1, then g^1 = e, which contradicts our assumption that g ≠ e. Therefore, the order of ⟨g⟩ must be 7.\n\nSince ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, it follows that ⟨g⟩ = G. This means that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g, and thus G is cyclic."
