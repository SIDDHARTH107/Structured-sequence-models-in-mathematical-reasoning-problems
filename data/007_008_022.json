    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 3^35 is divided by 5. Since 5 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, 3^5 ≡ 3 (mod 5). Now, we can rewrite 3^35 as (3^5)^7. Using the theorem, we can replace 3^5 with 3:\n\n(3^5)^7 ≡ 3^7 (mod 5)\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when 3^7 is divided by 5. We can calculate this directly:\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\nNow, divide 2187 by 5:\n\n2187 ÷ 5 = 437 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, the remainder when 3^35 is divided by 5 is 2."
