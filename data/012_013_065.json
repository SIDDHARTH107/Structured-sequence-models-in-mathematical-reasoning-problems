Start with the original graph G.\n2. Choose an edge, say 1-2.\n3. Delete the edge 1-2 to get G' and contract the edge 1-2 to get G''.\n4. The chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nNow, let's find P(G', k) and P(G'', k).\n\nG' has the following edges: 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-5, 3-6, 4-5, and 5-6.\nG'' is obtained by merging vertices 1 and 2, and we get a graph with five vertices and the following edges: 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 3-6, 4-5, and 5-6.\n\nFor G', we can choose another edge, say 1-3, and apply the deletion-contraction algorithm again:\n\nG1' has the following edges: 1-4, 2-3, 2-5, 3-6, 4-5, and 5-6.\nG1'' is obtained by merging vertices 1 and 3, and we get a graph with five vertices and the following edges: 1-2, 1-4, 1-6, 2-5, and 4-5.\n\nP(G', k) = P(G1', k) - P(G1'', k)\n\nFor G1', it is a tree with 6 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^5.\n\nFor G1'', we can choose the edge 1-2 and apply the deletion-contraction algorithm again:\n\nG2' has the following edges: 1-4, 1-6, 2-5, and 4-5.\nG2'' is obtained by merging vertices 1 and 2, and we get a graph with four vertices and the following edges: 1-4, 1-5, and 4-5.\n\nP(G1'', k) = P(G2', k) - P(G2'', k)\n\nFor G2', it is a tree with 5 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^4.\n\nFor G2'', it is a cycle with 4 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is (k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNow, we can find P(G1'', k):\n\nP(G1'', k) = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nAnd P(G', k):\n\nP(G', k) = k(k-1)^5 - [k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]\n\nFor G'', we can choose the edge 1-3 and apply the deletion-contraction algorithm again:\n\nG3' has the following edges: 1-4, 1-5, 4-5, and 5-6.\nG3'' is obtained by merging vertices 1 and 3, and we get a graph with four vertices and the following edges: 1-2, 1-5, 1-6, and 5-6.\n\nP(G'', k) = P(G3', k) - P(G3'', k)\n\nFor G3', it is a tree with 5 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^4.\n\nFor G3'', it is a cycle with 4 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is (k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNow, we can find P(G'', k):\n\nP(G'', k) = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nFinally, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)^5 - [k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]] - [k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^5 - k(k-1)^4 + (k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)^4 + (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^5 - 2k(k-1)^4 + 2(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G."
