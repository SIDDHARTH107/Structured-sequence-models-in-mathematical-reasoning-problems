    "message_2": "To find the complex numbers z such that f(z) = 0, we need to solve the quadratic equation z^2 - 4z - 5 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\nz = (4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2\nz = (4 ± √36) / 2\nz = (4 ± 6) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible solutions:\n\nz = (4 + 6) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\nz = (4 - 6) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1\n\nSo the complex numbers z that satisfy f(z) = 0 are z = 5 and z = -1."
