    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In a third-level Menger sponge, the process has been performed three times. \n\nFor a Menger sponge, the total surface area (SA) and volume (V) can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nSA = S * (20/3)^n\nV = S^3 * (8/27)^n\n\nwhere S is the side length of the original cube, n is the level of the Menger sponge, and SA and V are the surface area and volume, respectively.\n\nFor a third-level Menger sponge (n = 3) with a side length of 81 cm:\n\nSA = 81 * (20/3)^3\nSA ≈ 81 * (8000/27)\nSA ≈ 81 * 296.296296\nSA ≈ 24012 cm²\n\nV = 81^3 * (8/27)^3\nV ≈ 531441 * (512/19683)\nV ≈ 531441 * 0.026012\nV ≈ 13824 cm³\n\nSo, the total surface area of the third-level Menger sponge is approximately 24,012 cm², and the volume is approximately 13,824 cm³."
