    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and their opposite angles as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have:\n\na = 8 cm (opposite angle A = 60°)\nb = 10 cm (opposite angle B = 45°)\nc = ? (opposite angle C = 75°)\n\nWe can use the Law of Sines to find the length of the third side, c:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe have the values for a, b, A, and B, so we can find the ratio a/sin(A) or b/sin(B):\n\n8/sin(60°) = 10/sin(45°)\n\nNow, we can use this ratio to find the length of the third side, c:\n\nc/sin(75°) = 8/sin(60°)\n\nTo solve for c, we can multiply both sides by sin(75°):\n\nc = (8/sin(60°)) * sin(75°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for sin(60°) and sin(75°):\n\nc = (8/0.866) * 0.966\n\nc ≈ 9.24 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side opposite the angle of 75° is approximately 9.24 cm."
