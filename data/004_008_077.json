    "message_2": "To find the point on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 10, we first need to find the derivative of the given function, which represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe given function is y = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2.\n\nLet's find the derivative, dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^3)/dx - 4*d(x^2)/dx + 5*d(x)/dx - d(2)/dx\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, we want to find the point where the slope of the tangent line (dy/dx) is equal to 10:\n\n10 = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nLet's solve this quadratic equation for x:\n\n3x^2 - 8x + 5 - 10 = 0\n3x^2 - 8x - 5 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -8, and c = -5:\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4*3*(-5))) / (2*3)\nx = (8 ± √(64 + 60)) / 6\nx = (8 ± √124) / 6\n\nNow we have two possible x values:\n\nx1 = (8 + √124) / 6\nx2 = (8 - √124) / 6\n\nWe need to find the corresponding y values for these x values using the original function:\n\ny1 = (x1)^3 - 4(x1)^2 + 5(x1) - 2\ny2 = (x2)^3 - 4(x2)^2 + 5(x2) - 2\n\nSo, the points on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 10 are:\n\nP1(x1, y1) = ((8 + √124) / 6, y1)\nP2(x2, y2) = ((8 - √124) / 6, y2)"
