    "message_1": "Suppose two companies, A and B, are deciding whether to advertise on television or radio. If both companies advertise on TV, they will each earn a profit of $200. If both advertise on radio, they will each earn a profit of $100. If one advertises on TV and the other on radio, the company that advertises on TV will earn a profit of $300 and the company that advertises on radio will earn a profit of $50. What is the Nash Equilibrium for this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player can benefit from changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy. Let's analyze the possible strategies for both companies:\n\n1. Company A advertises on TV, Company B advertises on TV:\n   Profit A = $200, Profit B = $200\n\n2. Company A advertises on TV, Company B advertises on Radio:\n   Profit A = $300, Profit B = $50\n\n3. Company A advertises on Radio, Company B advertises on TV:\n   Profit A = $50, Profit B = $300\n\n4. Company A advertises on Radio, Company B advertises on Radio:\n   Profit A = $100, Profit B = $100\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for each company:\n\n- If Company A advertises on TV, Company B's best response is to advertise on TV as well (200 > 50).\n- If Company A advertises on Radio, Company B's best response is to advertise on TV (300 > 100).\n\n- If Company B advertises on TV, Company A's best response is to advertise on TV as well (200 > 50).\n- If Company B advertises on Radio, Company A's best response is to advertise on TV (300 > 100).\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium occurs when both companies choose their best response given the other company's strategy. In this case, the Nash Equilibrium is when both companies advertise on TV, as neither company can benefit from changing their strategy given the other company's strategy. So, the Nash Equilibrium is:\n\nCompany A advertises on TV, Company B advertises on TV:\nProfit A = $200, Profit B = $200"
