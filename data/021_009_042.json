    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain product. The production cost function is defined as C(x) = 100x^2 - 800x + 10,000, where x is the number of units that the company produces. Use the gradient descent method to find the minimum cost and the corresponding number of units that the company should produce to minimize the cost.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the cost function with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any given point.\n\nThe derivative of C(x) = 100x^2 - 800x + 10,000 with respect to x is:\n\nC'(x) = 200x - 800\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum cost. We will start with an initial guess for x and iteratively update it using the following formula:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * C'(x_old)\n\nWe will repeat this process until the change in x is very small, indicating that we have reached the minimum point.\n\nLet's choose an initial guess of x = 0 and a learning rate of 0.01. We will iterate until the change in x is less than 0.0001.\n\n1. x_old = 0\n2. C'(x_old) = 200 * 0 - 800 = -800\n3. x_new = 0 - 0.01 * (-800) = 8\n\nNow, we will repeat the process with x_new:\n\n1. x_old = 8\n2. C'(x_old) = 200 * 8 - 800 = 800\n3. x_new = 8 - 0.01 * 800 = 0\n\nSince the change in x is not less than 0.0001, we will continue the process:\n\n1. x_old = 0\n2. C'(x_old) = 200 * 0 - 800 = -800\n3. x_new = 0 - 0.01 * (-800) = 8\n\nWe can see that the value of x is oscillating between 0 and 8. This is because the learning rate is too high. Let's reduce the learning rate to 0.001 and start again with an initial guess of x = 0.\n\n1. x_old = 0\n2. C'(x_old) = 200 * 0 - 800 = -800\n3. x_new = 0 - 0.001 * (-800) = 0.8\n\nNow, we will repeat the process with x_new:\n\n1. x_old = 0.8\n2. C'(x_old) = 200 * 0.8 - 800 = -240\n3. x_new = 0.8 - 0.001 * (-240) = 1.04\n\nWe will continue this process until the change in x is less than 0.0001. After several iterations, we find that the minimum cost occurs when x is approximately 4.\n\nNow, we can plug this value of x back into the cost function to find the minimum cost:\n\nC(4) = 100 * 4^2 - 800 * 4 + 10,000 = 100 * 16 - 3200 + 10,000 = 1600 - 3200 + 10,000 = 8400\n\nSo, the company should produce approximately 4 units to minimize the cost, and the minimum cost is $8400."
