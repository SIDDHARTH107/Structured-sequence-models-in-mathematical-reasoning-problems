    "message_2": "To find the solution set for the inequality 2x + 5 > 9, we first need to isolate the variable x.\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n2x + 5 - 5 > 9 - 5\n2x > 4\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n2x / 2 > 4 / 2\nx > 2\n\nThe solution set for the inequality is x > 2. On the number line, this would be represented by an open circle at 2 and an arrow pointing to the right, indicating all values greater than 2 are part of the solution set."
