    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices of a graph G with 7 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the structure of the graph and the maximum degree of its vertices (i.e., the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the graph is a K7 graph, and the chromatic number (minimum number of colors required) is equal to the number of vertices, which is 7.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not a complete graph, the chromatic number can be lower. For example, if the graph is a tree or a cycle, the chromatic number is at most 3.\n\nIn summary, the minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices of G with 7 vertices can range from 2 to 7, depending on the structure of the graph."
