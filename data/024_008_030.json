    "message_2": "To compute the Ricci curvature, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\nΓijk = (1/2) * (gik_,j + gjk_,i - gij_,k)\n\nwhere i, j, and k range from 1 to 3, and the comma denotes partial differentiation with respect to the corresponding coordinate. Since the metric coefficients are constants, their partial derivatives are all zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\nΓijk = 0 for all i, j, k\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor, which is given by:\n\nRijkl = Γikj_,l - Γikl_,j + Γiml * Γmjk - Γimj * Γmlk\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Riemann curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nRijkl = 0 for all i, j, k, l\n\nFinally, we compute the Ricci curvature tensor, which is given by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\nRij = R^k_ikj = g^kl * Riklj\n\nSince the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, the Ricci curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nRij = 0 for all i, j\n\nThus, the Ricci curvature of M at any given point is zero."
