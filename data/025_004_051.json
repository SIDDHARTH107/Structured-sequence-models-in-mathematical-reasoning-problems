    "message_2": "A singular point on a curve is a point where the curve is not smooth, i.e., where the tangent is either not defined or is vertical. In this case, we are dealing with a rational curve, so we can find the derivative of the curve to determine if there are any singular points.\n\nGiven the equation $y = \\frac{x}{x+3}$, we can find the derivative $y'$ with respect to $x$ using the quotient rule:\n\n$y' = \\frac{(x+3)(1) - x(1)}{(x+3)^2} = \\frac{3}{(x+3)^2}$\n\nSince the denominator is always positive, the derivative is always defined and never zero. Therefore, there are no singular points on the curve $y = \\frac{x}{x+3}$."
