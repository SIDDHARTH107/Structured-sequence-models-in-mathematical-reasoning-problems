    "message_1": "Consider the dynamical system represented by the following equation: \nx_n+1 = 4x_n(1-x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the population proportion of a certain species in a habitat at discrete times n, with x_0 = 0.1.\n\nSuppose that due to a natural disaster, there is a 10% reduction in the initial population, such that x_0 = 0.09. How does the population proportion of the species change over time? Does the system exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions (i.e., the butterfly effect)?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the change in the population proportion of the species over time and to determine if the system exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions, we will compare the population proportions for the two initial conditions x_0 = 0.1 and x_0 = 0.09.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the first few iterations for both initial conditions:\n\nCase 1: x_0 = 0.1\nx_1 = 4 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.36\nx_2 = 4 * 0.36 * (1 - 0.36) = 0.9216\nx_3 = 4 * 0.9216 * (1 - 0.9216) ≈ 0.2890\nx_4 = 4 * 0.2890 * (1 - 0.2890) ≈ 0.8219\n\nCase 2: x_0 = 0.09\nx_1 = 4 * 0.09 * (1 - 0.09) = 0.3276\nx_2 = 4 * 0.3276 * (1 - 0.3276) ≈ 0.8837\nx_3 = 4 * 0.8837 * (1 - 0.8837) ≈ 0.4115\nx_4 = 4 * 0.4115 * (1 - 0.4115) ≈ 0.9665\n\nComparing the population proportions for the two initial conditions, we can see that they diverge significantly after just a few iterations:\n\nx_1: 0.36 vs 0.3276\nx_2: 0.9216 vs 0.8837\nx_3: 0.2890 vs 0.4115\nx_4: 0.8219 vs 0.9665\n\nThis indicates that the system exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the butterfly effect. Small changes in the initial population proportion lead to significant differences in the population proportions over time."
