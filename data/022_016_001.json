    "message_2": "The Riemann mapping theorem states that any simply connected open subset of the complex plane, which is not the whole plane, can be conformally mapped onto the open unit disc. In other words, there exists a bijective holomorphic function between the two regions.\n\nLet's consider the region between the curves $y=x^3$ and $y=x$. In the complex plane, we can represent this region as the set of points $z = x + iy$ such that $x^3 < y < x$. We want to find a conformal map $f(z)$ from this region to the unit disc $|w| < 1$.\n\nFirst, we can map the region to the upper half-plane by applying the transformation $g(z) = z^3$. The region between the curves will be mapped to the region between the lines $y = x^3$ and $y = x^9$. Now, we have a region in the upper half-plane, which is simply connected.\n\nNext, we can map the upper half-plane to the unit disc using the MÃ¶bius transformation $h(w) = \\frac{w - i}{w + i}$. This transformation maps the upper half-plane to the unit disc, and it is bijective and holomorphic.\n\nFinally, we can find the conformal map $f(z)$ by composing the transformations $g(z)$ and $h(w)$:\n\n$$f(z) = h(g(z)) = h(z^3) = \\frac{z^3 - i}{z^3 + i}$$\n\nThis function $f(z)$ is a conformal map from the region between the curves $y=x^3$ and $y=x$ to the unit disc."
