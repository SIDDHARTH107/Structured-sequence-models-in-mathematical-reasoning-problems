    "message_1": "A bird is perched on top of a tree 25 meters high. The bird spots a worm on the ground and flies down to catch it. If the angle of depression from the bird to the worm is 30 degrees, what is the distance between the bird and the worm? (Assume the ground is flat.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the tree's height as one leg (25 meters), the angle of depression (30 degrees), and we need to find the hypotenuse (the distance between the bird and the worm).\n\nWe can use the sine function to solve this problem:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side (tree's height) / hypotenuse (distance between bird and worm)\n\nsin(30 degrees) = 25 meters / hypotenuse\n\nTo find the sine of 30 degrees, we can use a calculator or recall that sin(30 degrees) = 1/2.\n\n1/2 = 25 meters / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse:\n\nhypotenuse = 25 meters / (1/2)\n\nhypotenuse = 25 meters * 2\n\nhypotenuse = 50 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the bird and the worm is 50 meters."
