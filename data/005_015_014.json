The data of 1000 customers is analyzed by a cluster analysis algorithm and divided into 3 clusters based on their usage patterns. The average monthly usage for each cluster is as follows:\n\nCluster 1: 300 voice minutes, 2 GB data\nCluster 2: 600 voice minutes, 4 GB data\nCluster 3: 900 voice minutes, 8 GB data\n\nIf a new customer's monthly usage is 400 voice minutes and 3 GB data, which cluster does he/she belong to according to the analysis?",
    "message_2": "To determine which cluster the new customer belongs to, we can calculate the Euclidean distance between the new customer's usage and the average usage of each cluster. The new customer will belong to the cluster with the smallest Euclidean distance.\n\nEuclidean distance formula: √((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)\n\nNew customer's usage: 400 voice minutes, 3 GB data\n\nCluster 1: 300 voice minutes, 2 GB data\nDistance to Cluster 1: √((400 - 300)^2 + (3 - 2)^2) = √((100)^2 + (1)^2) = √(10000 + 1) = √10001 ≈ 100.005\n\nCluster 2: 600 voice minutes, 4 GB data\nDistance to Cluster 2: √((400 - 600)^2 + (3 - 4)^2) = √((-200)^2 + (-1)^2) = √(40000 + 1) = √40001 ≈ 200.0025\n\nCluster 3: 900 voice minutes, 8 GB data\nDistance to Cluster 3: √((400 - 900)^2 + (3 - 8)^2) = √((-500)^2 + (-5)^2) = √(250000 + 25) = √250025 ≈ 500.025\n\nThe smallest distance is to Cluster 1 with a distance of approximately 100.005. Therefore, the new customer belongs to Cluster 1 according to the analysis."
