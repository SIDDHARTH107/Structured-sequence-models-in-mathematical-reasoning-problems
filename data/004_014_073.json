    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the cone around its height axis, we can use the method of integration. We will use the disk method, which involves integrating the area of each infinitesimally small disk along the height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equation of the line that represents the radius of the cone as a function of its height. Since the cone has a height of 10 cm and a base radius of 6 cm, we can use similar triangles to find the radius r at any height h:\n\nr/h = 6/10\nr = (3/5)h\n\nNow, we can find the area of a disk at height h with radius r:\n\nA(h) = πr^2 = π((3/5)h)^2 = (9π/25)h^2\n\nTo find the volume of the cone, we will integrate the area of each disk along the height of the cone from 0 to 10:\n\nV = ∫[0, 10] A(h) dh = ∫[0, 10] (9π/25)h^2 dh\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nV = (9π/25) ∫[0, 10] h^2 dh = (9π/25) * (1/3)h^3 |[0, 10]\n\nV = (3π/25) * (10^3 - 0^3) = (3π/25) * 1000 = 120π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the solid formed by rotating the cone around its height axis is 120π cm^3."
