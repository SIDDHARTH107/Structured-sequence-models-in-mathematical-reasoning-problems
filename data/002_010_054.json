    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. In this case, each side measures 5 cm and there are 6 sides.\n\nPerimeter = (side length) × (number of sides)\nPerimeter = 5 cm × 6\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular hexagon is 30 cm."
