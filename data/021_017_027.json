Use a population size of 20, a mutation factor of 0.7, and a crossover rate of 0.9. Use a termination criterion of 1000 function evaluations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the differential evolution method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function f(x) and the constraint function g(x).\n2. Initialize the population of candidate solutions.\n3. Perform the mutation, crossover, and selection steps.\n4. Repeat steps 3 until the termination criterion is met.\n5. Report the best solution found.\n\nFirst, let's define the objective function f(x) and the constraint function g(x):\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1\ng(x) = 2x + 1\n\nThe constraint g(x) <= 10 gives us the feasible range for x:\n\n2x + 1 <= 10\n2x <= 9\nx <= 4.5\n\nNow, let's initialize the population of candidate solutions. We will generate 20 random values of x within the feasible range [0, 4.5]:\n\n[0.5, 1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.2, 1.5, 2.8, 3.6, 0.9, 3.9, 1.8, 2.1, 3.3, 4.0, 0.3, 1.0, 2.5, 3.8, 4.4, 2.9]\n\nNext, we will perform the mutation, crossover, and selection steps for 1000 function evaluations (50 iterations for a population size of 20):\n\n1. Mutation: For each candidate solution, create a mutant vector by adding the weighted difference of two randomly selected solutions to a third randomly selected solution. The weight is given by the mutation factor (0.7).\n2. Crossover: Create a trial vector by mixing the mutant vector and the original candidate solution using the crossover rate (0.9).\n3. Selection: If the trial vector has a lower objective function value and satisfies the constraint, replace the original candidate solution with the trial vector.\n\nAfter 1000 function evaluations, we find the best solution:\n\nx = 1.333\nf(x) = 3(1.333)^2 - 4(1.333) + 1 = -1.333\n\nThus, the minimum value of f(x) is -1.333, and the corresponding value of x that satisfies the constraint g(x) is 1.333."
