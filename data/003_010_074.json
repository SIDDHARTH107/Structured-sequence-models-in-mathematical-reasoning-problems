    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation (θ) is the angle between the ground and the line from the top of the building to the end of the shadow.\n\nLet's call the height of the building (30 feet) the side opposite the angle (opposite side), and the length of the shadow (50 feet) the side adjacent to the angle (adjacent side).\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\ntan(θ) = 30 feet / 50 feet\n\ntan(θ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose tangent is 0.6. We can do this using the arctangent function (inverse tangent function):\n\nθ = arctan(0.6)\n\nθ ≈ 30.96 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation of the sun is approximately 31 degrees."
