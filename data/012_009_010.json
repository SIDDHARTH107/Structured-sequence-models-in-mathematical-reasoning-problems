    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 6 vertices and the following degree sequence: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1. Is this a valid degree sequence for a simple graph? Why or why not? If it is, draw a possible graph with this degree sequence.",
    "message_2": "Yes, this is a valid degree sequence for a simple graph. A simple graph is a graph with no loops and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. A degree sequence is valid if it satisfies the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10, which is an even number, so it satisfies the Handshaking Lemma.\n\nA possible graph with this degree sequence can be drawn as follows:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n2. Connect vertex A to vertices B, C, and D (A has degree 3).\n3. Connect vertex B to vertex E (B has degree 2).\n4. Connect vertex C to vertex F (C has degree 2).\n5. Vertices D, E, and F have degree 1, so they are connected to only one other vertex.\n\nThe graph can be represented with the following adjacency list:\n\nA: B, C, D\nB: A, E\nC: A, F\nD: A\nE: B\nF: C\n\nThis graph has 6 vertices and 5 edges, and it has the given degree sequence."
