    "message_1": "Let f(t) be a continuous function defined by f(t) = cos(3t) + 2sin(5t) on the interval [-π, π]. Find the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t).",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t), we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince f(t) is only defined on the interval [-π, π], the function is zero outside this interval. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt] from -π to π\n\nNow, substitute the given function f(t) = cos(3t) + 2sin(5t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(cos(3t) + 2sin(5t)) * e^(-jωt) dt] from -π to π\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) dt] from -π to π + ∫[2sin(5t) * e^(-jωt) dt] from -π to π\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) dt] = ∫[cos(3t) * (cos(-ωt) + jsin(-ωt)) dt]\n= ∫[cos(3t)cos(-ωt) dt] - j∫[cos(3t)sin(-ωt) dt]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\n∫[cos(3t)cos(-ωt) dt] = (1/3)sin(3t)cos(-ωt) - (1/ω)∫[-sin(3t)sin(-ωt) dt] from -π to π\n= (1/3ω)[sin(3t)(ωcos(3t) + 3sin(ωt))] from -π to π\n\nThe second integral:\n\n∫[2sin(5t) * e^(-jωt) dt] = 2∫[sin(5t) * (cos(-ωt) + jsin(-ωt)) dt]\n= 2∫[sin(5t)cos(-ωt) dt] + 2j∫[sin(5t)sin(-ωt) dt]\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\n2∫[sin(5t)cos(-ωt) dt] = -2(1/5)cos(5t)cos(-ωt) - 2(1/ω)∫[-cos(5t)sin(-ωt) dt] from -π to π\n= (-2/5ω)[cos(5t)(ωcos(5t) + 5sin(ωt))] from -π to π\n\nNow, combine the results:\n\nF(ω) = (1/3ω)[sin(3t)(ωcos(3t) + 3sin(ωt))] from -π to π - j(1/ω)∫[cos(3t)sin(-ωt) dt] from -π to π - (2/5ω)[cos(5t)(ωcos(5t) + 5sin(ωt))] from -π to π + 2j(1/ω)∫[sin(5t)sin(-ωt) dt] from -π to π\n\nSince the function f(t) is continuous and periodic, the Fourier transform F(ω) will be zero at all ω except ω = ±3 and ω = ±5. Therefore, we can write F(ω) as a sum of Dirac delta functions:\n\nF(ω) = Aδ(ω - 3) + Bδ(ω + 3) + Cδ(ω - 5) + Dδ(ω + 5)\n\nTo find the coefficients A, B, C, and D, we can evaluate F(ω) at ω = ±3 and ω = ±5:\n\nA = F(3) = (1/3)(π)\nB = F(-3) = -(1/3)(π)\nC = F(5) = -(2/5)(π)\nD = F(-5) = (2/5)(π)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t) is:\n\nF(ω) = (π/3)δ(ω - 3) - (π/3)δ(ω + 3) - (2π/5)δ(ω - 5) + (2π/5)δ(ω + 5)"
