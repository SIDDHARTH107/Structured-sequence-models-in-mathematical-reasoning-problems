    "message_2": "Kuratowski's Theorem states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (the complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (the complete bipartite graph on 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nTo determine if G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 12 and E = 20. To check if G is planar, we need to find the maximum number of edges (E_max) that a planar graph with 12 vertices can have. We can use the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in V = 12, we get:\n\nE_max ≤ 3(12) - 6 = 30\n\nSince E = 20 is less than E_max = 30, it is possible that G is planar. However, we still need to check for the presence of a K5 or K3,3 subgraph to confirm this.\n\nFor a graph to contain a K5 subgraph, it must have at least 5 vertices with a degree of 4 or more. In our case, the maximum degree of any vertex in G is:\n\nd_max = (2 * E) / V = (2 * 20) / 12 ≈ 3.33\n\nSince d_max < 4, G cannot contain a K5 subgraph.\n\nFor a graph to contain a K3,3 subgraph, it must have at least 6 vertices with a degree of 3 or more. In our case, the average degree of any vertex in G is:\n\nd_avg = (2 * E) / V = (2 * 20) / 12 ≈ 3.33\n\nSince d_avg > 3, it is possible that G contains a K3,3 subgraph. However, we do not have enough information to determine this conclusively.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine whether G is planar or not using Kuratowski's Theorem. We would need more information about the specific structure of G to make a determination."
