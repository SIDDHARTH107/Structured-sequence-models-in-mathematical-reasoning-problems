The cost of the material for the top and bottom of the box is $0.10 per square inch while the material for the sides is $0.05 per square inch. What are the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the box be length (L), width (W), and height (H). The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = L * W * H = 5000 cubic inches\n\nThe cost of the material for the top and bottom of the box is $0.10 per square inch, and the cost of the material for the sides is $0.05 per square inch. Therefore, the total cost (C) of the materials can be represented as:\n\nC = 0.10 * (2 * L * W) + 0.05 * (2 * L * H + 2 * W * H)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost of materials, so we need to find the dimensions L, W, and H that minimize the cost function C.\n\nFirst, we can express H in terms of L and W using the volume equation:\n\nH = 5000 / (L * W)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for H into the cost function:\n\nC = 0.10 * (2 * L * W) + 0.05 * (2 * L * (5000 / (L * W)) + 2 * W * (5000 / (L * W)))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC = 0.20 * L * W + 0.10 * (10000 / W + 10000 / L)\n\nNow we need to find the critical points of the cost function by taking the partial derivatives with respect to L and W and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂C/∂L = 0.20 * W - 0.10 * (10000 / L^2) = 0\n∂C/∂W = 0.20 * L - 0.10 * (10000 / W^2) = 0\n\nSolve these equations simultaneously to find the optimal dimensions L and W:\n\nL = 5000 / (W * H)\nW = 5000 / (L * H)\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n\nL = 5000 / (5000 / (L * H) * H)\n\nSimplify:\n\nL^2 = 5000\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nL = W = sqrt(5000)\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the equation for H:\n\nH = 5000 / (L * W) = 5000 / (sqrt(5000) * sqrt(5000)) = 5000 / 5000 = 1\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials are:\n\nLength (L) = sqrt(5000) inches ≈ 70.71 inches\nWidth (W) = sqrt(5000) inches ≈ 70.71 inches\nHeight (H) = 1 inch"
