    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products P1 and P2 which require two types of machines M1 and M2 to produce. One unit of product P1 requires 3 hours of machine M1 time and 2 hours of machine M2 time. One unit of product P2 requires 2 hours of M1 time and 1 hour of M2 time. The company has 180 hours of M1 time and 120 hours of M2 time available per week. The profit per unit of P1 is $5 and the profit per unit of P2 is $4. Determine the number of units of each product the company should produce each week to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product P1 and y be the number of units of product P2.\n\nThe constraints for the available machine hours are:\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 (M1 time constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 120 (M2 time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 5x + 4y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 180\ny ≤ (180 - 3x) / 2\n\n2x + y ≤ 120\ny ≤ 120 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,60), (40,40), and (60,0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. (0,0): Profit = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\n2. (0,60): Profit = 5(0) + 4(60) = $240\n3. (40,40): Profit = 5(40) + 4(40) = $360\n4. (60,0): Profit = 5(60) + 4(0) = $300\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (40,40), where the company should produce 40 units of product P1 and 40 units of product P2 each week to maximize their profit of $360."
