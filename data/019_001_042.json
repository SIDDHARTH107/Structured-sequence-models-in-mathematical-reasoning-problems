    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the truth values of the individual propositions:\n\np: 2 + 2 = 4 (True)\nq: 3 x 5 = 15 (True)\nr: 2 + 3 = 6 (False)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the compound proposition (p ∧ q) → r:\n\n1. (p ∧ q) means both p and q must be true. Since both p and q are true, (p ∧ q) is True.\n2. Now we have (True) → r. Since r is False, the compound proposition (True) → (False) is False.\n\nSo, the truth value of the compound proposition (p ∧ q) → r is False."
