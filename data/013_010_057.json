    "message_1": "Consider two firms A and B competing in a Cournot market with a total demand of Q = 100. The firms have identical marginal cost c = 20. Firm A can produce a maximum of QA = 40 units, while firm B can produce a maximum of QB = 50 units. \n\nWhat is the Nash Equilibrium output and profit for each firm?",
    "message_2": "In a Cournot competition, firms choose their output levels simultaneously, taking into account the output of the other firm. The profit function for each firm is given by:\n\nπA = (P - c) * QA\nπB = (P - c) * QB\n\nWhere P is the market price, c is the marginal cost, and QA and QB are the output levels of firms A and B, respectively. The market price is determined by the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 100 - Q\nQ = QA + QB\n\nFirst, we need to find the reaction functions for each firm. These functions show the optimal output for each firm, given the output of the other firm. To find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to each firm's output, taking the other firm's output as given.\n\nFor firm A, we have:\n\nπA = (100 - QA - QB - 20) * QA\nπA = 80QA - QA^2 - QA*QB\n\nTo maximize πA, we take the first derivative with respect to QA and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(πA)/dQA = 80 - 2QA - QB = 0\n\nSolving for QA, we get the reaction function for firm A:\n\nQA = (80 - QB) / 2\n\nFor firm B, we have:\n\nπB = (100 - QA - QB - 20) * QB\nπB = 80QB - QB^2 - QA*QB\n\nTo maximize πB, we take the first derivative with respect to QB and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(πB)/dQB = 80 - 2QB - QA = 0\n\nSolving for QB, we get the reaction function for firm B:\n\nQB = (80 - QA) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the Nash Equilibrium by solving the two reaction functions simultaneously, considering the capacity constraints of each firm:\n\nQA = (80 - QB) / 2\nQB = (80 - QA) / 2\n\nQA ≤ 40\nQB ≤ 50\n\nFirst, let's assume that both firms are not producing at their maximum capacity. In this case, we can solve the reaction functions simultaneously:\n\nQA = (80 - (80 - QA) / 2) / 2\nQA = (80 - 40 + QA/2) / 2\nQA = 20 + QA/4\n3QA/4 = 20\nQA = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nQB = (80 - QA) / 2\nQB = (80 - 80/3) / 2\nQB = 160/6 ≈ 26.67\n\nHowever, this solution violates the capacity constraint for firm A (QA ≤ 40). Therefore, we need to consider the case where firm A produces at its maximum capacity:\n\nQA = 40\n\nNow, we can find the output of firm B using its reaction function:\n\nQB = (80 - QA) / 2\nQB = (80 - 40) / 2\nQB = 20\n\nSo, the Nash Equilibrium output levels are QA = 40 and QB = 20.\n\nNow, we can find the market price and profit for each firm:\n\nP = 100 - Q\nP = 100 - (40 + 20)\nP = 40\n\nπA = (P - c) * QA\nπA = (40 - 20) * 40\nπA = 20 * 40\nπA = 800\n\nπB = (P - c) * QB\nπB = (40 - 20) * 20\nπB = 20 * 20\nπB = 400\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium profit for firm A is 800, and for firm B is 400."
