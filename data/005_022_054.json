    "message_1": "A math student is conducting a statistical analysis on a set of data that contains some outliers. To make the analysis more robust, the student wants to use the median instead of the mean. The data set contains 11 numbers: \n\n{17, 22, 19, 23, 25, 28, 21, 23, 24, 85, 20}\n\nWhat is the median of this data set?",
    "message_2": "To find the median of the data set, first, we need to arrange the numbers in ascending order:\n\n{17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 28, 85}\n\nSince there are 11 numbers in the data set (an odd number), the median is the middle number. In this case, the median is the 6th number:\n\n17, 19, 20, 21, 22, (23), 23, 24, 25, 28, 85\n\nThe median of this data set is 23."
