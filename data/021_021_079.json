    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6\n2. Set the domain of the function as [0, 10]\n3. Initialize the population of nests (solutions) and their fitness values\n4. Define the parameters for the algorithm, such as the number of iterations, the number of nests, and the probability of discovering a better solution\n5. Perform the search and update the nests and their fitness values\n6. Find the nest with the best fitness value (minimum value of the function)\n\nLet's assume we have 5 nests and we will perform 20 iterations. We will use a probability of discovering a better solution of 0.25.\n\nInitialization:\n- Generate 5 random solutions (nests) within the domain [0, 10] and calculate their fitness values (f(x))\n\nIteration:\n- For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n  1. Generate a new solution by modifying the current solution using a random walk\n  2. If the new solution is within the domain and has a better fitness value, replace the current solution with the new solution\n  3. With a probability of 0.25, choose a random nest and replace it with a new solution if the new solution has a better fitness value\n\nAfter 20 iterations, find the nest with the best fitness value (minimum value of the function).\n\nNote that the cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution may not be the exact minimum value of the function. However, it should be close to the true minimum value. The true minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 can be found by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 5 = 0\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nf(2.5) = (2.5)^2 - 5(2.5) + 6 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 6 = -0.25\n\nThe true minimum value of the function is -0.25 at x = 2.5. The cuckoo search algorithm should provide a solution close to this value."
