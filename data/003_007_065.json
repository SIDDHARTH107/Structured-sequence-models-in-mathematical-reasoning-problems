    "message_2": "We will use the Law of Cosines to find the largest angle in the triangle. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 11. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a = 7, b = 9, and c = 11, and the angles opposite these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. We want to find angle C.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (a² + b² - c²) / (2ab)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of a, b, and c:\n\ncos(C) = (7² + 9² - 11²) / (2 * 7 * 9)\ncos(C) = (49 + 81 - 121) / (126)\ncos(C) = (9) / (126)\n\nNow, we can find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(9/126)\nC ≈ 82.82°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 83°."
