    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company in a year, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, financial frauds) that occur in a fixed interval of time (one year) with a known average rate (once every 5 years).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events per time interval (in this case, 1/5 per year)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 1 financial fraud)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of 1 financial fraud occurring in a year, so k = 1. The average rate of financial frauds is once every 5 years, so λ = 1/5.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-1/5) * (1/5)^1) / 1!\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.2) * 0.2) / 1\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that e^(-0.2) ≈ 0.81873. Now, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 1) ≈ (0.81873 * 0.2) / 1\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.16375\n\nSo, the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company in a year is approximately 0.16375, or 16.375%."
