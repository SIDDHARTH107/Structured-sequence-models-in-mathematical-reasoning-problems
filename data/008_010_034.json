    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write down the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  4 |\n|  4 -2  3 | -7 |\n|  6  1  1 |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms from the second and third rows. To do this, we can perform the following row operations:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  4 |\n|  0 -8  5 | -15 |\n|  0 -8  4 | -11 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y terms from the third row. To do this, we can perform the following row operation:\n\nR3 = R3 - R2\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  4 |\n|  0 -8  5 | -15 |\n|  0  0 -1 |  4 |\n\nStep 3: Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n-1z = 4\nz = -4\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-8y + 5(-4) = -15\n-8y - 20 = -15\n-8y = 5\ny = -5/8\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n2x + 3(-5/8) - (-4) = 4\n2x - 15/8 + 32/8 = 4\n2x + 17/8 = 4\n2x = 15/8\nx = 15/16\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 15/16, y = -5/8, z = -4"
