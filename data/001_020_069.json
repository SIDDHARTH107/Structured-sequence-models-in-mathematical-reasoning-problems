    "message_2": "To find the equation to graph the given absolute value equation, first, we need to isolate the absolute value expression. The given equation is:\n\n|x-2| + 3 = 5\n\nNow, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n|x-2| = 5 - 3\n\n|x-2| = 2\n\nNow, we have two possible cases for the absolute value expression:\n\nCase 1: x-2 = 2\nCase 2: -(x-2) = 2\n\nNow, solve each case for x:\n\nCase 1: x-2 = 2\nx = 2 + 2\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: -(x-2) = 2\n-x + 2 = 2\n-x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are 0 and 4. To graph the equation, plot these points on the x-axis and draw a V-shaped graph connecting them. The equation to graph the absolute value equation is |x-2| = 2."
