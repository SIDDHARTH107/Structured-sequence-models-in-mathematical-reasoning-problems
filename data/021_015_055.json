    "message_2": "To solve this problem using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (i.e., the value of f(x) for each particle's position).\n3. Update each particle's personal best position if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if a particle's personal best position has a better fitness.\n5. Update the velocities and positions of the particles based on their personal best and the global best positions.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently small change in the global best position).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO to minimize f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 7 in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x**2 + 3 * x + 7\n\ndef pso(num_particles, num_iterations, search_space):\n    particles = [{'position': random.uniform(search_space[0], search_space[1]),\n                  'velocity': random.uniform(-1, 1),\n                  'best_position': None,\n                  'best_fitness': float('inf')}\n                 for _ in range(num_particles)]\n\n    global_best_position = None\n    global_best_fitness = float('inf')\n\n    for _ in range(num_iterations):\n        for particle in particles:\n            fitness = f(particle['position'])\n\n            if fitness < particle['best_fitness']:\n                particle['best_fitness'] = fitness\n                particle['best_position'] = particle['position']\n\n            if fitness < global_best_fitness:\n                global_best_fitness = fitness\n                global_best_position = particle['position']\n\n            w = 0.7  # inertia weight\n            c1 = 2  # cognitive weight\n            c2 = 2  # social weight\n\n            r1 = random.random()\n            r2 = random.random()\n\n            particle['velocity'] = (w * particle['velocity'] +\n                                    c1 * r1 * (particle['best_position'] - particle['position']) +\n                                    c2 * r2 * (global_best_position - particle['position']))\n\n            particle['position'] += particle['velocity']\n\n            # Ensure the particle stays within the search space\n            particle['position'] = np.clip(particle['position'], search_space[0], search_space[1])\n\n    return global_best_position, global_best_fitness\n\nx_min, f_min = pso(num_particles=30, num_iterations=100, search_space=(-5, 5))\nprint(f\"Minimum value of f(x) = {f_min} at x = {x_min}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation should give you an approximate value of x that minimizes f(x) within the search space [-5, 5]. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of PSO."
