    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of the fence, we need to calculate the cost of the fence for the two shorter sides and the two longer sides separately and then add them together.\n\nFor the two shorter sides (20 meters each), the cost is $10 per meter:\n2 sides * 20 meters * $10/meter = $400\n\nFor the two longer sides (30 meters each), the cost is $15 per meter:\n2 sides * 30 meters * $15/meter = $900\n\nNow, add the cost of the shorter sides and the longer sides together to find the minimum cost of the fence:\n$400 + $900 = $1300\n\nThe minimum cost of the fence is $1300."
