    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of graph G with k colors. We will find P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\nFirst, let's label the edges as follows:\n- e1 connects vertex 1 and vertex 2\n- e2 connects vertex 1 and vertex 3\n- e3 connects vertex 2 and vertex 3\n- e4 connects vertex 2 and vertex 4\n- e5 connects vertex 3 and vertex 4\n- e6 connects vertex 3 and vertex 5\n- e7 connects vertex 4 and vertex 5\n\nNow, we can apply the deletion-contraction algorithm on edge e1:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e1, k) - P(G / e1, k)\n\nG - e1 is the graph obtained by deleting edge e1. The graph G - e1 has the same structure as G, but without edge e1. \n\nG / e1 is the graph obtained by contracting edge e1. This means we merge vertex 1 and vertex 2 into a single vertex, say vertex 12, and remove edge e1. The new graph G / e1 has 4 vertices and the following edges:\n- Vertex 12 is connected to vertex 3 and vertex 4\n- Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 4 and vertex 5\n- Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5\n\nNow, we can apply the deletion-contraction algorithm on edge e3 in graph G - e1:\n\nP(G - e1, k) = P((G - e1) - e3, k) - P((G - e1) / e3, k)\n\n(G - e1) - e3 is the graph obtained by deleting edge e3 from G - e1. The graph (G - e1) - e3 has the same structure as G - e1, but without edge e3. This graph is a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^(n-1) where n is the number of vertices, which is 5 in this case.\n\nP((G - e1) - e3, k) = k(k-1)^4\n\n(G - e1) / e3 is the graph obtained by contracting edge e3 in G - e1. This means we merge vertex 2 and vertex 3 into a single vertex, say vertex 23, and remove edge e3. The new graph (G - e1) / e3 has 4 vertices and the following edges:\n- Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 23\n- Vertex 23 is connected to vertex 4 and vertex 5\n- Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5\n\nThis graph is also a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^(n-1) where n is the number of vertices, which is 4 in this case.\n\nP((G - e1) / e3, k) = k(k-1)^3\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the equation for P(G - e1, k):\n\nP(G - e1, k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3\n\nNext, we need to find P(G / e1, k). The graph G / e1 is a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)^(n-1) where n is the number of vertices, which is 4 in this case.\n\nP(G / e1, k) = k(k-1)^3\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the equation for P(G, k):\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e1, k) - P(G / e1, k)\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3] - k(k-1)^3\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - 2k(k-1)^3\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - 2k(k-1)^3."
