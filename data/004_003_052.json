    "message_1": "A metal box with no top is to be made from an 8-inch by 14-inch sheet of metal by cutting equal squares from each corner and folding up the sides. What is the maximum volume of the box?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner. After cutting the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be (8-2x) inches in length, (14-2x) inches in width, and x inches in height.\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as the product of its dimensions:\n\nV(x) = x(8-2x)(14-2x)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of this function by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (8-2x)(14-2x) - 2x(8-2x) - 2x(14-2x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the expression:\n\nV'(x) = -8x^2 + 44x - 112\n\nNow, set V'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-8x^2 + 44x - 112 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by -8:\n\nx^2 - 5.5x + 14 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the critical points:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -5.5, and c = 14:\n\nx = (5.5 ± √((-5.5)^2 - 4(1)(14))) / 2(1)\nx = (5.5 ± √(30.25 - 56)) / 2\nx = (5.5 ± √(-25.75)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. However, we can find the maximum volume by completing the square:\n\nx^2 - 5.5x + 14 = 0\nx^2 - 5.5x + (5.5/2)^2 = 14 - (5.5/2)^2\n(x - 2.75)^2 = 2.0625\n\nThe maximum volume occurs when x = 2.75 inches. Now, we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength = 8 - 2(2.75) = 2.5 inches\nWidth = 14 - 2(2.75) = 8.5 inches\nHeight = 2.75 inches\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum volume:\n\nV_max = 2.5 * 8.5 * 2.75 = 58.59375 cubic inches"
