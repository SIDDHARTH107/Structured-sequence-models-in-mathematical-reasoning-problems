    "message_2": "To find the solitary wave solution for the given Nonlinear Schrödinger equation, we can use the ansatz method. We assume that the solution has the form:\n\nu(x,t) = A(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t)))\n\nwhere A(t), B(t), and C(t) are functions of time t. Now, we will substitute this ansatz into the given equation and find the functions A(t), B(t), and C(t).\n\nFirst, let's find the necessary derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂t = A'(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) - B'(t) A(t) (x - C(t)) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) tanh(B(t)(x - C(t))) + C'(t) A(t) B(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) tanh(B(t)(x - C(t)))\n\n∂u/∂x = -A(t) B(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) tanh(B(t)(x - C(t)))\n\n∂²u/∂x² = A(t) B(t)² sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) (2 tanh(B(t)(x - C(t)))² - 1)\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives into the given equation:\n\ni (A'(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) - B'(t) A(t) (x - C(t)) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) tanh(B(t)(x - C(t))) + C'(t) A(t) B(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) tanh(B(t)(x - C(t)))) + A(t) B(t)² sech(B(t)(x - C(t))) (2 tanh(B(t)(x - C(t)))² - 1) = 2 |A(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t)))|² (A(t) sech(B(t)(x - C(t))))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation and compare the coefficients of the same functions:\n\ni A'(t) = 2 |A(t)|² A(t)\ni B'(t) A(t) (x - C(t)) = 2 |A(t)|² A(t) B(t)² (x - C(t))\ni C'(t) A(t) B(t) = 2 |A(t)|² A(t) B(t)²\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\nA'(t) = 2i |A(t)|² A(t)\n\nNow, let's solve this differential equation for A(t):\n\ndA/dt = 2i |A(t)|² A(t)\n\ndA/A(t) = 2i |A(t)|² dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(A(t)) = i |A(0)|² t + C1\n\nA(t) = A(0) exp(i |A(0)|² t)\n\nSince u(x,0) = sech(x), we have A(0) = 1. Therefore, A(t) = exp(i t).\n\nNow, from the second and third equations, we can see that B'(t) = 0 and C'(t) = 0. This means that B(t) and C(t) are constants. Since u(x,0) = sech(x), we have B(0) = 1 and C(0) = 0. Therefore, B(t) = 1 and C(t) = 0.\n\nNow we have all the functions A(t), B(t), and C(t):\n\nA(t) = exp(i t)\nB(t) = 1\nC(t) = 0\n\nSo, the solitary wave solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = exp(i t) sech(x)\n\nNow, we can find the value of u(x=0,t=1):\n\nu(0,1) = exp(i * 1) sech(0) = exp(i) * 1\n\nTo find the value correct to 3 decimal places, we can use Euler's formula:\n\nexp(i) = cos(1) + i sin(1)\n\nu(0,1) = cos(1) + i sin(1) ≈ 0.540 + 0.841i\n\nSo, the value of u(x=0,t=1) is approximately 0.540 + 0.841i."
