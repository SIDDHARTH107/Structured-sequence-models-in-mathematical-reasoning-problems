    "message_1": "A lighthouse is situated on a cliff that is 120 feet above the level of the sea. From the top of the lighthouse, an observer can see a ship coming straight towards the lighthouse. If the ship is 2 miles away from the cliff, find the distance between the ship and the foot of the cliff to the nearest foot. Assume the angle of depression from the observer to the ship is 18 degrees.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the ship and the foot of the cliff as x. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of depression, the height of the cliff, and the distance x.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the cliff (120 feet), and the adjacent side is the distance x.\n\nWe have:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nSince the angle of depression is 18 degrees, we can write:\n\ntan(18°) = 120 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 120 / tan(18°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 120 / 0.3249197\nx ≈ 369.1 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the ship and the foot of the cliff is approximately 369 feet."
