    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (-1, 0, 0), we need to find the gradient of the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xyz - 1. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇F(x, y, z) = (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dx = 2x + yz\ndF/dy = 2y + xz\ndF/dz = 2z + xy\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gradient at the point (-1, 0, 0):\n\n∇F(-1, 0, 0) = (2(-1) + 0*0, 2*0 + (-1)*0, 2*0 + (-1)*0) = (-2, 0, 0)\n\nThe gradient vector ∇F(-1, 0, 0) = (-2, 0, 0) is the normal vector to the tangent plane at the point (-1, 0, 0). Therefore, the equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\n-2(x - (-1)) + 0(y - 0) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-2(x + 1) = 0\n\nSo the equation of the tangent plane is:\n\nx + 1 = 0"
