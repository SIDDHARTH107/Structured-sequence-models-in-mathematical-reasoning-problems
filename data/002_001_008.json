    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8 cm and height of 12 cm. What is its area in cm²?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 cm × 12 cm) / 2\n\nArea = (96 cm²) / 2\n\nArea = 48 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 48 cm²."
