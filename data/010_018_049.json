    "message_2": "To find the number of critical points of index 3, we can simply subtract the number of critical points of the other indices from the total number of critical points in the Morse-Smale complex.\n\nTotal critical points = 20\nIndex 0 critical points = 4\nIndex 1 critical points = 8\nIndex 2 critical points = 8\n\nSo, the number of index 3 critical points is:\n\n20 - 4 - 8 - 8 = 0\n\nThere are 0 critical points of index 3 in this Morse-Smale complex."
