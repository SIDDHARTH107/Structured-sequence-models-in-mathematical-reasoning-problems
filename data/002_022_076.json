    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 8 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm. What is the total volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the minor radius of the torus and major_radius is the major radius of the torus.\n\nIn this case, the minor radius is 4 cm and the major radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 8)\nVolume = (π * 16) * (16 * π)\nVolume = 256 * π^2\n\nThe total volume of the torus is approximately 804.25 cm^3 (rounded to two decimal places)."
