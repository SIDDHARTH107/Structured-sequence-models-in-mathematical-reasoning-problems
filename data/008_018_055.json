The table below shows the amount of each raw material used to produce each product and the total available amount of raw material.\n\n| Raw Material/Product | A | B | C | Available |\n|----------------------|---|---|---|-----------|\n| X                    | 3 | 2 | 4 | 30        |\n| Y                    | 1 | 4 | 2 | 28        |\n\nThe factory wants to know how many units of each product they can produce without running out of any raw material. \nUsing block matrices, solve the system of linear equations to determine the maximum number of units of each product the factory can produce.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using block matrices, we first need to set up the system of linear equations. Let a, b, and c represent the number of units of products A, B, and C, respectively. The equations can be written as:\n\n3a + 2b + 4c ≤ 30 (Raw material X constraint)\n1a + 4b + 2c ≤ 28 (Raw material Y constraint)\n\nNow, we can represent this system of linear equations using block matrices:\n\n[3 2 4] [a]   [30]\n[1 4 2] [b] ≤ [28]\n\nWe can rewrite this inequality as an equality by introducing slack variables s1 and s2:\n\n3a + 2b + 4c + s1 = 30\n1a + 4b + 2c + s2 = 28\n\nNow, we can represent this system of linear equations using block matrices:\n\n[3 2 4 1 0] [a]   [30]\n[1 4 2 0 1] [b] = [28]\n            [c]\n            [s1]\n            [s2]\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of linear equations. Since it's a 2x5 matrix, we can use the simplex method to solve it. However, the simplex method is beyond the scope of this answer. Instead, we can use trial and error to find the maximum number of units of each product the factory can produce without running out of any raw material.\n\nLet's start by producing only product A:\n\na = 10, b = 0, c = 0 (30/3 = 10)\n\nNow, let's try producing only product B:\n\na = 0, b = 7, c = 0 (28/4 = 7)\n\nFinally, let's try producing only product C:\n\na = 0, b = 0, c = 7.5 (30/4 = 7.5)\n\nHowever, since we cannot produce half a unit of product C, we need to round down to the nearest whole number:\n\na = 0, b = 0, c = 7\n\nNow, let's compare the total raw materials used in each case:\n\n1. Only product A: 30 units of X and 10 units of Y\n2. Only product B: 14 units of X and 28 units of Y\n3. Only product C: 28 units of X and 14 units of Y\n\nThe factory can produce the maximum number of units without running out of any raw material by producing only product B. Therefore, the factory can produce a maximum of 7 units of product B."
