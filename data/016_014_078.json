    "message_2": "The self-similarity dimension (D) of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, after each iteration, the number of line segments increases by a factor of 4, so N = 4. The scaling factor for the Lévy C curve is 2 (each new segment is half the length of the previous segment), so s = 2.\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the self-similarity dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(2) = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nThe self-similarity dimension of the Lévy C curve is 2. Note that this value is independent of the number of iterations and the initial line segment length."
