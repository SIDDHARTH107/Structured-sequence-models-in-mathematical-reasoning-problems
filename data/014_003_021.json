    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using ElGamal encryption. Alice selects the prime number p as 17 and the primitive root g as 3. Alice's private key is x = 4, and her public key is y = g^x mod p. Alice wants to send the message m = 5 to Bob. She selects Bob's public key as B = 11. \n\nFind the cipher text C1 and C2 resulting from Alice's encryption of the message using ElGamal encryption. Then, show how Bob can decrypt the message using his private key b = 13.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find Alice's public key y:\ny = g^x mod p\ny = 3^4 mod 17\ny = 81 mod 17\ny = 13\n\nNow, Alice will use Bob's public key B = 11 to encrypt the message m = 5. She will also need to choose a random number k. Let's say k = 2.\n\nTo compute the ciphertext, we need to find C1 and C2:\nC1 = g^k mod p\nC1 = 3^2 mod 17\nC1 = 9 mod 17\nC1 = 9\n\nC2 = (m * B^k) mod p\nC2 = (5 * 11^2) mod 17\nC2 = (5 * 121) mod 17\nC2 = 605 mod 17\nC2 = 7\n\nSo, the ciphertext (C1, C2) is (9, 7).\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message using Bob's private key b = 13.\n\nTo find the original message m, we need to compute:\nm = (C2 * (C1^b)^(-1)) mod p\n\nFirst, let's find C1^b mod p:\nC1^b mod p = 9^13 mod 17\nC1^b mod p = 2541865828329 mod 17\nC1^b mod p = 16\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of C1^b mod p, which is (C1^b)^(-1) mod p:\n16^(-1) mod 17\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse:\ngcd(16, 17) = 1 = 16 * (-1) + 17 * 1\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 16 mod 17 is -1 (which is equivalent to 16 in mod 17).\n\nNow, we can find the original message m:\nm = (C2 * (C1^b)^(-1)) mod p\nm = (7 * 16) mod 17\nm = 112 mod 17\nm = 5\n\nThus, Bob successfully decrypted the message, and the original message is m = 5."
