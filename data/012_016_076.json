    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of a graph G with 5 vertices and 7 edges, we need to consider the number of connected components (k) and the number of cycles (c) in the graph. The Tutte polynomial is defined as:\n\nT(x, y) = (x-1)^(k-c) * (y-1)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nSince G has 5 vertices and 7 edges, it must be connected (as a connected graph with 5 vertices has at least 4 edges). Therefore, k = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the number of cycles in the graph. A graph with n vertices and m edges has c = m - n + k cycles. In our case, n = 5, m = 7, and k = 1, so:\n\nc = 7 - 5 + 1 = 3\n\nNow, we can find the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT(x, y) = (x-1)^(1-3) * (y-1)^(5-1)\nT(x, y) = (x-1)^(-2) * (y-1)^4\n\nThe Tutte polynomial of the given graph G with 5 vertices and 7 edges is T(x, y) = (x-1)^(-2) * (y-1)^4."
