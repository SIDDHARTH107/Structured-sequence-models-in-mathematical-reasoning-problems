    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of the number 693 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 693.\n2. Initialize two variables x and y with random values, say x = 2 and y = 2.\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x: x = f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 693.\n   b. Update y: y = f(f(y)) = (y^2 + 1)^2 + 1 mod 693.\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and 693.\n\nLet's start the iteration:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = (2^2 + 1) mod 693 = 5\ny = ((2^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 693 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 693) = GCD(21, 693) = 21\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 21. Now we can divide 693 by 21 to get the other factor:\n693 / 21 = 33\n\nNow we need to check if 21 and 33 are prime numbers or if they can be further factorized. Since 21 = 3 * 7 and 33 = 3 * 11, both numbers can be further factorized.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 693 using Pollard's rho algorithm is:\n693 = 3 * 3 * 7 * 11 or 3^2 * 7 * 11"
