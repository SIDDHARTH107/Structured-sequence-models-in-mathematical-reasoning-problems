    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the graph image you are referring to. However, I can provide you with a general method to determine if a graph is planar and how to create a planar representation if it is.\n\nA graph is planar if it can be drawn in a plane without any edge intersections. To determine if a graph is planar, you can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nTo check for planarity:\n\n1. Look for any subgraphs that resemble K5 or K3,3.\n2. If you find any, try to redraw the graph without edge intersections. If you can't, the graph is non-planar.\n3. If you don't find any subgraphs resembling K5 or K3,3, try redrawing the graph without edge intersections. If you can do this, the graph is planar.\n\nIf the graph is planar, you can create a planar representation by redrawing the graph without any edge intersections. This may involve rearranging the vertices and edges to avoid crossing."
