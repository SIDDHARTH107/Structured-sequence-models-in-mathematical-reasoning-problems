The second company bids $\\$15$ million and their probability of winning the bid is $50\\%$. What bidding price will give the first company the highest expected profit?

    "message_2": "Let $x$ be the bidding price of the first company. We want to find the value of $x$ that maximizes the expected profit for the first company. The expected profit for the first company is given by the product of the probability of winning the bid and the profit, which is $(x - 10)$ million dollars.\n\nLet $p(x)$ be the probability of the first company winning the bid when they bid $x$ million dollars. Since the probability of winning the bid is $30\\%$ when bidding $10$ million dollars and $50\\%$ when bidding the same amount as the second company ($15$ million dollars), we can assume that the probability function is linear between these two points. Therefore, we can find the equation of the line passing through the points $(10, 0.3)$ and $(15, 0.5)$.\n\nThe slope of the line is:\n\n$m = \\frac{0.5 - 0.3}{15 - 10} = \\frac{0.2}{5} = 0.04$\n\nThe equation of the line is:\n\n$p(x) = m(x - 10) + 0.3$\n\n$p(x) = 0.04(x - 10) + 0.3$\n\nNow, we can find the expected profit function, which is the product of the probability of winning the bid and the profit:\n\n$E(x) = p(x)(x - 10)$\n\n$E(x) = (0.04(x - 10) + 0.3)(x - 10)$\n\nTo find the maximum expected profit, we can take the derivative of the expected profit function with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = 0$\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = (0.04(x - 10) + 0.3)\\frac{d(x - 10)}{dx} + (x - 10)\\frac{d(0.04(x - 10) + 0.3)}{dx}$\n\n$\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = (0.04(x - 10) + 0.3) + (x - 10)(0.04)$\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n$(0.04(x - 10) + 0.3) + (x - 10)(0.04) = 0$\n\n$0.04(x - 10) + 0.3 + 0.04x - 0.4 = 0$\n\n$0.08x - 0.4 + 0.3 = 0$\n\n$0.08x = 0.1$\n\n$x = \\frac{0.1}{0.08}$\n\n$x = 12.5$\n\nSo, the first company should bid $\\$12.5$ million to maximize their expected profit."
