The fluid is driven by a pressure difference of $\\Delta P = 100$ Pa between the ends of the pipe. Calculate the average velocity of the fluid in the pipe, assuming steady-state laminar flow and using the Navier-Stokes equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for steady-state laminar flow in a cylindrical pipe. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is given by:\n\n$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$\n\nwhere $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate, $r$ is the radius of the pipe, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $L$ is the length of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the volumetric flow rate $Q$:\n\n$Q = \\frac{\\pi (0.5)^4 (100)}{8 (0.01) (10)}$\n\n$Q = \\frac{\\pi (0.0625)(100)}{0.8}$\n\n$Q \\approx 24.543 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$\n\nNow, we can find the average velocity $v$ of the fluid in the pipe by dividing the volumetric flow rate by the cross-sectional area of the pipe:\n\n$v = \\frac{Q}{\\pi r^2}$\n\n$v = \\frac{24.543}{\\pi (0.5)^2}$\n\n$v \\approx 31.416 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nSo, the average velocity of the fluid in the pipe is approximately $31.416$ m/s."
