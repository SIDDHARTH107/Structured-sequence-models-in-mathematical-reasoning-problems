The expected returns and standard deviations of each stock, as well as the correlation between each pair of stocks, are provided below:\n\nStock A: Expected return = 12%, standard deviation = 6%\n\nStock B: Expected return = 8%, standard deviation = 3%\n\nStock C: Expected return = 6%, standard deviation = 4%\n\nCorrelation between A and B = 0.4\n\nCorrelation between A and C = -0.2\n\nCorrelation between B and C = 0.3\n\nWhat is the optimal allocation of funds among the three stocks that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk of the portfolio?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation of funds among the three stocks that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk of the portfolio, we can use the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and the concept of efficient frontier.\n\nLet's denote the allocation of funds to Stock A, Stock B, and Stock C as x, y, and z, respectively. Since the total investment is $100,000, we have the following constraint:\n\nx + y + z = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = 0.12x + 0.08y + 0.06z\n\nThe risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp^2 = x^2 * σA^2 + y^2 * σB^2 + z^2 * σC^2 + 2xy * ρAB * σA * σB + 2xz * ρAC * σA * σC + 2yz * ρBC * σB * σC\n\nwhere σA, σB, and σC are the standard deviations of Stock A, Stock B, and Stock C, respectively, and ρAB, ρAC, and ρBC are the correlations between the stocks.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nσp^2 = 0.36x^2 + 0.09y^2 + 0.16z^2 + 0.48xy - 0.24xz + 0.36yz\n\nTo find the optimal allocation, we need to maximize the expected return (Rp) while minimizing the risk (σp). This can be done using optimization techniques such as the Lagrange multiplier method or quadratic programming.\n\nHowever, solving this optimization problem analytically can be quite complex. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the optimal allocation. One such method is the Monte Carlo simulation, where we randomly generate thousands of portfolios with different allocations and calculate their expected returns and risks. We can then plot these portfolios on a graph with expected return on the y-axis and risk on the x-axis to visualize the efficient frontier.\n\nThe optimal allocation will be the portfolio on the efficient frontier that has the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return, depending on the investor's risk tolerance.\n\nIn summary, the optimal allocation of funds among the three stocks can be found using optimization techniques and numerical methods, such as the Monte Carlo simulation, to maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk of the portfolio."
