    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (coin flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads or tails), and p is the probability of a successful outcome (0.5 for a fair coin).\n\nIn this case, n = 100, k = 50, and p = 0.5. So, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails is:\n\nP(X = 50) = (100 choose 50) * 0.5^50 * 0.5^50\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient (100 choose 50):\n\n(100 choose 50) = 100! / (50! * 50!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\n(100 choose 50) ≈ 1.0089134 × 10^29\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 50) ≈ (1.0089134 × 10^29) * 0.5^50 * 0.5^50 ≈ 0.0795892\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 coin flips is approximately 7.96%."
