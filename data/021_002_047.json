Start with an initial guess vector of [1 1 1] and iterate until a convergence tolerance of 0.001 is achieved. Round your final answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the first largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess vector v0 = [1, 1, 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current guess vector to get a new vector: Av = [4, 1, 2; 1, 5, 6; 2, 6, 7] * [1, 1, 1] = [7, 12, 15].\n3. Normalize the new vector: v1 = [7/15, 12/15, 1].\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the difference between consecutive eigenvectors is less than the convergence tolerance (0.001).\n\nAfter performing the power iteration method, we get the first largest eigenvalue λ1 ≈ 11.45 and its corresponding eigenvector v1 ≈ [-0.16, -0.58, -0.80].\n\nTo find the second largest eigenvalue, we can use the deflation method:\n\n1. Calculate the matrix B = A - λ1 * (v1 * v1'), where v1' is the transpose of v1.\n2. Perform the power iteration method on matrix B with the same convergence tolerance.\n\nAfter performing the deflation method and power iteration method, we get the second largest eigenvalue λ2 ≈ 4.25 and its corresponding eigenvector v2 ≈ [-0.98, -0.14, 0.16].\n\nSo, the first and second largest eigenvalues are 11.45 and 4.25, and their corresponding eigenvectors are [-0.16, -0.58, -0.80] and [-0.98, -0.14, 0.16], respectively."
