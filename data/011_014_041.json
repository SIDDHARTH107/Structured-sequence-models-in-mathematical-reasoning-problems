    "message_1": "In a graph with eight vertices, each vertex is connected to exactly three other vertices. How many edges does this graph have?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider each vertex in the graph. Each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices, so there are 3 edges coming out of each vertex. Since there are 8 vertices in total, we might initially think there are 8 * 3 = 24 edges.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to double-count the edges, as each edge connects two vertices. When we count the 3 edges for each vertex, we're counting each edge twice (once for each vertex it connects). To account for this, we need to divide the total number of edges by 2.\n\nSo, the actual number of edges in the graph is 24 / 2 = 12."
