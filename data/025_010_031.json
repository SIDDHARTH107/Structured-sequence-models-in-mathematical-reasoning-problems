    "message_1": "Here's a possible precise numerical problem for a math student studying Riemann-Roch theorem and its applications:\n\nSuppose we have a smooth projective algebraic curve $C$ of genus $3$, given by the equation $y^2=x^5-x$. Let $D$ be the divisor on $C$ given by the zero locus of $f(x,y)=y-x^2$, and let $\\omega_C$ be the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms on $C$. Find the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)\\otimes \\omega_C^{-1})$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a smooth projective algebraic curve $C$ of genus $g$ and a divisor $D$ on $C$, we have:\n\n$h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$.\n\nIn our case, we are given the divisor $D$ and we want to find the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)\\otimes \\omega_C^{-1})$. We can rewrite this as $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C))$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor associated to the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms $\\omega_C$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the degree of the divisor $D$. The curve $C$ is given by the equation $y^2 = x^5 - x$, and the divisor $D$ is given by the zero locus of $f(x, y) = y - x^2$. To find the intersection points of these two curves, we can substitute $y = x^2$ into the equation for $C$:\n\n$(x^2)^2 = x^5 - x \\Rightarrow x^4 = x^5 - x$.\n\nThis simplifies to $x^4 - x^5 + x = 0$, which factors as $x(x - 1)(x^3 + 1) = 0$. This gives us four distinct points of intersection: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, and the two complex conjugate solutions of $x^3 + 1 = 0$. Thus, the degree of the divisor $D$ is $\\deg(D) = 4$.\n\nNext, we need to find the degree of the canonical divisor $K_C$. Since $C$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $3$, we have $\\deg(K_C) = 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\n\nNow, we can find the degree of the divisor $D - K_C$. Since $\\deg(D) = 4$ and $\\deg(K_C) = 4$, we have $\\deg(D - K_C) = \\deg(D) - \\deg(K_C) = 4 - 4 = 0$.\n\nApplying the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C)) - h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C)) = \\deg(D - K_C) + 1 - g = 0 + 1 - 3 = -2$.\n\nSince $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C))$ and $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C))$ are both non-negative integers, the only way for their difference to be $-2$ is if $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C)) = 0$ and $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D - K_C)) = 2$. Therefore, the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)\\otimes \\omega_C^{-1})$ is $\\boxed{0}$."
