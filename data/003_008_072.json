    "message_1": "A barn has a triangular roof. The roof has a height of 8 meters and a base of 12 meters. Find the area of the roof using trigonometry. Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a square meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangular roof, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 12 meters and the height is 8 meters. \n\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 8\nArea = 6 * 8\nArea = 48 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the roof is approximately 48.0 square meters."
