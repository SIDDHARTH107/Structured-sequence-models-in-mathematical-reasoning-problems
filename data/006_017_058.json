    "message_2": "Let A be the event that a car accident occurs, and B be the event that a driver is under the influence of alcohol. We want to find the probability of P(A|B), which is the probability of a car accident given that the driver is under the influence of alcohol.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A|B') = 0.2, where B' is the event that a driver is sober (not under the influence of alcohol).\nP(B) = 0.05, the probability of a driver being under the influence of alcohol.\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(A), the probability of a car accident:\n\nP(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')\n\nSince we want to find P(A|B), we can rearrange the formula:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(A) - P(A|B') * P(B')) / P(B)\n\nFirst, we need to find P(B'), the probability of a driver being sober:\n\nP(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n\nNow we can find P(A):\n\nP(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|B') * P(B')\nP(A) = P(A|B) * 0.05 + 0.2 * 0.95\n\nWe don't have the value of P(A|B) yet, so we cannot find the exact value of P(A). However, we can still express P(A|B) in terms of P(A):\n\nP(A|B) = (P(A) - 0.2 * 0.95) / 0.05\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot find the exact probability of a car accident caused by a driver under the influence of alcohol."
