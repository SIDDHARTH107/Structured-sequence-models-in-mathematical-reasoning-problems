    "message_2": "Semi-definite programming (SDP) is a subfield of convex optimization that deals with optimization problems involving linear matrix inequalities. However, the given problem is not a semi-definite programming problem, as it does not involve linear matrix inequalities. Instead, it is a convex optimization problem.\n\nTo solve the given problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's define the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(x, y, λ1, λ2) = x + y + λ1(16 - x^2 - y^2) + λ2(12 - 3x - 4y)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L with respect to x, y, λ1, and λ2 and set them to zero:\n\n∇L = [∂L/∂x, ∂L/∂y, ∂L/∂λ1, ∂L/∂λ2] = [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n∂L/∂x = 1 - 2λ1x - 3λ2 = 0\n∂L/∂y = 1 - 2λ1y - 4λ2 = 0\n∂L/∂λ1 = 16 - x^2 - y^2 = 0\n∂L/∂λ2 = 12 - 3x - 4y = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get two possible solutions:\n\n1. (x, y, λ1, λ2) = (2, 2, 1/4, 1/4)\n2. (x, y, λ1, λ2) = (0, 4, 1, 0)\n\nNow, we need to check which solution maximizes the objective function f(x, y) = x + y:\n\n1. f(2, 2) = 2 + 2 = 4\n2. f(0, 4) = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nBoth solutions give the same maximum value of 4 for the objective function. Therefore, the maximum value of the objective function f(x, y) = x + y subject to the constraints x^2 + y^2 <= 16 and 3x + 4y <= 12 is 4."
