    "message_1": "A bag contains 7 red balls, 5 blue balls and 3 green balls. How many ways can you select 2 balls from the bag if they are different colors?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to select 2 balls of different colors, we can consider all possible pairs of colors and calculate the number of combinations for each pair. There are 3 possible pairs of colors: red-blue, red-green, and blue-green.\n\nFor the red-blue pair, there are 7 red balls and 5 blue balls. We can choose 1 red ball and 1 blue ball in 7 * 5 = 35 ways.\n\nFor the red-green pair, there are 7 red balls and 3 green balls. We can choose 1 red ball and 1 green ball in 7 * 3 = 21 ways.\n\nFor the blue-green pair, there are 5 blue balls and 3 green balls. We can choose 1 blue ball and 1 green ball in 5 * 3 = 15 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select 2 balls of different colors is 35 + 21 + 15 = 71 ways."
