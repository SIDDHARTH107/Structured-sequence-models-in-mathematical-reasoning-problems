    "message_2": "To find the points on the elliptic curve with integer coordinates, we can start by trying out integer values for x and see if the corresponding y value is an integer as well.\n\nLet's start with x = 0:\n$$y^2 = 0^3 - 7(0) + 10 = 10$$\nSince 10 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions for x = 0.\n\nNow, let's try x = 1:\n$$y^2 = 1^3 - 7(1) + 10 = 4$$\nHere, we have y = ±2, so the points (1, 2) and (1, -2) are on the curve.\n\nFor x = 2:\n$$y^2 = 2^3 - 7(2) + 10 = 0$$\nIn this case, y = 0, so the point (2, 0) is on the curve.\n\nFor x = 3:\n$$y^2 = 3^3 - 7(3) + 10 = 1$$\nHere, y = ±1, so the points (3, 1) and (3, -1) are on the curve.\n\nWe can continue this process for other integer values of x. However, as x gets larger, the value of $$x^3 - 7x + 10$$ will grow rapidly, making it less likely to find perfect squares for y^2. So, we can stop the search after a certain point.\n\nThe points on the elliptic curve with integer coordinates that we found are:\n(1, 2), (1, -2), (2, 0), (3, 1), and (3, -1)."
