    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = x^3 - 4x + 2 at the point (2, 2), we need to find the slope of the tangent line at that point. To do this, we'll first find the derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\ny = x^3 - 4x + 2\n\nThe derivative, dy/dx, is:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we'll find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 2) by plugging in x = 2 into the derivative:\n\nm = 3(2)^2 - 4\nm = 3(4) - 4\nm = 12 - 4\nm = 8\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope, and (x1, y1) is the point (2, 2). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\ny - 2 = 8(x - 2)\n\nNow, we'll simplify the equation:\n\ny - 2 = 8x - 16\ny = 8x - 14\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = x^3 - 4x + 2 at the point (2, 2) is:\n\ny = 8x - 14"
