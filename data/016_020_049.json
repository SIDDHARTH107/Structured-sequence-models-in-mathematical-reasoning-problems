    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a 3D fractal formed by repeatedly removing smaller tetrahedra from the initial larger tetrahedron. In each iteration, the number of equilateral triangles increases.\n\nIn the first iteration, there is one large equilateral triangle on each face of the tetrahedron, so there are 4 equilateral triangles in total.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 4 large equilateral triangles is divided into 4 smaller equilateral triangles, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 equilateral triangles.\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, there are 4^n equilateral triangles.\n\nSo, for the sixth iteration, there are 4^6 = 4096 equilateral triangles."
