If the initial displacement is given by $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ and the initial velocity is zero, what is the solution $u(x,t)$ for $t > 0$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the given wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$.\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $4X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$.\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$.\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$ with boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$.\n\n2) $T''(t) + 4\\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$.\n\nLet's solve the first ODE. The general solution of this ODE is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n$X(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0$.\n\n$X(1) = A\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$.\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$. This implies that $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, let's solve the second ODE. The general solution of this ODE is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\sin(2\\lambda t) + D\\cos(2\\lambda t)$.\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0$.\n\nThis implies that $T'(0) = 0$, which means $C = 0$. Thus, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T_n(t) = D_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$.\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$u_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)D_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$.\n\nSince the wave equation is linear, the general solution is a sum of these solutions:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)D_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$.\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$ and $D_n$, we use the initial displacement condition:\n\n$u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)D_n$.\n\nSince $D_n = 1$ for all $n$ (as $u(x,0)$ is non-zero), we have:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$.\n\nUsing the orthogonality of sine functions, we can find $A_n$:\n\n$A_n = 2\\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi x) dx$.\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have:\n\n$A_1 = 2\\int_{0}^{1} \\sin^2(\\pi x) dx = 2\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\pi x)}{2} dx = 1$.\n\nFor $n > 1$, we have:\n\n$A_n = 2\\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(n\\pi x) dx = 0$.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$."
