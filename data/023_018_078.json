    "message_2": "To find the steady-state value of the output signal using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the unit step input. The Laplace transform of a unit step function is given by:\n\nU(s) = 1/s\n\nNow, we need to find the Laplace transform of the output signal Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input Laplace transform U(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * U(s) = (2s / (s^2 + 3s + 2)) * (1/s)\n\nY(s) = 2 / (s^2 + 3s + 2)\n\nTo find the steady-state value of the output signal, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s). However, we can also find the steady-state value by taking the limit as s approaches 0:\n\nsteady-state value = lim (s -> 0) [s * Y(s)]\n\nsteady-state value = lim (s -> 0) [s * (2 / (s^2 + 3s + 2))]\n\nsteady-state value = lim (s -> 0) [2s / (s^2 + 3s + 2)]\n\nAs s approaches 0, the steady-state value becomes:\n\nsteady-state value = 2(0) / (0^2 + 3(0) + 2) = 0 / 2 = 0\n\nSo, the steady-state value of the output signal is 0."
