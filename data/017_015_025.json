    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order p^n * m, where p is a prime not dividing m, is congruent to 1 mod p and divides m.\n\nThe prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. So, we need to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (of order 8), the number of such subgroups can be 1 or 3. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, they may or may not have a normal subgroup among them.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (of order 3), the number of such subgroups can be 1 or 4. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One normal Sylow 2-subgroup and one normal Sylow 3-subgroup: In this case, the group is a direct product of the two normal subgroups, and there are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup (Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) and one possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup (Z_3). So, there are 2 * 1 = 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n2. One normal Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups: In this case, there are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup (Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2), but since the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal, we cannot form a direct product. Instead, we have a semidirect product. There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 to Aut(Z_8) and one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 to Aut(Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2). So, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n3. Three Sylow 2-subgroups and one normal Sylow 3-subgroup: In this case, there is one possibility for the Sylow 3-subgroup (Z_3), but since the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal, we cannot form a direct product. Instead, we have a semidirect product. There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_8 to Aut(Z_3) and three non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 to Aut(Z_3). So, there are 2 + 3 = 5 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n4. Three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups: In this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal, and we cannot form a direct or semidirect product. However, there is one possibility for a group with these properties: the symmetric group S_4.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
