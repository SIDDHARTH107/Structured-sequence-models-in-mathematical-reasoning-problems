    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given group G. We know that a and b have order 2, and c and d have order 5. We can also see that G has 40 elements. Since the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its elements, we can write the order of G as:\n\n|G| = |a|^2 * |b|^2 * |c|^5 * |d|^5 = 40\n\nNow, let's consider the possible non-abelian groups of order 40. There are eight such groups, which can be represented as:\n\n1. C2 x C2 x C5 x C5\n2. C2 x C2 x C10 x C5\n3. C2 x C2 x C20\n4. C2 x C10 x C5\n5. C2 x C20\n6. C4 x C10\n7. C4 x C20\n8. C40\n\nWe can eliminate some of these options based on the orders of their elements:\n\n1. C2 x C2 x C5 x C5: This group has elements of order 2, 2, 5, and 5, so it could be isomorphic to G.\n2. C2 x C2 x C10 x C5: This group has elements of order 2, 2, 10, and 5, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n3. C2 x C2 x C20: This group has elements of order 2, 2, and 20, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n4. C2 x C10 x C5: This group has elements of order 2, 10, and 5, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n5. C2 x C20: This group has elements of order 2 and 20, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n6. C4 x C10: This group has elements of order 4 and 10, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n7. C4 x C20: This group has elements of order 4 and 20, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n8. C40: This group has elements of order 40, so it cannot be isomorphic to G.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only possible non-abelian group of order 40 that could be isomorphic to G is C2 x C2 x C5 x C5."
