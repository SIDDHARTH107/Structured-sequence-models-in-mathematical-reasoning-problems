    "message_2": "First, let's define the sets A and B. \n\nSet A contains even numbers less than 10, so A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.\n\nSet B is the complement of set A, which means it contains all the numbers less than 10 that are not in set A. So, B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of sets A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B, as A contains only even numbers and B contains only odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of sets A and B is the empty set, denoted as âˆ…."
