    "message_1": "What is the probability of a certain demographic group of 500 people being affected by a disease if the overall incidence rate is 5% and within the demographic group, there are known risk factors which increase the incidence rate to 10%?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one person in the demographic group of 500 people being affected by the disease, we can first find the probability of no one being affected and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single person not being affected by the disease in this demographic group is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 (since the incidence rate is 10%).\n\nThe probability of all 500 people not being affected is (0.90)^500.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one person being affected by subtracting the probability of no one being affected from 1:\n\nProbability (at least one person affected) = 1 - (0.90)^500 â‰ˆ 0.99957\n\nSo, the probability of at least one person in the demographic group of 500 people being affected by the disease is approximately 99.957%."
