In other words, A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\n(A × B) △ B = {((1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8))} △ {(2, 5, 8)}\nSince there are no common elements between (A × B) and B, the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), 2, 5, 8}\n\nSimilarly, for (B × A) △ B:\n(B × A) △ B = {((2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7))} △ {(2, 5, 8)}\nSince there are no common elements between (B × A) and B, the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n(B × A) △ B = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), 2, 5, 8}\n\nNow, let's compare the two results:\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), 2, 5, 8}\n(B × A) △ B = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), 2, 5, 8}\n\nAs we can see, the two results are not equal. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
