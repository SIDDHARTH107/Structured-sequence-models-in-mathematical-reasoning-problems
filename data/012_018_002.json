    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λ(G), is defined as the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. In this case, it is given that the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph G is 3. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the graph G is λ(G) = 3."
