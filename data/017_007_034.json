    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be a subgroup of order 3 and K be a subgroup of order 2. Since the orders of H and K are prime, both H and K are cyclic. Let h be a generator of H and k be a generator of K.\n\nNow, since the order of H (3) and the order of K (2) are coprime, the intersection of H and K is the identity element e. Therefore, |HK| = |H||K| = 6, where HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Since |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G.\n\nThere are two possibilities for the group G:\n\n1. G is abelian: In this case, hk = kh for all h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Then G is generated by the element h * k, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\n2. G is non-abelian: In this case, there exists h ∈ H and k ∈ K such that hk ≠ kh. Then G is generated by h and k with the relations h^3 = k^2 = e and hk ≠ kh. This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D3.\n\nThus, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3.\n\nNow, let's write out the complete multiplication table for the dihedral group D3, which has elements {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection.\n\n```\n   | e  r  r^2  s  sr  sr^2\n---+----------------------\ne  | e  r  r^2  s  sr  sr^2\nr  | r  r^2 e   sr^2 sr s\nr^2| r^2 e  r   sr  s  sr^2\ns  | s  sr sr^2 e  r  r^2\nsr | sr sr^2 s   r^2 e  r\nsr^2| sr^2 s  sr  r  r^2 e\n```\n\nThis multiplication table demonstrates the isomorphism between G and D3 when G is non-abelian."
