    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nSymmetric difference of A and B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}\nA ∩ B = {4}\n\nNow, we subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nSymmetric difference of A and B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B = {4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter. In this case, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B does not equal the intersection of B and A.\n\nSymmetric difference of A and B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\nIntersection of B and A = {4}\n\nSince the symmetric difference of A and B does not equal the intersection of B and A, we can conclude that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection."
