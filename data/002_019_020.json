    "message_2": "The surface area of a cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 12 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 12)\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(17)\n\nSurface Area = 85π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 85π cm², or approximately 267.04 cm²."
