    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36. Since 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that there are Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let's find the possible number of these subgroups and their structures.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups:\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 9, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and they are not normal. The possible structures for a group of order 4 are C4 (cyclic) and V4 (Klein-4 group).\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups:\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and they are not normal. The possible structures for a group of order 9 are C9 (cyclic) and C3 × C3.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures for G:\n\n1. If G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then G is isomorphic to C4 × C9 or C4 × (C3 × C3) or V4 × C9 or V4 × (C3 × C3). The first two cases are abelian, and the last two cases are non-abelian.\n\n2. If G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and 4 non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is a semi-direct product of C4 or V4 with C3 × C3. This gives four non-abelian groups.\n\n3. If G has 9 non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then G is a semi-direct product of C9 or (C3 × C3) with C4. This gives two non-abelian groups.\n\n4. If G has 9 non-normal Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3, which is non-abelian.\n\nIn total, we have 2 abelian groups (C36 and C4 × C9) and 9 non-abelian groups. Therefore, every group of order 36 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
