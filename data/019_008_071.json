    "message_1": "Suppose we have a fuzzy set of grades for a math class with the following membership function:\n\nμ(grade)= [(grade-60)/10]² for 60 ≤ grade ≤ 100\n\nwhere μ(grade) represents the degree of membership of a grade in the set. Calculate the degree of membership of a grade of 75.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the degree of membership of a grade of 75, we can plug the value of the grade into the membership function:\n\nμ(75) = [((75-60)/10)]²\n\nFirst, subtract 60 from 75:\n\nμ(75) = [(15/10)]²\n\nNext, divide 15 by 10:\n\nμ(75) = [1.5]²\n\nFinally, square 1.5:\n\nμ(75) = 2.25\n\nSo, the degree of membership of a grade of 75 in the fuzzy set is 2.25."
