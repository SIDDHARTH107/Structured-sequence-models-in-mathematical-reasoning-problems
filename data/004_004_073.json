    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 and the x-axis on the interval [0, 3], we need to compute the definite integral of f(x) with respect to x from 0 to 3.\n\nThe definite integral is given by:\n\n∫[0, 3] (2x^2 - 3x + 1) dx\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nF(x) = ∫(2x^2 - 3x + 1) dx = (2/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we evaluate F(x) at the endpoints of the interval and subtract the results:\n\nArea = F(3) - F(0) = [(2/3)(3)^3 - (3/2)(3)^2 + (3)] - [(2/3)(0)^3 - (3/2)(0)^2 + (0)]\n\nArea = [(2/3)(27) - (3/2)(9) + 3] - [0]\n\nArea = [18 - 13.5 + 3]\n\nArea = 7.5\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 and the x-axis on the interval [0, 3] is 7.5 square units."
