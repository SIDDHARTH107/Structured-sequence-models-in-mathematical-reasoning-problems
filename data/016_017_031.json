    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^8) = 1 * 256 = 256 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 256 units."
