    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"SEND HELP\" using the Playfair Cipher with the key \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is usually combined with I in the Playfair Cipher). The grid will look like this:\n\n   M  A  T  H  S\n   B  C  D  E  F\n   G  I  K  L  N\n   O  P  Q  R  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If there's a repeated letter in a digraph, insert an 'X' between them. If there's an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end. In this case, \"SEND HELP\" becomes \"SE ND HE LX P\".\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair Cipher rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n4. Encrypt the digraphs:\n\n   - SE: S is in the same row as E, so replace them with the letters to their immediate right: HF\n   - ND: N is in the same column as D, so replace them with the letters immediately below them: GK\n   - HE: H is in the same row as E, so replace them with the letters to their immediate right: SF\n   - LX: L is in the same row as X, so replace them with the letters to their immediate right: NY\n   - P: Since there's only one letter left, we add an 'X' to form the digraph PX. P is in the same column as X, so replace them with the letters immediately below them: RU\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to form the ciphertext: \"HF GKS FNY RU\".\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Playfair Cipher with the key \"MATHS\" for the plaintext \"SEND HELP\" is \"HFGKSFNYRU\"."
