    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network will be targeted by a ransomware attack within a year, if historical data shows that the probability of a ransomware attack occurring per month is 0.1?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. The complementary probability of an event occurring is 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of the network not being targeted by a ransomware attack in a single month. Since the probability of an attack occurring per month is 0.1, the probability of it not occurring is:\n\n1 - 0.1 = 0.9\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of the network not being targeted by a ransomware attack for the entire year (12 months). We can do this by multiplying the probability of not being targeted in a single month by itself 12 times:\n\n0.9^12 ≈ 0.2824\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of the network being targeted by a ransomware attack within a year:\n\n1 - 0.2824 ≈ 0.7176\n\nSo, the probability that a network will be targeted by a ransomware attack within a year is approximately 0.7176 or 71.76%."
