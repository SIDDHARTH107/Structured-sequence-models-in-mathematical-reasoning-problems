    "message_2": "To graph the solution for the inequality 2x + 3y < 6, we'll first find the boundary line by treating the inequality as an equation: 2x + 3y = 6.\n\nNow, we'll find the x and y-intercepts:\n\n1. To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x:\n2x + 3(0) = 6\n2x = 6\nx = 3\nSo, the x-intercept is (3, 0).\n\n2. To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y:\n2(0) + 3y = 6\n3y = 6\ny = 2\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 2).\n\nNow, plot the points (3, 0) and (0, 2) on the xy-plane and draw a straight line through them. Since the inequality is \"less than\" and not \"less than or equal to,\" we'll use a dashed line to represent the boundary line.\n\nNext, we'll choose a test point to determine which side of the line contains the solutions to the inequality. A common test point is the origin (0, 0). Plug the coordinates of the test point into the inequality:\n\n2(0) + 3(0) < 6\n0 < 6\n\nSince the inequality is true for the test point, the solution set lies on the same side of the boundary line as the origin. Shade the region that includes the origin to represent the solution set for the inequality 2x + 3y < 6."
