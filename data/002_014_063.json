    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is its total surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSurface Area = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: length (l) = 8 cm, width (w) = 4 cm, and height (h) = 5 cm.\n\nSurface Area = 2(8)(4) + 2(8)(5) + 2(4)(5)\nSurface Area = 2(32) + 2(40) + 2(20)\nSurface Area = 64 + 80 + 40\nSurface Area = 184 cmÂ²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 184 square centimeters."
