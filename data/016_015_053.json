    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve in the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula L = N * (2^n), where L is the length, N is the number of segments in the first iteration (which is 4 in this case), and n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we have:\n\nL = 4 * (2^4)\nL = 4 * 16\nL = 64\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve in the 4th iteration with each segment having a length of 1 is 64."
