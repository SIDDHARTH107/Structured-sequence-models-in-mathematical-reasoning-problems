Fourier transform of cos(4*pi*t):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[cos(4*pi*t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite cos(4*pi*t) as:\n\ncos(4*pi*t) = (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) / 2\n\nNow, the Fourier transform becomes:\n\nF2(ω) = (1/2) ∫[(e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSeparate the integral into two parts:\n\nF2(ω) = (1/2) [∫[e^(j(4π-ω)t) dt] + ∫[e^(-j(4π+ω)t) dt]]\n\nNow, we can solve each integral:\n\n∫[e^(j(4π-ω)t) dt] = (1/(j(4π-ω))) * e^(j(4π-ω)t) evaluated from -∞ to +∞\n∫[e^(-j(4π+ω)t) dt] = (1/(-j(4π+ω))) * e^(-j(4π+ω)t) evaluated from -∞ to +∞\n\nThe first integral will be non-zero only when ω = 4π, and the second integral will be non-zero only when ω = -4π.
