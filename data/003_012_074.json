    "message_1": "A building is 50 meters high. From point A on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 60 degrees. From point B, which is 20 meters closer to the building, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 45 degrees. What is the distance between the building and point A?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the building and point A as x meters. Then, the distance between the building and point B is (x - 20) meters.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the height of the building and the distance from the building.\n\nFor point A:\ntan(60°) = (height of the building) / (distance from the building)\ntan(60°) = 50 / x\n\nFor point B:\ntan(45°) = (height of the building) / (distance from the building - 20)\ntan(45°) = 50 / (x - 20)\n\nNow we can solve these equations for x.\n\nFrom the first equation:\nx = 50 / tan(60°)\n\nSince tan(60°) = √3, we have:\nx = 50 / √3\n\nNow, we can use the second equation to find x:\nx - 20 = 50 / tan(45°)\n\nSince tan(45°) = 1, we have:\nx - 20 = 50\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx = 70\n\nSo, the distance between the building and point A is 70 meters."
