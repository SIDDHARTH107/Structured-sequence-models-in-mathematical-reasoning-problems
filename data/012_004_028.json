    "message_1": "Consider a weighted graph G with 6 vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, connected by the following edges with corresponding weights:\n\nAB: 2\nAC: 3\nBD: 1\nBE: 5\nCD: 2\nDE: 1\nEF: 4\nFA: 3\n\nWhat is the minimum spanning tree of G? Determine the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. BD: 1\n2. DE: 1\n3. AB: 2\n4. CD: 2\n5. AC: 3\n6. FA: 3\n7. EF: 4\n8. BE: 5\n\nNow, we start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree while making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add BD (total weight = 1)\n2. Add DE (total weight = 2)\n3. Add AB (total weight = 4)\n4. Add CD (total weight = 6)\n5. We cannot add AC, as it would create a cycle (ABCD)\n6. Add FA (total weight = 9)\n7. We cannot add EF, as it would create a cycle (DEFAB)\n8. We cannot add BE, as it would create a cycle (ABE)\n\nThe minimum spanning tree consists of the edges BD, DE, AB, CD, and FA. The total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 9."
