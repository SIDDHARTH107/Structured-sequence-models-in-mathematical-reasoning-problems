    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and the properties of groups.\n\nSince G has order 4, there are four elements in G. Let's denote these elements as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. We know that the identity element is unique and that every element in G has an inverse.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4\n----------------------------------------------\nIn this case, G has a single generator, say a, such that G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}. The operation table for G would look like this:\n\n|   | e  | a  | a^2 | a^3 |\n|---|----|----|-----|-----|\n| e | e  | a  | a^2 | a^3 |\n| a | a  | a^2| a^3 | e   |\n| a^2| a^2| a^3| e   | a   |\n| a^3| a^3| e  | a   | a^2 |\n\nIn this case, the group G is cyclic with generator a, and it is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4\n---------------------------------------------------\nIn this case, G has three elements of order 2, namely a, b, and c. The operation table for G would look like this:\n\n|   | e | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b | c |\n| a | a | e | c | b |\n| b | b | c | e | a |\n| c | c | b | a | e |\n\nIn this case, the group G is not cyclic, and it is isomorphic to V4.\n\nConclusion\n-------------\nWe have shown that a group G of order 4 can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, depending on its structure. The elements and operation tables for each case have been provided."
