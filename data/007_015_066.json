    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. Since we are looking for the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 3, we can start by testing the next power of 2:\n\n2^3 - 1 = 7\n\n7 is a prime number, so the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 3 is 7."
