    "message_2": "To find the median of the dataset, we first need to make sure the numbers are in ascending order, which they are. Since there are 10 numbers (an even amount), the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nMiddle numbers: 21 and 22\nMedian = (21 + 22) / 2 = 43 / 2 = 21.5\n\nNow, let's find the median absolute deviation (MAD). First, we need to find the absolute deviations from the median for each number in the dataset:\n\n|15 - 21.5| = 6.5\n|16 - 21.5| = 5.5\n|19 - 21.5| = 2.5\n|21 - 21.5| = 0.5\n|22 - 21.5| = 0.5\n|23 - 21.5| = 1.5\n|25 - 21.5| = 3.5\n|29 - 21.5| = 7.5\n|32 - 21.5| = 10.5\n|70 - 21.5| = 48.5\n\nNow, we need to find the median of these absolute deviations:\n\nAbsolute deviations in ascending order: 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 10.5, 48.5\n\nMiddle numbers: 2.5 and 3.5\nMAD = (2.5 + 3.5) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the median of the dataset is 21.5, and the median absolute deviation (MAD) is 3."
