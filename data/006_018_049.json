    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 60 employees and the probability of one of them committing financial fraud is 0.03. What is the probability that at least two employees in the company commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two employees committing financial fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of none or only one employee committing financial fraud.\n\nLet's first find the probability of no employee committing financial fraud:\nP(0) = (1 - 0.03)^60 ≈ 0.301\n\nNow, let's find the probability of exactly one employee committing financial fraud. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(1) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n = 60 (number of employees), k = 1 (number of employees committing fraud), p = 0.03 (probability of committing fraud), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(60, 1) = 60 (since there are 60 ways to choose 1 employee out of 60)\n\nP(1) = 60 * (0.03)^1 * (1 - 0.03)^(60-1) ≈ 0.452\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) ≈ 1 - 0.301 - 0.452 ≈ 0.247\n\nSo, the probability that at least two employees in the company commit financial fraud is approximately 0.247 or 24.7%."
