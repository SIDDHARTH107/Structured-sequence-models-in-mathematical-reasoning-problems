    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 11y = 87 for integer solutions, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 11, and then find a particular solution for the equation. Since 7 and 11 are coprime (their GCD is 1), there will be an infinite number of solutions.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD of 7 and 11 using the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n11 = 1 * 7 + 4\n7 = 1 * 4 + 3\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 3 * 1\n\nNow, we can work our way back up to find the coefficients for 7 and 11:\n\n1 = 4 - 1 * 3\n1 = 4 - 1 * (7 - 1 * 4)\n1 = 2 * 4 - 1 * 7\n1 = 2 * (11 - 1 * 7) - 1 * 7\n1 = 2 * 11 - 3 * 7\n\nNow we have the equation 1 = 2 * 11 - 3 * 7. We want to find a solution for 87 = 7x + 11y, so we can multiply both sides of the equation by 87:\n\n87 = 174 * 11 - 261 * 7\n\nNow we have a particular solution for the Diophantine equation:\n\n7 * (-261) + 11 * 174 = 87\n\nTo find the general solution, we can use the formula:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nIn this case, x0 = -261, y0 = 174, a = 7, b = 11, and gcd(a, b) = 1. So the general solution is:\n\nx = -261 + 11k\ny = 174 - 7k\n\nFor any integer k, this will give us an integer solution for the Diophantine equation 7x + 11y = 87."
