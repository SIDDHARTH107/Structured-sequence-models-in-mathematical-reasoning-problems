    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector v onto vector n, we can use the formula:\n\nproj_n(v) = (v · n) / ||n||^2 * n\n\nwhere v · n is the dot product of v and n, and ||n|| is the magnitude of n.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v and n:\n\nv · n = (7 * 2) + (-3 * 5) + (2 * 6) = 14 - 15 + 12 = 11\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of n:\n\n||n|| = √(2^2 + 5^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 25 + 36) = √65\n\nNow, let's find the square of the magnitude of n:\n\n||n||^2 = 65\n\nNow we can find the projection of v onto n:\n\nproj_n(v) = (v · n) / ||n||^2 * n = (11 / 65) * (2, 5, 6) = (22/65, 55/65, 66/65)\n\nSo, the projection of v onto n is (22/65, 55/65, 66/65)."
