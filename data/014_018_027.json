    "message_1": "Consider a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a unique letter in the ciphertext. If the plaintext consists of 20 letters, how many possible ways are there to encrypt the message using a substitution cipher?",
    "message_2": "In a substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a unique letter in the ciphertext. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, we need to find the number of ways to assign 20 unique letters from the 26 available letters to the 20 letters in the plaintext.\n\nThis is a problem of permutations, as the order of the letters matters. We can use the formula for permutations:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 26 letters), r is the number of items to be chosen (in this case, 20 letters), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nP(26, 20) = 26! / (26 - 20)!\n\nP(26, 20) = 26! / 6!\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000\n\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, we can divide:\n\nP(26, 20) = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 / 720 = 559,240,368,128,614,131,000\n\nSo, there are 559,240,368,128,614,131,000 possible ways to encrypt the message using a substitution cipher with a 20-letter plaintext."
