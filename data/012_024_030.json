    "message_2": "To determine the genus g of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, since G is not a planar graph, we need to modify the formula to account for the genus g:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nWe are given that G has 10 vertices (V = 10) and 20 edges (E = 20). We need to find the number of faces F to solve for g.\n\nFor a connected graph, the number of edges E can be expressed as:\n\nE = 3F/2\n\nThis is because each face is bounded by at least 3 edges, and each edge is shared by 2 faces. In our case, we have:\n\n20 = 3F/2\n\nSolving for F, we get:\n\nF = 40/3\n\nNow, we can plug the values of V, E, and F into the modified Euler's formula:\n\n10 - 20 + 40/3 = 2 - 2g\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-10 + 40/3 = 2 - 2g\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n-30 + 40 = 6 - 6g\n\n10 = 6 - 6g\n\nNow, we can solve for g:\n\n6g = -4\n\ng = -4/6\n\ng = -2/3\n\nHowever, the genus of a graph must be a non-negative integer. In this case, it seems that there is an error in the given information about the graph G. Please double-check the number of vertices and edges, as the provided values do not result in a valid genus."
