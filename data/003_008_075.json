    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle between the base and the height. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then using the inverse sine function to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We have:\n\na = 8 cm\nb = 5 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 8^2 + 5^2\nc^2 = 64 + 25\nc^2 = 89\nc = √89\nc ≈ 9.43 cm\n\nNow, we can use the inverse sine function to find the angle between the base and the height. Let's call this angle θ:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = b / c\nsin(θ) = 5 / 9.43\n\nθ = arcsin(5 / 9.43)\nθ ≈ 31.92°\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can use the formula for the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 5 * sin(31.92°)\nArea ≈ 20 * 0.5299\nArea ≈ 10.598\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 10.6 square centimeters."
