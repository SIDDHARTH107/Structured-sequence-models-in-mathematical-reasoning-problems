    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of ways to make a bouquet with k different types of flowers as a_k. We are given that there are 10 different types of flowers, and we want to find a_4.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the flowers. Let's represent each flower type as a star (*) and use bars (|) to separate the different types of flowers. Since we want at least one of each flower type, we can start by placing one flower of each type in the bouquet. This leaves us with the task of distributing the remaining flowers among the 4 chosen types.\n\nFor example, if we have 4 types of flowers A, B, C, and D, and we want to make a bouquet with 5 flowers, we can represent it as follows:\n\n* | * * | * | *\n\nThis represents a bouquet with 1 flower of type A, 2 flowers of type B, 1 flower of type C, and 1 flower of type D.\n\nNow, let's use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the remaining flowers. Since we have already placed one flower of each type in the bouquet, we have 4 - 1 = 3 bars to separate the flower types. We need to distribute the remaining flowers among the 4 types, so we have a total of n - 4 stars, where n is the total number of flowers in the bouquet.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n - 1, 3)\n\nNow, we need to sum this expression over all possible values of n, from 4 to 10:\n\na_4 = C(3, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(5, 3) + C(6, 3) + C(7, 3) + C(8, 3) + C(9, 3)\n\na_4 = 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84\n\na_4 = 210\n\nSo there are 210 different ways to make a bouquet with exactly 4 different types of flowers, with at least one of each flower type included."
