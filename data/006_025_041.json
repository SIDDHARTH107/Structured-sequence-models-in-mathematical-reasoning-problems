    "message_1": "In a magic show, a performer has 20 cards, which 5 of them are red, 10 are blue, and 5 are green. If the performer shuffles the cards and then selects 3 cards at random, what is the probability that all 3 cards will be blue?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting 3 blue cards, we can use the formula for combinations and probability.\n\nThere are a total of 20 cards, and we want to choose 3 cards. The number of ways to choose 3 cards from 20 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of cards (20) and k is the number of cards we want to choose (3).\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20-3)!)\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!17!)\nC(20, 3) = (20*19*18) / (3*2*1)\nC(20, 3) = 1140\n\nSo, there are 1140 ways to choose 3 cards from 20.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of ways to choose 3 blue cards from the 10 blue cards. We can use the same combination formula:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\nC(10, 3) = (10*9*8) / (3*2*1)\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose 3 blue cards from the 10 blue cards.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of selecting 3 blue cards by dividing the number of ways to choose 3 blue cards by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 3 blue cards) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 cards)\nProbability = 120 / 1140\nProbability = 1 / 9.5\n\nSo, the probability of selecting 3 blue cards is 1/9.5 or approximately 0.10526 (rounded to 5 decimal places)."
