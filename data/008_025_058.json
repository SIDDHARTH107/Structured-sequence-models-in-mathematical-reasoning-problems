    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we first need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. In this case, the coefficients of y are already the same, so we can proceed with the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can multiply the first equation by -2 to make the coefficients of y the same:\n\n-4x - 6y = -10\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n-4x - 6y = -10\n4x + 6y = 9\n\nNext, we add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\n-4x - 6y + 4x + 6y = -10 + 9\n0 = -1\n\nSince we get a false statement (0 = -1), this means that the system of linear equations has no solutions."
