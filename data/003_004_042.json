    "message_2": "To solve for x, we first need to isolate the sine function:\n\n2sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n2sin(x) = 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the angles x in the given range (0° ≤ x ≤ 360°) for which the sine function equals 1/2. \n\nThe sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. We know that sin(30°) = 1/2, so that's one solution. To find the other solution, we can use the fact that sine is also positive in the second quadrant and has the same value as its reference angle in the first quadrant. The reference angle in the second quadrant is also 30°, so the angle in the second quadrant is 180° - 30° = 150°.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x in the given range are:\n\nx = 30° and x = 150°."
