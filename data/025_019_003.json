    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth Fano variety of dimension 4 with Picard number 1 having an anticanonical divisor D such that D^4 = 4. Compute the degree of D.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of D, we will use the formula for the degree of an anticanonical divisor on a smooth Fano variety of dimension n with Picard number 1:\n\ndegree(D) = (-K_X)^n,\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical divisor of X and n is the dimension of X.\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, we know that -K_X is an ample divisor, and in our case, it is equal to D. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\ndegree(D) = D^n.\n\nIn our problem, we have n = 4 and D^4 = 4. Thus, the degree of D is:\n\ndegree(D) = D^4 = 4."
