    "message_2": "To compute the linking number $lk(K, D)$ between the trefoil knot $K$ and the oriented disk $D$, we will use the Gauss linking integral formula:\n\n$$lk(K, D) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\oint_K \\oint_D \\frac{\\vec{r}_K - \\vec{r}_D}{|\\vec{r}_K - \\vec{r}_D|^3} \\cdot (\\vec{dr}_K \\times \\vec{dr}_D)$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{r}_K$ and $\\vec{r}_D$ are position vectors of points on $K$ and $D$, respectively, and $\\vec{dr}_K$ and $\\vec{dr}_D$ are their respective differential displacements.\n\nSince $D$ intersects $K$ at four points, we can divide $D$ into four regions, each of which is bounded by two of the intersection points and a curve on $K$. Let's denote these regions as $D_1, D_2, D_3,$ and $D_4$. We can then compute the linking number for each region separately and sum them up to obtain the total linking number.\n\nFor each region $D_i$, we have:\n\n$$lk_i(K, D) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\oint_{K_i} \\oint_{D_i} \\frac{\\vec{r}_K - \\vec{r}_D}{|\\vec{r}_K - \\vec{r}_D|^3} \\cdot (\\vec{dr}_K \\times \\vec{dr}_D)$$\n\nwhere $K_i$ is the portion of $K$ that bounds the region $D_i$.\n\nNow, we notice that the integral over each region $D_i$ will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the integral over the adjacent region $D_{i+1}$ (modulo 4), since the orientation of the curve on $K$ is opposite for adjacent regions. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$lk_1(K, D) = -lk_2(K, D)$$\n$$lk_3(K, D) = -lk_4(K, D)$$\n\nAdding up the linking numbers for all four regions, we get:\n\n$$lk(K, D) = lk_1(K, D) + lk_2(K, D) + lk_3(K, D) + lk_4(K, D) = 0$$\n\nSo the linking number $lk(K, D)$ between the trefoil knot $K$ and the oriented disk $D$ is 0."
