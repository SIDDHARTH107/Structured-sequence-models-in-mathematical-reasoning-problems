Now, we need to find the corresponding y-values for each curve:\n\ny1 = 2(0) - (0)^2 = 0\ny2 = (0) - (0)^2 = 0\n\nThe point of intersection is (0, 0).\n\nNext, we need to find the area between the curves. To do this, we will integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval where they intersect. Since the two curves intersect at x = 0, we will integrate from x = 0 to the point where the two curves are no longer intersecting.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-value where the two curves are no longer intersecting. To do this, we can set the two functions equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n2x - x^2 = x - x^2\n\nx = 1\n\nNow, we will integrate the difference between the two functions from x = 0 to x = 1:\n\n∫(2x - x^2) - (x - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n∫(x) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate:\n\n[x^2/2] from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\n(1^2/2) - (0^2/2) = 1/2\n\nThe area enclosed by the curves y = 2x - x^2 and y = x - x^2 is 1/2 square units."
