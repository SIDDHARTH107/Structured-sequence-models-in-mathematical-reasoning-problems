    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that their soda cans contain an average of 12 ounces of soda. In order to test this claim, a random sample of 30 cans is drawn and the amount of soda in each can is measured. The sample mean is found to be 11.5 ounces with a sample standard deviation of 0.8 ounces. \n\nDetermine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a 5% level of significance by carrying out a hypothesis test.",
    "message_2": "To carry out a hypothesis test, we first need to set up our null and alternative hypotheses. In this case, the null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean of the soda cans is equal to the manufacturer's claim, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean is not equal to the manufacturer's claim.\n\nH0: μ = 12 ounces\nH1: μ ≠ 12 ounces\n\nSince the sample size is 30, which is greater than 30, we can use the z-test to test the hypothesis. The test statistic for the z-test is given by:\n\nz = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nz = (11.5 - 12) / (0.8 / sqrt(30))\n\nz = -0.5 / (0.8 / sqrt(30))\n\nz ≈ -2.74\n\nNow, we need to find the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance. Since it's a two-tailed test, we'll be looking at the 2.5% on each tail. The critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance is approximately ±1.96.\n\nSince the calculated z-value (-2.74) is less than the critical z-value (-1.96), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence at the 5% level of significance to reject the manufacturer's claim that their soda cans contain an average of 12 ounces of soda."
