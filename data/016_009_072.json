    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal like the Dragon curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Dragon curve, after each iteration, the number of line segments doubles (N = 2), and the scaling factor is the square root of 2 (S = √2) because each new segment is half the length of the previous one and forms a right angle.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Dragon curve is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(√2)\n\nD ≈ 1.523\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Dragon curve generated by recursively following the instructions 10 times is approximately 1.523."
