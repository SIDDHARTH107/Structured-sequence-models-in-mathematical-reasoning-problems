    "message_2": "To prove that there are exactly nine non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will analyze the possible structures of these groups and show that no two of them have the same set of character tables. Recall that the order of a group is the number of its elements, and two groups are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their elements that preserves the group operation.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible structures of groups of order 36:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_36\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 x C_4, C_18 x C_2, C_6 x C_6\n3. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups: C_9 ⋊ C_4, C_18 ⋊ C_2, C_6 ⋊ C_6\n4. Special groups: S_3 x S_3, (C_3 x C_3) ⋊ C_4\n\nNow, let's analyze the character tables of these groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_36 has a character table with 36 linear characters, which is unique to cyclic groups.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups:\n   a. C_9 x C_4 has a character table with 9 linear characters and 4 quadratic characters.\n   b. C_18 x C_2 has a character table with 18 linear characters and 2 quadratic characters.\n   c. C_6 x C_6 has a character table with 6 linear characters, 4 quadratic characters, and 9 cubic characters.\n\n3. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups:\n   a. C_9 ⋊ C_4 has a character table with 9 linear characters and 4 quadratic characters, but it is not isomorphic to C_9 x C_4 because it is non-abelian.\n   b. C_18 ⋊ C_2 has a character table with 18 linear characters and 2 quadratic characters, but it is not isomorphic to C_18 x C_2 because it is non-abelian.\n   c. C_6 ⋊ C_6 has a character table with 6 linear characters, 4 quadratic characters, and 9 cubic characters, but it is not isomorphic to C_6 x C_6 because it is non-abelian.\n\n4. Special groups:\n   a. S_3 x S_3 has a character table with 3 linear characters, 6 quadratic characters, and 9 cubic characters.\n   b. (C_3 x C_3) ⋊ C_4 has a character table with 9 linear characters, 4 quadratic characters, and 9 cubic characters.\n\nEach of these nine groups has a distinct character table, which means that they are not isomorphic to each other. Therefore, there are exactly nine non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
