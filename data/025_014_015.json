    "message_2": "To find a formula for the value of the Riemann-Roch space $L(P)$ associated to $P$ on this elliptic curve, we first need to find the period lattice of the elliptic curve. The period lattice is given by the integral of the holomorphic differential $\\omega = \\frac{dx}{2y}$ over the homology basis of the curve.\n\nLet $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ be the periods of the elliptic curve, and let $\\tau = \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}$. The Riemann Theta function is defined as:\n\n$$\\theta(z|\\tau) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\tau + 2\\pi i n z}$$\n\nNow, let's find the Abel-Jacobi map $u(P) = \\int_{O}^{P} \\omega$, where $O$ is the identity element of the elliptic curve. In this case, $O$ is the point at infinity. We can compute the Abel-Jacobi map using the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function and its derivative $\\wp'(z)$:\n\n$$u(P) = \\int_{O}^{P} \\omega = \\int_{\\infty}^{P} \\frac{dx}{2y} = \\int_{\\infty}^{P} \\frac{dx}{2\\sqrt{x^3 + 7x + 6}}$$\n\nTo find the Riemann-Roch space $L(P)$, we need to find all meromorphic functions $f$ on the elliptic curve such that $(f) + P \\geq 0$, where $(f)$ denotes the divisor of $f$. In other words, we need to find all meromorphic functions with at most a simple pole at $P$.\n\nThe Riemann-Roch theorem states that:\n\n$$\\dim L(P) - \\dim L(K - P) = 1 - \\deg P = 1$$\n\nwhere $K$ is the canonical divisor of the elliptic curve. Since the genus of the elliptic curve is 1, we have $K = O$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\dim L(P) - \\dim L(O - P) = 1$$\n\nSince $O - P = -P$, we have:\n\n$$\\dim L(P) - \\dim L(-P) = 1$$\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann Theta function to find the Riemann-Roch space $L(P)$. The Riemann-Roch space $L(P)$ is spanned by the functions:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{\\theta(u(P) + z|\\tau)}{\\theta(u(P)|\\tau)}$$\n\nwhere $z$ is a complex number. Since $\\dim L(P) = 1$, the Riemann-Roch space $L(P)$ is one-dimensional and is spanned by the function $f(z)$.\n\nIn conclusion, the Riemann-Roch space $L(P)$ associated to $P$ on this elliptic curve is given by the one-dimensional space spanned by the function:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{\\theta(u(P) + z|\\tau)}{\\theta(u(P)|\\tau)}$$"
