    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subject of Partial Differential Equations for Image Processing and Computer Vision:\n\nSuppose we have an image with dimensions 512x512, and we want to apply a blurring effect to it using a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 1.5. Write a partial differential equation that describes this blurring process, and determine the numerical values of the coefficients needed to implement it using a 5-point stencil on a discretized grid. Then, solve the resulting system of linear equations using an iterative method such as the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel method, and compare the resulting blurred image with the original image using a suitable metric such as the mean squared error (MSE).",
    "message_2": "To apply a blurring effect to an image using a Gaussian kernel, we can model the process using the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation (PDE) of the form:\n\n∂u/∂t = D * ( ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² )\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) represents the intensity of the image at position (x, y) and time t, and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nFor a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of σ = 1.5, the diffusion coefficient D can be calculated as:\n\nD = σ² / 2 = 1.5² / 2 ≈ 1.125\n\nNow, we need to discretize the PDE using a 5-point stencil on a grid. Let h be the grid spacing, and let uᵢⱼⁿ denote the intensity of the image at grid point (i, j) and time step n. The discretized PDE can be written as:\n\n(uᵢⱼⁿ⁺¹ - uᵢⱼⁿ) / Δt = D * ( (uᵢ₊₁ⱼⁿ - 2uᵢⱼⁿ + uᵢ₋₁ⱼⁿ) / h² + (uᵢⱼ₊₁ⁿ - 2uᵢⱼⁿ + uᵢⱼ₋₁ⁿ) / h² )\n\nTo solve this system of linear equations, we can use an iterative method such as the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel method. For example, using the Jacobi method, we can update the image intensity at each grid point (i, j) as follows:\n\nuᵢⱼⁿ⁺¹ = uᵢⱼⁿ + Δt * D * ( (uᵢ₊₁ⱼⁿ - 2uᵢⱼⁿ + uᵢ₋₁ⱼⁿ) / h² + (uᵢⱼ₊₁ⁿ - 2uᵢⱼⁿ + uᵢⱼ₋₁ⁿ) / h² )\n\nAfter applying the blurring effect to the image, we can compare the resulting blurred image with the original image using a suitable metric such as the mean squared error (MSE), which is defined as:\n\nMSE = (1 / (512 * 512)) * ΣᵢΣⱼ (uᵢⱼᵒʳᶦᵍᶦⁿᵃˡ - uᵢⱼᵇˡᵘʳʳᵉᵈ)²\n\nwhere uᵢⱼᵒʳᶦᵍᶦⁿᵃˡ and uᵢⱼᵇˡᵘʳʳᵉᵈ are the intensities of the original and blurred images at grid point (i, j), respectively."
