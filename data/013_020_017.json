    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest game, there are 10 players who each choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all chosen numbers. What number should each player choose to maximize their chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chance of winning, each player should try to predict the average of the numbers chosen by the other players and then choose a number that is two-thirds of that predicted average.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and think similarly. If all players choose a number uniformly at random between 0 and 100, the average of the chosen numbers would be 50. In this case, a rational player would choose two-thirds of 50, which is 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think this way and choose 33.33, then the new average would be 33.33, and the optimal choice would be two-thirds of 33.33, which is approximately 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, and each time the optimal choice will get closer to 0. However, since the numbers chosen must be between 0 and 100, the optimal choice will never actually reach 0.\n\nIn practice, the optimal choice depends on the level of rationality and strategic thinking of the other players. If you believe that the other players are perfectly rational and will also choose numbers based on this logic, you should choose a number close to the result of iteratively applying the two-thirds rule several times. For example, after 3 iterations, the optimal choice would be approximately 14.81 (two-thirds of 22.22). After 4 iterations, it would be approximately 9.87 (two-thirds of 14.81), and so on.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no fixed optimal choice, as it depends on the level of strategic thinking of the other players. However, choosing a number close to the result of iteratively applying the two-thirds rule several times should maximize your chance of winning."
