If A is a closed subset of X and B is a closed subset of R, then prove that f^(-1)(B) ∩ A is a closed subset of X. \n\nIn other words, the question for the math student to solve is to prove that the preimage of a closed set under a continuous function is a closed set in the original space.",
    "message_2": "To prove that f^(-1)(B) ∩ A is a closed subset of X, we will show that its complement in X is open.\n\nRecall that a function f: X → R is continuous if and only if the preimage of every open set in R is open in X. Since B is a closed subset of R, its complement, B^c, is open in R. By the continuity of f, we know that f^(-1)(B^c) is open in X.\n\nNow, let's consider the complement of f^(-1)(B) ∩ A in X. By De Morgan's laws, we have:\n\n(f^(-1)(B) ∩ A)^c = f^(-1)(B)^c ∪ A^c\n\nSince A is a closed subset of X, its complement A^c is open in X. We already know that f^(-1)(B^c) is open in X. The union of two open sets is open, so:\n\nf^(-1)(B)^c ∪ A^c is open in X.\n\nThus, the complement of f^(-1)(B) ∩ A is open in X, which implies that f^(-1)(B) ∩ A is a closed subset of X. This completes the proof."
