    "message_1": "Suppose we have a set of 10 numbers, and we want to determine if there exist three distinct numbers in the set such that their sum is equal to zero. What is the minimum possible number of comparisons between elements in the set that are needed to determine if such a triple exists?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a sorting algorithm and then perform a linear search for the triple. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Sort the given set of numbers. This can be done using an efficient sorting algorithm like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n). In this case, n = 10, so the number of comparisons needed for sorting is O(10 * log(10)) â‰ˆ 33 comparisons.\n\n2. After sorting, we can use a linear search to find if there exists a triple with a sum equal to zero. For each number in the sorted set, we can use a two-pointer approach to find if there exists a pair with the required sum. This step will take O(n) time, which is 10 comparisons in this case.\n\nSo, the minimum possible number of comparisons needed to determine if such a triple exists is approximately 33 (for sorting) + 10 (for linear search) = 43 comparisons."
