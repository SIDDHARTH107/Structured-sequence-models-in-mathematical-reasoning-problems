    "message_1": "A circular table has a radius of 42 cm. If a slice of pizza is cut with an angle of 60°, what is the area of the pizza slice? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a square centimeter.)",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the pizza slice, we can use the formula for the area of a sector of a circle: \n\nArea = (angle/360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere angle is the angle of the sector (in this case, the pizza slice) and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven the angle of 60° and a radius of 42 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (60/360) * π * 42^2\n\nArea = (1/6) * π * 1764\n\nArea = 294π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nArea ≈ 294 * 3.14\n\nArea ≈ 922.56\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth of a square centimeter, the area of the pizza slice is approximately 922.6 square centimeters."
