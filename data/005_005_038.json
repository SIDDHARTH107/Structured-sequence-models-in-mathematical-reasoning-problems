    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces smartphones and the probability of producing a faulty phone is 0.1. If a sample of 50 phones is randomly selected, what is the probability that at most 5 phones are faulty?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k faulty phones\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of producing a faulty phone (0.1)\n- n is the total number of phones in the sample (50)\n- k is the number of faulty phones (0 to 5)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at most 5 phones are faulty, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nP(X ≤ 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * 0.1^0 * (1-0.1)^(50-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.1^0 * 0.9^50 ≈ 0.000002\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * 0.1^1 * (1-0.1)^(50-1) = 50 * 0.1 * 0.9^49 ≈ 0.000045\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * 0.1^2 * (1-0.1)^(50-2) = 1225 * 0.01 * 0.9^48 ≈ 0.000410\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * 0.1^3 * (1-0.1)^(50-3) = 19600 * 0.001 * 0.9^47 ≈ 0.001982\nP(X = 4) = C(50, 4) * 0.1^4 * (1-0.1)^(50-4) = 230300 * 0.0001 * 0.9^46 ≈ 0.006467\nP(X = 5) = C(50, 5) * 0.1^5 * (1-0.1)^(50-5) = 2118760 * 0.00001 * 0.9^45 ≈ 0.014891\n\nNow, we can sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 5) ≈ 0.000002 + 0.000045 + 0.000410 + 0.001982 + 0.006467 + 0.014891 ≈ 0.023797\n\nSo, the probability that at most 5 phones are faulty in a sample of 50 is approximately 0.0238 or 2.38%."
