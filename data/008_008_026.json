    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products A and B. Each unit of A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, and makes a profit of $5. Each unit of B requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, and makes a profit of $4. The company has 120 labor hours and 80 machine hours available. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y, subject to the constraints 3x + 2y ≤ 120 (labor hours) and 2x + y ≤ 80 (machine hours).\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 120\n2. 2x + y ≤ 80\n\nTo graph the constraints, we can find the intercepts:\n\nFor constraint 1:\nx-intercept: set y = 0, then 3x = 120, x = 40\ny-intercept: set x = 0, then 2y = 120, y = 60\n\nFor constraint 2:\nx-intercept: set y = 0, then 2x = 80, x = 40\ny-intercept: set x = 0, then y = 80\n\nNow we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and finding the intersection points:\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 60), (40, 0), and (20, 40).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y at each of the vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 60) = 5(0) + 4(60) = 240\n3. P(40, 0) = 5(40) + 4(0) = 200\n4. P(20, 40) = 5(20) + 4(40) = 100 + 160 = 260\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 40), with a profit of $260. Therefore, the company should produce 20 units of product A and 40 units of product B to maximize its profit."
