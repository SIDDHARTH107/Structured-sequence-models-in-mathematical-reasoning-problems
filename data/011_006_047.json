    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nFirst, we need to choose 3 members from the subset of 4 people. The number of ways to do this is:\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4! / (3!1!) = (4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)(1)) = 4\n\nNext, we need to choose 1 member from the remaining 6 people. The number of ways to do this is:\n\nC(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6! / (1!5!) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((1)(5*4*3*2*1)) = 6\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 3 members from the subset of 4 people by the number of ways to choose 1 member from the remaining 6 people:\n\nTotal number of ways = 4 * 6 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select a committee of 4 members from a group of 10 people with the given conditions."
