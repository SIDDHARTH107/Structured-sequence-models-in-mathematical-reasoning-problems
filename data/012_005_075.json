    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph using the distance matrix, we first need to find the distance matrix itself. However, since we don't have the specific graph G, we can't compute the exact distance matrix. Instead, we can use the general properties of graphs to find the diameter.\n\nA simple connected graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges is guaranteed to be connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph.\n\nLet's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, with 7 vertices and 10 edges, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible degree sequences for the graph G. Since the graph is connected, each vertex must have a degree of at least 1. The maximum degree for a vertex in a simple graph with 7 vertices is 6 (connected to all other vertices). Let's try to find a degree sequence that adds up to 20.\n\nOne possible degree sequence is (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3). This sequence has a sum of 20 and represents a connected graph. In this graph, the vertex with degree 1 is connected to a vertex with degree 4. The longest shortest path (diameter) in this graph would be the path that goes from the vertex with degree 1 to the other vertex with degree 4, passing through the other vertices. This path has a length of 4.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the graph G is 4."
