    "message_1": "A company is considering investing in a new project. The expected profits for the project are $50,000 with 60% probability and $20,000 with 40% probability. The company is risk-averse and wants to know if this investment is worth it. What is the expected value of the investment, and should the company invest in the project?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the investment, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Outcome 1 * Value of Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 * Value of Outcome 2)\n\nIn this case, the expected value would be:\n\nExpected Value = (0.60 * $50,000) + (0.40 * $20,000)\nExpected Value = ($30,000) + ($8,000)\nExpected Value = $38,000\n\nThe expected value of the investment is $38,000. Whether the company should invest in the project depends on their risk tolerance and the opportunity cost of not investing in other projects. If the company is risk-averse and the expected value of $38,000 is not significantly higher than the returns from other less risky investments, they may choose not to invest in the project. However, if the expected value is considerably higher than other investment options, the company may decide to invest in the project despite the risk."
