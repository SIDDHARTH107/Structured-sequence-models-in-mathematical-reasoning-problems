    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the given continuous-time signal f(t), we need to apply the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform F(ω) of a continuous-time signal f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time domain (-∞ to ∞).\n\nFor the given signal f(t) = sin(50πt) + 2sin(150πt) + 3sin(250πt), we can apply the Fourier transform to each sinusoidal component separately and then sum the results.\n\nLet's first recall the Fourier transform pair for a sine function:\n\nFourier transform of sin(2πft) is (j/2) * [δ(ω - 2πf) - δ(ω + 2πf)], where δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, let's apply the Fourier transform to each component of f(t):\n\n1. For sin(50πt): \nF1(ω) = (j/2) * [δ(ω - 50π) - δ(ω + 50π)]\n\n2. For 2sin(150πt): \nF2(ω) = 2 * (j/2) * [δ(ω - 150π) - δ(ω + 150π)] = j * [δ(ω - 150π) - δ(ω + 150π)]\n\n3. For 3sin(250πt): \nF3(ω) = 3 * (j/2) * [δ(ω - 250π) - δ(ω + 250π)] = (3j/2) * [δ(ω - 250π) - δ(ω + 250π)]\n\nNow, we can sum the Fourier transforms of each component to find the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω)\nF(ω) = (j/2) * [δ(ω - 50π) - δ(ω + 50π)] + j * [δ(ω - 150π) - δ(ω + 150π)] + (3j/2) * [δ(ω - 250π) - δ(ω + 250π)]\n\nSo, the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t) is:\n\nF(ω) = (j/2) * [δ(ω - 50π) - δ(ω + 50π)] + j * [δ(ω - 150π) - δ(ω + 150π)] + (3j/2) * [δ(ω - 250π) - δ(ω + 250π)]"
