    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: A and B. The production process requires two machines: Machine 1 and Machine 2. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of processing time on Machine 1 and 1 hour of processing time on Machine 2. Each unit of product B requires 3 hours of processing time on Machine 1 and 1 hour of processing time on Machine 2. Machine 1 is available for 120 hours and Machine 2 is available for 100 hours. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and the profit per unit of product B is $20. Using mixed-integer linear programming, determine the number of units of each product to produce in order to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 20y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 120 (Machine 1 availability)\nx + y ≤ 100 (Machine 2 availability)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\n\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 3 (Machine 1 constraint)\ny ≤ 100 - x (Machine 2 constraint)\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. y ≤ (120 - 2x) / 3\n2. y ≤ 100 - x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (60, 0), and (30, 70). We will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 20(0) = $0\nP(0, 40) = 10(0) + 20(40) = $800\nP(60, 0) = 10(60) + 20(0) = $600\nP(30, 70) = 10(30) + 20(70) = $1700\n\nThe maximum profit is $1700 when producing 30 units of product A and 70 units of product B."
