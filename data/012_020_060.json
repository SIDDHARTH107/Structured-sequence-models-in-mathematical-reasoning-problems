    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation). In this case, we have a square graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges.\n\nThere are 8 automorphisms for this graph:\n\n1. Identity (no change): (1)(2)(3)(4)\n2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise: (1 2 3 4)\n3. Rotate 180 degrees: (1 3)(2 4)\n4. Rotate 270 degrees clockwise (90 degrees counterclockwise): (1 4 3 2)\n5. Reflect across the vertical axis: (1 2)(3 4)\n6. Reflect across the horizontal axis: (1 4)(2 3)\n7. Reflect across the main diagonal: (1 3)\n8. Reflect across the anti-diagonal: (2 4)\n\nThus, the automorphism group of this graph is the set of these 8 automorphisms, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, denoted as D4 or D_4."
