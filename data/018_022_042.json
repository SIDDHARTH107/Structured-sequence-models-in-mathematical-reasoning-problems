    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A) and determine whether they are equal or not. Show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, and B and A.\n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A).\n\n(A ∆ B) × (B ∆ A) = {1, 4} × {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (B ∆ A) and (A ∆ B).\n\n(B ∆ A) × (A ∆ B) = {1, 4} × {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A ∆ B) × (B ∆ A) = (B ∆ A) × (A ∆ B). Therefore, the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the symmetric difference itself is commutative, i.e., A ∆ B = B ∆ A, but this does not imply that the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference is also commutative. In this specific example, it just happens to be the case that the Cartesian products are equal."
