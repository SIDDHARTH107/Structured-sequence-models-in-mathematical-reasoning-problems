    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of the dice landing on an odd number using Monte Carlo simulation, we will simulate the process of rolling the dice 100 times and count the number of times it lands on an odd number. We will repeat this process a large number of times (let's say 10,000 times) and then calculate the average number of odd rolls per 100 rolls. Finally, we will divide this average by 100 to get the estimated probability.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Define the possible outcomes of rolling a six-sided dice: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n2. Define a function to simulate rolling the dice once and returning True if the outcome is odd and False if it's even.\n3. Define a function to simulate rolling the dice 100 times and counting the number of odd outcomes.\n4. Run the 100-roll simulation 10,000 times and store the counts of odd outcomes in a list.\n5. Calculate the average number of odd outcomes per 100 rolls by summing the counts and dividing by 10,000.\n6. Divide the average number of odd outcomes by 100 to get the estimated probability.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform the simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef is_odd_roll():\n    roll = random.randint(1, 6)\n    return roll % 2 == 1\n\ndef count_odd_rolls(num_rolls):\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(num_rolls):\n        if is_odd_roll():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nnum_simulations = 10000\nnum_rolls = 100\nodd_counts = [count_odd_rolls(num_rolls) for _ in range(num_simulations)]\n\naverage_odd_count = sum(odd_counts) / num_simulations\nestimated_probability = average_odd_count / num_rolls\n\nprint(\"Estimated probability of rolling an odd number:\", estimated_probability)\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, you should get an estimated probability close to 0.5, which is the true probability of rolling an odd number with a fair six-sided dice (since there are 3 odd numbers and 3 even numbers)."
