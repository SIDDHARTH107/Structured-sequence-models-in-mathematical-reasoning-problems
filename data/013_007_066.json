Each farmer wants to maximize their profit by grazing as many cattle as possible on the land. However, the land can only sustain a maximum of 200 heads of cattle in total. If each farmer grazes cattle on their land independently, how many cattle will they collectively graze? What is the resulting profit for each farmer assuming that each head of cattle generates a profit of $50?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 10 farmers and 100 acres of land, each farmer owns 10 acres of land (100 acres / 10 farmers = 10 acres per farmer). The land can sustain a maximum of 200 heads of cattle, so the land can support 2 heads of cattle per acre (200 cattle / 100 acres = 2 cattle per acre).\n\nEach farmer wants to maximize their profit by grazing as many cattle as possible on their land.
