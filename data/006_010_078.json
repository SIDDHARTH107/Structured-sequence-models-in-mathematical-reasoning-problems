    "message_2": "The probability that a randomly selected individual from a certain demographic group has a disease, given that the prevalence of the disease in that group is 5%, can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability = (Number of individuals with the disease) / (Total number of individuals in the group)\n\nSince the prevalence of the disease is 5% and the group has 1000 members, the number of individuals with the disease is:\n\nNumber of individuals with the disease = 0.05 * 1000 = 50\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = 50 / 1000 = 0.05 or 5%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this demographic group has the disease is 5%."
