    "message_2": "The general equation for a sinusoidal wave is given by:\n\ny = A * sin(Bx - C) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 2sin(3x - π/2), we can identify the following:\n\nA = 2 (amplitude)\nB = 3 (angular frequency)\nC = π/2 (phase shift)\nD = 0 (vertical shift, since it's not present in the equation)\n\nThe phase shift of the wave is C, which is π/2."
