    "message_1": "In a block design experiment, 10 patients are randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) with each group having the same number of patients. Each patient receives only one treatment. What is the number of possible treatment combinations for this experiment?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 10 patients and 4 treatment groups, we need to divide the patients equally among the groups. So, each group will have 10/4 = 2.5 patients. However, we cannot have half a patient, so it is not possible to divide the 10 patients equally among the 4 treatment groups. Therefore, there is no valid treatment combination for this experiment."
