    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nIn this case, we have 6 left turns and 6 right turns, so n = 6. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nC(6) = (1/(6+1)) * (12! / (6! * 6!))\n\nC(6) = (1/7) * (479001600 / (720 * 720))\n\nC(6) = (1/7) * (665280)\n\nC(6) = 132256\n\nSo there are 132,256 ways to arrange a sequence of 6 left and 6 right turns such that the sequence never goes below the x-axis."
