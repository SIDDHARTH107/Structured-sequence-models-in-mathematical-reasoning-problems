    "message_2": "The Gosper curve is a fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of (2√2 + 2). \n\nLet L be the initial length of the Gosper curve, which is 10 units. After 6 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nL * (2√2 + 2)^6\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n10 * (2√2 + 2)^6 ≈ 10 * 1024.00097 ≈ 10240.0097\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the total length of the curve after 6 iterations is approximately 10240.01 units."
