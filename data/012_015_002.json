    "message_2": "To determine whether a graph is connected or not, we can use the following theorem:\n\nA graph with n vertices is connected if and only if it has at least (n-1) edges and the sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least 2(n-1).\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. Let's check if it satisfies the conditions of the theorem.\n\n1. The graph has at least (n-1) edges:\nSince n = 10, (n-1) = 9. The graph has 15 edges, which is more than 9, so it satisfies this condition.\n\n2. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least 2(n-1):\nIn a graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges (because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices). In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 15 = 30.\n\nSince n = 10, 2(n-1) = 2 * 9 = 18. The sum of the degrees of all vertices (30) is greater than 18, so the graph satisfies this condition as well.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, we can conclude that the graph is connected."
