    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nTwo companies, A and B, are considering reducing the prices of their respective products. If they both reduce the prices, they will both receive a payoff of $10 million. If only one company reduces the price, that company will receive a payoff of $12 million, while the other company's payoff will be $8 million. If neither company reduces the price, they will both receive a payoff of $11 million. What is the Nash equilibrium in this game?",
    "message_2": "A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this case, we have two players (companies A and B) and two strategies for each player (reduce the price or not reduce the price).\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both companies reduce the price:\n   Payoff A = $10 million, Payoff B = $10 million\n\n2. Only company A reduces the price:\n   Payoff A = $12 million, Payoff B = $8 million\n\n3. Only company B reduces the price:\n   Payoff A = $8 million, Payoff B = $12 million\n\n4. Neither company reduces the price:\n   Payoff A = $11 million, Payoff B = $11 million\n\nNow, let's find the Nash equilibrium by checking if any player has an incentive to change their strategy given the other player's strategy.\n\n- If company A reduces the price and company B does not, company A gets $12 million. If company A does not reduce the price, it gets $11 million. So, company A has an incentive to reduce the price.\n- If company B reduces the price and company A does not, company B gets $12 million. If company B does not reduce the price, it gets $11 million. So, company B has an incentive to reduce the price.\n\nGiven that both companies have an incentive to reduce the price, the Nash equilibrium is the situation where both companies reduce the price. In this case, the payoffs are:\n\nPayoff A = $10 million, Payoff B = $10 million"
