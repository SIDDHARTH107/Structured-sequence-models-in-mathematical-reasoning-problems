The input signal has a Fourier series representation given by:\n$$x(t) = 5\\cos(2\\pi t)+2\\cos(4\\pi t)+3\\sin(6\\pi t)$$\nUsing the Fourier transform, determine the behavior of the network for frequencies that correspond to the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency (which is $f_0=\\frac{1}{T}$, where $T$ is the period of the input signal). In particular, find the amplitude and phase of the output signal for the third harmonic frequency. Assume the network is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5Hz.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the fundamental frequency $f_0$ of the input signal. The period $T$ can be determined by looking at the smallest frequency component in the input signal. In this case, the smallest frequency component is $2\\pi t$, which corresponds to a period of $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi} = 1$ second. Therefore, the fundamental frequency is $f_0 = \\frac{1}{T} = 1$ Hz.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of the network for frequencies that correspond to the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. The input signal has three frequency components:\n\n1. $5\\cos(2\\pi t)$ with frequency $f_1 = 1$ Hz (first harmonic)\n2. $2\\cos(4\\pi t)$ with frequency $f_2 = 2$ Hz (second harmonic)\n3. $3\\sin(6\\pi t)$ with frequency $f_3 = 3$ Hz (third harmonic)\n\nSince the network is a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz, it will allow the first, second, and third harmonics to pass through, but attenuate the higher harmonics. \n\nNow, let's find the amplitude and phase of the output signal for the third harmonic frequency. The third harmonic component of the input signal is $3\\sin(6\\pi t)$. To find the amplitude and phase of the output signal, we need to consider the transfer function of the low-pass filter at the third harmonic frequency (3 Hz).\n\nLet $H(f)$ be the transfer function of the low-pass filter. The amplitude response of the filter at the third harmonic frequency is given by $|H(3)|$. The phase response of the filter at the third harmonic frequency is given by $\\angle H(3)$. \n\nHowever, we don't have enough information about the specific low-pass filter to determine the exact values of $|H(3)|$ and $\\angle H(3)$. In general, the amplitude and phase of the output signal for the third harmonic frequency can be represented as:\n\n$$A_3 = 3|H(3)|$$\n$$\\phi_3 = \\angle H(3)$$\n\nSo, the output signal for the third harmonic frequency will be:\n\n$$y_3(t) = A_3\\sin(6\\pi t + \\phi_3) = 3|H(3)|\\sin(6\\pi t + \\angle H(3))$$\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the specific low-pass filter, we can only represent the amplitude and phase of the output signal for the third harmonic frequency in terms of the filter's transfer function."
