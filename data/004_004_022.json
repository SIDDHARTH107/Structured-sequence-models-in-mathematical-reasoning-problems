    "message_2": "To calculate the area between the curve y = 2x and the x-axis from x = 1 to x = 3 using integration, we need to find the integral of the function y = 2x with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of y = 2x with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(2x) dx = x^2 + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits x = 1 and x = 3:\n\nx^2 + C | from x = 1 to x = 3\n\n= (3^2 + C) - (1^2 + C)\n\n= (9 + C) - (1 + C)\n\nSince the constant C cancels out, we are left with:\n\n= 9 - 1\n\n= 8\n\nSo, the area between the curve y = 2x and the x-axis from x = 1 to x = 3 is 8 square units."
