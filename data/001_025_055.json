    "message_2": "To find all complex solutions to the equation $z^3 + 8i = 0$, we first rewrite the equation as $z^3 = -8i$. Now, we will use the polar form of complex numbers to solve this equation.\n\nLet $z = r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ and $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$. Then, we have:\n\n$r^3 (\\cos 3\\theta + i \\sin 3\\theta) = -8i$\n\nSince $-8i$ has a magnitude of $8$ and an argument of $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, we can write it in polar form as $8(\\cos \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + i \\sin \\frac{3\\pi}{2})$.\n\nNow, we can equate the magnitudes and arguments:\n\n$r^3 = 8 \\Rightarrow r = 2$ (since $r$ must be non-negative)\n\n$3\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{2}{3}k\\pi$\n\nSince the cube roots of unity are $1, e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$, we can find the three distinct solutions by plugging in $k = 0, 1, 2$:\n\n1. For $k = 0$:\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n\n$z_1 = 2(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{2} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 2i$\n\n2. For $k = 1$:\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{2}{3}\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$\n\n$z_2 = 2(\\cos \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + i \\sin \\frac{5\\pi}{6}) = -1 + \\sqrt{3}i$\n\n3. For $k = 2$:\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{4}{3}\\pi = \\frac{11\\pi}{6}$\n\n$z_3 = 2(\\cos \\frac{11\\pi}{6} + i \\sin \\frac{11\\pi}{6}) = -1 - \\sqrt{3}i$\n\nThus, the complex solutions to the equation $z^3 + 8i = 0$ are $z_1 = 2i$, $z_2 = -1 + \\sqrt{3}i$, and $z_3 = -1 - \\sqrt{3}i$."
