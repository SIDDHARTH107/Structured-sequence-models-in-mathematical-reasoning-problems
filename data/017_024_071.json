    "message_2": "To determine the number of groups of order 96 that are isomorphic to either C96 or the direct product of A4, C4, and C2, we will consider each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Cyclic group C96\nThere is only one cyclic group of order 96, which is generated by an element of order 96. So, there is only 1 group in this case.\n\nCase 2: Direct product of A4, C4, and C2\nThe order of the direct product of A4, C4, and C2 is |A4| * |C4| * |C2| = 12 * 4 * 2 = 96. Since the orders of A4, C4, and C2 are pairwise coprime (gcd(12, 4) = gcd(12, 2) = gcd(4, 2) = 1), the direct product of these groups is unique up to isomorphism by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. So, there is only 1 group in this case as well.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (C96) + 1 (A4 × C4 × C2) = 2 groups of order 96 that are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96 or the direct product of A4, C4, and C2."
