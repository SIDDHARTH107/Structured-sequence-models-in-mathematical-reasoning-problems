Using the forward, backward, and central difference formulas with a step size of h = 0.1, approximate the first derivative of f(x) at x = 0.5.

    "message_2": "First, let's approximate the first derivative of f(x) at x = 0.5 using the forward, backward, and central difference formulas with a step size of h = 0.1.\n\nForward difference formula:\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nBackward difference formula:\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x) - f(x - h)) / h\n\nCentral difference formula:\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nLet x = 0.5 and h = 0.1.\n\nf(0.5) = 2sin(0.5) - 0.5^2 ≈ 0.8293\nf(0.5 + 0.1) = 2sin(0.6) - 0.6^2 ≈ 0.6755\nf(0.5 - 0.1) = 2sin(0.4) - 0.4^2 ≈ 0.9636\n\nForward difference approximation:\nf'(0.5) ≈ (0.6755 - 0.8293) / 0.1 ≈ -1.538\n\nBackward difference approximation:\nf'(0.5) ≈ (0.8293 - 0.9636) / 0.1 ≈ -1.343\n\nCentral difference approximation:\nf'(0.5) ≈ (0.6755 - 0.9636) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ -1.4405\n\nNow, let's approximate the integral of f(x) from x = 0 to x = π using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of h = 0.1.\n\nTrapezoidal rule formula:\n∫f(x)dx ≈ h * (0.5 * (f(x0) + f(xn)) + Σf(xi))\n\nIn this case, x0 = 0, xn = π, and h = 0.1. We will have n = (π - 0) / 0.1 ≈ 31.42, so we will use n = 31 for our approximation.\n\nLet's calculate the sum Σf(xi) for i = 1 to 30:\n\nsum = 0\nfor i = 1 to 30:\n    xi = i * 0.1\n    sum += 2sin(xi) - xi^2\n\nNow, we can apply the trapezoidal rule formula:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 * (f(0) + f(π)) + sum)\n\nf(0) = 2sin(0) - 0^2 = 0\nf(π) = 2sin(π) - π^2 ≈ -9.8696\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 * (0 - 9.8696) + sum)\n\nAfter calculating the sum and plugging it into the formula, we get:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ -1.9857\n\nSo, the approximate integral of f(x) from x = 0 to x = π using the trapezoidal rule with a step size of h = 0.1 is -1.9857."
