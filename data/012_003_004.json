    "message_2": "To find the size of the maximum independent set in the graph G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set and the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. This is known as the Gallai's theorem.\n\nFirst, let's find an upper bound for the minimum vertex cover. By Turán's theorem, a graph with n vertices and no complete subgraph of size k+1 has at most (k-1)n/2k edges. In our case, we have 10 vertices and 12 edges. Let's assume there is no complete subgraph of size 4 (i.e., no K4 subgraph), so k = 3.\n\nUsing Turán's theorem, we get:\n\n(2/3) * 10 = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\nSince the number of edges is 12, which is less than 6.67, our assumption that there is no K4 subgraph is valid. Therefore, the graph G has no complete subgraph of size 4.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum vertex cover. Since there is no K4 subgraph, the graph G is a 3-degenerate graph. A 3-degenerate graph has a vertex cover of size at most 3n/4. In our case, n = 10, so the upper bound for the minimum vertex cover is:\n\n(3/4) * 10 = 7.5\n\nSince the size of the vertex cover must be an integer, the minimum vertex cover has size at most 7.\n\nNow, using Gallai's theorem, we can find the size of the maximum independent set:\n\nSize of maximum independent set = Number of vertices - Size of minimum vertex cover\n\nSize of maximum independent set = 10 - 7 = 3\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in the graph G is 3."
