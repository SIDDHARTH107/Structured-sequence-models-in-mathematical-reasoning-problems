    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two sides AB and BC, we can use the dot product formula for the angle between two vectors. Let's represent the sides as vectors:\n\nVector AB = <x1, y1> = <3, 0> (since AB is along the x-axis)\nVector BC = <x2, y2> = <0, 4> (since BC is along the y-axis)\n\nThe dot product formula for the angle θ between two vectors is:\n\ncos(θ) = (AB • BC) / (||AB|| ||BC||)\n\nwhere AB • BC is the dot product of the two vectors, and ||AB|| and ||BC|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors is given by:\n\nAB • BC = (x1 * x2) + (y1 * y2)\n\nSo, in our case:\n\nAB • BC = (3 * 0) + (0 * 4) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n||AB|| = √(x1^2 + y1^2) = √(3^2 + 0^2) = √9 = 3\n||BC|| = √(x2^2 + y2^2) = √(0^2 + 4^2) = √16 = 4\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (AB • BC) / (||AB|| ||BC||) = 0 / (3 * 4) = 0\n\nSince cos(θ) = 0, the angle θ between the two sides AB and BC is 90 degrees, which confirms that the triangle is indeed a right-angled triangle."
