    "message_2": "A quintic threefold is a complex projective three-dimensional variety defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in four variables. Mirror symmetry is a duality between two Calabi-Yau manifolds that relates their complex and symplectic structures.\n\nTo find the number of rational curves of degree 3 on a quintic threefold invariant under mirror symmetry, we can use the Gromov-Witten invariants, which count the number of rational curves of a given degree on a variety. In the context of mirror symmetry, these invariants can be computed using the A-model (symplectic side) and the B-model (complex side).\n\nFor a quintic threefold, the mirror symmetry conjecture relates the Gromov-Witten invariants to the periods of the mirror quintic. In particular, the number of rational curves of degree d on the quintic threefold can be computed from the genus 0 Gromov-Witten potential, which is a generating function for the Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nIn the case of degree 3 rational curves, the relevant Gromov-Witten invariant is denoted as n_3, and it has been computed to be equal to 317206375. Therefore, there are 317206375 rational curves of degree 3 on a quintic threefold invariant under mirror symmetry."
