    "message_2": "Let S be a set with 3 distinct elements, i.e., |S| = 3. The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.\n\nTo find the number of elements in the power set of S, we can use the formula |P(S)| = 2^|S|, where |S| is the number of elements in S. In this case, |S| = 3, so |P(S)| = 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow let's compare the number of elements in the power set of S with the number of elements in S. We have |P(S)| = 8 and |S| = 3. Clearly, 8 > 3, so the power set of S has more elements than S itself.\n\nTo prove that the power set of S is always larger than S, let's consider an arbitrary set S with n distinct elements, i.e., |S| = n. The number of elements in the power set of S is |P(S)| = 2^n. Since n is a positive integer, we know that 2^n > n for all n > 0. This is because the function 2^n grows exponentially, while n grows linearly. Therefore, the power set of S will always have more elements than S itself, regardless of the number of elements in S."
