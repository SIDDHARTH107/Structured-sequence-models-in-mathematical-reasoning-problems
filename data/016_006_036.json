    "message_2": "To produce a Barnsley fern fractal image with a total of 50,000 points, you need to perform 50,000 iterations. Each iteration will generate one point, and the transformation probabilities determine which function will be applied to generate that point. After 50,000 iterations, you will have generated 50,000 points, creating the desired Barnsley fern fractal image."
