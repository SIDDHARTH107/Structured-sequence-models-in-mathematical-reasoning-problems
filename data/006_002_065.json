    "message_2": "There are three odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) on a six-sided dice. The probability of rolling an odd number is the ratio of the number of odd outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, there are 3 odd outcomes and 6 total outcomes, so the probability is:\n\nP(odd number) = (number of odd outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%."
