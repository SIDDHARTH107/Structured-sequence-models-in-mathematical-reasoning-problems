We want to check if (X x Y) ∩ Z = X x (Y ∩ Z).\n\nIn general, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection. This is because the elements of a Cartesian product are ordered pairs, while the elements of a set intersection are single elements. Therefore, the intersection of a Cartesian product with a set will usually result in an empty set, as seen in parts (i) and (ii) of the problem. However, the Cartesian product of a set with the intersection of two sets may not always be an empty set, as it depends on the specific sets being considered.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
