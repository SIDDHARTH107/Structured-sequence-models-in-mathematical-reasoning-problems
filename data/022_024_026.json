Find the temperature at a point $(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6})$ on the plate.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the point $(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6})$, we simply need to plug the values of $r$ and $\\theta$ into the given function $u(r, \\theta) = 10r\\sin(3\\theta)$.\n\nSo, for the point $(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6})$, we have $r = 2$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$. Plugging these values into the function, we get:\n\n$u(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = 10(2)\\sin(3(\\frac{\\pi}{6}))$\n\n$u(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = 20\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})$\n\nNow, we know that $\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -1$, so:\n\n$u(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = 20(-1)$\n\n$u(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6}) = -20$\n\nTherefore, the temperature at the point $(2, \\frac{\\pi}{6})$ on the plate is $-20$ degrees."
