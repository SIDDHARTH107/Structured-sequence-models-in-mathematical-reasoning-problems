    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. $p$ is a Sophie Germain prime, so $p$ and $2p+1$ are prime numbers.\n2. $p+2$ is also a prime number.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases for $p$ modulo 3:\n\nCase 1: If $p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $p$ is divisible by 3. Since $p$ is a prime number, this implies that $p = 3$. In this case, $2p+1 = 7$ and $p+2 = 5$, which are both prime numbers. So, $p = 3$ is a valid Sophie Germain prime satisfying the given conditions.\n\nCase 2: If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $p+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which means that $p+2$ is divisible by 3. Since $p+2$ is a prime number, this implies that $p+2 = 3$, which leads to $p = 1$. However, $p = 1$ is not a prime number, so this case does not produce any valid Sophie Germain primes.\n\nCase 3: If $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $2p+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which means that $2p+1$ is divisible by 3. Since $2p+1$ is a prime number, this implies that $2p+1 = 3$, which leads to $p = 1$. Again, $p = 1$ is not a prime number, so this case does not produce any valid Sophie Germain primes.\n\nTherefore, the only Sophie Germain prime $p$ such that $p+2$ is also a prime number is $p = 3$."
