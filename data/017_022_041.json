    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nFor each prime factor, we will find the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. For the prime factor 2: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 60 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. \n\n2. For the prime factor 3: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 60 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, or 10.\n\n3. For the prime factor 5: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 60 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and their normality:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor, and all of them are normal. In this case, the group is the direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5 ≅ Z_60 (cyclic group of order 60). This group is abelian.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is a semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_3 and Z_5. There are two possible semi-direct products in this case, one of which is isomorphic to the alternating group A_5. Both of these groups are non-abelian.\n\n3. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is a semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_5 and Z_3. There is only one possible semi-direct product in this case, which is isomorphic to the dicyclic group Dic_12. This group is non-abelian.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then the group is a semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_15 and Z_2. There is only one possible semi-direct product in this case, which is isomorphic to the non-abelian group Z_2 × A_5.\n\nAll other combinations of Sylow subgroups lead to isomorphic groups to the ones already listed. Therefore, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 60:\n\n1. Z_60 (abelian)\n2. A_5 (non-abelian)\n3. A different semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_3 and Z_5 (non-abelian)\n4. Dic_12 (non-abelian)\n5. Z_2 × A_5 (non-abelian)\n\nOut of these 5 groups, 4 of them are non-abelian."
