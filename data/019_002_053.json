    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the predicate P(x): \"x + 2 is an even number\". An even number can be represented as 2n, where n is an integer. So, we have:\n\nx + 2 = 2n\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that satisfy this equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx = 2n - 2\n\nThis means that x must be an even number as well since it is a multiple of 2. Now, let's find the first 10 even positive integers that satisfy P(x):\n\n1. x = 2(1) - 2 = 0 (Note: Since the domain is positive integers, we will not consider 0)\n2. x = 2(2) - 2 = 2\n3. x = 2(3) - 2 = 4\n4. x = 2(4) - 2 = 6\n5. x = 2(5) - 2 = 8\n6. x = 2(6) - 2 = 10\n7. x = 2(7) - 2 = 12\n8. x = 2(8) - 2 = 14\n9. x = 2(9) - 2 = 16\n10. x = 2(10) - 2 = 18\n\nNow, we can find the sum of these 10 numbers in A:\n\n2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 = 90\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 numbers in A is 90."
