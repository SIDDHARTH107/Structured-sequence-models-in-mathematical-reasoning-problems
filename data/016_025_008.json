    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing triangles from an initial equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the remaining triangles are divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, and the central triangle is removed. \n\nTo find the total number of filled triangles in the 8th level construction of the Sierpinski sieve, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal filled triangles = (3 * (4^n - 1)) / (4 - 1)\n\nwhere n is the level of the construction.\n\nFor the 8th level:\n\nTotal filled triangles = (3 * (4^8 - 1)) / (4 - 1)\nTotal filled triangles = (3 * (65536 - 1)) / 3\nTotal filled triangles = (3 * 65535) / 3\nTotal filled triangles = 65535\n\nSo, there are 65,535 filled triangles in the 8th level construction of the Sierpinski sieve."
