    "message_1": "Sure, here's a control theory problem for a math student to solve: \n\nConsider the system given by:\ndx/dt = 2x + 6u\ndy/dt = 5x + 2y + u\n\nwhere x and y are the system state variables and u is the control input. Find the optimal control input u(t) that will minimize the cost function: \n\nJ = ∫((x^2 + y^2) + u^2) dt\n\nsubject to the following constraint:\n\ny(0) = 1, x(0) = 0, x(2) = 3 \n\n(Note: ∫ represents integration over time, and u(t) must satisfy the differential equation dx/dt = 2x + 6u and dy/dt = 5x + 2y + u at all times t.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). First, let's define the Hamiltonian function H(x, y, u, p_x, p_y) as follows:\n\nH(x, y, u, p_x, p_y) = (x^2 + y^2) + u^2 + p_x(2x + 6u) + p_y(5x + 2y + u)\n\nwhere p_x and p_y are the costate variables.\n\nAccording to the PMP, the optimal control input u(t) should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. dp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x\n3. dp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u + 6p_x + p_y = 0\n∂H/∂x = 2x + 5p_y + 2p_x\n∂H/∂y = 2y + 2p_y\n\nNow, let's compute the costate equations:\n\ndp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x = -2x - 5p_y - 2p_x\ndp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y = -2y - 2p_y\n\nNow we have a system of 5 differential equations:\n\n1. dx/dt = 2x + 6u\n2. dy/dt = 5x + 2y + u\n3. dp_x/dt = -2x - 5p_y - 2p_x\n4. dp_y/dt = -2y - 2p_y\n5. 2u + 6p_x + p_y = 0\n\nSolving this system of differential equations with the given constraints (y(0) = 1, x(0) = 0, x(2) = 3) is quite challenging analytically. Therefore, we will use numerical methods to find the optimal control input u(t).\n\nYou can use software like MATLAB or Python to solve this system of differential equations numerically and obtain the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J."
