    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has a portfolio worth $500,000 and wants to invest in two assets: stocks and bonds. The expected annual return for stocks is 10%, and the expected annual return for bonds is 5%. The investor wants to allocate a maximum of 60% to stocks and a minimum of 40% to bonds. If the investor's goal is to maximize the portfolio's expected annual return, what should be the allocations to stocks and bonds?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the portfolio's expected annual return, the investor should allocate the maximum allowed percentage to stocks (which have a higher expected return) and the minimum allowed percentage to bonds (which have a lower expected return).\n\nSo, the investor should allocate 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the dollar amounts for each allocation:\n\nStocks: $500,000 * 0.60 = $300,000\nBonds: $500,000 * 0.40 = $200,000\n\nThe investor should allocate $300,000 to stocks and $200,000 to bonds to maximize the portfolio's expected annual return."
