    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve connecting P and Q on the surface S, we need to minimize the arc length between the two points on the surface. The arc length can be expressed as:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2) ds\n\nwhere ds is the differential arc length along the curve.\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we can substitute these into the arc length expression:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (2x)^2 + (2y)^2) ds\n\nTo minimize the arc length, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let F(x, y, ∂x/∂s, ∂y/∂s) = √(1 + (2x)^2 + (2y)^2). Then, the Euler-Lagrange equations are:\n\n∂F/∂x - d(∂F/∂(∂x/∂s))/ds = 0\n∂F/∂y - d(∂F/∂(∂y/∂s))/ds = 0\n\nSolving these equations is quite challenging, and it usually requires numerical methods or specialized techniques. However, in this particular case, we can make an observation that simplifies the problem. Since the surface S is rotationally symmetric around the z-axis, the geodesic curve connecting P and Q must lie in the plane containing P, Q, and the z-axis.\n\nLet's find the equation of this plane. The normal vector to the plane can be found as the cross product of the position vectors of P and Q:\n\nN = P × Q = (1, 0, 1) × (1, 1, 3) = (-1, -2, 1)\n\nThus, the equation of the plane is:\n\n-1(x - 1) - 2(y - 0) + 1(z - 1) = 0\nx + 2y - z = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation of the surface S (z = x^2 + y^2) into the equation of the plane:\n\nx + 2y - (x^2 + y^2) = 0\n\nThis equation represents the geodesic curve connecting P and Q on the surface S. Note that this is an implicit equation, and it may be difficult to express y as a function of x or vice versa. However, this equation fully describes the geodesic curve on the surface."
