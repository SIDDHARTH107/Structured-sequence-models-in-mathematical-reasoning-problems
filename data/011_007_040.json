    "message_2": "There are 3 options for the first letter: A, B, or C. After choosing the first letter, there are only 2 options left for the second letter, as it cannot be the same as the first letter. Finally, there is only 1 option left for the third letter, as it cannot be the same as the second letter.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the three letters without any two consecutive letters being identical is:\n\n3 (options for the first letter) × 2 (options for the second letter) × 1 (option for the third letter) = 6 ways."
