    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  1 |  8 ]\n[ 1 -1  2 |  3 ]\n[ 3  4 -1 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  3 ]\n[ 2  3  1 |  8 ]\n[ 3  4 -1 |  2 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2 * Row 1 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  3 ]\n[ 0  5 -3 |  2 ]\n[ 0  7 -7 | -7 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 5:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  3 ]\n[ 0  1 -3/5 |  2/5 ]\n[ 0  7 -7 | -7 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with Row 1 + Row 2 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 7 * Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  7/5 | 19/5 ]\n[ 0  1 -3/5 |  2/5 ]\n[ 0  0  0  |  0  ]\n```\n\nSince we have a row of zeros at the bottom, we can see that the system has a unique solution. Now, we will perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom Row 2: y - (3/5)z = 2/5 => y = (2/5) + (3/5)z\nFrom Row 1: x + (7/5)z = 19/5 => x = (19/5) - (7/5)z\n\nNow, we can express the solution in terms of z:\n\nx = (19/5) - (7/5)z\ny = (2/5) + (3/5)z\nz = z\n\nLet z = t, where t is any real number. Then the solution is:\n\nx = (19/5) - (7/5)t\ny = (2/5) + (3/5)t\nz = t\n\nThis is the general solution to the given system of linear equations."
