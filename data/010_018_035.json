    "message_1": "Consider a Morse-Smale complex on a closed, orientable 2-manifold with 8 critical points. The index of each critical point is as follows: 2 maximums, 3 index-1 saddles, and 3 index-0 minima. What is the Euler characteristic of this Morse-Smale complex?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a Morse-Smale complex can be computed using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index. In this case, we have:\n\nχ = (# of index-0 minima) - (# of index-1 saddles) + (# of index-2 maximums)\n\nχ = 3 - 3 + 2\n\nχ = 2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this Morse-Smale complex is 2."
