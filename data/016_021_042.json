    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is created by iteratively replacing a line segment with a sequence of smaller segments. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 3/2. To find the length of the curve after the seventh stage of iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (3/2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 3 units, and we want to find the length after the seventh iteration (n = 7).\n\nLength = 3 * (3/2)^7\nLength ≈ 3 * 21.87\nLength ≈ 65.61 units\n\nSo, the length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the seventh stage of iteration is approximately 65.61 units."
