    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2^(3x+1) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base.\nSince 16 can be written as 2^4, we can rewrite the equation as:\n2^(3x+1) = 2^4\n\nStep 2: Set the exponents equal to each other.\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n3x + 1 = 4\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n3x = 3\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1."
