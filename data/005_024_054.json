    "message_1": "Suppose we have a dataset containing the ages of 20 students in a classroom. The ages range from 18 to 24 years old. What is the average age of the students in the classroom?",
    "message_2": "To find the average age of the students in the classroom, we need to know the sum of all the ages and then divide that sum by the total number of students (20 in this case). However, we don't have the individual ages of the students, so we cannot calculate the average age with the given information. Please provide the ages of all 20 students."
