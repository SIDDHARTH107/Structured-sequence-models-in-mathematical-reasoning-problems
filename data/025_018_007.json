    "message_2": "To compute the Mori cone of the toric variety, we first need to find the fan corresponding to the toric variety. The fan is determined by the weights of the torus action, which are given as $(1,2,3,4)$. We can write these weights as columns of a matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the dual lattice $N$ of the lattice generated by the columns of this matrix. The dual lattice is generated by the rows of the matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe fan corresponding to the toric variety is the normal fan of the polytope generated by the columns of the matrix. In this case, the polytope is a 1-dimensional simplex with vertices at $(1,0,0,0)$, $(2,0,0,0)$, $(3,0,0,0)$, and $(4,0,0,0)$. The normal fan has rays generated by the rows of the matrix, which are the primitive vectors in the dual lattice $N$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Mori cone of the toric variety. The Mori cone is the cone generated by the rays of the fan that correspond to the effective curve classes. In this case, the rays are generated by the rows of the matrix, which are the primitive vectors in the dual lattice $N$. Since all the rays are in the same quadrant, the Mori cone is generated by all the rays:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mori cone} = \\langle (1,0,0,0), (2,0,0,0), (3,0,0,0), (4,0,0,0) \\rangle\n$$\n\nSo, the Mori cone of the toric variety is the cone generated by the vectors $(1,0,0,0)$, $(2,0,0,0)$, $(3,0,0,0)$, and $(4,0,0,0)$."
