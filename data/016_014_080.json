    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the self-similarity ratio.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and the self-similarity ratio is s = 1/3.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD ≈ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve with a self-similarity ratio of 1/3 is approximately 1.2619."
