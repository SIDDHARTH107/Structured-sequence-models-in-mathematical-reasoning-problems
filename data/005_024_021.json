    "message_2": "To find the mean of the dataset, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values:\n\nMean = (10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50) / 9\nMean = 270 / 9\nMean = 30\n\nTo find the median, we first make sure the dataset is in ascending order (which it is), and then find the middle value. Since there are 9 values, the median is the 5th value:\n\nMedian = 30\n\nSo, the mean and median of the dataset are both 30."
