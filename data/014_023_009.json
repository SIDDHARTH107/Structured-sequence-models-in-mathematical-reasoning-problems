    "message_1": "In a Rail fence cipher, a message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted by having 3 rails. What would be the encrypted message using this cipher?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using a Rail Fence cipher with 3 rails, we write the message in a zigzag pattern along the rails and then read the message along each rail. The pattern looks like this:\n\nM   E   I\n A H A T A\n  T   M   C   S\n\nNow, read the message along each rail: \"MEI\", \"AHATA\", \"TMCS\". Combine these parts to get the encrypted message:\n\nMEIAHATATMCS"
