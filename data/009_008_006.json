    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example problem:\n\nA wave is traveling along a rope with a speed of 3 m/s. The wave can be modeled by the equation y(x,t) = 0.2 sin(π/2 x - πt/4), where y is the displacement of the rope at a point x and time t. What is the wavelength of the wave?",
    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the wave, we need to look at the spatial part of the wave equation, which is the part inside the sine function that depends on x. In this case, it is (π/2) * x. \n\nThe general form of a wave equation is y(x, t) = A * sin(k * x - ω * t), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency. The wave number k is related to the wavelength λ by the formula:\n\nk = 2π / λ\n\nIn our given wave equation, we can see that k = π/2. Now we can solve for the wavelength λ:\n\n(π/2) = 2π / λ\n\nTo solve for λ, we can multiply both sides by λ and divide both sides by (π/2):\n\nλ * (π/2) = 2π\n\nNow, divide both sides by (π/2):\n\nλ = 2π / (π/2)\n\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\nλ = 2π * (2/π)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nλ = 2 * 2 = 4 meters\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is 4 meters."
