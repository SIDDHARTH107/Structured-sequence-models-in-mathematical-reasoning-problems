    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nFor a sphere with a radius of 5 cm:\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (5³)\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (125)\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125\nV = 523.59833 cm³\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the sphere is 523.60 cm³."
