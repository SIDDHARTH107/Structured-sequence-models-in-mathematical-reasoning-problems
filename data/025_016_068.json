    "message_2": "(a) To show that there exists a birational map $\\phi : C_1 \\rightarrow C_2$, we need to find a rational function that maps points on $C_1$ to points on $C_2$. Let's consider the following map:\n\n$$\\phi(x, y) = \\left(x, \\frac{4}{x}\\right)$$\n\nWe need to check that this map sends points on $C_1$ to points on $C_2$. If $(x, y) \\in C_1$, then $y = 2x^2 - x^3$. Applying $\\phi$ to this point, we get:\n\n$$\\phi(x, y) = \\left(x, \\frac{4}{x}\\right) = \\left(x, \\frac{4}{x}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to check that this point lies on $C_2$. Plugging the coordinates into the equation for $C_2$, we get:\n\n$$x\\left(\\frac{4}{x}\\right) = 4$$\n\nSimplifying, we see that this equation holds, so $\\phi(x, y)$ does indeed map points on $C_1$ to points on $C_2$. Thus, there exists a birational map $\\phi : C_1 \\rightarrow C_2$.\n\n(b) To find the inverse of this birational map, we need to find a map $\\psi : C_2 \\rightarrow C_1$ such that $\\psi(\\phi(x, y)) = (x, y)$ for all points $(x, y) \\in C_1$. Let's consider the following map:\n\n$$\\psi(u, v) = \\left(u, 2u^2 - u^3\\right)$$\n\nWe need to check that this map sends points on $C_2$ to points on $C_1$. If $(u, v) \\in C_2$, then $uv = 4$. Applying $\\psi$ to this point, we get:\n\n$$\\psi(u, v) = \\left(u, 2u^2 - u^3\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to check that this point lies on $C_1$. Plugging the coordinates into the equation for $C_1$, we get:\n\n$$2u^2 - u^3 = 2u^2 - u^3$$\n\nThis equation holds, so $\\psi(u, v)$ does indeed map points on $C_2$ to points on $C_1$. Thus, the inverse of the birational map $\\phi$ is given by $\\psi$.\n\n(c) To compute the intersection multiplicities of $C_1$ and $C_2$ at the point $(2, 2)$, we need to find the multiplicity of the common tangent lines at this point. Let's compute the partial derivatives of the equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_1}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + 4x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_1}{\\partial y} = 1$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_2}{\\partial x} = y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_2}{\\partial y} = x$$\n\nNow, let's evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $(2, 2)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_1}{\\partial x}(2, 2) = -12 + 8 = -4$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_1}{\\partial y}(2, 2) = 1$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_2}{\\partial x}(2, 2) = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_2}{\\partial y}(2, 2) = 2$$\n\nSince the tangent lines of $C_1$ and $C_2$ at $(2, 2)$ are not parallel, the intersection multiplicity at this point is 1."
