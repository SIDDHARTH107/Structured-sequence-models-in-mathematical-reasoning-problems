    "message_1": "Suppose Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice using ElGamal encryption with a public key (p=23, α=5, β=19) where p is a prime number and α is a primitive root modulo p. If Bob's message is m = 11, and he chooses k = 3, calculate the ciphertext (c1, c2) and ask the math student to find a way to decrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the ciphertext (c1, c2) using ElGamal encryption, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute c1 = α^k mod p\n2. Compute c2 = m * β^k mod p\n\nGiven the public key (p=23, α=5, β=19), the message m = 11, and k = 3, we can calculate the ciphertext as follows:\n\n1. c1 = 5^3 mod 23 = 125 mod 23 = 3\n2. c2 = 11 * 19^3 mod 23 = 11 * 6859 mod 23 = 11 * 7 mod 23 = 77 mod 23 = 8\n\nSo the ciphertext (c1, c2) is (3, 8).\n\nNow, we ask the math student to find a way to decrypt the message. To decrypt the message using ElGamal decryption, Alice needs to know her private key a, which satisfies the equation β = α^a mod p. In this case, we have:\n\n19 = 5^a mod 23\n\nBy trying different values of a, we find that a = 10 satisfies the equation:\n\n5^10 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow, Alice can decrypt the message using the following steps:\n\n1. Compute s = c1^a mod p\n2. Compute m = c2 * s^(-1) mod p\n\nUsing the ciphertext (c1, c2) = (3, 8) and the private key a = 10, we can decrypt the message as follows:\n\n1. s = 3^10 mod 23 = 59049 mod 23 = 18\n2. To find the modular inverse of s, we need to find a value x such that (s * x) mod p = 1. In this case, we need to find x such that (18 * x) mod 23 = 1. By trying different values of x, we find that x = 13 satisfies the equation: (18 * 13) mod 23 = 1.\n3. m = 8 * 13 mod 23 = 104 mod 23 = 11\n\nSo the decrypted message is m = 11, which is the original message Bob sent to Alice."
