Using sheaf cohomology, determine the number of linearly independent global sections of L, denoted by h⁰(X, L). \n\nIn particular, let X be the elliptic curve y² = x³ +ax+b and L a line bundle of degree 1 on X. Calculate h⁰(X, L).",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of linearly independent global sections of L, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a smooth curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h¹(X, L) = d - g + 1\n\nwhere h⁰(X, L) is the number of linearly independent global sections of L, h¹(X, L) is the dimension of the first cohomology group of L, d is the degree of L, and g is the genus of X.\n\nIn our case, X is an elliptic curve, so its genus is g = 1. The line bundle L has degree d = 1. To compute h¹(X, L), we can use Serre duality, which states that:\n\nh¹(X, L) = h⁰(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle of X. For an elliptic curve, the canonical bundle is trivial, i.e., K_X = O_X, the structure sheaf of X. Since L has degree 1, its inverse L^(-1) has degree -1. Therefore, we have:\n\nh¹(X, L) = h⁰(X, O_X ⊗ L^(-1)) = h⁰(X, L^(-1))\n\nSince L^(-1) has degree -1, it has no non-zero global sections, so h⁰(X, L^(-1)) = 0. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h¹(X, L) = d - g + 1\nh⁰(X, L) - 0 = 1 - 1 + 1\nh⁰(X, L) = 1\n\nThus, there is one linearly independent global section of L on the elliptic curve X."
