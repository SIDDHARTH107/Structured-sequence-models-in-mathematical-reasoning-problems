    "message_1": "A group of 6 people wants to form a circular dance circle. In how many distinct ways can they arrange themselves if rotations are considered indistinguishable? (Hint: use Catalan numbers)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The number of distinct ways to arrange n people in a circular dance circle, with rotations considered indistinguishable, can be calculated using the (n-1)th Catalan number. The formula for the nth Catalan number is:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nIn this case, we have 6 people, so we want to find the (6-1)th or 5th Catalan number:\n\nC_5 = (1/(5+1)) * (2*5 choose 5)\nC_5 = (1/6) * (10 choose 5)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of combinations of choosing 5 elements from a set of 10 elements:\n\n(10 choose 5) = 10! / (5! * (10-5)!)\n(10 choose 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!)\n(10 choose 5) = 252\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the formula for the 5th Catalan number:\n\nC_5 = (1/6) * 252\nC_5 = 42\n\nSo, there are 42 distinct ways to arrange the 6 people in a circular dance circle with rotations considered indistinguishable."
