    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 from x = 0 to x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 4.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 1) dx = (1/3)x^3 + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 4:\n\n[(1/3)(4)^3 + (4)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (0)]\n= [(1/3)(64) + 4] - [0]\n= [64/3 + 4]\n= [64/3 + 12/3]\n= [76/3]\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 1 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 76/3 square units."
