    "message_2": "The equation sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 is an identity, which means it is true for all values of x. This identity is known as the Pythagorean identity in trigonometry. Since it holds true for all x, there is no specific solution for x in the given range of 0 to 2π radians. Instead, x can be any real number between 0 and 2π radians, and the equation will still be true."
