    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of companies with financial fraud (6), and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of companies reviewed (1000).\n\nProbability = 6 / 1000\n\nTo express the probability as a percentage, we can multiply the result by 100.\n\nProbability = (6 / 1000) * 100 = 0.6%\n\nSo, the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.6%."
