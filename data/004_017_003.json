    "message_1": "A curve is given by the equation y = x^(3/2) between x = 1 and x = 9. Find the arc length of the curve between these two endpoints.",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx):\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find (dy/dx)^2:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2 = (9/4)x\n\nNext, we'll find 1 + (dy/dx)^2:\n\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4)x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 9] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4)x\ndu/dx = 9/4\ndx = (4/9)du\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[u(1), u(9)] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nWe also need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nu(1) = 1 + (9/4)(1) = 1 + 9/4 = 13/4\nu(9) = 1 + (9/4)(9) = 1 + 81/4 = 82/4 = 41/2\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nL = (4/9) ∫[13/4, 41/2] u^(1/2) du\n\nTo integrate u^(1/2), we can use the power rule:\n\n∫u^(1/2) du = (2/3)u^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the expression for L:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * [u(41/2)^(3/2) - u(13/4)^(3/2)]\n\nL = (8/27) * [(41/2)^(3/2) - (13/4)^(3/2)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value:\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * [29.66479 - 5.61248]\nL ≈ (8/27) * 24.05231\nL ≈ 7.13477\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve between x = 1 and x = 9 is approximately 7.13477 units."
