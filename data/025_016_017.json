    "message_2": "To show that X and Y are birationally equivalent, we need to find a rational map from X to Y and its inverse map from Y to X.\n\nLet's first find a rational map from X to Y. Consider the map φ: X → Y defined by φ(x, y, z) = (x, y, x + y). Note that this map is well-defined since if (x, y, z) is a point on X, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, and thus (x, y, x + y) is a point on Y because x + y - (x + y) = 0.\n\nNow let's find the inverse map of φ. We want to find a map ψ: Y → X such that ψ(φ(x, y, z)) = (x, y, z) for any point (x, y, z) on X.\n\nConsider the map ψ: Y → X defined by ψ(x, y, z) = (x, y, sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)). Note that this map is well-defined since if (x, y, z) is a point on Y, then x + y = z, and thus x^2 + y^2 = z^2 - 2xy. Since z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy, we have 1 - x^2 - y^2 = z^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 2xy, and thus sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2) is well-defined and non-negative.\n\nNow let's check that ψ is the inverse map of φ. For any point (x, y, z) on X, we have:\n\nψ(φ(x, y, z)) = ψ(x, y, x + y) = (x, y, sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)).\n\nSince x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, we have z^2 = 1 - x^2 - y^2, and thus z = sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2). Therefore, ψ(φ(x, y, z)) = (x, y, z), as desired.\n\nHence, we have found a rational map φ: X → Y and its inverse map ψ: Y → X, which shows that X and Y are birationally equivalent."
