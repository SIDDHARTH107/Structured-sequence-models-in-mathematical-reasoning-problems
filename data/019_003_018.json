    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem from Modal logic for a math student to solve:\n\nLet S be a set of all possible worlds in a model M. Let p and q be two propositions such that p is true in all worlds of S and q is true in some but not all worlds of S. What is the truth value of the formula □p → ◇q in M?",
    "message_2": "In modal logic, □ (box) represents necessity and ◇ (diamond) represents possibility. The formula □p → ◇q can be read as \"if p is necessarily true, then q is possibly true.\"\n\nGiven that p is true in all worlds of S, it means that p is necessarily true. So, □p is true.\n\nSince q is true in some but not all worlds of S, it means that q is possibly true. So, ◇q is true.\n\nNow, we have the formula □p → ◇q, where both □p and ◇q are true. In classical logic, a conditional (→) is true if the antecedent (in this case, □p) is false or the consequent (in this case, ◇q) is true. Since both □p and ◇q are true, the entire formula □p → ◇q is true in model M."
