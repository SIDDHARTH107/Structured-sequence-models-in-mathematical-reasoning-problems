    "message_2": "First, let's list the elements of G. Since G is generated by 8 with addition modulo 16, the elements of G are {0, 8}. We can see that G is cyclic because it is generated by a single element, 8.\n\nNow, let's find all the subgroups of G. We know that the trivial group {0} is always a subgroup, so we have one subgroup already. The other subgroup is G itself, which is {0, 8}. \n\nNow, let's show that each subgroup is cyclic:\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {0} is cyclic because it can be generated by the single element 0.\n\n2. The subgroup {0, 8} is cyclic because it can be generated by the single element 8.\n\nThus, we have found all the subgroups of G, which are {0} and {0, 8}, and we have shown that each subgroup is cyclic."
