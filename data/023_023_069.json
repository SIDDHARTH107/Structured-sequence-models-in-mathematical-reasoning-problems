    "message_1": "Suppose you have a network with a transfer function H(ω) = 5cos(2ω) + 3sin(4ω).  Using the Fourier transform, determine the amplitude and phase angle of the input signal that will result in a maximum output amplitude of 10.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase angle of the input signal that will result in a maximum output amplitude of 10, we first need to find the magnitude of the transfer function H(ω).\n\nThe magnitude of H(ω) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|H(ω)| = √((5cos(2ω))^2 + (3sin(4ω))^2)\n|H(ω)| = √(25cos^2(2ω) + 9sin^2(4ω))\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |H(ω)|. To do this, we can differentiate |H(ω)| with respect to ω and set the result to zero:\n\nd|H(ω)|/dω = 0\n\nHowever, finding the derivative of the square root function can be quite complicated. Instead, we can find the maximum value of the function inside the square root, which will also give us the maximum value of |H(ω)|:\n\nd(25cos^2(2ω) + 9sin^2(4ω))/dω = 0\n\nNow, we can find the derivative:\n\nd(25cos^2(2ω))/dω = -100cos(2ω)sin(2ω)\nd(9sin^2(4ω))/dω = 72sin(4ω)cos(4ω)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function inside the square root is:\n\n-100cos(2ω)sin(2ω) + 72sin(4ω)cos(4ω) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of ω that satisfies this equation. This can be done using numerical methods or by observation. In this case, we can observe that when ω = π/4, the equation is satisfied:\n\n-100cos(π/2)sin(π/2) + 72sin(π)cos(π) = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of ω that maximizes |H(ω)|, we can find the maximum value of |H(ω)|:\n\n|H(π/4)| = √(25cos^2(π/2) + 9sin^2(2π))\n|H(π/4)| = √(25(0)^2 + 9(1)^2)\n|H(π/4)| = √9\n|H(π/4)| = 3\n\nNow, we want the output amplitude to be 10. Since the output amplitude is the product of the input amplitude and the transfer function magnitude, we can find the input amplitude A:\n\nA * |H(π/4)| = 10\nA * 3 = 10\nA = 10/3\n\nSo, the input amplitude is 10/3.\n\nNow, we need to find the phase angle of the input signal. Since the transfer function is a linear combination of cosines and sines, the phase angle will be the same as the phase angle of the transfer function at ω = π/4:\n\nH(π/4) = 5cos(π/2) + 3sin(π)\nH(π/4) = 5(0) + 3(0)\nH(π/4) = 0\n\nSince H(π/4) = 0, the phase angle of the input signal is the same as the phase angle of the transfer function, which is 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the amplitude and phase angle of the input signal that will result in a maximum output amplitude of 10 are 10/3 and 0, respectively."
