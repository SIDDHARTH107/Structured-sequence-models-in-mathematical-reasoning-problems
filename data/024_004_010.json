    "message_1": "A student is given a surface equation: f(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy. The task for the student is to find the mean curvature of this surface at the point (1,1).",
    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1), we first need to compute the first and second partial derivatives of the function f(x,y).\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\nfx = ∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\nfy = ∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\nfxx = ∂²f/∂x² = 6x\nfyy = ∂²f/∂y² = 6y\nfxy = ∂²f/∂x∂y = -3\n\nNow, we need to find the unit normal vector N at the point (1,1). To do this, we compute the gradient of f at (1,1):\n∇f(1,1) = (fx(1,1), fy(1,1), -1) = (0, 0, -1)\n\nSince the gradient is already a unit vector, we have N = (0, 0, -1).\n\nNext, we compute the shape operator S at (1,1) using the second partial derivatives:\nS = (fxx(1,1), fxy(1,1))\n       (fxy(1,1), fyy(1,1))\nS = (6, -3)\n       (-3, 6)\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of the shape operator, which represent the principal curvatures k1 and k2. The characteristic equation of S is:\n|S - λI| = (6 - λ)(6 - λ) - (-3)(-3) = λ^2 - 12λ + 27\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\nλ1 = 3, λ2 = 9\n\nThe mean curvature H is the average of the principal curvatures:\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2 = (3 + 9) / 2 = 6\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1) is 6."
