    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 20 elements and U be the universal set with 30 elements. Find the number of elements in the union of A and its complement.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of A. Since A is a subset of U, A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A has 20 elements and U has 30 elements, A' must have 30 - 20 = 10 elements.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of elements in the union of A and A'. Since A and A' are disjoint sets (meaning they have no elements in common), the number of elements in their union is simply the sum of the number of elements in each set.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the union of A and A' is 20 + 10 = 30 elements."
