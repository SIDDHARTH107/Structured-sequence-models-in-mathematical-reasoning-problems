    "message_2": "To determine the number of irreducible components of the moduli space of smooth plane curves of degree 4 passing through 6 distinct points in general position, we can use the following approach.\n\nA smooth plane curve of degree 4 can be represented by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in three variables, say F(x, y, z) = 0. The space of all such polynomials has dimension 15 (since there are 15 monomials of degree 4 in three variables). \n\nNow, we have 6 distinct points in general position, say P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6. For each point Pi, we have the condition F(Pi) = 0. This gives us a system of 6 linear equations in the coefficients of F. Since the points are in general position, these equations are independent, and their solution space has dimension 15 - 6 = 9.\n\nHowever, we are interested in the moduli space, which means we need to factor out the action of the projective group PGL(3). The group PGL(3) has dimension 8 (since it is the quotient of the 9-dimensional group GL(3) by the 1-dimensional group of scalar matrices). \n\nTherefore, the moduli space of smooth plane curves of degree 4 passing through 6 distinct points in general position has dimension 9 - 8 = 1. Since the moduli space is 1-dimensional, it has only one irreducible component."
