    "message_1": "A math student is studying mirror symmetry and its applications in algebraic geometry. Here's a numerical problem for them to solve:\n\nA Calabi-Yau threefold has a Hodge number h11 = 1 and h21 = 101. Using mirror symmetry, determine the corresponding Hodge numbers for its mirror Calabi-Yau threefold.",
    "message_2": "In mirror symmetry, the Hodge numbers of a Calabi-Yau threefold and its mirror are related by swapping h11 and h21. So, for the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold, the Hodge numbers will be:\n\nh11' = h21 = 101\nh21' = h11 = 1\n\nThus, the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold has Hodge numbers h11' = 101 and h21' = 1."
