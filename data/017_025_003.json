Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using the formula n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where n_p is the number of groups of order p^k, p is the prime factor, and k is the highest power of the prime factor.\n\nFor p = 2, k = 3: n_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 15\nFor p = 3, k = 1: n_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = 4\nFor p = 5, k = 1: n_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1) / (5 - 1) = 6\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of order n = n_p1 * n_p2 * n_p3, where n_p1, n_p2, and n_p3 are the number of groups of order p1^k1, p2^k2, and p3^k3, respectively.\n\nNumber of groups of order 120 = 15 * 4 * 6 = 360\n\nHowever, this number includes isomorphic groups. To find the number of non-isomorphic groups, we can use the following theorem:\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic groups of order p1^k1 * p2^k2 * p3^k3 is equal to the product of the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p1^k1, p2^k2, and p3^k3.\n\nFor p = 2, k = 3: There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 2^3 (including the cyclic group and the quaternion group).\nFor p = 3, k = 1: There is 1 non-isomorphic group of order 3 (the cyclic group).\nFor p = 5, k = 1: There is 1 non-isomorphic group of order 5 (the cyclic group).\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 = 5 * 1 * 1 = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
