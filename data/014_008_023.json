    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a plaintext message \"HELLO\" that you want to encrypt using a block cipher. The key used for encryption is a 64-bit key. If the block cipher you are using breaks the plaintext message into 32-bit blocks, how many rounds of encryption will be needed to encrypt the entire message?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of rounds needed to encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a block cipher with 32-bit blocks, we first need to find out how many 32-bit blocks are required to represent the message.\n\nEach character in the message can be represented using 8 bits (1 byte) in ASCII encoding. The message \"HELLO\" has 5 characters, so it requires 5 * 8 = 40 bits to represent the entire message.\n\nSince the block cipher breaks the plaintext message into 32-bit blocks, we can fit the 40-bit message into two 32-bit blocks (32 bits for the first block and the remaining 8 bits in the second block, with 24 bits unused).\n\nTherefore, 2 rounds of encryption will be needed to encrypt the entire message \"HELLO\" using a block cipher with 32-bit blocks and a 64-bit key."
