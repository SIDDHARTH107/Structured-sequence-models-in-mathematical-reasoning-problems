    "message_2": "To solve the Knapsack problem, we need to find the combination of items that gives the maximum value while not exceeding the weight capacity of 7 kg. We can do this by checking all possible combinations of items:\n\n1. A + B: 2 kg + 3 kg = 5 kg, Value $60 + $50 = $110\n2. A + C: 2 kg + 4 kg = 6 kg, Value $60 + $70 = $130\n3. A + D: 2 kg + 1 kg = 3 kg, Value $60 + $30 = $90\n4. B + C: 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg, Value $50 + $70 = $120\n5. B + D: 3 kg + 1 kg = 4 kg, Value $50 + $30 = $80\n6. C + D: 4 kg + 1 kg = 5 kg, Value $70 + $30 = $100\n7. A + B + D: 2 kg + 3 kg + 1 kg = 6 kg, Value $60 + $50 + $30 = $140\n\nThe combination of items A, B, and D gives the maximum value of $140 while not exceeding the weight capacity of 7 kg. Therefore, the maximum value the student can carry in their knapsack is $140."
