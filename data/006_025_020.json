    "message_1": "In a music concert, the probability of the lead singer hitting a high note is 0.6, and the probability of the pianist playing a perfect note is 0.8. What is the probability that both the lead singer hits a high note and the pianist plays a perfect note in the next performance?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events happening, we can multiply the individual probabilities together. \n\nProbability of lead singer hitting a high note = 0.6\nProbability of pianist playing a perfect note = 0.8\n\nProbability of both events happening = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that both the lead singer hits a high note and the pianist plays a perfect note in the next performance is 0.48 or 48%."
