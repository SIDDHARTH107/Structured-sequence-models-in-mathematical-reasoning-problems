    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C. This is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) ∈ (A × B) and c ∈ C.\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B × C. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b ∈ B and c ∈ C.\n\nB × C = {(4, 6), (5, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × C). This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, (b, c)) where a ∈ A and (b, c) ∈ (B × C).\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B) × C and A × (B × C). We can see that the elements in both sets are not the same. However, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sets by associating each element ((a, b), c) in (A × B) × C with the element (a, (b, c)) in A × (B × C).\n\nFor example, ((1, 4), 6) in (A × B) × C corresponds to (1, (4, 6)) in A × (B × C).\n\nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sets, we can say that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative up to a one-to-one correspondence. However, it is important to note that the elements themselves are not identical, so the Cartesian product is not strictly associative."
