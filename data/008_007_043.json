    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P such that A = PDP^(-1), we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[3 4]\n[2 1]\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.\n\n(3 - λ)(1 - λ) - (4)(2) = 0\nλ^2 - 4λ - 5 = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -1.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n(A - 5I)v1 = 0\n[-2  4] [x1]   [0]\n[ 2 -4] [x2] = [0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get -2x1 + 4x2 = 0. Solving for x1, we have x1 = 2x2. Let x2 = 1, then x1 = 2. So, the eigenvector v1 is [2; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n(A + 1I)v2 = 0\n[ 4  4] [x1]   [0]\n[ 2  2] [x2] = [0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get 4x1 + 4x2 = 0. Solving for x1, we have x1 = -x2. Let x2 = 1, then x1 = -1. So, the eigenvector v2 is [-1; 1].\n\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as the diagonal entries.\n\nMatrix P:\n[ 2 -1]\n[ 1  1]\n\nMatrix D:\n[ 5  0]\n[ 0 -1]\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of matrix P, P^(-1).\n\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * [d -b; -c a], where a, b, c, and d are the elements of the matrix P.\n\ndet(P) = (2)(1) - (-1)(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nP^(-1) = (1/3) * [ 1  1; -1  2]\n\nP^(-1) = [ 1/3  1/3]\n          [-1/3  2/3]\n\nNow, let's verify that A = PDP^(-1).\n\nPDP^(-1) = [ 2 -1] [ 5  0] [ 1/3  1/3]\n           [ 1  1] [ 0 -1] [-1/3  2/3]\n\n         = [ 2 -1] [ 5/3  1/3]\n           [ 1  1] [-1/3 -2/3]\n\n         = [ 3  4]\n           [ 2  1]\n\nIndeed, A = PDP^(-1). So, the diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P are:\n\nD = [ 5  0]\n    [ 0 -1]\n\nP = [ 2 -1]\n    [ 1  1]\n\nP^(-1) = [ 1/3  1/3]\n         [-1/3  2/3]"
