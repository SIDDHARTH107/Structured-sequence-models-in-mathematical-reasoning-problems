    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | 19 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 5) - (3 * 4) = 10 - 12 = -2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix of A. The cofactor matrix of A is obtained by replacing each element with its corresponding minor with the appropriate sign.\n\nCofactor matrix of A:\n\nC = |  5  -3 |\n    | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we find the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix:\n\nadj(A) = |  5  -4 |\n         | -3   2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * |  5  -4 |\n                 | -3   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -5/2  2  |\n         |  3/2 -1  |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -5/2  2  | * | 11 |\n    |  3/2 -1  |   | 19 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices:\n\nx = (-5/2 * 11) + (2 * 19) = -55/2 + 38 = 21/2\ny = (3/2 * 11) - (1 * 19) = 33/2 - 19 = 1/2\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 21/2 and y = 1/2."
