    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all its sides.\n\nPerimeter = length of first parallel side + length of second parallel side + length of first non-parallel side + length of second non-parallel side\n\nPerimeter = 10 cm + 16 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm\n\nPerimeter = 42 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 42 cm."
