    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept an encrypted message using the Caesar cipher. After performing frequency analysis on the message, you find that the most frequent character is 'T' and the second most frequent character is 'R'. Determine the key used to encrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "In the English language, the most frequent character is usually 'E', and the second most frequent character is 'T'. Since the most frequent character in the encrypted message is 'T' and the second most frequent character is 'R', we can assume that 'E' was encrypted to 'T' and 'T' was encrypted to 'R'.\n\nTo find the key, we need to determine the shift between the original characters and the encrypted characters. \n\nFor 'E' to 'T':\nE (5th letter) -> T (20th letter)\nShift: 20 - 5 = 15\n\nFor 'T' to 'R':\nT (20th letter) -> R (18th letter)\nShift: 18 - 20 = -2 (or 24 in a positive modulo 26 representation)\n\nSince the shift is consistent for both the most frequent and second most frequent characters, we can conclude that the key used to encrypt the message is 15 (or -11, which is equivalent in modulo 26 representation)."
