    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the linear system $|D|$ of degree 3 divisors on $C$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g(C)$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g(C)$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the linear system $|D|$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, we have a genus 2 curve $C$ and a divisor $D$ of degree 3. Thus, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = 3 + 1 - 2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the canonical divisor $K_C$. For a curve of genus $g(C) = 2$, the canonical divisor has degree $2g(C) - 2 = 2(2) - 2 = 2$. Since the degree of $D$ is 3, the degree of $K_C - D$ is $2 - 3 = -1$. \n\nSince the degree of $K_C - D$ is negative, we have $l(K_C - D) = 0$. Therefore, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to:\n\n$l(D) = 3 + 1 - 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, the dimension of the linear system $|D|$ of degree 3 divisors on the genus 2 curve $C$ is 2."
