    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + μ * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = μ * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = a - (b / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2)).\n\nThe bifurcation parameter in the Ikeda map is μ, and we are given the value of the control parameter a = 0.85. To find the value of μ at which the Ikeda map undergoes its first period-doubling transition, we need to analyze the stability of the fixed points of the system.\n\nThe fixed points of the Ikeda map can be found by setting x_{n+1} = x_n and y_{n+1} = y_n. However, finding the exact value of μ for the first period-doubling transition is not straightforward and typically requires numerical methods, such as the bifurcation diagram or the Lyapunov exponent.\n\nA bifurcation diagram for the Ikeda map can be constructed by iterating the map for a range of μ values and plotting the stable points. From the bifurcation diagram, we can approximately determine the value of μ at which the first period-doubling transition occurs. Alternatively, we can compute the Lyapunov exponent for a range of μ values and find the value of μ at which the exponent becomes positive, indicating the onset of chaos and period-doubling.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform these numerical computations directly. However, you can use software like MATLAB or Python to perform these calculations and find the approximate value of μ for the first period-doubling transition when a = 0.85."
