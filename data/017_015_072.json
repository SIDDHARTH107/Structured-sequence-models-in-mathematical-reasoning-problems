    "message_2": "There are 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 24. Their structures are as follows:\n\n1. Z_24: Cyclic group of order 24.\n2. Z_12 × Z_2: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 12 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. Z_8 × Z_3: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n4. Z_6 × Z_4: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n5. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and two cyclic groups of order 2.\n6. Z_3 × S_3: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the symmetric group of degree 3.\n7. S_4: Symmetric group of degree 4.\n8. A_4: Alternating group of degree 4.\n9. D_12: Dihedral group of order 12.\n10. D_8 × Z_3: Direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n11. Q_8 × Z_3: Direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n12. Z_6 × D_4: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 6 and the dihedral group of order 4.\n13. Z_3 × Q_8: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the quaternion group of order 8.\n14. Z_3 × (Z_4 × Z_2): Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n15. SL(2,3): Special linear group of degree 2 over the field with 3 elements.\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and considering the possible structures of groups with order 24."
