    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 5) - log(x - 2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b) to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation:\n\nlog((x + 5)/(x - 2)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b:\n\n(x + 5)/(x - 2) = 10^2\n\n(x + 5)/(x - 2) = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 5 = 100(x - 2)\n\nx + 5 = 100x - 200\n\nNow, we can move all the terms with x to one side of the equation:\n\n-99x = -205\n\nNow, we can divide by -99 to solve for x:\n\nx = 205/99\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = 205/99"
