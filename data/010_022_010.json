    "message_1": "A rubber ball has a diameter of 8 cm. What is the surface area of the ball?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere (which is the shape of the rubber ball), we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. Since the diameter of the ball is 8 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 4 cm.\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (4 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 16 cm^2\nSurface area = 64π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the rubber ball is approximately 64π cm^2 or 201.06 cm^2 (rounded to two decimal places)."
