    "message_1": "A certain manufacturing process produces a certain type of defect in 3% of all products. If a sample of 200 products is taken, what is the probability that exactly 7 products will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes (defective products in this case) in n trials (sample size)\n- n is the number of trials (sample size)\n- x is the number of successes (defective products)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of success (defect rate)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (non-defect rate)\n\nIn this problem:\n- n = 200 (sample size)\n- x = 7 (number of defective products)\n- p = 0.03 (defect rate)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(7) = C(200, 7) * (0.03^7) * (0.97^193)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(200, 7), which is the number of combinations of 200 items taken 7 at a time:\n\nC(200, 7) = 200! / (7! * (200-7)!)\nC(200, 7) = 200! / (7! * 193!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nC(200, 7) ≈ 3,315,315,200\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(7) ≈ 3,315,315,200 * (0.03^7) * (0.97^193)\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(7) ≈ 0.218\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 7 products will have this type of defect in a sample of 200 products is approximately 0.218 or 21.8%."
