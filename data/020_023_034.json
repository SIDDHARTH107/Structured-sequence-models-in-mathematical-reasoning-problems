    "message_1": "A math student needs to solve the following numerical problem related to Optimal portfolio selection:\n\n\"A portfolio manager has invested in three stocks with the following characteristics: stock A has an expected return of 9% and a standard deviation of 12%, stock B has an expected return of 11% and a standard deviation of 8%, and stock C has an expected return of 15% and a standard deviation of 20%. The manager wants to allocate a total of $100,000 to these stocks to maximize the portfolio's return while keeping the portfolio's overall risk (measured by the portfolio's standard deviation) at or below 14%. What is the optimal allocation of funds to each stock to achieve this goal?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal allocation of funds to each stock (A, B, and C) that maximizes the portfolio's expected return while keeping the portfolio's overall risk (standard deviation) at or below 14%. Let's denote the allocation of funds to each stock as x, y, and z for stocks A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z = $100,000 (total investment)\n2. The portfolio's standard deviation must be at or below 14%.\n\nThe portfolio's expected return can be calculated as:\n\nExpected Return = (9%x) + (11%y) + (15%z)\n\nThe portfolio's risk (standard deviation) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPortfolio Standard Deviation = √(x^2 * σA^2 + y^2 * σB^2 + z^2 * σC^2 + 2xy * Cov(A, B) + 2xz * Cov(A, C) + 2yz * Cov(B, C))\n\nHowever, we don't have the covariance values between the stocks. In this case, we can't find the exact optimal allocation. But we can still make some observations and suggestions.\n\nSince stock C has the highest expected return (15%) and the highest risk (20% standard deviation), the portfolio manager should allocate more funds to stock C to maximize the return, but not too much to keep the overall risk below 14%.\n\nStock B has a lower risk (8% standard deviation) and a slightly higher return (11%) than stock A (9% return and 12% standard deviation). Therefore, it would be reasonable to allocate more funds to stock B than stock A.\n\nWithout the covariance values, we can't provide an exact optimal allocation. However, the portfolio manager should consider allocating more funds to stock C and stock B than stock A, while keeping the overall risk below 14%. The manager can use optimization techniques, such as the Markowitz portfolio optimization model, to find the exact allocation once the covariance values are available."
