    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) - 4X''(x)T(t) = 0$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n$$4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$T''(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n$$X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} X(x) = 0$$\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\n$$X(0) = X(1) = 0$$\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem. The eigenfunctions are:\n\n$$X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nwith eigenvalues:\n\n$$\\lambda_n = 2n\\pi$$\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding time-dependent functions:\n\n$$T_n''(t) + (2n\\pi)^2 T_n(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = A_n\\cos(2n\\pi t) + B_n\\sin(2n\\pi t)$$\n\nUsing the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we get $B_n = 0$. So,\n\n$$T_n(t) = A_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$$\n\nNow, using the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we can find the coefficients $A_n$:\n\n$$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nComparing the terms, we find that $A_1 = 1$ and $A_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the first time $t > 0$ at which $u(x,t)$ attains the value $\\frac{1}{2}$. Set $u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$$\n\nSince $0 < x < 1$ and $t > 0$, we can find the minimum positive $t$ that satisfies the equation:\n\n$$\\cos(2\\pi t) = \\frac{1}{2\\sin(\\pi x)}$$\n\nThe smallest positive value of $t$ occurs when $\\cos(2\\pi t) = 1$, which gives $t = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the first time $t > 0$ at which $u(x,t)$ attains the value $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $t = \\frac{1}{2}$."
