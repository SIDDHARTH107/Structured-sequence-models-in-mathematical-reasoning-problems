    "message_2": "The T3 axiom states that for any closed set F and a point x not in F, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and F ⊆ V.\n\nLet's show that the Euclidean metric space ℝ with the usual metric d satisfies the T3 axiom.\n\nLet F be a closed subset of ℝ, and let x ∈ ℝ \\ F. Since F is closed, its complement, ℝ \\ F, is open. Since x ∈ ℝ \\ F, there exists an open ball B(x, r) centered at x with radius r > 0 such that B(x, r) ⊆ ℝ \\ F. Let's choose r > 0 such that B(x, r) does not intersect F.\n\nNow, let's define two open sets U and V as follows:\n\nU = B(x, r/2) and V = (ℝ \\ B(x, r/2)).\n\nU is an open set containing x, and V is an open set containing F. Moreover, U and V are disjoint, as their intersection would imply that there exists a point in both B(x, r/2) and its complement, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, the Euclidean metric space ℝ with the usual metric d satisfies the T3 axiom."
