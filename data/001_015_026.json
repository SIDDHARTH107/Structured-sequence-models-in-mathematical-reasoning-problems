    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a form that allows us to isolate x. We can start by expressing the fraction $\\frac{1}{8}$ as a power of 2:\n\n$\\frac{1}{8} = 2^{-3}$\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n$2^{2x-1} = 2^{-3}$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$2x - 1 = -3$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$2x = -3 + 1$\n\n$2x = -2$\n\n$x = -1$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = -1$."
