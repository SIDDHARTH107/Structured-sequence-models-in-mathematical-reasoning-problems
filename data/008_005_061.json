    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  5 -1 |  1 |\n| 1 -3  2 | -4 |\n| 4  1  3 |  7 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\nWe can subtract 1/2 of the first row from the second row and subtract 2 times the first row from the third row.\n\n|  2   5  -1 |  1  |\n|  0  -6.5  2.5 | -4.5|\n|  0  -9   5  |  5  |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -6.5 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\n|  2   5  -1 |  1   |\n|  0   1  -5/13 | 9/13 |\n|  0  -9   5  |  5   |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row.\nWe can add 9 times the second row to the third row.\n\n|  2   5  -1 |  1   |\n|  0   1  -5/13 | 9/13 |\n|  0   0  32/13 | 68/13|\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 32/13 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\n|  2   5  -1 |  1   |\n|  0   1  -5/13 | 9/13 |\n|  0   0   1  |  17/8 |\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\nFrom the third row, we have z = 17/8.\nSubstitute z into the second row: y - (5/13)(17/8) = 9/13 => y = 1.\nSubstitute y and z into the first row: 2x + 5(1) - (17/8) = 1 => x = -1/2.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1/2, y = 1, and z = 17/8."
