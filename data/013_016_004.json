    "message_1": "Suppose you are the CEO of a company and want to hire a new employee who will either work hard or shirk. If the new employee works hard, you get a profit of $50,000; if the new employee shirks, you get a profit of $20,000. The probability of the new employee shirking is 0.5. You can offer the new employee a salary of $30,000 or $40,000. If the salary is $30,000, the probability of the employee working hard is 0.3; and if the salary is $40,000, the probability of the employee working hard is 0.7. Which salary should you offer the new employee to maximize your expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine which salary to offer the new employee to maximize your expected profit, we need to calculate the expected profit for each salary option.\n\n1. Salary of $30,000:\n\nProbability of working hard: 0.3\nProfit if working hard: $50,000\nExpected profit from working hard: 0.3 * $50,000 = $15,000\n\nProbability of shirking: 0.5\nProfit if shirking: $20,000\nExpected profit from shirking: 0.5 * $20,000 = $10,000\n\nTotal expected profit for $30,000 salary: $15,000 + $10,000 = $25,000\n\n2. Salary of $40,000:\n\nProbability of working hard: 0.7\nProfit if working hard: $50,000\nExpected profit from working hard: 0.7 * $50,000 = $35,000\n\nProbability of shirking: 0.3\nProfit if shirking: $20,000\nExpected profit from shirking: 0.3 * $20,000 = $6,000\n\nTotal expected profit for $40,000 salary: $35,000 + $6,000 = $41,000\n\nNow, we need to subtract the salary cost from the total expected profit for each option:\n\nExpected profit for $30,000 salary: $25,000 - $30,000 = -$5,000\nExpected profit for $40,000 salary: $41,000 - $40,000 = $1,000\n\nSince the expected profit for offering a $40,000 salary is higher than the expected profit for offering a $30,000 salary, you should offer the new employee a salary of $40,000 to maximize your expected profit."
