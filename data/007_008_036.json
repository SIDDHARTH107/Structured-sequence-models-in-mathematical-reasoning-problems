    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this case, p = 13 (a prime number) and a = 5. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, 5^13 ≡ 5 (mod 13). Therefore, the remainder when 5^13 is divided by 13 is 5."
