    "message_2": "Let x be a non-identity element in G. We want to show that the order of x is p. The order of x is the smallest positive integer n such that x^n = e, where e is the identity element in G.\n\nConsider the subgroup H generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩. By definition, ⟨x⟩ = {x^0, x^1, x^2, ..., x^(n-1)}, where n is the order of x. Since x is not the identity, n > 1.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. In our case, the order of H (which is n) must divide the order of G (which is p). Since p is a prime number, its only divisors are 1 and p. We already know that n > 1, so the only possibility left is that n = p.\n\nTherefore, the order of every non-identity element in the group G is p."
