    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) - 1 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n3y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0\n\nNow we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -2, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(3)(-1))) / (2(3))\ny = (2 ± √(4 + 12)) / 6\ny = (2 ± √16) / 6\ny = (2 ± 4) / 6\n\nThis gives us two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (2 + 4) / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1\ny2 = (2 - 4) / 6 = -2 / 6 = -1/3\n\nNow we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy these values of y (sin(x)):\n\n1) sin(x) = 1\nThe only value of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfies this equation is x = π/2.\n\n2) sin(x) = -1/3\nTo find the values of x that satisfy this equation, we can use the arcsin function:\n\nx = arcsin(-1/3)\n\nThere are two values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy this equation:\n\nx1 = arcsin(-1/3) ≈ -0.3398 (This value is outside the interval [0, 2π], so we need to find the equivalent value within the interval)\nx1 = π - (-0.3398) ≈ 3.4814\n\nx2 = 2π - arcsin(-1/3) ≈ 2π - (-0.3398) ≈ 6.0532\n\nSo, the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy the original equation are:\n\nx ≈ π/2, 3.4814, 6.0532"
