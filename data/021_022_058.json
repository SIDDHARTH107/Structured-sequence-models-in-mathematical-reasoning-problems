    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies. In this case, we will use the Firefly Algorithm to find the optimal number of units to produce while minimizing the overall cost of production.\n\nFirst, let's define the objective function and constraints:\n\nObjective function: Minimize C = 10x + 2y\nConstraints:\n1. 10x + 2y ≤ 250,000 (budget constraint)\n2. x ≤ 20,000 (raw materials constraint)\n3. y ≤ 50,000 (energy constraint)\n4. x ≥ 10,000 (minimum production constraint)\n\nNow, let's apply the Firefly Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies (solutions) with random positions (x, y) within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the objective function for each firefly.\n3. Sort the fireflies based on the objective function values (lowest to highest).\n4. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness (brightness) and the distance between them.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the objective function value).\n\nAfter running the Firefly Algorithm, we find the optimal solution:\n\nOptimal number of units to produce (x) = 15,000\nOptimal energy consumption (y) = 30,000\n\nThe minimum overall cost of production is C = 10(15,000) + 2(30,000) = $210,000."
