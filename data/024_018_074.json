    "message_2": "To compute the sectional curvature at the point (0, 0, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by two variables u and v. We can rewrite the given equation as:\n\nz^2 - 4z + x^2 + y^2 = 0\nz^2 - 4z + 4 + x^2 + y^2 = 4\n(z - 2)^2 + x^2 + y^2 = 4\n\nThis is the equation of a sphere with center (0, 0, 2) and radius 2. We can parameterize the sphere using spherical coordinates:\n\nx = 2sin(u)cos(v)\ny = 2sin(u)sin(v)\nz = 2 + 2cos(u)\n\nNow we compute the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <ru, ru> = (2cos(u)cos(v))^2 + (2cos(u)sin(v))^2 + (-2sin(u))^2\nE = 4cos^2(u)(cos^2(v) + sin^2(v)) + 4sin^2(u)\nE = 4(cos^2(u) + sin^2(u))\n\nF = <ru, rv> = 0 (since ru and rv are orthogonal)\n\nG = <rv, rv> = (2sin(u)(-sin(v)))^2 + (2sin(u)cos(v))^2\nG = 4sin^2(u)(sin^2(v) + cos^2(v))\nG = 4sin^2(u)\n\nNow we compute the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <ruu, N> = 0 (since ruu and N are orthogonal)\n\nM = <ruv, N> = 0 (since ruv and N are orthogonal)\n\nN = <rvv, N> = 2\n\nNow we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (0 * 2 - 0^2) / (4 * 4sin^2(u) - 0^2) = 0\n\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / 2(EG - F^2) = (0 + 2 * 4cos^2(u) - 0) / 2(4 * 4sin^2(u) - 0^2) = cos^2(u) / sin^2(u)\n\nNow we can evaluate K and H at the point (0, 0, 2) on the surface:\n\nu = π/2, v = 0 (since x = y = 0 and z = 2)\n\nK(π/2, 0) = 0\nH(π/2, 0) = cos^2(π/2) / sin^2(π/2) = 0 / 1 = 0\n\nThus, the sectional curvature at the point (0, 0, 2) is 0."
