    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3/x) + (2/x^2) = 5/6, we first find a common denominator for the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x^2. \n\nNow, we rewrite the equation with the common denominator:\n\n(3x/x^2) + (2/x^2) = 5/6\n\nNow, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n\n(3x + 2)/x^2 = 5/6\n\nNext, we cross-multiply:\n\n6(3x + 2) = 5x^2\n\nNow, we distribute the 6 on the left side:\n\n18x + 12 = 5x^2\n\nNow, we set the equation to 0:\n\n5x^2 - 18x - 12 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = -18, and c = -12. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (18 ± √((-18)^2 - 4(5)(-12))) / (2(5))\n\nx = (18 ± √(324 + 240)) / 10\n\nx = (18 ± √564) / 10\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (18 + √564) / 10\nx = (18 - √564) / 10\n\nThese are the two possible values for x."
