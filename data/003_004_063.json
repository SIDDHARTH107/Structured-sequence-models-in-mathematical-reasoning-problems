    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin^2(x) - 3sin(x) - 2 = 0, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - 3y - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(2y + 1)(y - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for y:\n\n1) 2y + 1 = 0 => y = -1/2\n2) y - 2 = 0 => y = 2\n\nHowever, since the sine function has a range of [-1, 1], the second solution (y = 2) is not valid. So, we only need to consider the first solution, y = -1/2. Now, we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy sin(x) = -1/2.\n\nThere are two such values:\n\n1) x = 7π/6 (210°)\n2) x = 11π/6 (330°)\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6."
