A sample of 50 tablets is collected and their average weight is found to be 490 mg. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the tablets based on the sample data.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the tablets, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere,\nSample Mean = 490 mg\nSample Size (n) = 50 tablets\nPopulation Standard Deviation (σ) = 20 mg\nCritical Value (Z) for a 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from the Z-table)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Standard Error (SE):\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n\nSE = 20 mg / √50\nSE ≈ 2.83 mg\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nMargin of Error (ME) = Critical Value * Standard Error\nME = 1.96 * 2.83 mg\nME ≈ 5.55 mg\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± Margin of Error\nConfidence Interval = 490 mg ± 5.55 mg\nConfidence Interval ≈ (484.45 mg, 495.55 mg)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the tablets is approximately (484.45 mg, 495.55 mg)."
