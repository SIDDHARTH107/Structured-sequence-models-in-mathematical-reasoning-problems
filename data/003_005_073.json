    "message_2": "Using the inverse sine function, we can find the value of x in degrees as follows:\n\nx = sin^(-1)(0.5)\n\nx ≈ 30°\n\nSo, the value of x is approximately 30 degrees. Note that this is the principal value. The general solution would be x = 30° + 360°n and x = 180° - 30° + 360°n, where n is an integer."
