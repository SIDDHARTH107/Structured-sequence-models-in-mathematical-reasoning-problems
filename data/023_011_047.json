    "message_2": "To analyze the frequency behavior of the signal x(t) = cos(2000πt) + cos(4000πt), we can apply the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is defined as:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, where the integral is taken over all time.\n\nIn our case, x(t) = cos(2000πt) + cos(4000πt). The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF[cos(ωt)] = (1/2) [δ(f - ω/2π) + δ(f + ω/2π)], where δ(f) is the Dirac delta function and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to x(t):\n\nX(f) = F[cos(2000πt) + cos(4000πt)]\n     = F[cos(2000πt)] + F[cos(4000πt)]\n\nUsing the Fourier transform of a cosine function:\n\nX(f) = (1/2) [δ(f - 1000) + δ(f + 1000)] + (1/2) [δ(f - 2000) + δ(f + 2000)]\n\nThe Dirac delta functions indicate the presence of frequencies at f = 1000 Hz, f = -1000 Hz, f = 2000 Hz, and f = -2000 Hz. However, since the negative frequencies are just the complex conjugates of the positive frequencies, we only need to consider the positive frequencies.\n\nThus, the two frequencies of the signal are 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz."
