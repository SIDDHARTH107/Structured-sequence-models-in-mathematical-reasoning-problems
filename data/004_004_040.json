    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x² + 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = x² + 2x + 3. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\n∫(x² + 2x + 3) dx = (1/3)x³ + x² + 3x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 0 and x = 4:\n\n[(1/3)(4)³ + (4)² + 3(4)] - [(1/3)(0)³ + (0)² + 3(0)]\n= [(1/3)(64) + 16 + 12] - [0]\n= [64/3 + 16 + 12]\n= [64/3 + 48/3 + 36/3]\n= [148/3]\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x² + 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 148/3 square units."
