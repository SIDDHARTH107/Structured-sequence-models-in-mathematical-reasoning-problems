    "message_1": "Consider a Trust Game where two players, A and B, are playing. Player A is given $100 and has the option to give any amount of money to player B. Whatever amount A gives, B will receive triple the amount and then decide how much to give back to player A. If player B decides to return $50 to player A, how much money did player A initially give to player B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of money player A initially gave to player B. Then, player B received 3x (triple the amount). Since player B returned $50 to player A, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3x - 50 = x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x - x = 50\n2x = 50\nx = 25\n\nSo, player A initially gave $25 to player B."
