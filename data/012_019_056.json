    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In the given graph, we can see that it is a complete graph with 4 vertices, also known as K4.\n\nIn a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The chromatic index of a complete graph K_n is given by the formula:\n\nchromatic index = n if n is odd,\nchromatic index = n - 1 if n is even.\n\nSince the given graph is K4, which has an even number of vertices (n = 4), the chromatic index is:\n\nchromatic index = n - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3."
