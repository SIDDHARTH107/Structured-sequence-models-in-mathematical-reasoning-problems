However, we first need to check if the function is periodic with period 2π.\n\nThe function f(x) = 1/x is not periodic with period 2π, as f(x + 2π) ≠ f(x) for all x. Therefore, we cannot directly compute the Fourier series coefficients for this function.\n\nHowever, we can still find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval [-π, π] by considering its even extension on the interval [0, π] and then extending it to the interval [-π, π]. The even extension of f(x) = 1/x is g(x) = (1/x) for x in [0, π] and g(x) = (1/(-x)) for x in [-π, 0]. Now, we can compute the Fourier series coefficients for g(x).\n\nSince g(x) is an even function, all the sine terms in the Fourier series will be zero, and we only need to compute the cosine terms. The Fourier series representation of g(x) is:\n\ng(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx)]\n\nTo find the coefficients a_n, we use the following formula:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] g(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nFor a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1/x) * cos(0) dx + ∫[0, π] (1/x) * cos(0) dx]\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1/x) dx + ∫[0, π] (1/x) dx]\n\nSince the integral of 1/x is ln|x|, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-ln|x|) |[-π, 0] + ln|x| |[0, π]]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-ln(π) + ln(π))]\na_0 = 0\n\nFor a_n (n ≠ 0):\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1/x) * cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (1/x) * cos(nx) dx]\n\nUnfortunately, these integrals do not have elementary antiderivatives, so we cannot find a closed-form expression for a_n. However, we can still represent the Fourier series of g(x) using the integral expressions for a_n:\n\ng(x) = Σ[(1/π) * (∫[-π, 0] (-1/x) * cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (1/x) * cos(nx) dx) * cos(nx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the even extension of f(x) = 1/x on the interval [-π, π]."
