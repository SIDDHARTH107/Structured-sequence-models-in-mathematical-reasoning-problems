    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation tan(x) = 2, we first find the angle whose tangent is 2.\n\n1. Take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of both sides:\nx = arctan(2)\n\n2. Use a calculator or lookup table to find the angle:\nx ≈ 63.43 degrees\n\nHowever, the tangent function has a period of 180 degrees, which means that there is another solution for x within the given range of 0 to 360 degrees. To find this solution, we add 180 degrees to the first solution:\n\nx ≈ 63.43 + 180\nx ≈ 243.43 degrees\n\nSo, the two solutions for x within the given range are approximately 63.43 degrees and 243.43 degrees."
