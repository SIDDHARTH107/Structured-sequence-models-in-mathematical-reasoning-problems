    "message_1": "A Chua circuit has the following circuit components: two capacitors of capacitances C1 = 100 pF and C2 = 220 pF, one inductor of inductance L = 10 mH, two resistors of values R1 = 220 Ω and R2 = 470 Ω, and a chaotic system of equations. \n\nIf the initial condition of the Chua circuit is Vc1 = 2 V, Vc2 = 3 V, and Il = 1 mA, determine the voltage across the Chua circuit at time t = 5 ms.",
    "message_2": "To determine the voltage across the Chua circuit at time t = 5 ms, we need to solve the Chua circuit's system of equations. The Chua circuit is governed by the following three nonlinear differential equations:\n\n1. C1 * dVc1/dt = (G(Vc2 - Vc1) - R1 * Il)\n2. C2 * dVc2/dt = (G(Vc1 - Vc2) + R2 * Il)\n3. L * dIl/dt = -Vc2\n\nWhere G is the nonlinear function representing the Chua diode.\n\nHowever, solving these equations analytically is not possible due to the nonlinear nature of the Chua circuit. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to solve the system of equations.\n\nOne common numerical method for solving differential equations is the Runge-Kutta method. We can use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve the Chua circuit's system of equations with the given initial conditions and find the voltage across the circuit at t = 5 ms.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform numerical simulations. You can use software like MATLAB or Python to implement the Runge-Kutta method and solve the Chua circuit's system of equations."
