    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to Type Theory for the math student to solve:\n\nGiven the following types:\n\n- `Nat`: the natural numbers type containing `0` and all positive integers,\n- `Bool`: the boolean type containing `true` and `false`,\n- `Pair`: a type that takes two types and forms the type of pairs, and\n- `List`: a type that takes a type and forms the type of lists,\n\ndefine a type `Tree` of binary trees such that each node contains either a `Nat` value, a `List` of `Tree` values or a `Pair` of `Tree` values. \n\nWrite the definition of the `Tree` type using type theory notation and provide an example of a valid binary tree of type `Tree`.",
    "message_2": "To define the `Tree` type, we can use a recursive sum type. In type theory notation, we can define the `Tree` type as follows:\n\n```\nTree = Σ(NodeType: {Nat, List(Tree), Pair(Tree, Tree)}, Left: Tree, Right: Tree)\n```\n\nHere, `Σ` represents a dependent sum type, and `NodeType` is a field that can take one of the three types: `Nat`, `List(Tree)`, or `Pair(Tree, Tree)`. The `Left` and `Right` fields represent the left and right subtrees, respectively.\n\nNow, let's provide an example of a valid binary tree of type `Tree`:\n\n```\nt1: Tree\nt1 = (NodeType: Nat, Value: 3, Left: t2, Right: t3)\n\nt2: Tree\nt2 = (NodeType: List(Tree), Value: [t4], Left: t4, Right: t5)\n\nt3: Tree\nt3 = (NodeType: Pair(Tree, Tree), Value: (t6, t7), Left: t6, Right: t7)\n\nt4: Tree\nt4 = (NodeType: Nat, Value: 1, Left: null, Right: null)\n\nt5: Tree\nt5 = (NodeType: Nat, Value: 2, Left: null, Right: null)\n\nt6: Tree\nt6 = (NodeType: Nat, Value: 4, Left: null, Right: null)\n\nt7: Tree\nt7 = (NodeType: Nat, Value: 5, Left: null, Right: null)\n```\n\nIn this example, `t1` is the root of the binary tree, and it contains a `Nat` value of `3`. The left subtree of `t1` is `t2`, which contains a `List(Tree)` value of `[t4]`. The right subtree of `t1` is `t3`, which contains a `Pair(Tree, Tree)` value of `(t6, t7)`. The other nodes in the tree contain `Nat` values and have null left and right subtrees."
