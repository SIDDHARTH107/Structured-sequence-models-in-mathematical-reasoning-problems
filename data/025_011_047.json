    "message_2": "We are given an elliptic curve $E$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_3$ with the equation $y^2 + y = x^3 - x$. To find the number of points $N$ on this curve, we can simply check all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ and count the number of valid points.\n\nRecall that $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. We will check each possible combination of $x$ and $y$:\n\n1. For $x = 0$:\n   - $y = 0$: $0^2 + 0 = 0^3 - 0 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$, valid point $(0, 0)$.\n   - $y = 1$: $1^2 + 1 = 0^3 - 0 \\Rightarrow 2 = 0$, not a valid point.\n   - $y = 2$: $2^2 + 2 = 0^3 - 0 \\Rightarrow 2 = 0$, not a valid point.\n\n2. For $x = 1$:\n   - $y = 0$: $0^2 + 0 = 1^3 - 1 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$, valid point $(1, 0)$.\n   - $y = 1$: $1^2 + 1 = 1^3 - 1 \\Rightarrow 2 = 0$, not a valid point.\n   - $y = 2$: $2^2 + 2 = 1^3 - 1 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$, valid point $(1, 2)$.\n\n3. For $x = 2$:\n   - $y = 0$: $0^2 + 0 = 2^3 - 2 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$, valid point $(2, 0)$.\n   - $y = 1$: $1^2 + 1 = 2^3 - 2 \\Rightarrow 2 = 0$, not a valid point.\n   - $y = 2$: $2^2 + 2 = 2^3 - 2 \\Rightarrow 0 = 0$, valid point $(2, 2)$.\n\nWe found 5 valid points on the curve: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 0)$, and $(2, 2)$. Additionally, we must also consider the point at infinity, which is always on an elliptic curve. Therefore, the total number of points on the elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ is $N = 5 + 1 = 6$."
