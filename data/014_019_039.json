    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with a key length of 7 means that the plaintext message will be written in a grid with 7 columns, and the ciphertext will be formed by reading the characters in the grid row by row.\n\nFirst, let's write the plaintext message \"MATHROCKS\" in a grid with 7 columns:\n\nM A T H R O C\nK S\n\nNow, we read the characters row by row to form the ciphertext:\n\nCiphertext: MATHROCKS\n\nIn this case, the ciphertext is the same as the plaintext because the message length is less than the key length. If the message was longer, the transposition would have a more significant effect on the ciphertext."
