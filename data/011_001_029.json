    "message_2": "To find the number of different ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"MATHS,\" you can use the formula for permutations, which is n! (n factorial), where n is the number of letters in the word.\n\nIn this case, there are 5 letters in the word \"MATHS,\" so the number of different ways to rearrange the letters is 5! (5 factorial).\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 different ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"MATHS\" if you use all the letters."
