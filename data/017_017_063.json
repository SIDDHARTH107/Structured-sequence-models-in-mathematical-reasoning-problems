    "message_2": "Let G be a non-abelian group of order 30. The prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there are unique Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let P2, P3, and P5 denote these subgroups, with orders 2, 3, and 5, respectively.\n\nSince P2 is a Sylow 2-subgroup, it must have order 2. Therefore, it contains one element of order 2 (besides the identity element). Let's call this element x.\n\nNow, let's consider the centralizer of x in G, denoted by C_G(x). This is the set of all elements in G that commute with x. Since x is an element of order 2, we have x^2 = e (the identity element). Thus, for any element g in G, we have (gx)^2 = g^2x^2 = g^2e = g^2, which implies that x commutes with all elements of order 2 in G.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, there must be at least one element that does not commute with x. Therefore, the order of C_G(x) must be strictly less than the order of G, which is 30. The possible orders of C_G(x) are divisors of 30, excluding 30 itself: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 15.\n\nIf the order of C_G(x) were 1, then x would only commute with the identity element, which contradicts the fact that x commutes with all elements of order 2. Therefore, the smallest possible order for C_G(x) is 2.\n\nSince x is an element of order 2, C_G(x) must contain at least one more element of order 2. Let's call this element y. Then, the number of elements of order 2 in G is at least 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of non-identity elements that commute with each element of order 2. Since x and y are both elements of order 2 and commute with each other, there are at least two non-identity elements that commute with each element of order 2.\n\nIn summary, there are at least 2 elements of order 2 in any non-abelian group of order 30, and there are at least 2 non-identity elements that commute with each one of them."
