    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six-sided die in three rolls, we can use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability of NOT rolling a 4 in three rolls and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a 4 on a single roll is 5/6 (since there are 5 other outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6).\n\nThe probability of not rolling a 4 in three consecutive rolls is (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = 125/216.\n\nNow, we'll find the complementary probability, which is the probability of rolling at least one 4 in three rolls:\n\n1 - (125/216) = 91/216\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six-sided die in three rolls is 91/216."
