    "message_1": "Consider a principal-agent model where the agent's effort level (e) affects the outcome (y) as follows: \n\ny = e + 10 \n\nThe agent's effort level is not directly observable by the principal. Instead, the principal can offer a wage contract to the agent where the agent's wage (w) is based on the outcome (y) as follows: \n\nw = y - 5 \n\nIf the agent accepts the contract, she will choose her effort level (e). However, the agent may not always choose the effort level that maximizes the principal's payoff. \n\nSuppose the principal's payoff function is \n\nP = 2e - w \n\nWhat is the agent's best response function to this wage contract?",
    "message_2": "To find the agent's best response function, we first need to determine the agent's payoff function. The agent's payoff function (A) can be defined as:\n\nA = w - c(e)\n\nwhere c(e) is the cost of effort for the agent. We are not given the cost function, so we will assume it is a general function of effort.\n\nNow, we can substitute the wage contract into the agent's payoff function:\n\nA = (y - 5) - c(e)\n\nSince y = e + 10, we can substitute this into the agent's payoff function:\n\nA = (e + 10 - 5) - c(e)\nA = e + 5 - c(e)\n\nThe agent's best response function will be the effort level that maximizes her payoff. To find this, we can take the first-order condition by differentiating the agent's payoff function with respect to effort:\n\ndA/de = 1 - c'(e)\n\nTo find the maximum, we set the first-order condition equal to zero:\n\n1 - c'(e) = 0\nc'(e) = 1\n\nThe agent's best response function is the effort level that satisfies this condition. Since we do not have a specific cost function, we cannot find an explicit solution for the effort level. However, we can say that the agent will choose her effort level such that the marginal cost of effort (c'(e)) is equal to 1."
