    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, denoted by A', we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. However, the universal set U is not explicitly given. So, let's assume a reasonable universal set that contains A. For example, we can consider the set of all integers from 1 to 10 as the universal set U.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, A':\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's verify that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = {2, 4, 6, 8} ∪ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince A ∪ A' = U, we have verified that the union of set A and its complement is equal to the set U."
