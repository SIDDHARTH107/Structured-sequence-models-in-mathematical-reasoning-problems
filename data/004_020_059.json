The coefficient of friction between the crate and the surface is 0.2. If the crate is dragged a distance of 10 meters, find the work done by the force applied to the crate.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force applied to the crate, we need to determine the horizontal component of the force exerted by the rope and the frictional force acting on the crate. Then, we can calculate the net force acting on the crate and multiply it by the distance it is dragged.\n\n1. Calculate the horizontal component of the force exerted by the rope:\nThe force exerted by the rope (F_rope) can be divided into two components: horizontal (F_horizontal) and vertical (F_vertical). We can use trigonometry to find the horizontal component.\n\nF_horizontal = F_rope * cos(30°)\n\nSince we know the weight of the crate (100N), we can find the force exerted by the rope (F_rope) using the vertical component of the force:\n\nF_vertical = F_rope * sin(30°)\n\nThe vertical component of the force is equal to the weight of the crate, so:\n\nF_rope * sin(30°) = 100N\n\nF_rope = 100N / sin(30°) = 100N / 0.5 = 200N\n\nNow we can find the horizontal component of the force:\n\nF_horizontal = 200N * cos(30°) = 200N * 0.866 = 173.2N\n\n2. Calculate the frictional force acting on the crate:\nThe frictional force (F_friction) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF_friction = μ * F_normal\n\nSince the crate is being dragged horizontally, the normal force (F_normal) is equal to the weight of the crate (100N). Therefore:\n\nF_friction = 0.2 * 100N = 20N\n\n3. Calculate the net force acting on the crate:\nThe net force (F_net) is the difference between the horizontal component of the force exerted by the rope and the frictional force:\n\nF_net = F_horizontal - F_friction = 173.2N - 20N = 153.2N\n\n4. Calculate the work done by the force applied to the crate:\nThe work done (W) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = F_net * distance\n\nW = 153.2N * 10m = 1532 Joules\n\nSo, the work done by the force applied to the crate is 1532 Joules."
