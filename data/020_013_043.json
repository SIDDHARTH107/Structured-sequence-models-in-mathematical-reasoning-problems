    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y, that requires raw materials A and B. The company has 900 units of raw material A and 1200 units of raw material B. Each unit of product X requires 3 units of raw material A and 2 units of raw material B, while each unit of product Y requires 2 units of raw material A and 4 units of raw material B. The profit per unit of product X is $4 and for Y is $5. Find the maximum profit the company can earn given the limited availability of raw materials using semi-definite programming.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we can set up a linear programming problem. Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 4x + 5y, subject to the constraints on raw materials A and B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 900 (raw material A)\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 1200 (raw material B)\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we'll use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 900 → y = (900 - 3x) / 2\n2. 2x + 4y = 1200 → y = (1200 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 300), (200, 150), and (300, 0). Now, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 4(0) + 5(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 300) = 4(0) + 5(300) = 1500\n3. P(200, 150) = 4(200) + 5(150) = 800 + 750 = 1550\n4. P(300, 0) = 4(300) + 5(0) = 1200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (200, 150), with a profit of $1550. Therefore, the company should produce 200 units of product X and 150 units of product Y to maximize their profit, given the limited availability of raw materials."
