    "message_2": "To simplify the expression `tan(x) / cos(x)`, we can use the fact that `tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)`. So, the expression becomes:\n\n`(sin(x) / cos(x)) / cos(x)`\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `cos(x)` to eliminate the fraction within a fraction:\n\n`sin(x) / (cos(x) * cos(x))`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`sin(x) / cos^2(x)`\n\nSo, the simplified expression in terms of `sin(x)` is:\n\n`sin(x) / cos^2(x)`"
