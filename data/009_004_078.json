    "message_2": "The equation of motion for a mass-spring system can be described by the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the object at time t, A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nGiven the natural angular frequency (ω) is 5 rad/s, the mass (m) is 2 kg, and the spring constant (k) is 10 N/m, we can verify the relationship between these parameters:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n5 = sqrt(10/2)\n5 = sqrt(5)\n\nThe relationship is correct.\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude (A) and the phase angle (φ). Since the object is displaced by 5 cm (0.05 m) at time t=0, we can use this information to find A and φ:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ)\n0.05 = A * cos(0)\nA = 0.05\n\nSince the phase angle (φ) is 0 at t=0, the equation of motion for the resulting vibrations is:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(5 * t)"
