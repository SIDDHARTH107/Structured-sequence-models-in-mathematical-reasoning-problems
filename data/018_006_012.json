    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set such that U = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and A be a subset of U such that A = {1,3,5,7}, what is the complement of A and what is the union of A and its complement? Use Set theory to prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. The complement of A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of A from U:\n\nA' = U - A = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, to find the union of A and its complement A', we need to combine all the elements of A and A' without any repetition:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nTo prove that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U, we can use the following set theory property:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nSince A ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, we can conclude that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
