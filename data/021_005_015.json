    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we first need to set up the method. The general form of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is:\n\nk1 = h * f(x, y)\nk2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(x + h, y + k3)\ny_new = y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\nwhere h is the step size, f(x, y) is the given ODE, and y_new is the updated value of y after one step.\n\nNow let's solve the ODE for the given initial condition y(0) = -1 and the two step sizes h = 0.1 and h = 0.01.\n\nFor h = 0.1:\n\nWe will have 20 steps to reach x = 2 (since 2 / 0.1 = 20). We can use a loop to iterate through these steps and update the value of y using the Runge-Kutta method.\n\nFor h = 0.01:\n\nWe will have 200 steps to reach x = 2 (since 2 / 0.01 = 200). We can use a loop to iterate through these steps and update the value of y using the Runge-Kutta method.\n\nAfter calculating the values of y at x = 2 for both step sizes, we can compare the solutions and find the percentage error of the solution with h = 0.01.\n\nThe percentage error can be calculated as:\n\npercentage_error = (abs(y_h_0.01 - y_h_0.1) / y_h_0.1) * 100\n\nwhere y_h_0.01 is the value of y at x = 2 with step size h = 0.01, and y_h_0.1 is the value of y at x = 2 with step size h = 0.1.\n\nNote that this ODE does not have a closed-form solution, so we cannot compare the numerical solutions to an exact solution. However, the percentage error between the two numerical solutions can give us an idea of how much the solution changes as we decrease the step size."
