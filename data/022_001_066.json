    "message_2": "To find the value of f(1) using Cauchy's integral formula, we first need to find a simple closed curve that encloses the point z = 1 and does not pass through the singularity at z = -2/3. A simple choice is a circle centered at 1 with a radius of 1, which we will denote as C.\n\nCauchy's integral formula states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve C, and for any point z_0 inside C:\n\nf(z_0) = (1/(2πi)) * ∮(f(z)/(z - z_0)) dz\n\nIn our case, z_0 = 1, and we want to find f(1). So we have:\n\nf(1) = (1/(2πi)) * ∮(f(z)/(z - 1)) dz\n\nNow, we substitute the given function f(z) = 1/(3z + 2):\n\nf(1) = (1/(2πi)) * ∮((1/(3z + 2))/(z - 1)) dz\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n\nf(1) = (1/(2πi)) * ∮(1/((3z + 2)(z - 1))) dz\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral. Since the integrand has a simple pole at z = 1, we can use the residue theorem to find the integral. The residue theorem states that for a function with isolated singularities inside a simple closed curve C:\n\n∮f(z) dz = 2πi * (sum of residues of f(z) at its singularities inside C)\n\nIn our case, the only singularity inside C is at z = 1. To find the residue of f(z) at z = 1, we can use the formula for a simple pole:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * f(z)]\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (1/((3z + 2)(z - 1)))]\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 1) [1/(3z + 2)]\n\nNow we substitute z = 1:\n\nResidue = 1/(3(1) + 2) = 1/5\n\nNow we can use the residue theorem to find the integral:\n\n∮(1/((3z + 2)(z - 1))) dz = 2πi * (1/5)\n\nFinally, we can find f(1) using Cauchy's integral formula:\n\nf(1) = (1/(2πi)) * (2πi * (1/5))\n\nf(1) = 1/5\n\nSo, the value of f(1) is 1/5."
