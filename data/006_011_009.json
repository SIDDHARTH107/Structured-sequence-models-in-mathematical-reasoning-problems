    "message_2": "To find the probability of no accidents in a particular month, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents), k is the desired number of events (0 in this case, since we want no accidents), λ is the average number of events (4 accidents per month), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 0) = (4^0 * e^(-4)) / 0!\n\nP(X = 0) = (1 * e^(-4)) / 1\n\nP(X = 0) = e^(-4)\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of e^(-4):\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.0183\n\nSo, the probability that the factory will have no accidents in a particular month is approximately 0.0183 or 1.83%."
