    "message_2": "To prove that X is Hausdorff, we need to show that for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nBy the given condition, for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U_x and V_y such that x ∈ U_x and y ∈ V_y. Since U_x and V_y are disjoint, this implies that X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nNow, let's provide an example of a topological space that is not Hausdorff but satisfies the given separation axiom.\n\nConsider the set X = {a, b, c} with the following topology:\n\nT = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, X}\n\nIn this topology, every two distinct points can be separated by two disjoint open sets. For example, for points a and b, we can choose the open sets {a} and {b}. Similarly, for points a and c, we can choose the open sets {a} and {c} (since {c} = X - {a, b} is open), and for points b and c, we can choose the open sets {b} and {c} (since {c} = X - {a, b} is open).\n\nHowever, this topological space is not Hausdorff. To see this, consider the points a and c. There are no disjoint open sets U and V such that a ∈ U and c ∈ V. Any open set containing a must be either {a} or {a, b}, and any open set containing c must be X. Since {a} ⊆ X and {a, b} ⊆ X, there are no disjoint open sets containing a and c, so this space is not Hausdorff.\n\nThus, we have provided an example of a topological space that is not Hausdorff but satisfies the given separation axiom."
