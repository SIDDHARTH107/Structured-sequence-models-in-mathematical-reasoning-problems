    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of G, and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then P is a normal subgroup of G, and since |P| = 125, P = G, which implies that G is a p-group (p = 5). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic or a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since 125 = 5^3, G is either a cyclic group of order 125 or a direct product of cyclic groups of order 5 and 25.\n\nIf n_5 = 25, then there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let P and Q be two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups. Since |P| = |Q| = 5^2, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1 or 5. If |P ∩ Q| = 5, then P = Q, which is a contradiction. Therefore, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nLet H be the subgroup of G generated by the union of all Sylow 5-subgroups. Then, |H| = 1 + 24 * 5 = 121, since each Sylow 5-subgroup contributes 4 new elements to H. Since |G| = 125 and |H| = 121, we have |G:H| = 4. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have:\n\nG/H ≅ G/(G ∩ H) ≅ (GH)/H\n\nSince |G| = 125 and |H| = 121, we have |G/H| = 4, and |GH| = |G| * |H| / |G ∩ H| = 125 * 121 / 1 = 15125. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group of order 4. Since G is a group of order 125, it must be a 5-group, and thus G/H is a trivial group, which implies that G = H.\n\nNow, let R be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since G is a 5-group, R is a normal subgroup of G. Let S be another Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Then, RS is a subgroup of G, and |RS| = |R| * |S| / |R ∩ S| = 5^2 * 5^2 / 1 = 5^4. Since |RS| > |G|, we have RS = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of R and S, which are cyclic groups of order 5 and 25, respectively."
