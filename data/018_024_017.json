    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the complement of the symmetric difference, and finally check whether the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B is equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, we find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2} ∪ {4, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we find the complement of the symmetric difference. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. We need to define a universal set U to find the complement. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 4, 5} = {3}\n\nNext, we find the complements of A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {4, 5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2}\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B:\n\nA' ∆ B' = {4, 5} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nFinally, we check whether the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B is equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n(A ∆ B)' = {3}\n\nSince A' ∆ B' ≠ (A ∆ B)', the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B."
