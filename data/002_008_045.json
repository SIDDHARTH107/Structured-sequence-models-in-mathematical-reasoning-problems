    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. Calculate the volume of the cone rounded to the nearest cubic centimeter.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (5 cm)² * (10 cm)\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 25 cm² * 10 cm\n\nVolume = 3.14159 * 250/3 cm³\n\nVolume ≈ 261.799 cm³\n\nRounded to the nearest cubic centimeter, the volume of the cone is approximately 262 cm³."
