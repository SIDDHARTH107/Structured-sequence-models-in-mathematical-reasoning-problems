If a client files a claim, then the probability that they will file another claim in the following year is 0.5. If a client does not file a claim, then the probability of filing a claim in the following year is only 0.1. \n\nNow, suppose that a client has filed a claim in the current year. What is the probability that they will file a claim in the following year again?",
