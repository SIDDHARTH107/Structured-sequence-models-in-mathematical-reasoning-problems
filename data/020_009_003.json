Factory 1 produces 60% of all units, while Factory 2 produces 40%. Each unit produced by Factory 1 has a 10% chance of being defective, while each unit produced by Factory 2 has a 20% chance of being defective. The company wants to minimize the total number of defective units produced, given that they need a total of 100 units.\n\nWhat percentage of the total production should come from Factory 1 to minimize the number of defective units?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the percentage of production from Factory 1, and (1-x) be the percentage of production from Factory 2. We want to minimize the number of defective units produced.\n\nThe total number of defective units produced can be represented as a function of x:\n\nDefective units = (x * 100 * 0.1) + ((1-x) * 100 * 0.2)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nDefective units = 10x + 20 - 20x\n\nTo minimize the number of defective units, we need to find the value of x that minimizes the equation. We can do this by taking the derivative of the equation with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Defective units)/dx = 10 - 20 = -10\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on x, the function is a straight line with a negative slope. This means that the number of defective units decreases as x increases. Therefore, to minimize the number of defective units, we should maximize the production from Factory 1.\n\nSince Factory 1 can produce a maximum of 60% of the total units, the percentage of total production that should come from Factory 1 to minimize the number of defective units is 60%."
