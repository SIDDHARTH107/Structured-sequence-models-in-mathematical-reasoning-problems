    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations: \n\n2x + 3y = 7 \n\n4x + 6y = 14 \n\nDoes this system have a solution? If so, find the solution. If not, explain why there is no solution.",
    "message_2": "This system of linear equations can be analyzed by comparing the two equations. Notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation:\n\n(2x + 3y = 7) * 2 â‡’ 4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, these two equations are essentially the same line. In other words, they are dependent and represent the same linear equation.\n\nWhen two linear equations are dependent, they have infinitely many solutions, as they represent the same line. To find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other using one of the equations. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nWe can solve for x in terms of y:\n\n2x = 7 - 3y\nx = (7 - 3y) / 2\n\nSo the general solution for this system of linear equations is x = (7 - 3y) / 2, where y can be any real number."
