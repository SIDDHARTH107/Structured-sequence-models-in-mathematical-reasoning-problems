    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space X, we can use the formula for the dimension of the moduli space of smooth curves of genus g with n marked points, which is given by:\n\ndim(X) = 3g - 3 + n\n\nIn this case, we have g = 2 and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ndim(X) = 3(2) - 3 + 4 = 6 - 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space X of smooth curves of genus 2 with 4 marked points is 7."
