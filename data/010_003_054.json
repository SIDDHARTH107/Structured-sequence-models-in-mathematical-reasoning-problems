    "message_2": "Let's denote the points of X as {a, b, c, d, e}. Since every two distinct points of X are separated by open sets, X is a T1 space. In a T1 space, all singletons are closed sets. Now, let's find all possible open sets in X.\n\n1. The empty set Ø is always an open set.\n2. The whole set X itself is an open set.\n3. All singletons are complements of closed sets, so they are open sets: {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}, {e}.\n4. All possible pairs of points: {a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {a, e}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {b, e}, {c, d}, {c, e}, {d, e}.\n5. All possible sets with three points: {a, b, c}, {a, b, d}, {a, b, e}, {a, c, d}, {a, c, e}, {a, d, e}, {b, c, d}, {b, c, e}, {b, d, e}, {c, d, e}.\n6. All possible sets with four points: {a, b, c, d}, {a, b, c, e}, {a, b, d, e}, {a, c, d, e}, {b, c, d, e}.\n\nNow let's count the open sets in each category:\n\n1. 1 open set (Ø)\n2. 1 open set (X)\n3. 5 open sets (singletons)\n4. 10 open sets (pairs)\n5. 10 open sets (triples)\n6. 5 open sets (quadruples)\n\nAdding them up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 32 open sets in X."
