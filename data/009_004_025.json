Write the equation of motion for this system and determine the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To write the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use the following formula for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass.\n\nω = √(50 N/m / 0.2 kg) = √(250 s^(-2)) = 15.81 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). We know the initial displacement (x0) and initial velocity (v0):\n\nx0 = 0.1 m\nv0 = 0.5 m/s\n\nAt t = 0, the equation of motion becomes:\n\nx0 = A * cos(φ)\n\nand the derivative of the equation of motion with respect to time gives the velocity:\n\nv(t) = -A * ω * sin(ωt + φ)\n\nAt t = 0, the velocity equation becomes:\n\nv0 = -A * ω * sin(φ)\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns (A and φ):\n\n0.1 = A * cos(φ)\n0.5 = -A * 15.81 * sin(φ)\n\nTo solve for A and φ, we can square both equations and add them together:\n\n(0.1)^2 + (0.5 / 15.81)^2 = A^2 * (cos^2(φ) + sin^2(φ))\n\n0.01 + 0.001 = A^2\n\nA^2 = 0.011\nA = √0.011 = 0.1049 m\n\nNow, we can find the phase angle (φ) using the first equation:\n\n0.1 = 0.1049 * cos(φ)\n\ncos(φ) = 0.1 / 0.1049 = 0.9533\n\nφ = arccos(0.9533) = 0.3094 rad\n\nNow we have all the parameters for the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.1049 * cos(15.81t + 0.3094)\n\nTo find the period (T) and frequency (f) of the oscillation, we can use the following formulas:\n\nT = 2π / ω\nf = 1 / T\n\nT = 2π / 15.81 = 0.3974 s\nf = 1 / 0.3974 = 2.516 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude is 0.1049 m, the period is 0.3974 s, and the frequency is 2.516 Hz."
