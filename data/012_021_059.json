    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of graph G, we need to find a tree decomposition of G with the smallest possible maximum bag size minus one.\n\nA possible tree decomposition of G is:\n\n```\n  T1 = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n  T2 = {2, 3, 5, 6}\n  T3 = {4, 5, 7, 8}\n  T4 = {5, 6, 8, 9}\n\n  with the tree structure:\n\n      T1\n     /  \\\n   T3    T2\n         |\n        T4\n```\n\nEach bag has 4 vertices, so the maximum bag size is 4. Therefore, the treewidth of graph G is 4 - 1 = 3."
