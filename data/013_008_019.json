    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 10 people are playing a Public Goods Game. Each person has an endowment of $100. In each round of the game, each person is asked to contribute an amount between 0 and $10 towards a public good. The total contributions are then multiplied by a factor of 2 and divided equally among the players, regardless of whether or not they contributed to the public good.\n\nAssuming that all 10 players are rational and self-interested, what is the Nash equilibrium contribution for each player?",
    "message_2": "In a Nash equilibrium, each player chooses their best strategy, given the strategies chosen by the other players. In this Public Goods Game, the players are rational and self-interested, so they will try to maximize their own payoff.\n\nLet's consider a player's decision to contribute to the public good. If a player contributes $x, the total contribution will increase by $x, and the total amount after multiplication by the factor of 2 will increase by $2x. This increased amount will be divided equally among the 10 players, so each player will receive an additional $2x/10 = $x/5.\n\nHowever, the player who contributed $x will have a net loss of $x - $x/5 = $4x/5. Since this is a negative value for any positive contribution, it is not in the player's best interest to contribute any amount to the public good.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium contribution for each player is $0. In this equilibrium, no player has an incentive to change their strategy, as any positive contribution would result in a net loss for the contributing player."
