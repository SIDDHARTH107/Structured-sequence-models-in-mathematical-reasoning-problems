    "message_2": "The logistic map is a mathematical model for population growth, defined by the following equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at the nth iteration, r is the growth rate, and x(0) is the initial population.\n\nTo find the value of the logistic map at the 100th iteration with a growth rate of 3.75 and an initial population of 0.1, we can use a loop to calculate the population at each iteration:\n\nx = 0.1\nr = 3.75\n\nfor n in range(100):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nThe value of x after 100 iterations is approximately 0.348678."
