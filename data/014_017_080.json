    "message_1": "In a ciphertext encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the letters \"Q,\" \"Z,\" and \"X\" appear 5, 10, and 8 times respectively. What are the frequencies of these letters in the plaintext (in percentage)?",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequencies of the letters \"Q,\" \"Z,\" and \"X\" in the plaintext, we first need to know the total number of letters in the plaintext. However, this information is not provided in the problem. \n\nMonoalphabetic substitution ciphers involve replacing each letter in the plaintext with another letter in a one-to-one correspondence. The frequency of a specific letter in the ciphertext should be the same as the frequency of the corresponding letter in the plaintext. \n\nWithout knowing the total number of letters in the plaintext or the specific substitution used in the cipher, it is not possible to determine the exact frequencies of \"Q,\" \"Z,\" and \"X\" in the plaintext."
