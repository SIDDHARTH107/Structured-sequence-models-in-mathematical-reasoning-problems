    "message_1": "Suppose we have an elliptic curve over a finite field given by the equation y² = x³ + 2x + 1, where the finite field is defined as F11. Suppose that we have two points on the curve, P(2,6) and Q(3,10). Using elliptic curve addition, what is the resulting point R when we add P and Q together?",
    "message_2": "To add two points P and Q on an elliptic curve, we need to find the slope of the line passing through P and Q, and then find the third point of intersection of this line with the curve, which we will call R'. Finally, we reflect R' across the x-axis to get the resulting point R.\n\nSince P ≠ Q, we can use the following formula for the slope (m) of the line passing through P and Q:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p\n\nwhere P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2), and p is the characteristic of the finite field (in this case, p = 11).\n\nPlugging in the values for P and Q, we get:\n\nm = (10 - 6) * (3 - 2)^(-1) mod 11\nm = 4 * 1^(-1) mod 11\nm = 4 * 1 mod 11\nm = 4\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of R' using the following formulas:\n\nx3 = (m^2 - x1 - x2) mod p\ny3 = (m(x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx3 = (4^2 - 2 - 3) mod 11\nx3 = (16 - 5) mod 11\nx3 = 11 mod 11\nx3 = 0\n\ny3 = (4(2 - 0) - 6) mod 11\ny3 = (8 - 6) mod 11\ny3 = 2 mod 11\ny3 = 2\n\nSo, R' = (0, 2). Now, we reflect R' across the x-axis to get the resulting point R:\n\nR = (x3, -y3 mod p)\nR = (0, -2 mod 11)\nR = (0, 9)\n\nThus, the resulting point R when we add P and Q together is R = (0, 9)."
