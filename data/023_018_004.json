    "message_2": "To determine the frequency components of the output signal g(t), we need to find the Fourier transform of g(t). The Fourier transform of a function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫(f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt)\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of the function f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of the input signal f(t) = cos(2πt):\n\nF_f(ω) = ∫(cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt) dt)\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal g(t) = 2cos(2πt + π/4) + 3sin(6πt - π/3):\n\nF_g(ω) = ∫((2cos(2πt + π/4) + 3sin(6πt - π/3)) * e^(-jωt) dt)\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform properties to simplify the expressions:\n\n1. Linearity: F(a * f(t) + b * g(t)) = a * F(f(t)) + b * F(g(t))\n2. Time shift: F(f(t - t0)) = F(f(t)) * e^(-jωt0)\n\nApplying these properties, we get:\n\nF_f(ω) = (1/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\nF_g(ω) = (1/2) * [2 * e^(jπ/4) * δ(ω - 2π) + 2 * e^(-jπ/4) * δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/2j) * [3 * e^(jπ/3) * δ(ω - 6π) - 3 * e^(-jπ/3) * δ(ω + 6π)]\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) of the system, which is the ratio of the output signal's Fourier transform to the input signal's Fourier transform:\n\nH(ω) = F_g(ω) / F_f(ω)\n\nH(ω) = [(1/2) * [2 * e^(jπ/4) * δ(ω - 2π) + 2 * e^(-jπ/4) * δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/2j) * [3 * e^(jπ/3) * δ(ω - 6π) - 3 * e^(-jπ/3) * δ(ω + 6π)]] / [(1/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]]\n\nBy simplifying the expression, we get:\n\nH(ω) = e^(jπ/4) * δ(ω - 2π) + e^(-jπ/4) * δ(ω + 2π) + (3/j) * [e^(jπ/3) * δ(ω - 6π) - e^(-jπ/3) * δ(ω + 6π)]\n\nThe transfer function H(ω) shows that the system has two frequency components at ω = ±2π with a phase shift of ±π/4 and two frequency components at ω = ±6π with a phase shift of ±π/3."
