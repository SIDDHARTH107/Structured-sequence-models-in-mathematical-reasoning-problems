    "message_2": "First, let's find the period doubling sequence for the given function f(x) = -0.5x^2 + 0.8 with x₀ = 0.5.\n\n1. f(x₀) = f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5)^2 + 0.8 = 0.7\n2. f(f(x₀)) = f(0.7) = -0.5(0.7)^2 + 0.8 = 0.305\n3. f(f(f(x₀))) = f(0.305) = -0.5(0.305)^2 + 0.8 ≈ 0.733\n4. f(f(f(f(x₀)))) = f(0.733) = -0.5(0.733)^2 + 0.8 ≈ 0.566\n5. f(f(f(f(f(x₀))))) = f(0.566) = -0.5(0.566)^2 + 0.8 ≈ 0.680\n\nThe sequence does not seem to be periodic or converging to a fixed point. However, we cannot conclude that it is chaotic just by looking at a few iterations.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest value of r that leads to a chaotic sequence in the logistic map function g(x) = rx(1-x).\n\nThe logistic map is known to exhibit chaotic behavior when r is in the range of approximately 3.57 to 4. The smallest value of r that leads to a chaotic sequence is approximately r ≈ 3.57."
