In this graph, there are two cycles: (1-2-5-4-1) and (2-3-7-6-5-2). The graph has one connected component.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) is defined as follows:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x^(k(A) - k(G)) * y^(|A| - k(A)) * T_G(A)(x, y)\n\nwhere G is the graph, A is a subgraph of G, k(G) is the number of connected components in G, and k(A) is the number of connected components in A.\n\nWe can use the recursive deletion-contraction formula to compute the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y)\n\nwhere G-e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nLet's compute the Tutte polynomial for the given graph G:\n\n1. Choose edge e = (1, 2). Delete e to get G-e and contract e to get G/e:\n\nG-e:\n```\n      1    2 -- 3\n      |    |    |\n      4 -- 5    |\n           |   |\n           6 -- 7\n```\n\nG/e:\n```\n      1 -- 3\n      |    |\n      4 -- 5\n           |\n           6 -- 7\n```\n\n2. Compute the Tutte polynomials for G-e and G/e:\n\nT_{G-e}(x, y) = x^0 * y^6 = y^6\n\nT_{G/e}(x, y) = x^0 * y^5 = y^5\n\n3. Use the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y) = y^6 + y^5\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G is T_G(x, y) = y^6 + y^5."
