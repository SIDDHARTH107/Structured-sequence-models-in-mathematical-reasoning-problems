    "message_2": "To maximize the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 - 8x, we need to find the critical points where the first derivative is equal to zero. \n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x - 8\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 24x - 24\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the critical points. Newton's method formula is:\n\nx_new = x_old - f'(x_old) / f''(x_old)\n\nWe are given an initial guess of x = 1. Let's apply Newton's method:\n\nx_new = 1 - (12(1)^3 - 12(1)^2 - 24(1) - 8) / (36(1)^2 - 24(1) - 24)\nx_new = 1 - (-32 / -12)\nx_new = 1 - 2.67\nx_new ≈ -1.67\n\nNow, let's apply Newton's method one more time to get a more accurate result:\n\nx_new = -1.67 - (12(-1.67)^3 - 12(-1.67)^2 - 24(-1.67) - 8) / (36(-1.67)^2 - 24(-1.67) - 24)\nx_new ≈ -1.67 - (-0.01)\nx_new ≈ -1.66\n\nSince the result did not change significantly, we can assume that the critical point is approximately x ≈ -1.66.\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a maximum. We do this by checking the sign of the second derivative at this point:\n\nf''(-1.66) = 36(-1.66)^2 - 24(-1.66) - 24\nf''(-1.66) ≈ 48.62\n\nSince f''(-1.66) > 0, the critical point is a local minimum, not a maximum.\n\nHowever, we were asked to find the value of x that maximizes f(x). In this case, there is no local maximum for the given function. The function increases as x approaches positive infinity, so there is no maximum value for x."
