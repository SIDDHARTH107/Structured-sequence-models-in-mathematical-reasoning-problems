    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean (85%)\nZ = Z-score for 95% confidence interval (1.96)\nσ = standard deviation (10%)\nn = sample size (50)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 10 / √50 ≈ 1.414\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 1.414 ≈ 2.77\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = x̄ - ME = 85 - 2.77 ≈ 82.23\nUpper limit = x̄ + ME = 85 + 2.77 ≈ 87.77\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (82.23%, 87.77%)."
