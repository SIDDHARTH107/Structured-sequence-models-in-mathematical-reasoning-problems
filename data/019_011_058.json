What is the probability that (P and Q) are both true?\n2. What is the probability that (P or Q) is true, given that R is true?\n3. What is the probability that (P implies Q) is true, given that R is false?\n4. What is the probability that (P and Q) are both true, given that (P implies R) is true?\n\nNote: The answers to these questions depend on the specific definitions and logical connectives used in Relevance Logic, so make sure to provide enough context and instructions to the student.",
    "message_2": "Assuming that the propositions P, Q, and R are independent, we can solve the problems as follows:\n\n1. What is the probability that (P and Q) are both true?\n\nSince P and Q are independent, the probability of both being true is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(P and Q) = P(P) * P(Q) = 0.60 * 0.75 = 0.45 or 45%\n\n2. What is the probability that (P or Q) is true, given that R is true?\n\nTo find the probability of (P or Q) given R, we can use the formula:\n\nP(P or Q | R) = P((P or Q) and R) / P(R)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of (P or Q) and R:\n\nP((P or Q) and R) = P(P and R) + P(Q and R) - P((P and Q) and R)\n\nSince P, Q, and R are independent:\n\nP(P and R) = P(P) * P(R) = 0.60 * 0.50 = 0.30\nP(Q and R) = P(Q) * P(R) = 0.75 * 0.50 = 0.375\nP((P and Q) and R) = P(P and Q) * P(R) = 0.45 * 0.50 = 0.225\n\nNow, we can calculate P((P or Q) and R):\n\nP((P or Q) and R) = 0.30 + 0.375 - 0.225 = 0.45\n\nFinally, we can find P(P or Q | R):\n\nP(P or Q | R) = P((P or Q) and R) / P(R) = 0.45 / 0.50 = 0.90 or 90%\n\n3. What is the probability that (P implies Q) is true, given that R is false?\n\nIn classical logic, the implication (P implies Q) is false only when P is true and Q is false. Therefore, we can find the probability of (P implies Q) being true by finding the probability of it being false and subtracting it from 1.\n\nP(P implies Q) = 1 - P(P and not Q)\n\nSince P and Q are independent:\n\nP(P and not Q) = P(P) * P(not Q) = 0.60 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15\n\nNow, we can find the probability of (P implies Q) being true:\n\nP(P implies Q) = 1 - P(P and not Q) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 or 85%\n\nSince R is false in 50% of cases, and we are given that R is false, it does not affect the probability of (P implies Q) being true. Therefore, the probability remains the same:\n\nP(P implies Q | not R) = 85%\n\n4. What is the probability that (P and Q) are both true, given that (P implies R) is true?\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of (P implies R) being true. Using the same logic as in question 3:\n\nP(P implies R) = 1 - P(P and not R) = 1 - (0.60 * 0.50) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 or 70%\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of (P and Q) and (P implies R) both being true:\n\nP((P and Q) and (P implies R)) = P(P and Q) * P(P implies R | P and Q)\n\nSince (P implies R) is true when P and Q are both true, we have:\n\nP((P and Q) and (P implies R)) = P(P and Q) = 0.45\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of (P and Q) being true, given that (P implies R) is true:\n\nP(P and Q | P implies R) = P((P and Q) and (P implies R)) / P(P implies R) = 0.45 / 0.70 â‰ˆ 0.643 or 64.3%"
