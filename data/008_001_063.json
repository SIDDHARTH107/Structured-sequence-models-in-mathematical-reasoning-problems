    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we can use the inverse matrix method. First, we write the given system of equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  4 |\n    | 3 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    |  1 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv):\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -2) - (4 * 3) = -4 - 12 = -16\n\nadj(A) = | -2 -4 |\n         | -3  2 |\n\nA_inv = (-1/16) * | -2 -4 |\n                  | -3  2 |\n\nA_inv = | 1/8  1/4 |\n        | 3/16 -1/8 |\n\nNow, we multiply A_inv by B to get the values of x and y:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = | 1/8  1/4 | * | 10 |\n    | 3/16 -1/8 |   |  1 |\n\nx = (1/8 * 10) + (1/4 * 1) = 5/4\ny = (3/16 * 10) - (1/8 * 1) = 15/8 - 1/8 = 14/8 = 7/4\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 5/4 and y = 7/4."
