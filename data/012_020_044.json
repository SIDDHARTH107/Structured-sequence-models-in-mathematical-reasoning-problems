In this case, we have the following automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself: (1)(2)(3)\n2. The automorphism that swaps vertices 1 and 3: (13)(2)\n\nThus, the automorphism group of this graph is the group containing these two automorphisms, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S2 (the group of all permutations of two elements)."
