    "message_2": "First, we need to find out how many units each machine produces per day. We can do this by dividing the total units produced by the number of machines:\n\n2000 units / 10 machines = 200 units per machine per day\n\nNow that we know each machine produces 200 units per day, we can calculate how many more units will be produced with the addition of 2 more machines:\n\n2 machines * 200 units per machine per day = 400 units\n\nSo, with the addition of 2 more machines, the factory will be able to produce 400 more units of the product per day."
