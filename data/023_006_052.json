    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of F(w) = (4 - i10w) / (w^2 + 3w + 2), we first need to factor the denominator of the function.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as (w + 1)(w + 2). Now, we can perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nF(w) = A / (w + 1) + B / (w + 2)\n\n(4 - i10w) = A(w + 2) + B(w + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by substituting appropriate values for w:\n\n1. Let w = -1:\n(4 - i10(-1)) = A(-1 + 2)\n4 + 10i = A\nA = 4 + 10i\n\n2. Let w = -2:\n(4 - i10(-2)) = B(-2 + 1)\n4 + 20i = -B\nB = -4 - 20i\n\nNow, we have:\n\nF(w) = (4 + 10i) / (w + 1) - (4 + 20i) / (w + 2)\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier transform, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of each term separately:\n\n1. Inverse Fourier transform of (4 + 10i) / (w + 1):\n\nThis term is in the form of a standard inverse Fourier transform: F(w) = K / (w + a), where K is a complex constant and a is a real constant. The inverse Fourier transform of this term is given by:\n\nf(t) = K * e^(at)\n\nFor our term, K = 4 + 10i and a = -1. Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform is:\n\nf1(t) = (4 + 10i) * e^(-t)\n\n2. Inverse Fourier transform of -(4 + 20i) / (w + 2):\n\nSimilarly, for this term, K = -(4 + 20i) and a = -2. Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform is:\n\nf2(t) = -(4 + 20i) * e^(-2t)\n\nNow, we can find the total inverse Fourier transform by adding the inverse Fourier transforms of the individual terms:\n\nf(t) = f1(t) + f2(t)\nf(t) = (4 + 10i) * e^(-t) - (4 + 20i) * e^(-2t)\n\nSo, the time-domain signal f(t) is given by:\n\nf(t) = (4 + 10i) * e^(-t) - (4 + 20i) * e^(-2t)"
