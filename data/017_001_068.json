    "message_2": "To find a concrete isomorphism from G to either C4 or V4, we first need to determine the structure of G. Since G has order 4, there are only two possibilities for its structure: G is either a cyclic group of order 4 (isomorphic to C4) or a group with all elements of order 2 (isomorphic to V4).\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary element g in G, where g ≠ e (the identity element). If g has order 4, then G is a cyclic group generated by g, and G is isomorphic to C4. In this case, we can define the isomorphism φ: G → C4 as follows:\n\nφ(g^0) = 0\nφ(g^1) = 1\nφ(g^2) = 2\nφ(g^3) = 3\n\nThis is a concrete isomorphism since it maps each element of G to a unique element in C4, and it preserves the group operation.\n\nNow, let's assume that no element in G has order 4. In this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let g and h be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then, the group G must have the following elements: {e, g, h, gh}. Since g^2 = h^2 = e, and (gh)^2 = g^2h^2 = e, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nWe can define the isomorphism φ: G → V4 as follows:\n\nφ(e) = (0, 0)\nφ(g) = (1, 0)\nφ(h) = (0, 1)\nφ(gh) = (1, 1)\n\nThis is a concrete isomorphism since it maps each element of G to a unique element in V4, and it preserves the group operation.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found concrete isomorphisms from G to either C4 or V4, depending on the structure of G."
