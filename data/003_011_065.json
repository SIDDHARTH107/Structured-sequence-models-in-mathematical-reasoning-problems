Find the distance between the sailor and the top of the lighthouse, assuming that the sailor's eye level is $1.5$ meters above the ground. Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the lighthouse as $h$ meters, and the distance between the sailor and the top of the lighthouse as $d$ meters. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance between the sailor's eye level and the base of the lighthouse. Since the sailor is standing $85$ meters away from the lighthouse, and the lighthouse is $150$ meters away from the shore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the sailor's eye level and the base of the lighthouse:\n\n$$x^2 = 85^2 + 150^2$$\n$$x^2 = 7225 + 22500$$\n$$x^2 = 29725$$\n$$x = \\sqrt{29725}$$\n$$x \\approx 172.41$$\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the distance between the sailor and the top of the lighthouse:\n\n$$d^2 = x^2 + (h - 1.5)^2$$\n$$d^2 = 172.41^2 + (h - 1.5)^2$$\n\nWe don't have the height of the lighthouse, so we cannot find the exact value of $d$. However, if we are given the height of the lighthouse, we can plug it into the equation and solve for $d$."
