    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations. To do this, we can add the first and second equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 0\n2x - y + z = 0\n-------------------\n3x + y = 0 (Equation 1)\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. To do this, we can add 3 times the second equation to the third equation:\n\n3(2x - y + z) = 3(0)\n3x - y - 3z = 0\n-------------------\n9x - 4y = 0 (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n3x + y = 0\n9x - 4y = 0\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 4 and adding it to the second equation:\n\n4(3x + y) = 4(0)\n9x - 4y = 0\n-------------------\n21x = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find the value of y:\n\n3(0) + y = 0\ny = 0\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can substitute them back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. Let's use the first equation:\n\n0 + 2(0) - z = 0\n-z = 0\nz = 0\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
