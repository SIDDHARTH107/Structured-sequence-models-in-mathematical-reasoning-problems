    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(x) + √3sin(x) = 2, we can use the angle addition formula for sine and cosine functions. Let's rewrite the equation in the following form:\n\nsin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B) = sin(A+B)\n\nComparing this with our given equation, we can see that:\n\nA = x\nB = 60° (since sin(60°) = √3/2 and cos(60°) = 1/2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given equation as:\n\nsin(x)cos(60°) + cos(x)sin(60°) = sin(x+60°)\n\nSince we are given that 2cos(x) + √3sin(x) = 2, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\ncos(x) + (√3/2)sin(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite this as:\n\nsin(x)cos(60°) + cos(x)sin(60°) = sin(x+60°)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsin(x+60°) = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the range of 0° to 360° that satisfy this equation. The sine function equals 1 at 90°, so:\n\nx + 60° = 90°\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 90° - 60°\nx = 30°\n\nSo, the solution for x in the given equation is x = 30°."
