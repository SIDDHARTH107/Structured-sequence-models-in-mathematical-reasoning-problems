    "message_2": "First, let's recall Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra:\n\nLiouville's theorem: Every bounded entire function (i.e., a function that is holomorphic on the entire complex plane and is bounded) is constant.\n\nFundamental theorem of algebra: Every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.\n\nNow, let's consider the given polynomial $p(z)$ of degree $n$ with complex coefficients satisfying $|p(z)|\\leq M$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$. Since $p(z)$ is a polynomial, it is an entire function. Moreover, it is bounded by the given condition. Therefore, by Liouville's theorem, $p(z)$ must be a constant function.\n\nHowever, if $p(z)$ is a constant function, its degree is 0. Thus, the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{0}$."
