    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by repeatedly removing the middle third of a line segment. In this case, the initial length of the piece of wood is 80 cm. After each removal, the remaining length is multiplied by 2/3. To find the length of the Cantor set after infinitely many removals, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the initial term (80 cm) and r is the common ratio (2/3).\n\nSum = 80 / (1 - 2/3)\n\nSum = 80 / (1/3)\n\nSum = 80 * 3\n\nSum = 240 cm\n\nSo, the length of the Cantor set that will be obtained after infinitely many removals is 0 cm, as the sum of the remaining segments converges to 0."
