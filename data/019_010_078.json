    "message_1": "Suppose there are three statements made by three people - Alice, Bob, and Cathy - about a certain mathematical concept, and two of these statements are true. Using linear logic, determine which individual made the false statement:\n\n1. Bob or Cathy made the false statement.\n2. If Cathy didn't make the false statement, then Alice did.\n3. If Bob made the false statement, then Cathy did not.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. If Alice's statement is true, then Bob or Cathy made the false statement.\n2. If Bob's statement is true, then either Cathy made the false statement or Alice did (since Cathy didn't).\n3. If Cathy's statement is true, then if Bob made the false statement, Cathy did not.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Alice's statement is false, then it would mean that neither Bob nor Cathy made the false statement, which is a contradiction since we know that two statements are true and one is false. Therefore, Alice's statement must be true.\n\n- If Bob's statement is false, then Cathy must have made the false statement (since Alice's statement is true). But this would mean that both Bob and Cathy made false statements, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Bob's statement must be true.\n\n- Since Alice's and Bob's statements are true, Cathy's statement must be the false one. So, Cathy made the false statement."
