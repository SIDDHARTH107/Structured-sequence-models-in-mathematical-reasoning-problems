    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log(x+3) - log(x-2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the quotient rule of logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog((x+3)/(x-2)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n\n(x+3)/(x-2) = 10^2\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n(x+3)/(x-2) = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 3 = 100(x - 2)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 3 = 100x - 200\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we have:\n\n3 = 99x - 200\n\nAdding 200 to both sides, we get:\n\n203 = 99x\n\nFinally, dividing by 99, we find the value of x:\n\nx = 203/99\n\nSo, the solution to the logarithmic equation log(x+3) - log(x-2) = 2 is x = 203/99."
