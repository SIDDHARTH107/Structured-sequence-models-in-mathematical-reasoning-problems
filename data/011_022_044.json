    "message_1": "Suppose a thief has broken into a museum and is trying to steal some artifacts. The thief has a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 10 kilograms. The artifacts have the following weights and values:\n\n- Artifact A: 2 kg, $1000\n- Artifact B: 5 kg, $4500\n- Artifact C: 3 kg, $3000\n- Artifact D: 7 kg, $6000\n\nWhat is the maximum value of artifacts that the thief can steal given the constraints of the knapsack capacity? Use the 0/1 knapsack problem to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve the 0/1 knapsack problem, we will create a table with rows representing the artifacts and columns representing the knapsack capacity from 0 to 10 kg. We will fill the table by comparing the value of including the current artifact with the value of excluding it.\n\nThe table will look like this:\n\n```\n  | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n--+-------------------------------\nA | 0  0 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000\nB | 0  0 1000 1000 1000 4500 4500 5500 5500 5500 5500\nC | 0  0 1000 3000 3000 4500 4500 5500 7500 7500 7500\nD | 0  0 1000 3000 3000 4500 4500 6000 7500 7500 8500\n```\n\nHere's how the table is filled:\n\n- For artifact A, since its weight is 2 kg, we can only start filling the table from column 2. The value remains the same for all columns after 2, as we can either include or exclude A.\n- For artifact B, we compare the value of including B with the value of excluding it. If we include B, the knapsack capacity reduces to 5-5=0 kg, and the value becomes 4500. If we exclude B, the value remains the same as the previous row (A). So, we choose the maximum of the two values for each column.\n- We follow the same process for artifacts C and D.\n\nThe maximum value that the thief can steal given the constraints of the knapsack capacity is $8500, which can be achieved by stealing artifacts A, B, and D."
