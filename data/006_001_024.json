    "message_1": "If two fair coins are flipped simultaneously, what is the probability of getting at least one head?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least one head, we can first find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., getting no heads or both tails) and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThere are 4 possible outcomes when flipping two fair coins: HH, HT, TH, and TT. The probability of each outcome is 1/4 since there are 4 equally likely outcomes.\n\nThe probability of getting both tails (TT) is 1/4. Therefore, the probability of getting at least one head is the complement of this event:\n\nP(at least one head) = 1 - P(both tails) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one head when flipping two fair coins is 3/4 or 75%."
