    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime divisors.\n2. A group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, is called a p-group.\n3. The number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n is determined by the number of partitions of n.\n\nNow, let's find the prime factorization of 96:\n\n96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n\nSo, we have a 2-group of order 2^5 and a 3-group of order 3^1.\n\nNow, let's find the number of partitions for each power:\n\nFor 2^5, the partitions of 5 are {5}, {4, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 1}, {2, 1, 1, 1}, and {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}. There are 7 partitions.\n\nFor 3^1, the only partition of 1 is {1}. There is 1 partition.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n * q^m:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = (number of partitions of p^n) * (number of partitions of q^m)\n\nIn our case:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = (7) * (1) = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
