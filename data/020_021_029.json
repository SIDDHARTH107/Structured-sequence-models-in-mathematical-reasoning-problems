    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to produce two types of products - Product A and Product B. The production of each product takes 3 hours and 2 hours, respectively. The company has a total of 80 hours of production time available for the week. \n\nProduct A sells for $50 per unit, while product B sells for $30 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit for the week. How many units of each product should the company produce to achieve the maximum profit, and what is the maximum profit that can be earned?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe time constraint can be represented as:\n3x + 2y ≤ 80\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 50x + 30y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we need to find the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we find the feasible region:\n3x + 2y ≤ 80\ny ≥ 0\nx ≥ 0\n\nRearranging the time constraint equation for y:\ny ≤ (80 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. The vertices are the points where the constraint lines intersect. In this case, there are three vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0) - intersection of x = 0 and y = 0\n2. (0, 40) - intersection of x = 0 and y = (80 - 3x) / 2\n3. (26.67, 0) - intersection of x = (80 - 2y) / 3 and y = 0\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(0, 40) = 50(0) + 30(40) = $1200\nP(26.67, 0) = 50(26.67) + 30(0) = $1333.50\n\nThe maximum profit is $1333.50, which occurs when the company produces 26.67 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they should produce 26 units of Product A and 1 unit of Product B. This will result in a profit of:\n\nP(26, 1) = 50(26) + 30(1) = $1310"
