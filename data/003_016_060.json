    "message_2": "I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Let's re-evaluate the phase shift for the given function y = 4cos(3x - π/2).\n\nThe general form of a cosine function with phase shift is y = A cos (B(x - C)) + D, where A, B, C, and D are constants.\n\nIn our given function, A = 4, B = 3, and the term inside the cosine function is (3x - π/2). To find the phase shift, we need to rewrite this term in the form B(x - C).\n\n3x - π/2 = 3(x - π/6)\n\nNow, comparing this with the general form, we can see that the phase shift is C = π/6.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the given function y = 4cos(3x - π/2) is π/6."
