    "message_2": "Let the number be x. We are given that:\n\nx = 6a - 7 (where a is a multiple of 6)\nx = 19b - 17 (where b is a multiple of 19)\n\nNow, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n6a - 7 = 19b - 17\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate a:\n\n6a = 19b - 10\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer values of a and b that satisfy this equation. We can do this by trying different values of b and checking if the result is divisible by 6:\n\nFor b = 1:\n6a = 19(1) - 10 = 9 (not divisible by 6)\n\nFor b = 2:\n6a = 19(2) - 10 = 28 (not divisible by 6)\n\nFor b = 3:\n6a = 19(3) - 10 = 47 (not divisible by 6)\n\nFor b = 4:\n6a = 19(4) - 10 = 66 (divisible by 6)\n\nSo, when b = 4, we have:\n\n6a = 66\na = 11\n\nNow, we can use either equation to find the value of x:\n\nx = 6a - 7 = 6(11) - 7 = 66 - 7 = 59\n\nTherefore, the number is 59."
