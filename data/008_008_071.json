    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has 1200 pounds of raw material available each day. Both products require raw materials as follows:\n\n• Product A requires 3 pounds of raw material and takes 0.5 hours of labor to produce. The profit on each unit of Product A is $9.\n\n• Product B requires 4 pounds of raw material and takes 0.4 hours of labor to produce. The profit on each unit of Product B is $10.\n\nAssuming that the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should the company produce in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 1200 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 9x + 10y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation for the constraint:\n\n3x + 4y = 1200\ny = (1200 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we can plot the constraint and find the feasible region. Since x and y must be non-negative, the feasible region is in the first quadrant. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 300), (400, 0), and (240, 240).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 9(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 300) = 9(0) + 10(300) = $3000\n3. Profit at (400, 0) = 9(400) + 10(0) = $3600\n4. Profit at (240, 240) = 9(240) + 10(240) = $4560\n\nThe maximum profit is $4560, which occurs when the company produces 240 units of Product A and 240 units of Product B."
