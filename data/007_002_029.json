    "message_2": "To find the smallest natural number that is divisible by 10, 12, and 15, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nPrime factorization of the numbers:\n10 = 2 * 5\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n15 = 3 * 5\n\nNow, we find the LCM by taking the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers:\nLCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nSo, the smallest natural number that is divisible by 10, 12, and 15 is 60."
