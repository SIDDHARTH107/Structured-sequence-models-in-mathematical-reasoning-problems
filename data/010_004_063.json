    "message_2": "The function f: X -> Y is not continuous. To show this, we can use the definition of continuity. A function is continuous at a point x₀ if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x in the domain, if |x - x₀| < δ, then |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε.\n\nConsider any point x₀ in X. If x₀ is rational, then f(x₀) = 0. If x₀ is irrational, then f(x₀) = 1. In either case, let ε = 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find a δ > 0 such that for all x in X, if |x - x₀| < δ, then |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε. However, this is not possible. No matter how small we choose δ, there will always be both rational and irrational numbers within the interval (x₀ - δ, x₀ + δ). This is because both rational and irrational numbers are dense in the real numbers.\n\nSo, for any x in the interval (x₀ - δ, x₀ + δ), we will have either |f(x) - f(x₀)| = 0 or |f(x) - f(x₀)| = 1. In both cases, |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≥ ε, which contradicts the definition of continuity.\n\nTherefore, the function f: X -> Y is not continuous."
