    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the first two principal components for a given data set. Let's say that the data set comprises of the following values:\n\n- 4, 5, 6\n- 3, 2, 1\n- 8, 7, 9\n- 12, 11, 10\n\nWhat are the first two principal components of this data set?",
    "message_2": "To find the first two principal components of the given data set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each variable (column).\n2. Center the data by subtracting the mean from each value.\n3. Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data.\n4. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n5. Sort the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in descending order.\n6. Select the first two eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues as the first two principal components.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each variable:\n   Mean of the first variable (X1): (4 + 3 + 8 + 12) / 4 = 6.75\n   Mean of the second variable (X2): (5 + 2 + 7 + 11) / 4 = 6.25\n   Mean of the third variable (X3): (6 + 1 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 6.5\n\n2. Center the data:\n   Centered data set:\n   - (4-6.75, 5-6.25, 6-6.5) = (-2.75, -1.25, -0.5)\n   - (3-6.75, 2-6.25, 1-6.5) = (-3.75, -4.25, -5.5)\n   - (8-6.75, 7-6.25, 9-6.5) = (1.25, 0.75, 2.5)\n   - (12-6.75, 11-6.25, 10-6.5) = (5.25, 4.75, 3.5)\n\n3. Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data:\n   Covariance matrix:\n   |  12.9167,  12.5833,  11.25   |\n   |  12.5833,  12.9167,  11.5833 |\n   |  11.25  ,  11.5833,  10.9167 |\n\n4. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix:\n   Eigenvalues: λ1 ≈ 35.4706, λ2 ≈ 0.3628, λ3 ≈ 0.9167\n   Eigenvectors: \n   - v1 ≈ (-0.5774, -0.5774, -0.5774)\n   - v2 ≈ (0.8165, -0.4082, -0.4082)\n   - v3 ≈ (0.0000, -0.7071, 0.7071)\n\n5. Sort the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in descending order:\n   Sorted eigenvalues: λ1 ≈ 35.4706, λ2 ≈ 0.9167, λ3 ≈ 0.3628\n   Sorted eigenvectors: \n   - v1 ≈ (-0.5774, -0.5774, -0.5774)\n   - v3 ≈ (0.0000, -0.7071, 0.7071)\n   - v2 ≈ (0.8165, -0.4082, -0.4082)\n\n6. Select the first two eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues as the first two principal components:\n   First principal component (PC1): (-0.5774, -0.5774, -0.5774)\n   Second principal component (PC2): (0.0000, -0.7071, 0.7071)\n\nSo, the first two principal components of this data set are:\nPC1: (-0.5774, -0.5774, -0.5774)\nPC2: (0.0000, -0.7071, 0.7071)"
