    "message_1": "A building 60 feet tall casts a shadow that is 75 feet long. What is the angle of elevation of the sun? (Assuming the ground is level and the sun is directly above the building)",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation of the sun, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the building (60 feet), and the adjacent side is the length of the shadow (75 feet).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(angle) = 60/75\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse tangent (arctangent) of this ratio to find the angle:\n\nangle = arctan(60/75)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nangle â‰ˆ 38.66 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of elevation of the sun is approximately 38.66 degrees."
