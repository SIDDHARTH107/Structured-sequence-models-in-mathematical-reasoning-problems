    "message_1": "If the probability that a certain type of traffic accident occurs on a road is 0.05, and there are 10 accidents reported on that road every year, what is the expected number of accidents of this certain type that will occur on the road per year?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents of this certain type that will occur on the road per year, we can multiply the total number of accidents reported per year by the probability of this certain type of accident occurring.\n\nExpected number of accidents of this certain type = Total number of accidents per year * Probability of this certain type of accident\n\nExpected number of accidents of this certain type = 10 * 0.05\n\nExpected number of accidents of this certain type = 0.5\n\nSo, the expected number of accidents of this certain type that will occur on the road per year is 0.5."
