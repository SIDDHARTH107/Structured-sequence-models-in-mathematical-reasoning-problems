    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we first need to find the velocity function, and then take its derivative to get the acceleration function. Since the car is speeding up from 0 km/h to 100 km/h in 10 seconds, we can assume a constant acceleration. Let v(t) be the velocity function and a(t) be the acceleration function.\n\nGiven:\nInitial velocity, v(0) = 0 km/h\nFinal velocity, v(10) = 100 km/h\nTime interval, t = 10 seconds\n\nFirst, we need to convert the velocities from km/h to m/s:\n0 km/h = 0 * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 0 m/s\n100 km/h = 100 * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) ≈ 27.78 m/s\n\nNow, we have:\nv(0) = 0 m/s\nv(10) = 27.78 m/s\n\nSince the acceleration is constant, we can write the velocity function as:\nv(t) = a * t + v(0)\n\nAt t = 10 seconds:\n27.78 = a * 10\n\nSolving for a:\na = 27.78 / 10\na ≈ 2.778 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of the car is approximately 2.778 m/s^2."
