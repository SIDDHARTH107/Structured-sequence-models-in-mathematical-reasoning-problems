    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x^3$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 6x^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n$2x - 6x^2 = 0$\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we find that $y = 0$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$2x - 6x^2 = 0$\n$x(2 - 6x) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{3}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the Morse index of each critical point. The Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix is given by the second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 - 12x & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor the critical point $(0, 0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are 4 and 2, both of which are positive. Therefore, the Morse index of the critical point $(0, 0)$ is 0.\n\nFor the critical point $(\\frac{1}{3}, 0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H(f)(\\frac{1}{3}, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are -4 and 2, with one negative eigenvalue. Therefore, the Morse index of the critical point $(\\frac{1}{3}, 0)$ is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x^3$ are $(0, 0)$ with Morse index 0 and $(\\frac{1}{3}, 0)$ with Morse index 1."
