    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of sets A, B, and A, we will first find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the Cartesian product of the resulting set with A. Let's denote the Cartesian product of two sets X and Y as X × Y.\n\n1. A × B: This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n\n2.

B × A: This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A.\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2)}\n\n4. (B × A) × B: This is the set of all ordered pairs ((b, a), b') where (b, a) ∈ (B × A) and b' ∈ B.\n(B × A) × B = {((3, 1), 3), ((3, 1), 4), ((3, 1), 5), ((3, 2), 3), ((3, 2), 4), ((3, 2), 5), ((4, 1), 3), ((4, 1), 4), ((4, 1), 5), ((4, 2), 3), ((4, 2), 4), ((4, 2), 5), ((5, 1), 3), ((5, 1), 4), ((5, 1), 5), ((5, 2), 3), ((5, 2), 4), ((5, 2), 5)}\n\nFinally, let's find the Cartesian product of A and A, and then find the Cartesian product of the resulting set with B.\n\n5. A × A: This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, a') where a, a' ∈ A.\nA × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\n6. (A × A) × B: This is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, a'), b) where (a, a') ∈ (A × A) and b ∈ B.\n(A × A) × B = {((1, 1), 3), ((1, 1), 4), ((1, 1), 5), ((1, 2), 3), ((1, 2), 4), ((1, 2), 5), ((2, 1), 3), ((2, 1), 4), ((2, 1), 5), ((2, 2), 3), ((2, 2), 4), ((2, 2), 5)}\n\nNow, let's compare the three sets we found: (A × B) × A, (B × A) × B, and (A × A) × B. We can see that these sets are not equal, as they contain different ordered pairs. Therefore, the three different sets that result from the Cartesian product of A, B, and A respectively are not equal."
