What is the intersection of A and its complement, A̅, with respect to U? Show that the intersection is the empty set using the set theory concepts learned in class.",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection of A and its complement A̅ with respect to U, we first need to define the complement of A. The complement of A, denoted as A̅, is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A.\n\nSince U contains all positive integers and A contains the first five positive even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, the complement of A, A̅, will contain all positive integers except for the numbers in A.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and A̅, denoted as A ∩ A̅. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nBy definition, A and A̅ have no elements in common, as A̅ contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, there are no common elements between A and A̅.\n\nThus, the intersection of A and A̅ is the empty set, denoted as ∅. In set theory notation, we can write this as:\n\nA ∩ A̅ = ∅\n\nThis shows that the intersection of A and its complement A̅ with respect to U is the empty set, using the set theory concepts learned in class."
