    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 participants in a beauty contest. Each participant is required to select a number between 0 and 100, inclusive. The winner of the contest will be the participant whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all selected numbers. What number should you select to maximize your chances of winning the contest?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the average of all selected numbers as A. The target number to be closest to is (2/3)A. Since all participants are selecting numbers between 0 and 100, the maximum possible value for A is 100 (if everyone selects 100) and the minimum possible value for A is 0 (if everyone selects 0).\n\nHowever, if we assume that all participants are rational and aiming to maximize their chances of winning, they would also select numbers less than or equal to (2/3)100, which is approximately 66.67. This is because selecting a number greater than 66.67 would not bring them closer to the target number (2/3)A.\n\nNow, if all participants select numbers less than or equal to 66.67, the new maximum possible value for A becomes 66.67. Therefore, the new target number to be closest to is (2/3)66.67, which is approximately 44.44.\n\nThis process can be repeated iteratively, with each iteration assuming that all participants are rational and aiming to maximize their chances of winning. However, this can lead to an infinite loop of reasoning.\n\nA more practical approach is to assume that not all participants are perfectly rational, and their choices will be distributed across the range of 0 to 100. In this case, selecting a number close to (2/3) of the expected average of the distribution would be a reasonable strategy.\n\nIf we assume that the average of the selected numbers will be around 50 (as a midpoint of the range 0 to 100), then selecting a number close to (2/3)50, which is approximately 33.33, would be a reasonable choice to maximize your chances of winning the contest."
