    "message_1": "Assume that in a magic show, a magician has a deck of cards with 26 black cards and 26 red cards, and they shuffle the deck. What is the probability that the top card drawn from the deck is a black card? Round your answer to three decimal places.",
    "message_2": "There are a total of 52 cards in the deck (26 black cards and 26 red cards). To find the probability of drawing a black card from the top, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 26 (since there are 26 black cards), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (since there are 52 cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a black card from the top is:\n\nProbability = 26 / 52\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 1 / 2\n\nAs a decimal, this is equal to 0.5. Rounded to three decimal places, the probability is 0.500."
