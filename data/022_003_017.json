    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed contour in that domain is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 + 3z - 7 is a polynomial, and polynomials are analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic in the domain containing the circular contour C: |z-2| = 3.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic in the domain containing the contour C, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) over the contour C is zero.\n\nSo, the value of the integral of the function f(z) = z^2 + 3z - 7 over the circular contour C: |z-2| = 3, traversed counterclockwise, is 0."
