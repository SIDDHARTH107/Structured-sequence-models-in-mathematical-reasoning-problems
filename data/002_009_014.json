    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(10 + 5)\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 10π(15)\nSurface Area = 150π\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder is 150π square centimeters. If you want to get an approximate numerical value, you can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 150 * 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 471 cm²"
