    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to radioactive decay and half-life equations:\n\nSuppose you have 100 milligrams of a radioactive substance with a half-life of 30 days. How much of the substance will be left after 90 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 milligrams, the half-life is 30 days, and the time elapsed is 90 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^(90 / 30)\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 12.5 milligrams\n\nSo after 90 days, there will be 12.5 milligrams of the radioactive substance left."
