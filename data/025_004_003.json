    "message_2": "To find the equation of the rational curve passing through the points (0,0), (1,1), and (3,7) in the projective plane, we first need to convert these points to homogeneous coordinates. In the projective plane, a point (x, y) is represented as (x, y, 1). So, the homogeneous coordinates of the given points are:\n\nP1 = (0, 0, 1)\nP2 = (1, 1, 1)\nP3 = (3, 7, 1)\n\nNow, let's assume the rational curve is represented by the equation:\n\nF(x, y, z) = Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Exz + Fyz = 0\n\nWe can plug in the homogeneous coordinates of the given points into this equation:\n\nF(0, 0, 1) = C = 0 (since the curve passes through P1)\nF(1, 1, 1) = A + B + D + E + F = 0 (since the curve passes through P2)\nF(3, 7, 1) = 9A + 49B + 9D + 3E + 7F = 0 (since the curve passes through P3)\n\nWe have three equations and five unknowns (A, B, D, E, F). However, since the curve is a rational curve, we can scale the coefficients by a constant factor, so we can set one of the coefficients to a convenient value. Let's set A = 1:\n\n1 + B + D + E + F = 0\n9 + 49B + 9D + 3E + 7F = 0\n\nNow we have two equations and four unknowns (B, D, E, F). We can solve these equations for B and D in terms of E and F:\n\nB = -1 - D - E - F\n49(-1 - D - E - F) + 9D + 3E + 7F = 9\n\nSubstituting B back into the equation, we get:\n\n-49 - 49D - 49E - 49F + 9D + 3E + 7F = 9\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n-40D - 46E - 42F = 58\n\nNow, we can choose a convenient value for one of the remaining variables, say E = 1:\n\n-40D - 46 - 42F = 58\n\nSolving for D in terms of F:\n\nD = (-104 - 42F) / 40\n\nNow, we have B, D, and E in terms of F:\n\nB = -1 - D - E - F = -1 - (-104 - 42F) / 40 - 1 - F\nD = (-104 - 42F) / 40\nE = 1\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation of the curve:\n\nF(x, y, z) = x^2 + By^2 + Dxy + xz + Fyz = 0\n\nF(x, y, z) = x^2 + (-1 - (-104 - 42F) / 40 - 1 - F)y^2 + ((-104 - 42F) / 40)xy + xz + Fyz = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the rational curve passing through the points (0,0), (1,1), and (3,7) in the projective plane, where F is a free parameter."
