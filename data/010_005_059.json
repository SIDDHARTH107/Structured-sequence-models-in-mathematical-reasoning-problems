    "message_2": "A topological space X is path-connected if for every pair of points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nLet's consider the points a and e in X. We want to find a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = a and f(1) = e. Suppose such a function exists. Since f is continuous, the preimage of any open set in X must be open in [0, 1].\n\nNow, consider the open set {a, b, e} in X. The preimage of this set under f must be open in [0, 1]. Since f(0) = a and f(1) = e, the preimage must contain 0 and 1. However, the only open sets in [0, 1] containing both 0 and 1 are [0, 1] itself and the empty set. If the preimage is the empty set, then f cannot map 0 and 1 to a and e, respectively. If the preimage is [0, 1], then f must map the entire interval [0, 1] to the set {a, b, e}, which means that f cannot be a path from a to e, as it does not pass through the open set {c, d}.\n\nTherefore, no such continuous function f exists, and the topological space X is not path-connected."
