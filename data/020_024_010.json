    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a certain product at a cost of $50 per unit. The demand for the product is given by the equation Q = 5000 â€“ 50P, where P is the price per unit in dollars and Q is the quantity demanded per week. What price should the company charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "message_2": "To maximize revenue, we need to find the price P that maximizes the product of price and quantity demanded (R = PQ). We are given the demand function Q = 5000 - 50P. \n\nFirst, let's express the revenue R in terms of P:\nR(P) = P(5000 - 50P)\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by taking the derivative of R(P) with respect to P and setting it equal to 0:\ndR/dP = 5000 - 100P = 0\n\nSolving for P:\n100P = 5000\nP = 50\n\nSo, the price that maximizes revenue is $50 per unit."
