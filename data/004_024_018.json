    "message_2": "To find dy/dx, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) = d/dx (25)\n\nUsing the chain rule for the second term, we get:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 3. We can do this by plugging x = 3 into the original equation:\n\n(3)^2 + y^2 = 25\n9 + y^2 = 25\ny^2 = 16\ny = Â±4\n\nSince y is a function of x, we must choose only one value for y. In this case, we'll choose the positive value, y = 4. (Note: If the problem specified a particular quadrant or other conditions, we might choose a different value for y.)\n\nNow, we'll plug x = 3 and y = 4 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(4)(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx:\n\n6 + 8(dy/dx) = 0\n8(dy/dx) = -6\ndy/dx = -6/8\ndy/dx = -3/4\n\nSo, when x = 3, dy/dx = -3/4."
