    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n-2(x + y + z) = -2(8)\n-2x - 2y - 2z = -16\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n\n(2x + 3y + 4z) + (-2x - 2y - 2z) = 23 + (-16)\ny + 2z = 7 (1)\n\nNext, multiply the first equation by -3 and add it to the third equation:\n\n-3(x + y + z) = -3(8)\n-3x - 3y - 3z = -24\n\nNow, add this to the third equation:\n\n(3x + 4y + 5z) + (-3x - 3y - 3z) = 31 + (-24)\ny + 2z = 7 (2)\n\nNow, we have two identical equations (1) and (2). This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they depend on the value of one of the variables (in this case, z). \n\nTo find the general solution, we can express y in terms of z:\n\ny = 7 - 2z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y back into the first equation:\n\nx + (7 - 2z) + z = 8\nx - z = 1\n\nNow, express x in terms of z:\n\nx = 1 + z\n\nThe general solution for this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1 + z\ny = 7 - 2z\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
