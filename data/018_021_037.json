    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B, but not both}\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A △ B) with the set {6, 10, 12}.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {6, 10, 12} = {10, 12}\n\nNow, we need to verify that the result satisfies the distributive property of symmetric difference over intersection. The distributive property states that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\nA △ (B ∩ C) = (A △ B) ∩ (A △ C)\n\nLet C = {6, 10, 12}. We need to find B ∩ C, A △ (B ∩ C), A △ B, A △ C, and (A △ B) ∩ (A △ C).\n\nB ∩ C = {6, 12}\n\nA △ (B ∩ C) = A △ {6, 12} = {2, 4, 8, 10}\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12} (already calculated)\n\nA △ C = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\n(A △ B) ∩ (A △ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12} ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {2, 4, 8}\n\nSince A △ (B ∩ C) = {2, 4, 8, 10} and (A △ B) ∩ (A △ C) = {2, 4, 8}, the distributive property of symmetric difference over intersection does not hold for these specific sets A, B, and C."
