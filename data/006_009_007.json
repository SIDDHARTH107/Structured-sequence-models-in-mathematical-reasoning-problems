    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person from this population will have the condition, we need to divide the number of people with the condition by the total population.\n\nProbability = (Number of people with the condition) / (Total population)\n\nProbability = 500 / 10,000\n\nProbability = 0.05\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person from this population will have the condition is 0.05 or 5%."
