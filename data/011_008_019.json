    "message_1": "Suppose there are 7 different basketballs to be divided equally among 3 basketball players. In how many ways can we distribute the basketballs so that each player receives at least 1 basketball?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. We have 7 basketballs (stars) and we want to divide them among 3 players (using 2 bars). Since each player must receive at least 1 basketball, we can give 1 basketball to each player and then distribute the remaining 4 basketballs among the 3 players.\n\nNow, we have 4 basketballs (stars) and 2 bars to divide them among the 3 players. The problem now becomes arranging these 4 stars and 2 bars in a row.\n\nThere are a total of (4+2) = 6 positions, and we need to choose 2 positions for the bars. This can be done in C(6,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n       = 6! / (2! * 4!)\n       = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n       = (6 * 5) / 2\n       = 30 / 2\n       = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to distribute the 7 basketballs among the 3 players so that each player receives at least 1 basketball."
