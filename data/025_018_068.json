If the degree of L is d, then show that the number of effective divisors of degree at most k on X is bounded above by (d+k)^(g-1), where g is the genus of X. \n\nIf d=3, k=4, and g=2, then what is the upper bound for the number of effective divisors of degree at most 4 on X?",
    "message_2": "To show that the number of effective divisors of degree at most k on X is bounded above by (d+k)^(g-1), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles bounded by D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of D.\n\nNow, let D be an effective divisor of degree at most k on X. Then, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g.\n\nSince D is effective, l(D) ≥ 1. Also, since L is ample, there exists a positive integer n such that L - nK is effective. Thus, for any effective divisor D, we have:\n\nl(K - D) ≤ l(nK - D) ≤ l(L - nK) ≤ l(L).\n\nNow, let's bound l(L). Since L is ample, there exists a positive integer m such that L^m has a global section s that does not vanish identically on X. Then, we have:\n\nl(L) = l(L^m) = l(mL) ≤ m deg(L) + 1 - g = m(d + 1 - g).\n\nCombining the inequalities, we get:\n\n1 ≤ l(D) ≤ m(d + 1 - g) + g - 1.\n\nSince D has degree at most k, we have:\n\ndeg(D) ≤ d + k.\n\nTherefore, the number of effective divisors of degree at most k on X is bounded above by (d+k)^(g-1).\n\nNow, let's find the upper bound for the number of effective divisors of degree at most 4 on X when d=3, k=4, and g=2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(3+4)^(2-1) = 7^1 = 7.\n\nSo, the upper bound for the number of effective divisors of degree at most 4 on X is 7."
