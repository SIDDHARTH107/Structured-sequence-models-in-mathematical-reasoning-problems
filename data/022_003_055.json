    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Cauchy-Goursat theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a simple closed curve is zero. \n\nFirst, let's check if the function f(z) = z^2 + 3z - 5 is analytic. A function is analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function f(z) is a polynomial, and polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic.\n\nNow, let's consider the curve C, which is the circle |z - 2| = 3. Since f(z) is analytic and C is a simple closed curve, we can apply the Cauchy-Goursat theorem. \n\nAccording to the theorem, the integral of f(z) over the curve C is zero:\n\nâˆ®(z^2 + 3z - 5) dz = 0"
