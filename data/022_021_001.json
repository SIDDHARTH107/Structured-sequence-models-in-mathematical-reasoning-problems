Plugging in our function into the definition, we get:\n\nF(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st)te^(2t) dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(s) = ∫[0, ∞] te^((2-s)t) dt\n\nTo use the residue theorem, we will first rewrite the integral as a contour integral over a Bromwich contour, which is a vertical line in the complex plane that starts at t=0 and goes to t=∞, and then closes with a semi-circle at infinity:\n\nF(s) = ∫[C] te^((2-s)t) dt\n\nNow, we need to find the poles of the integrand. The integrand has a simple pole at t = 0. We can find the residue at this pole by taking the limit as t approaches 0:\n\nResidue = lim (t→0) t * e^((2-s)t)\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule:\n\nResidue = lim (t→0) (d/dt (t)) / (d/dt (e^(-st)e^(-2t)))\n\nResidue = lim (t→0) 1 / (-se^(-st)e^(-2t) - 2e^(-st)e^(-2t))\n\nResidue = lim (t→0) 1 / (e^(-st)e^(-2t)(-s - 2))\n\nResidue = 1 / (-s - 2)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the contour integral:\n\nF(s) = 2πi * (1 / (-s - 2))\n\nF(s) = -2πi / (s + 2)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = te^(2t) is:\n\nL{te^(2t)}(s) = -2πi / (s + 2)"
