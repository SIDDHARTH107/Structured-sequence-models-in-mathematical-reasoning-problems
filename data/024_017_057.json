    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C at any point t. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt)\n\nNow, let's find the derivatives:\n\ndx/dt = d(3t)/dt = 3\ndy/dt = d(t^2 - 1)/dt = 2t\ndz/dt = d(2t - 3)/dt = 2\n\nSo, T(t) = (3, 2t, 2)\n\nNext, we need to find the values of t corresponding to the initial and final points:\n\nInitial point (0, -1, -3): t = 0 (since x(0) = 0, y(0) = -1, and z(0) = -3)\nFinal point (3, 8, 3): t = 1 (since x(1) = 3, y(1) = 8, and z(1) = 3)\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C from t = 0 to t = 1. The parallel transport condition states that the vector v should remain parallel to itself along the curve, which means that the derivative of v with respect to t should be orthogonal (perpendicular) to the tangent vector T(t) at every point along the curve.\n\nLet v(t) = (a(t), b(t), c(t)) be the parallel transported vector along the curve. The condition for parallel transport is:\n\nv'(t) = (da/dt, db/dt, dc/dt) = k * T(t) = (3k, 2tk, 2k)\n\nwhere k is a scalar function of t.\n\nNow, let's find the scalar function k(t):\n\nda/dt = 3k => a(t) = 3kt + A (where A is a constant)\ndb/dt = 2tk => b(t) = kt^2 + B (where B is a constant)\ndc/dt = 2k => c(t) = 2kt + C (where C is a constant)\n\nAt the initial point (t = 0), the vector v(0) = (2, 1, -3). Therefore:\n\na(0) = 3k(0) + A = 2 => A = 2\nb(0) = k(0)^2 + B = 1 => B = 1\nc(0) = 2k(0) + C = -3 => C = -3\n\nNow, we have the parallel transported vector v(t) = (3kt + 2, kt^2 + 1, 2kt - 3).\n\nFinally, we need to find the parallel transported vector at the final point (t = 1):\n\nv(1) = (3k(1) + 2, k(1)^2 + 1, 2k(1) - 3)\n\nSince the vector v should remain parallel to itself along the curve, the ratio of the components of v(1) should be the same as the ratio of the components of the initial vector v(0) = (2, 1, -3). Therefore:\n\n(3k + 2) / 2 = (k^2 + 1) / 1 = (2k - 3) / (-3)\n\nSolving these equations, we get k = 1. So, the parallel transported vector at the final point (t = 1) is:\n\nv(1) = (3(1) + 2, 1^2 + 1, 2(1) - 3) = (5, 2, -1)\n\nThus, the parallel transport of the vector v = 2i + j - 3k along the curve C from the point (0, -1, -3) to the point (3, 8, 3) is given by the vector 5i + 2j - k."
