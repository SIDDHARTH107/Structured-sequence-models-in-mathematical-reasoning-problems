    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of G, we first need to understand the structure of G. The graph G can be represented as follows:\n\n```\na -- b\n|\\  |\n| \\ |\nd -- c\n```\n\nNow, let's find the Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) of G. The Tutte polynomial is defined recursively as follows:\n\n1. If G has no edges, T_G(x, y) = 1.\n2. If G has an edge e that is not a loop and not a bridge, then T_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y), where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n3. If G has a loop e, then T_G(x, y) = (x-1)T_{G-e}(x, y).\n4. If G has a bridge e, then T_G(x, y) = (y-1)T_{G-e}(x, y).\n\nIn our case, the edge {a, c} is not a loop and not a bridge, so we can apply rule 2:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-{a, c}}(x, y) + T_{G/{a, c}}(x, y)\n\nG-{a, c} is a graph with four vertices and four edges:\n\n```\na -- b\n|   |\n|   |\nd -- c\n```\n\nG/{a, c} is a graph with three vertices and three edges, obtained by contracting the edge {a, c}:\n\n```\na,b -- c\n  |__ d\n```\n\nNow, let's find the Tutte polynomials for G-{a, c} and G/{a, c}.\n\nFor G-{a, c}, we can apply rule 2 again, using the edge {a, d}:\n\nT_{G-{a, c}}(x, y) = T_{G-{a, c}-{a, d}}(x, y) + T_{G-{a, c}/{a, d}}(x, y)\n\nG-{a, c}-{a, d} is a graph with four vertices and three edges:\n\n```\na   b\n|   |\n|   |\nd -- c\n```\n\nG-{a, c}/{a, d} is a graph with three vertices and three edges, obtained by contracting the edge {a, d}:\n\n```\na,c -- b\n  |__ d\n```\n\nFor G/{a, c}, we can apply rule 2 again, using the edge {a,b, c}:\n\nT_{G/{a, c}}(x, y) = T_{G/{a, c}-{a,b, c}}(x, y) + T_{G/{a, c}/{a,b, c}}(x, y)\n\nG/{a, c}-{a,b, c} is a graph with three vertices and two edges:\n\n```\na,b -- c\n  |   d\n```\n\nG/{a, c}/{a,b, c} is a graph with two vertices and one edge, obtained by contracting the edge {a,b, c}:\n\n```\na,b,c -- d\n```\n\nNow, we can find the Tutte polynomials for all these smaller graphs using rule 1 (for graphs with no edges) and rule 4 (for graphs with bridges):\n\nT_{G-{a, c}-{a, d}}(x, y) = (y-1)^3\nT_{G-{a, c}/{a, d}}(x, y) = (y-1)^2\nT_{G/{a, c}-{a,b, c}}(x, y) = (y-1)^2\nT_{G/{a, c}/{a,b, c}}(x, y) = (y-1)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the expressions for T_{G-{a, c}}(x, y) and T_{G/{a, c}}(x, y):\n\nT_{G-{a, c}}(x, y) = (y-1)^3 + (y-1)^2 = y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1\nT_{G/{a, c}}(x, y) = (y-1)^2 + (y-1) = y^2 - 2y + 1\n\nFinally, we can substitute these values back into the expression for T_G(x, y):\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-{a, c}}(x, y) + T_{G/{a, c}}(x, y) = (y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1) + (y^2 - 2y + 1)\n\nT_G(x, y) = y^3 - 2y^2 + y\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of G is T_G(x, y) = y^3 - 2y^2 + y."
