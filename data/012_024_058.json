    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. For a complete graph with n vertices, denoted as K_n, the genus g can be found using the Ringel-Youngs formula:\n\ng(K_n) = ⌈(n-3)(n-4)/12⌉\n\nwhere ⌈x⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n\nFor K_7 (the complete graph with 7 vertices), we can plug in n = 7 into the formula:\n\ng(K_7) = ⌈(7-3)(7-4)/12⌉ = ⌈(4)(3)/12⌉ = ⌈1⌉ = 1\n\nSo, the genus of the complete graph with 7 vertices is 1."
