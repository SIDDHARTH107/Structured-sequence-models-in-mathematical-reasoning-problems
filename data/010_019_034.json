    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we need to compute the gradient of $f$ and set it equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy)$.\n\nNow, we set the gradient equal to the zero vector:\n\n$(3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy) = (0, 0)$.\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\n1) $3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y^2 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm y$.\n2) $-6xy = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$ or $y = 0$.\n\nFrom (2), if $x = 0$, then from (1) we have $y = 0$. This gives us the critical point $(0, 0)$. If $y = 0$, then from (1) we have $x = 0$, which is the same critical point we already found. \n\nNow, let's consider the case when $x = y$. From (2), we have $-6x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. This is the same critical point we already found. \n\nFinally, let's consider the case when $x = -y$. From (2), we have $6x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. This is the same critical point we already found. \n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ to determine the index of the critical point. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nEvaluating the Hessian matrix at the critical point $(0, 0)$, we get:\n\n$H(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Since the Hessian matrix at the critical point is the zero matrix, it has no negative eigenvalues. Therefore, the index of the critical point $(0, 0)$ is 0.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one critical point $(0, 0)$, and its index is 0."
