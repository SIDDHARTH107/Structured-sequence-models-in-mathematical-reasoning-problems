    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.05. If 500 products are produced, what is the probability that exactly 25 of them will have this type of defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defects, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as nCx), p is the probability of a single defect occurring, and n is the total number of products.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nn = 500 (total number of products)\nx = 25 (number of defects we want to find the probability for)\np = 0.05 (probability of a single defect occurring)\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, x), which is calculated as:\n\nC(n, x) = n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nC(500, 25) = 500! / (25! * (500-25)!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(25) = C(500, 25) * (0.05)^25 * (1-0.05)^(500-25)\n\nP(25) = C(500, 25) * (0.05)^25 * (0.95)^475\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(25) â‰ˆ 0.0394\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 25 out of 500 products will have this type of defect is approximately 0.0394 or 3.94%."
