    "message_2": "To solve the given SDE, we can use the technique of applying Ito's Lemma. The SDE is given by:\n\ndX = 2Xdt + 3XdW\n\nwith X(0) = 1\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the SDE in the following form:\n\ndX/X = 2dt + 3dW\n\nNow, we integrate both sides from 0 to t:\n\n∫(0 to t) (dX/X) = ∫(0 to t) (2dt + 3dW)\n\nWe can solve the integrals separately:\n\n∫(0 to t) (dX/X) = ln(X(t)) - ln(X(0))\n\n∫(0 to t) (2dt) = 2t\n\n∫(0 to t) (3dW) = 3W(t) - 3W(0)\n\nNow, we can combine the results:\n\nln(X(t)) - ln(X(0)) = 2t + 3W(t) - 3W(0)\n\nSince X(0) = 1 and W(0) = 0, we have:\n\nln(X(t)) = 2t + 3W(t)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to solve for X(t):\n\nX(t) = exp(2t + 3W(t))\n\nFinally, we want to find the solution at t = 1:\n\nX(1) = exp(2(1) + 3W(1))\n\nX(1) = exp(2 + 3W(1))\n\nThe solution of the SDE at t = 1 is X(1) = exp(2 + 3W(1)). Since W(1) is a random variable, the solution X(1) is also a random variable with a log-normal distribution."
