    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that measures 5cm and the hypotenuse measures 13cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the length of one leg (a = 5cm) and the length of the hypotenuse (c = 13cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nPlugging the given values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n13² = 5² + b²\n169 = 25 + b²\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb² = 169 - 25\nb² = 144\nb = √144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 12cm."
