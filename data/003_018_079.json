    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(2x))/dx\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function (3sin(u)) with respect to u, where u = 2x:\n\nd(3sin(u))/du = 3cos(u)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the inner function (2x) with respect to x:\n\nd(2x)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (d(3sin(u))/du) * (d(2x)/dx) = 3cos(u) * 2\n\nSubstitute u = 2x back into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(2(π/6)) = 6cos(π/3)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2, so:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6(1/2) = 3\n\nTherefore, the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) at x = π/6 is 3."
