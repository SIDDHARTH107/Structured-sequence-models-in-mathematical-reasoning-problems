    "message_2": "To find the minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, we need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the root of the first derivative in the interval [1, 2]. Newton's method is an iterative method that uses the formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current approximation and x_n+1 is the next approximation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 11) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, let's choose an initial approximation x_0 in the interval [1, 2]. We can start with the midpoint of the interval, x_0 = 1.5.\n\nNext, we will apply Newton's method iteratively until we reach a desired level of accuracy. For this example, let's perform 3 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0) = 1.5 - (3(1.5)^2 - 12(1.5) + 11) / (6(1.5) - 12)\nx_1 ≈ 1.372\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1) = 1.372 - (3(1.372)^2 - 12(1.372) + 11) / (6(1.372) - 12)\nx_2 ≈ 1.368\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = x_2 - f'(x_2) / f''(x_2) = 1.368 - (3(1.368)^2 - 12(1.368) + 11) / (6(1.368) - 12)\nx_3 ≈ 1.368\n\nAfter 3 iterations, the approximation has stabilized at x ≈ 1.368. This is the critical point in the interval [1, 2]. To verify that this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative at this point:\n\nf''(1.368) = 6(1.368) - 12 ≈ 2.208\n\nSince f''(1.368) > 0, this critical point corresponds to a minimum of the function f(x) in the interval [1, 2]."
