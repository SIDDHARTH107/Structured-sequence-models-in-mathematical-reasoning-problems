    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian product AxB, we form ordered pairs with elements from set A as the first element and elements from set B as the second element. \n\nAxB = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product BxA, where we form ordered pairs with elements from set B as the first element and elements from set A as the second element.\n\nBxA = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare AxB and BxA. We can see that the ordered pairs in AxB are not the same as the ordered pairs in BxA. For example, (1, 4) is in AxB but not in BxA, and (4, 1) is in BxA but not in AxB. \n\nSince AxB â‰  BxA, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
