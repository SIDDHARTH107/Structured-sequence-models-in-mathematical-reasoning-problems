    "message_1": "A stock price of a company is currently $50. The probability of the stock price to increase by up to 10% is 0.6 and the probability of it increasing by more than 10% is 0.2. What is the probability of the stock price staying below $60 at the end of the day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the stock price staying below $60 at the end of the day, we need to consider the probability of it increasing by up to 10%. Since the stock price is currently $50, a 10% increase would bring it to $55 ($50 * 1.10 = $55). Any increase beyond 10% would result in the stock price going above $60.\n\nThe probability of the stock price increasing by up to 10% is given as 0.6. Therefore, the probability of the stock price staying below $60 at the end of the day is also 0.6."
