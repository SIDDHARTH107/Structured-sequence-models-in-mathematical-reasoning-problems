    "message_2": "Let |S| = n. To form a subset of S that can be expressed as the union of two disjoint nonempty subsets, we can think of it as dividing the elements of the subset into two groups. \n\nConsider a subset T of S with |T| = k. There are C(n, k) ways to choose such a subset T, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient (n choose k). Now, we need to divide the elements of T into two disjoint nonempty subsets. There are 2^k ways to assign each element of T to one of the two subsets, but we need to subtract 2 cases: the case where all elements are in the first subset and the case where all elements are in the second subset, as these would not result in disjoint nonempty subsets. So, there are 2^k - 2 ways to divide the elements of T into two disjoint nonempty subsets.\n\nNow, we need to sum this over all possible values of k (the size of the subset T) from k = 2 (since we need at least two elements to form two disjoint nonempty subsets) to k = n (the size of the set S):\n\nΣ [C(n, k) * (2^k - 2)] for k = 2 to n.\n\nHowever, this summation can be simplified. Notice that Σ C(n, k) * 2^k for k = 0 to n is equal to (2 + 1)^n = 3^n, by the binomial theorem. We can subtract the cases where k = 0 and k = 1, so we have:\n\n3^n - C(n, 0) * 2^0 - C(n, 1) * 2^1 = 3^n - 1 - 2n.\n\nNow, we need to subtract Σ C(n, k) * 2 for k = 2 to n. This is equal to Σ C(n, k) * 2^k for k = 0 to n minus the cases where k = 0 and k = 1:\n\n(3^n - 1 - 2n) - (C(n, 0) * 2^0 + C(n, 1) * 2^1) = 3^n - 1 - 2n - 1 - 2n = 3^n - 4n - 2.\n\nSo, the number of subsets of S that can be expressed as the union of two disjoint nonempty subsets of S is 3^n - 4n - 2."
