    "message_2": "The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. To find the power set of A, we list all possible subsets:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. Single element subsets: {1}, {2}, {3}\n3. Two-element subsets: {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}\n4. The set A itself: {1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, the power set of A is:\n\nP(A) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }\n\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. The cardinality of A is 3, as there are three elements in A: {1, 2, 3}. The cardinality of P(A) is 8, as there are eight elements in P(A).\n\nSince the cardinality of P(A) (8) is greater than the cardinality of A (3), we have shown that the cardinality of the power set of A is greater than that of A."
