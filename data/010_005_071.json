    "message_2": "To prove that A and C are connected, we will show that they are both path-connected. Recall that a set is path-connected if for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous path between them.\n\nA = {z ∈ X : |z| = 1} is the unit circle in the complex plane. Given any two points z1 and z2 on the unit circle, we can define a continuous path between them as follows:\n\nLet θ1 and θ2 be the arguments of z1 and z2, respectively (i.e., z1 = e^(iθ1) and z2 = e^(iθ2)). Define the path γ(t) = e^(i(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1))), where t ∈ [0, 1]. This path is continuous, and γ(0) = z1 and γ(1) = z2. Therefore, A is path-connected, and hence connected.\n\nC = {z ∈ X : |z - 3i| = 1} is a circle of radius 1 centered at 3i in the complex plane. Similar to the argument for A, given any two points z1 and z2 on this circle, we can define a continuous path between them as follows:\n\nLet θ1 and θ2 be the arguments of z1 - 3i and z2 - 3i, respectively (i.e., z1 - 3i = e^(iθ1) and z2 - 3i = e^(iθ2)). Define the path γ(t) = 3i + e^(i(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1))), where t ∈ [0, 1]. This path is continuous, and γ(0) = z1 and γ(1) = z2. Therefore, C is path-connected, and hence connected.\n\nNow, we will show that B is path-connected. B = {z ∈ X : |z - 1| ≤ 1} is a closed disk of radius 1 centered at 1 in the complex plane. Given any two points z1 and z2 in B, we can define a continuous path between them as follows:\n\nDefine the path γ(t) = z1 + t(z2 - z1), where t ∈ [0, 1]. This path is a straight line segment between z1 and z2, and it is continuous. Since B is a convex set, the entire line segment lies within B. Therefore, γ(0) = z1 and γ(1) = z2, and B is path-connected.\n\nFinally, we will find the path component of the point 0 in B. The path component of a point is the set of all points that can be connected to the given point by a continuous path within the set. Since B is path-connected, the path component of 0 in B is the entire set B."
