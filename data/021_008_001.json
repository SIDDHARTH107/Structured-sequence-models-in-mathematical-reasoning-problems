    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to a system of nonlinear equations, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. Let's denote the given system of equations as:\n\nF(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) = (x^2 + y^2 - 1, x^2 - y^2 - 0.5)\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n          | 2x -2y |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the inverse is given by:\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = (1/det(J)) * |  d  -b |\n                              | -c   a |\n\nwhere det(J) = ad - bc, and a, b, c, d are the elements of the matrix J(x, y):\n\na = 2x, b = 2y, c = 2x, d = -2y\n\ndet(J) = (2x)(-2y) - (2y)(2x) = -4xy + 4xy = 0\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the Jacobian matrix is singular, and its inverse does not exist. Therefore, we cannot apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations."
