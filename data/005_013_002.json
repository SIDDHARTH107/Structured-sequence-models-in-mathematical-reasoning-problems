They want to know if there is a significant relationship between these two variables.  The company randomly sampled 10 of its employees and obtained the following data:\n\n| Employee | Monthly Salary (USD) | Years of Experience |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1        | 3000                | 5                   |\n| 2        | 3500                | 4                   |\n| 3        | 4000                | 7                   |\n| 4        | 5000                | 10                  |\n| 5        | 6000                | 12                  |\n| 6        | 4500                | 8                   |\n| 7        | 5500                | 13                  |\n| 8        | 4000                | 9                   |\n| 9        | 3500                | 6                   |\n| 10       | 2500                | 3                   |\n\nAssuming a significance level of 0.05, can we conclude that there is a significant relationship between monthly salary and years of experience? Find the correlation coefficient and its confidence interval.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant relationship between monthly salary and years of experience, we will calculate the correlation coefficient (r) and perform a hypothesis test. We will also calculate the confidence interval for the correlation coefficient.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the means and standard deviations of both variables.\nMean of Monthly Salary (M) = (3000 + 3500 + 4000 + 5000 + 6000 + 4500 + 5500 + 4000 + 3500 + 2500) / 10 = 41500 / 10 = 4150\nMean of Years of Experience (Y) = (5 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 8 + 13 + 9 + 6 + 3) / 10 = 77 / 10 = 7.7\n\nStandard Deviation of Monthly Salary (SD_M) = √[(Σ(M - Mean of M)^2) / (n - 1)] = √[(Σ(3000 - 4150)^2 + ... + (2500 - 4150)^2) / (10 - 1)] = √[1825000 / 9] = 450\nStandard Deviation of Years of Experience (SD_Y) = √[(Σ(Y - Mean of Y)^2) / (n - 1)] = √[(Σ(5 - 7.7)^2 + ... + (3 - 7.7)^2) / (10 - 1)] = √[102.3 / 9] = 1.1\n\nStep 2: Calculate the correlation coefficient (r).\nr = (Σ[(M - Mean of M)(Y - Mean of Y)]) / [(n - 1) * SD_M * SD_Y] = [(Σ(3000 - 4150)(5 - 7.7) + ... + (2500 - 4150)(3 - 7.7))] / [(10 - 1) * 450 * 1.1] = 0.978\n\nStep 3: Perform a hypothesis test.\nNull Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between monthly salary and years of experience (r = 0).\nAlternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between monthly salary and years of experience (r ≠ 0).\n\nUsing a t-distribution table and a significance level of 0.05, we find the critical value for a two-tailed test with 8 degrees of freedom (n - 2) to be 2.306.\n\nt = r * √[(n - 2) / (1 - r^2)] = 0.978 * √[(10 - 2) / (1 - 0.978^2)] = 9.24\n\nSince the calculated t-value (9.24) is greater than the critical value (2.306), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant relationship between monthly salary and years of experience.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the confidence interval for the correlation coefficient.\nLower Bound = tanh[atanh(r) - (1.96 * (1 / √(n - 3)))] = tanh[atanh(0.978) - (1.96 * (1 / √(10 - 3)))] = 0.919\nUpper Bound = tanh[atanh(r) + (1.96 * (1 / √(n - 3)))] = tanh[atanh(0.978) + (1.96 * (1 / √(10 - 3)))] = 0.995\n\nThe correlation coefficient is 0.978, and its 95% confidence interval is (0.919, 0.995). This indicates a strong positive relationship between monthly salary and years of experience."
