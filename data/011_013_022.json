    "message_1": "Suppose there are 6 distinct colors of balls available, and you need to pick 4 of them to create a set of unique colored balls. How many unique sets can be created if rotations are considered the same (i.e., if a set is rotated, it is still considered the same set)? Use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we need to find the cycle index polynomial of the group acting on the set of colored balls. In this case, the group is the cyclic group of order 4, which has 4 elements: the identity, a 90-degree rotation, a 180-degree rotation, and a 270-degree rotation.\n\nLet's denote the cycle index polynomial as P(G, x1, x2, ..., x6), where G is the group and xi represents the number of cycles of length i.\n\n1. For the identity element, all 4 balls are in their own cycles, so the cycle index is x1^4.\n2. For the 90-degree rotation, there is one 4-cycle, so the cycle index is x4.\n3. For the 180-degree rotation, there are two 2-cycles, so the cycle index is x2^2.\n4. For the 270-degree rotation, there is one 4-cycle, so the cycle index is x4.\n\nNow, we average these cycle index polynomials to find the overall cycle index polynomial for the group:\n\nP(G, x1, x2, ..., x6) = (x1^4 + x4 + x2^2 + x4) / 4\n\nNow, we substitute xi with the number of colors (6) to find the number of unique sets:\n\nP(G, 6, 6, ..., 6) = (6^4 + 6 + 6^2 + 6) / 4 = (1296 + 6 + 36 + 6) / 4 = 1344 / 4 = 336\n\nSo there are 336 unique sets of 4 colored balls that can be created when rotations are considered the same."
