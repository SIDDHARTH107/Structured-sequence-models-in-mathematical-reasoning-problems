    "message_1": "Assume a student surveys 100 students in their school regarding their favorite ice cream flavor. Out of the 100, 22 students prefer vanilla, 35 prefer chocolate, 20 prefer strawberry, and the rest prefer other flavors. What percentage of the surveyed students prefer flavors other than vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students who prefer flavors other than vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry, first determine the total number of students who prefer these three flavors:\n\n22 (vanilla) + 35 (chocolate) + 20 (strawberry) = 77 students\n\nNow, subtract this number from the total number of surveyed students (100) to find the number of students who prefer other flavors:\n\n100 - 77 = 23 students\n\nFinally, divide the number of students who prefer other flavors by the total number of surveyed students and multiply by 100 to find the percentage:\n\n(23 / 100) * 100 = 23%\n\nSo, 23% of the surveyed students prefer flavors other than vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry."
