    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Segment Length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(5/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^(2.5))\nLength = 1 * (√(2^5))\nLength = 1 * (√32)\nLength = 1 * 4√2\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after 5 iterations is 4√2."
