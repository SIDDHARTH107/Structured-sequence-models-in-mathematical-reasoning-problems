    "message_2": "To determine the number of games that need to be played in a round-robin tournament with 10 teams, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the number of teams) and k = 2 (since each game consists of 2 teams playing against each other).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9 × 8!)/(2 × 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9)/2\n\nC(10, 2) = 90/2\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, 45 games need to be played in a round-robin tournament with 10 teams."
