    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x + 3| = 18, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x + 3 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n\n5x + 3 = 18\n5x = 18 - 3\n5x = 15\nx = 15/5\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 5x + 3 is negative\nIn this case, we need to consider the negative value inside the absolute value sign:\n\n-(5x + 3) = 18\n-5x - 3 = 18\n-5x = 18 + 3\n-5x = 21\nx = 21/(-5)\nx = -4.2\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -4.2."
