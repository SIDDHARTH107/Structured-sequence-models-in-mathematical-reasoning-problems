    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize its profit by producing two products: Product A and Product B. Product A sells for $10 per unit and requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of machinery to produce. Product B sells for $15 per unit and requires 5 hours of labor and 4 units of machinery to produce. The company has 30 hours of labor and 20 units of machinery available. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit, if they are limited to producing whole-number quantities of each product?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machinery are as follows:\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 30 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 20 (machinery constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\nFor the labor constraint:\n\ny ≤ (30 - 3x) / 5\n\nFor the machinery constraint:\n\ny ≤ (20 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. We can do this by finding the intersection points of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and machinery constraint:\n\n3x + 5y = 30\n2x + 4y = 20\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 2, y = 4\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n\n3x + 5y = 30\n3(0) + 5y = 30\n\ny = 6\n\n3. Intersection of machinery constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n\n2x + 4y = 20\n2x + 4(0) = 20\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 6), (2, 4), and (10, 0).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 6) = 10(0) + 15(6) = 90\nP(2, 4) = 10(2) + 15(4) = 20 + 60 = 80\nP(10, 0) = 10(10) + 15(0) = 100\n\nThe maximum profit is $100, which occurs when the company produces 10 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B."
