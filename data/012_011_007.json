    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph, and for each vertex, keep track of its discovery time and the lowest discovery time of its adjacent vertices.\n2. A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child whose lowest discovery time is greater than or equal to the vertex's discovery time.\n3. An edge is a bridge if its two vertices have different lowest discovery times, and the lowest discovery time of one vertex is equal to the discovery time of the other vertex.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given graph, we get the following results:\n\nCut vertices: {1, 4}\nBridges: {(1, 2), (4, 5)}\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is a cut vertex because it is the root of the DFS tree and has two children (2 and 4). Removing vertex 1 would disconnect the graph into two components: {2, 5} and {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}.\n2. Vertex 4 is a cut vertex because it has a child (5) whose lowest discovery time is greater than or equal to vertex 4's discovery time. Removing vertex 4 would disconnect the graph into two components: {1, 2, 5} and {3, 6, 7, 8}.\n3. Edge (1, 2) is a bridge because vertices 1 and 2 have different lowest discovery times, and the lowest discovery time of vertex 2 is equal to the discovery time of vertex 1. Removing this edge would disconnect the graph into two components: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} and {2, 5}.\n4. Edge (4, 5) is a bridge because vertices 4 and 5 have different lowest discovery times, and the lowest discovery time of vertex 5 is equal to the discovery time of vertex 4. Removing this edge would disconnect the graph into two components: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} and {5}."
