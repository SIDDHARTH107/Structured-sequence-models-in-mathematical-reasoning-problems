    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 4x - 7 ≤ 5x + 3, we'll first isolate the variable x.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4x from both sides of the inequality.\n-7 ≤ x + 3\n\nStep 2: Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality.\n-10 ≤ x\n\nNow, we can write the solution in interval notation. Since the inequality is -10 ≤ x, this means that x is greater than or equal to -10. In interval notation, this is written as:\n\n[-10, ∞)"
