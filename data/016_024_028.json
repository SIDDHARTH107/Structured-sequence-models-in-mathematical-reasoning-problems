    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern formed by successively removing squares from the original square. In each iteration, we remove the middle square of each remaining square, which is 1/9 of its area. \n\nAfter the first iteration, we have removed 1/9 of the area, so the remaining area is 1 - 1/9 = 8/9. \n\nFor each subsequent iteration, we remove 1/9 of the remaining area. So, after the 7th iteration, the remaining area is:\n\nA = 1 * (8/9)^7\n\nA â‰ˆ 0.1640625\n\nSo, the area of the Sierpinski carpet after the 7th iteration is approximately 0.1640625 units."
