Water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 cubic feet per minute. At what rate is the water level rising when the water is 6 feet deep?\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this related rates problem, we'll first set up the relationship between the volume of the cone and its dimensions, and then differentiate with respect to time to find the rate at which the water level is rising.\n\nThe volume V of a cone with radius r and height h is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nSince the dimensions of the tank are fixed, we can set up a proportion between the radius and height of the water in the tank:\n\nr/h = 4/10\nr = (2/5)h\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for r into the volume formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π((2/5)h)^2h\nV = (1/3)π(4/25)h^3\nV = (4/75)πh^3\n\nNow, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (4/75)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 cubic feet per minute, so dV/dt = 3 ft³/min. We want to find the rate at which the water level is rising (dh/dt) when the water is 6 feet deep (h = 6).\n\n3 = (4/75)π(3(6)^2)(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we'll solve for dh/dt:\n\n3 = (4/75)π(108)(dh/dt)\n3 = (432/75)π(dh/dt)\n\nDivide both sides by (432/75)π:\n\ndh/dt = 3/((432/75)π)\ndh/dt = (3*75)/(432π)\ndh/dt = 225/(432π)\n\nSo, when the water is 6 feet deep, the water level is rising at a rate of 225/(432π) feet per minute."
