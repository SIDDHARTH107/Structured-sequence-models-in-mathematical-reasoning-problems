    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\nLet P be a point on the curve C defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1, and let L be the line defined by the equation y = x + 3. Find the points of intersection between C and L, and determine the number of intersection points using Bezout's theorem.",
    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection between curve C and line L, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1 (1)\ny = x + 3 (2)\n\nFirst, we can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to eliminate y:\n\n(x + 3)^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 6x + 9 = x^3 + 2x + 1\nx^3 - x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\n\nNow we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. Unfortunately, there is no general formula for solving cubic equations like the quadratic formula. However, we can try to find integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the divisors of the constant term (-8) divided by the divisors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, and ±8.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 2 is a root:\n\n(2)^3 - (2)^2 + 4(2) - 8 = 8 - 4 + 8 - 8 = 0\n\nNow we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 8) / (x - 2) = x^2 + x + 4\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor, x^2 + x + 4, does not have any real roots (its discriminant is negative). Therefore, the only real intersection point between curve C and line L is when x = 2. Substituting this value back into equation (2), we find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\ny = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the only point of intersection between curve C and line L is (2, 5).\n\nNow, let's use Bezout's theorem to determine the number of intersection points. Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points between two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counting multiplicity and including complex intersection points. In this case, curve C has degree 3 (since it's a cubic equation) and line L has degree 1 (since it's a linear equation). Therefore, the total number of intersection points, including complex points and counting multiplicity, is 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nSince we found only one real intersection point, this means that there must be two complex intersection points between curve C and line L."
