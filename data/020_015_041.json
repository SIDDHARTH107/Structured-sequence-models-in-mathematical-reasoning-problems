    "message_1": "A rectangular field with a total of 500 meters of fencing needs to be fenced off using an existing wall on one side. What is the maximum area that can be enclosed by the fencing?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. Since the existing wall is on one side, we only need to use the fencing for the other three sides. Therefore, the total fencing used will be:\n\nL + 2W = 500\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nFirst, we can solve the fencing equation for L:\n\nL = 500 - 2W\n\nNow, substitute this expression for L into the area equation:\n\nArea = (500 - 2W) * W\nArea = 500W - 2W^2\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area equation with respect to W and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dW = 500 - 4W = 0\n\nSolving for W:\n\n4W = 500\nW = 125\n\nNow, substitute the value of W back into the equation for L:\n\nL = 500 - 2(125)\nL = 500 - 250\nL = 250\n\nSo, the maximum area that can be enclosed by the fencing is:\n\nArea = L * W\nArea = 250 * 125\nArea = 31,250 square meters"
