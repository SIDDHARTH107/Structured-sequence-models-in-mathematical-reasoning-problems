    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G*e; x, y) if e is not a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = xT(G/e; x, y) if e is a bridge and not a loop,\nT(G; x, y) = yT(G-e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, G*e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e and identifying its endpoints.\n\nLet's compute the Tutte polynomial for the given graph G with edges:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), and (5,6).\n\nFirst, we need to find a non-bridge edge. In this case, we can choose edge (2,3). Now we apply the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-(2,3); x, y) + T(G*(2,3); x, y)\n\nNow, we need to compute the Tutte polynomial for the two new graphs:\n\nG-(2,3) has edges: (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), and (5,6).\nG*(2,3) has edges: (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), and (4,6).\n\nLet's compute the Tutte polynomial for G-(2,3). We can choose edge (1,2) as a non-bridge edge:\n\nT(G-(2,3); x, y) = T(G-(2,3)-(1,2); x, y) + T(G-(2,3)*(1,2); x, y)\n\nG-(2,3)-(1,2) has edges: (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), and (5,6).\nG-(2,3)*(1,2) has edges: (1,3), (1,4), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,6).\n\nBoth of these graphs are trees, so their Tutte polynomials are x^4y^2 and x^3y^2, respectively. Thus, T(G-(2,3); x, y) = x^4y^2 + x^3y^2.\n\nNow, let's compute the Tutte polynomial for G*(2,3). We can choose edge (1,2) as a non-bridge edge:\n\nT(G*(2,3); x, y) = T(G*(2,3)-(1,2); x, y) + T(G*(2,3)*(1,2); x, y)\n\nG*(2,3)-(1,2) has edges: (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), and (4,6).\nG*(2,3)*(1,2) has edges: (1,3), (1,4), (3,5), and (4,6).\n\nBoth of these graphs are trees, so their Tutte polynomials are x^3y^2 and x^3y^2, respectively. Thus, T(G*(2,3); x, y) = x^3y^2 + x^3y^2 = 2x^3y^2.\n\nFinally, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for the original graph G:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-(2,3); x, y) + T(G*(2,3); x, y) = (x^4y^2 + x^3y^2) + 2x^3y^2 = x^4y^2 + 3x^3y^2.\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G is T(G; x, y) = x^4y^2 + 3x^3y^2."
