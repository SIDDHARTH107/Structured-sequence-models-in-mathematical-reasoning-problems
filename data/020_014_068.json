    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, A and B. The profit earned from one product of type A is $10 and from one product of type B is $15. The production process involves a certain raw material that has a limited supply of 1000 units. The production of one product of type A requires 5 units of the raw material, while the production of one product of type B requires 8 units of the raw material. Assume that the manufacturer can produce a maximum of 150 products in a day. How many units of each product should the manufacturer produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of products of type A and y be the number of products of type B.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material: 5x + 8y ≤ 1000\n2. Maximum products: x + y ≤ 150\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit P.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 5x + 8y = 1000\ny = (1000 - 5x) / 8\n\n2. x + y = 150\ny = 150 - x\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the feasible region. We will find these intersection points by solving the equations simultaneously:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n5x + 8(150 - x) = 1000\n5x + 1200 - 8x = 1000\n-3x = -200\nx = 200/3 ≈ 66.67\n\ny = 150 - 66.67 ≈ 83.33\n\nSince the number of products must be integers, we will consider two closest integer solutions: (x, y) = (66, 84) and (67, 83).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P at these two points:\n\nP(66, 84) = 10(66) + 15(84) = 660 + 1260 = 1920\nP(67, 83) = 10(67) + 15(83) = 670 + 1245 = 1915\n\nSince P(66, 84) > P(67, 83), the manufacturer should produce 66 units of product A and 84 units of product B to maximize the profit, which will be $1920."
