    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, surviving for at least 5 years) in n trials (patients)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 60% or 0.6)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 patients)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 3)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 3 patients surviving, we need to calculate the probabilities for 3, 4, and 5 patients surviving and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\n\nFirst, let's find P(X = 3):\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.6)^3 * (1-0.6)^(5-3) = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16 = 0.3456\n\nNext, let's find P(X = 4):\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5\nP(X = 4) = 5 * (0.6)^4 * (1-0.6)^(5-4) = 5 * 0.1296 * 0.4 = 0.2592\n\nFinally, let's find P(X = 5):\n\nC(5, 5) = 5! / (5! * (5-5)!) = 1\nP(X = 5) = 1 * (0.6)^5 * (1-0.6)^(5-5) = 1 * 0.07776 * 1 = 0.07776\n\nNow, we can sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 0.3456 + 0.2592 + 0.07776 = 0.68256\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 out of 5 randomly selected patients will survive for at least 5 years is approximately 68.26%."
