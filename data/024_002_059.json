    "message_2": "To find the geodesic distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, we can use the great-circle distance formula. First, we need to convert the Cartesian coordinates P(1,2,2) and Q(2,3,1) to spherical coordinates.\n\nLet's denote the spherical coordinates as (r, θ, φ), where r is the radius, θ is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis), and φ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the positive x-axis).\n\nFor point P(1,2,2):\nr = √(1² + 2² + 2²) = √9 = 3\nθ = arccos(z/r) = arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.8411 radians\nφ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(2/1) ≈ 1.1071 radians\n\nFor point Q(2,3,1):\nr = √(2² + 3² + 1²) = √14 ≈ 3 (since we are considering the points on the sphere with radius 3)\nθ = arccos(z/r) = arccos(1/3) ≈ 1.2309 radians\nφ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(3/2) ≈ 0.9828 radians\n\nNow we can use the great-circle distance formula:\nd = r * arccos(sin(θ₁) * sin(θ₂) + cos(θ₁) * cos(θ₂) * cos(φ₁ - φ₂))\n\nPlugging in the values:\nd = 3 * arccos(sin(0.8411) * sin(1.2309) + cos(0.8411) * cos(1.2309) * cos(1.1071 - 0.9828))\nd ≈ 3 * arccos(0.6667)\nd ≈ 3 * 0.8757\nd ≈ 2.6271 units\n\nSo, the geodesic distance between points P and Q on the surface of the sphere with a radius of 3 units is approximately 2.6271 units."
