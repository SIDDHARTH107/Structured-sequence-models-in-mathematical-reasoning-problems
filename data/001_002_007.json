    "message_2": "The given linear equation is in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 2x + 3, we can see that:\n\nThe slope (m) is 2.\n\nThe y-intercept (b) is 3.\n\nSo, the slope of the line is 2, and the y-intercept is 3."
