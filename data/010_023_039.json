    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of crossings needed for a non-trivial knot on a torus, we first need to find the Euler characteristic of a torus using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total curvature of a surface to its Euler characteristic (χ). For a torus, the total curvature is 0, since it is a flat surface.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. For a torus, we have V = 0, E = 0, and F = 1 (the torus itself). Therefore, the Euler characteristic of a torus is:\n\nχ = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1\n\nNow, we need to use the knot tabulation database to find the smallest non-trivial knot on a torus. The smallest non-trivial knot on a torus is the (2,3)-torus knot, also known as the trefoil knot. This knot has a minimum of 3 crossings.\n\nSo, the minimum number of crossings needed for a non-trivial knot on a torus is 3."
