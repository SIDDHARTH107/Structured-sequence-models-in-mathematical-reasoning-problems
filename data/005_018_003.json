The survival time of each patient was recorded in days. Calculate the survival rate of these patients after 2 years of observation.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the survival rate after 2 years of observation, we need to know how many patients were still alive after 2 years (or 730 days, since there are 365 days in a year).\n\nLet's assume we have the survival time of each patient in days. We can count the number of patients who survived more than 730 days.\n\nLet's say x patients survived more than 730 days.\n\nThe survival rate after 2 years of observation can be calculated as:\n\nSurvival Rate = (Number of patients alive after 2 years) / (Total number of patients) * 100\n\nSince we don't have the exact number of patients who survived more than 730 days, we can represent the survival rate as:\n\nSurvival Rate = (x / 100) * 100\n\nPlease provide the survival time of each patient or the number of patients who survived more than 730 days to calculate the exact survival rate."
