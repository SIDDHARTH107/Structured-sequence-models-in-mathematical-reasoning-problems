    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, it's a way to pair up the vertices so that each pair is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph. We can represent the graph as follows:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 6\n \\    \\\n  \\    5 -- 7\n   \\\n    4\n\nNow, let's find the perfect matchings:\n\n1. {1,2}, {3,6}, {4,5}, {5,7}\n2. {1,4}, {2,3}, {3,6}, {5,7}\n\nThere are 2 perfect matchings in this graph."
