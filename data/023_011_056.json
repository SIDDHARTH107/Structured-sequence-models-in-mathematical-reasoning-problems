    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform X(f) of the signal x(t), we can use the following formula:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1), and the integral is taken over all time.\n\nHowever, since x(t) is composed of sinusoidal functions (cosine and sine), we can use the property of linearity of the Fourier Transform and find the Fourier Transform of each term individually and then sum them up.\n\nSo, let's find the Fourier Transform of each term:\n\n1) For the term 2cos(4πt):\n\nX1(f) = ∫[2cos(4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite the cosine function as:\ncos(4πt) = 0.5[e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)]\n\nX1(f) = ∫[2 * 0.5 * (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\nX1(f) = ∫[e^(j4πt) * e^(-j2πft) + e^(-j4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nNow, we can separate the integrals and solve them individually:\n\nX1(f) = ∫[e^(j4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt + ∫[e^(-j4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n∫[e^(j4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt = ∫[e^(j2π(2f - 2)t)] dt\nThis integral is non-zero only when f = 2, and in that case, it evaluates to infinity. So, we can represent it as a Dirac delta function:\nδ(f - 2)\n\nSimilarly, for the second integral:\n∫[e^(-j4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt = ∫[e^(j2π(2f + 2)t)] dt\nThis integral is non-zero only when f = -2, and in that case, it evaluates to infinity.

So, we can represent it as a Dirac delta function:\njδ(f - 5)\n\nSimilarly, for the second integral:\n∫[e^(-j10πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt = ∫[e^(j2π(5f + 5)t)] dt\nThis integral is non-zero only when f = -5, and in that case, it evaluates to infinity. So, we can represent it as a Dirac delta function:\n-jδ(f + 5)\n\nThus, X3(f) = 3j[δ(f - 5) - δ(f + 5)]\n\n4) For the term 8sin(14πt):\n\nFollowing the same procedure as above, we can find the Fourier Transform of this term:\n\nX4(f) = 4j[δ(f - 7) - δ(f + 7)]\n\nNow, we can sum up the Fourier Transforms of all the terms:\n\nX(f) = X1(f) + X2(f) + X3(f) + X4(f)\nX(f) = (δ(f - 2) + δ(f + 2)) + (δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)) + 3j[δ(f - 5) - δ(f + 5)] + 4j[δ(f - 7) - δ(f + 7)]\n\nThis is the Fourier Transform X(f) of the signal x(t)."
