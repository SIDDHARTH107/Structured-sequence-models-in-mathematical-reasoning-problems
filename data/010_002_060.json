    "message_2": "We can use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to solve this problem. The IVT states that if a function f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], and k is any number between f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one number c in the interval [a, b] such that f(c) = k.\n\nIn this case, f is continuous on the closed interval [0, 1], f(0) = 5, and f(1) = 10. We want to find a value c in the interval [0, 1] such that f(c) = 8. Since 8 is between 5 and 10, we can apply the IVT.\n\nBy the IVT, there exists at least one number c in the interval [0, 1] such that f(c) = 8. However, without more information about the function f, we cannot determine the exact value of c."
