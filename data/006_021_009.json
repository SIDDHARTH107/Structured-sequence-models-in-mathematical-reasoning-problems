    "message_1": "A certain type of environmental event occurs in a region with a probability of 0.15 in a given year. In the next four years, what is the probability that this event occurs exactly twice?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of the event occurring exactly x times, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of the event occurring in a given year, and n is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of the event occurring exactly twice (x = 2) in the next four years (n = 4), with a probability of 0.15 (p = 0.15) in a given year.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of combinations of 4 items taken 2 at a time, which is:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6\n\nNext, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(2) = 6 * (0.15)^2 * (1 - 0.15)^(4 - 2)\nP(2) = 6 * (0.0225) * (0.85)^2\nP(2) = 6 * 0.0225 * 0.7225\nP(2) â‰ˆ 0.0973\n\nSo, the probability that the environmental event occurs exactly twice in the next four years is approximately 0.0973 or 9.73%."
