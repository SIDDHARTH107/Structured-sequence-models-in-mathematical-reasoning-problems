    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of divisors of each prime factor's exponent plus one: (5+1) * (1+1) = 6 * 2 = 12\n3. Subtract 1 to account for the trivial group: 12 - 1 = 11\n\nTherefore, there are 11 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
