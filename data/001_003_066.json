    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of the y variable the same in both equations:\n\n4x - 2y = 16\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(3x + 2y) + (4x - 2y) = 10 + 16\n3x + 4x = 26\n7x = 26\n\nNow, divide by 7 to solve for x:\n\nx = 26 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n3(26/7) + 2y = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 7 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n3(26) + 14y = 70\n78 + 14y = 70\n\nSubtract 78 from both sides:\n\n14y = -8\n\nNow, divide by 14 to solve for y:\n\ny = -8 / 14\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\ny = -4 / 7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 26/7 and y = -4/7."
