    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but I have to clarify that Non-monotonic logic is not specific to numerical problems, but rather it deals with the behavior and reasoning of logical statements in certain contexts. It is used in Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy as a tool for reasoning about systems that have incomplete or uncertain information. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for you. However, I can suggest some questions related to non-monotonic logic that a math student might find interesting:\n\n1. What are the key differences between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning systems, and how are they used in real-world applications?\n2. Can you give examples of non-monotonic reasoning systems that are used in Artificial Intelligence, and how are they applied?\n3. What are the limitations of non-monotonic reasoning systems, and how can they be overcome in practice?\n4. How can we model common-sense reasoning using non-monotonic logic, and what are the challenges involved in doing so?\n5. Can you describe the concept of \"default reasoning\" and how it relates to non-monotonic logic?",
    "message_2": "1. The key differences between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning systems lie in how they handle new information. In monotonic reasoning, adding new information to a knowledge base will never invalidate previously derived conclusions. In contrast, non-monotonic reasoning allows for the possibility that new information can change or invalidate previous conclusions. This makes non-monotonic reasoning more suitable for handling incomplete or uncertain information, as it can adapt to changing circumstances. Real-world applications of non-monotonic reasoning include expert systems, natural language processing, and planning in artificial intelligence.\n\n2. Examples of non-monotonic reasoning systems used in artificial intelligence include:\n\n   a. Default logic: A formalism for reasoning with default assumptions, which allows for drawing tentative conclusions based on incomplete information.\n   b. Circumscription: A method for minimizing the domain of discourse to make inferences based on what is known, while leaving room for new information to change the conclusions.\n   c. Autoepistemic logic: A logic that deals with an agent's knowledge and beliefs, allowing for self-reference and introspection, which can be useful in reasoning about the agent's own reasoning process.\n\n3. Limitations of non-monotonic reasoning systems include:\n\n   a. Computational complexity: Non-monotonic reasoning can be computationally expensive, making it challenging to scale to large knowledge bases or real-time applications.\n   b. Lack of a unique or canonical model: Non-monotonic reasoning systems can have multiple models, making it difficult to determine a single \"correct\" conclusion.\n   c. Incompleteness: Non-monotonic reasoning systems may not always provide a complete set of conclusions, as they are designed to handle incomplete information.\n\nThese limitations can be overcome in practice by using heuristics, approximation techniques, or by combining non-monotonic reasoning with other forms of reasoning.\n\n4. Modeling common-sense reasoning using non-monotonic logic involves representing everyday knowledge and reasoning patterns that humans use to make inferences in uncertain or incomplete situations. Challenges involved in doing so include:\n\n   a. Representing common-sense knowledge: Encoding the vast amount of everyday knowledge that humans possess is a difficult task.\n   b. Handling inconsistencies: Common-sense reasoning often involves dealing with conflicting information, which can be challenging to represent and reason with in a formal system.\n   c. Scalability: Common-sense reasoning requires handling large amounts of information, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n5. Default reasoning is a concept in non-monotonic logic that deals with making inferences based on default assumptions when there is incomplete information. It allows for drawing tentative conclusions that can be revised if new information becomes available. Default reasoning is useful in situations where it is reasonable to assume that certain conditions hold unless there is evidence to the contrary. For example, if we know that birds can typically fly, we can assume that a newly discovered bird species can fly unless we have evidence suggesting otherwise. Default reasoning is closely related to non-monotonic logic, as both deal with reasoning under uncertainty and the possibility of revising conclusions based on new information."
