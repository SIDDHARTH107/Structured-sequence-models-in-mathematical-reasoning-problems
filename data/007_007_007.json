    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 12, 14, and 46, which is 2. This gives us:\n\n6x + 7y = 23\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution for this simplified equation. To do this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of 7 modulo 6. \n\nExtended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. 6 = 1 * 7 + (-1)\n2. 7 = (-1) * (-1) + 1\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that the modular inverse of 7 modulo 6 is -1. Now, we can multiply both sides of the simplified equation by the modular inverse of 7 modulo 6:\n\n(-1) * (6x + 7y) = (-1) * 23\n-6x - 7y = -23\n\nNow, we can add 6x to both sides to isolate y:\n\n-7y = 6x - 23\n\nNow, we can find a particular solution by trying different integer values for x until we find an integer value for y. Let's try x = 1:\n\n-7y = 6(1) - 23\n-7y = -17\ny = 17/7\n\nSince y is not an integer, we can try x = 2:\n\n-7y = 6(2) - 23\n-7y = -11\ny = 11/7\n\nAgain, y is not an integer. Let's try x = 3:\n\n-7y = 6(3) - 23\n-7y = -5\ny = 5/7\n\nStill not an integer. Let's try x = 4:\n\n-7y = 6(4) - 23\n-7y = 1\ny = -1\n\nFinally, we have found a particular solution: (x, y) = (4, -1).\n\nNow, we need to find the general solution. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\n(x, y) = (x0 + k * b/gcd(a, b), y0 - k * a/gcd(a, b))\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is the particular solution, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the simplified equation, gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, and k is an integer.\n\nIn our case, (x0, y0) = (4, -1), a = 6, b = 7, gcd(a, b) = 1, and k is an integer. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(x, y) = (4 + 7k, -1 - 6k)\n\nThis is the general solution for the Diophantine equation 12x + 14y = 46."
