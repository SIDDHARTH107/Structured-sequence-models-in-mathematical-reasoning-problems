    "message_1": "How many ways are there to arrange a sequence of 8 parenthesis such that they are balanced (i.e. every open parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The number of balanced parentheses sequences of length 2n can be represented by the nth Catalan number, which is given by the formula:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nIn this case, we have 8 parentheses, so n = 4. Plugging this into the formula:\n\nC_4 = (1/(4+1)) * (8! / (4! * 4!))\n\nC_4 = (1/5) * (40320 / (24 * 24))\n\nC_4 = (1/5) * (40320 / 576)\n\nC_4 = 14\n\nSo there are 14 ways to arrange a sequence of 8 parentheses such that they are balanced."
