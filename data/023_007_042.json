    "message_2": "To find the time-domain representation of the signal, we need to perform the inverse Fourier transform. The inverse Fourier transform formula is given by:\n\nx(t) = Σ[X(f) * e^(j * 2 * π * f * t)]\n\nwhere x(t) is the time-domain signal, X(f) is the amplitude of the frequency component, f is the frequency, t is the time, and j is the imaginary unit (sqrt(-1)).\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation:\n\n| Frequency (Hz) | Amplitude |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| 0 | 20 |\n| 1 | 10 |\n| 2 | 5 |\n| 3 | 2 |\n| 4 | 1 |\n\nWe can calculate the time-domain representation x(t) as follows:\n\nx(t) = 20 * e^(j * 2 * π * 0 * t) + 10 * e^(j * 2 * π * 1 * t) + 5 * e^(j * 2 * π * 2 * t) + 2 * e^(j * 2 * π * 3 * t) + 1 * e^(j * 2 * π * 4 * t)\n\nx(t) = 20 + 10 * (cos(2 * π * t) + j * sin(2 * π * t)) + 5 * (cos(4 * π * t) + j * sin(4 * π * t)) + 2 * (cos(6 * π * t) + j * sin(6 * π * t)) + 1 * (cos(8 * π * t) + j * sin(8 * π * t))\n\nThis is the time-domain representation of the signal. Note that the result is a complex function of time, with real and imaginary parts. In practice, the real part represents the actual time-domain signal, while the imaginary part is often discarded or used for other purposes (e.g., phase information)."
