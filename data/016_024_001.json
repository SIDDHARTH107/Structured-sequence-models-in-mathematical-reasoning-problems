    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is formed by dividing a square into 9 equal smaller squares and removing the central square, then repeating the process for each of the remaining 8 squares, and so on.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the side length of each small square that makes up the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated as follows:\n\nSide length of small square = (Original side length) / (3^iterations)\nSide length of small square = 6 / (3^4)\nSide length of small square = 6 / 81\nSide length of small square = 2/27 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of small squares that make up the perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet after 4 iterations. In each iteration, the number of squares on the perimeter increases by a factor of 8 (since each remaining square is replaced by 8 smaller squares). So, after 4 iterations:\n\nNumber of squares on the perimeter = 8^iterations\nNumber of squares on the perimeter = 8^4\nNumber of squares on the perimeter = 4096\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet after 4 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of squares on the perimeter) * (Side length of small square)\nPerimeter = 4096 * (2/27)\nPerimeter = 8192/27 units"
