    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B △ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B △ A is equal to A △ B.\n\nB △ A = A △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A △ B) and (B △ A):\n\n(A △ B) ∩ (B △ A) = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's compare this to the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nAs we can see, the intersection of (A △ B) and (B △ A) is not equal to A ∩ B:\n\n{1, 4} ≠ {2, 3}"
