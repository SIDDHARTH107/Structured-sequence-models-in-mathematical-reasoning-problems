    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the input signal x(t). Since x(t) is a square wave with amplitude A and frequency f, its Fourier series representation can be given by:\n\nx(t) = A * sum((-1)^((n-1)/2) * (2/(n * π)) * sin(n * 2πf * t), n = 1, 3, 5, ...)\n\nNow, let's take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\nY(ω) + 4jωY(ω) + 5Y(ω) = X(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) and X(ω) are the Fourier transforms of y(t) and x(t), respectively.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\nY(ω) * (1 + 4jω + 5) = X(ω)\n\nNow, we can find Y(ω) by dividing both sides by (1 + 4jω + 5):\n\nY(ω) = X(ω) / (1 + 4jω + 5)\n\nNext, we need to find the Fourier coefficients of the output signal y(t). To do this, we can substitute the Fourier series representation of x(t) into the equation for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = sum(A * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (2/(n * π)) * (δ(ω - n * 2πf) - δ(ω + n * 2πf)) / (1 + 4jω + 5), n = 1, 3, 5, ...)\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to obtain the Fourier coefficients of the output signal y(t):\n\ny(t) = sum(A * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (2/(n * π)) * sin(n * 2πf * t) / (1 + 4j * n * 2πf + 5), n = 1, 3, 5, ...)\n\nThese are the Fourier coefficients of the output signal y(t) for a given value of A and f."
