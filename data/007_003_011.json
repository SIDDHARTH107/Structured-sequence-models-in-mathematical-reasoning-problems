    "message_2": "To find the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies both conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the integer we are looking for. We have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 5 (mod 9)\n\nWe can solve this system using the following steps:\n\n1. Find the product of the moduli: N = 7 * 9 = 63\n2. Compute the modular inverses:\n   - N1 = N / 7 = 9, and its modular inverse M1 ≡ 9^(-1) (mod 7)\n   - N2 = N / 9 = 7, and its modular inverse M2 ≡ 7^(-1) (mod 9)\n3. Calculate x using the formula: x = (4 * N1 * M1 + 5 * N2 * M2) % N\n\nNow, let's find the modular inverses:\n\nM1 ≡ 9^(-1) (mod 7)\n9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n2 * 4 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nSo, M1 = 4\n\nM2 ≡ 7^(-1) (mod 9)\n7 ≡ -2 (mod 9)\n-2 * -5 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\nSo, M2 = -5 or 4 (mod 9)\n\nNow, let's calculate x:\n\nx = (4 * 9 * 4 + 5 * 7 * 4) % 63\nx = (144 + 140) % 63\nx = 284 % 63\nx = 40\n\nSo, the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies both conditions is 40."
