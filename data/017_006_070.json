    "message_2": "A group G of order 35 has the order as the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following structures:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 35, denoted as Z_35.\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, denoted as Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nTo determine which structure G has, we can use the fact that the number of elements of order 5 and 7 in G must be equal to the Euler's totient function values of 5-1 and 7-1, which are 4 and 6, respectively. Since 4 and 6 are coprime, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, i.e., G ≅ Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nTo give an explicit isomorphism, let's define a function φ: G → Z_5 × Z_7. Let g be an element in G, and let g_5 and g_7 be its projections onto the cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. Then, we can define φ(g) = (g_5, g_7). This function is an isomorphism because it preserves the group operation and has an inverse function.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 35 is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, and an explicit isomorphism is given by the function φ(g) = (g_5, g_7)."
