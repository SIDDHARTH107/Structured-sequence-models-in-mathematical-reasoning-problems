    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 2, -3), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nThe surface is given by the equation F(x, y, z) = x^2 - y^2 - z = 0. We can compute the gradient of F as follows:\n\n∇F = (Fx, Fy, Fz) = (2x, -2y, -1)\n\nAt the point (1, 2, -3), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(1, 2, -3) = (2, -4, -1)\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = (∇F • ∇F) = (2^2 + (-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = 21\nF = 0 (since the surface is given by an equation of the form z = f(x, y))\nG = (∇F • ∇F) = (2^2 + (-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = 21\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients. We need the second derivatives of F:\n\nFxx = 2\nFyy = -2\nFxy = Fyx = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = Fxx / |∇F| = 2 / sqrt(21)\nM = Fxy / |∇F| = 0 / sqrt(21) = 0\nN = Fyy / |∇F| = -2 / sqrt(21)\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(kI - (Second fundamental form)) = 0\n\nThis gives us the equation:\n\n(k - L)(k - N) - M^2 = 0\n(k - 2/sqrt(21))(-k - 2/sqrt(21)) - 0^2 = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = 2/sqrt(21)\nk2 = -2/sqrt(21)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 2, -3) are 2/sqrt(21) and -2/sqrt(21)."
