    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted by A', consists of all the elements in U that are not in A. Since the universal set U is not provided, we cannot find the exact complement of set A.\n\nHowever, we can still prove that the complement of set A is unique. Let's assume that there are two different complements of set A, denoted by A' and B'. By definition, both A' and B' contain all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element x. If x is in A', then by definition, x is not in A. Since B' also contains all the elements not in A, x must also be in B'. Similarly, if x is in B', then x is not in A, and x must also be in A'. Therefore, for any element x, x is in A' if and only if x is in B'. This means that A' and B' have the same elements, and thus, A' = B'. This proves that the complement of set A is unique."
