    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 players in a beauty contest game. Each player is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the person whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen. If two or more players choose the same number and it is closest to 2/3 of the average, then they will share the victory equally. What number should each player choose to maximize their chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chance of winning, each player should try to predict what the other players will choose and then select a number that is 2/3 of the average of those predicted choices. This is because the winning number is determined by the 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen.\n\nLet's assume that all players think rationally and know that everyone else is also rational. In this case, all players would expect others to choose a number between 0 and 100. The average of numbers between 0 and 100 is 50, so a rational player would choose 2/3 of 50, which is 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think that everyone else will choose 33.33, then the new average would be 33.33, and the winning number would be 2/3 of 33.33, which is approximately 22.22. This process can be repeated, with each iteration leading to a lower winning number.\n\nThis process converges to 0, as players continue to adjust their choices based on the assumption that others will also adjust their choices. In practice, however, not all players may think this way or adjust their choices accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, to maximize their chance of winning, a player should choose a number close to 0, as this is the number that the iterative process of rational thinking converges to. However, it's important to note that this strategy may not guarantee a win, as other players may not follow the same rational thought process."
