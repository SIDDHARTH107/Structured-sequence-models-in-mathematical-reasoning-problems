    "message_2": "Let's consider an odd integer n. By definition, an odd integer can be written in the form n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the square of n:\n\nn^2 = (2k + 1)^2\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, we can expand this expression:\n\nn^2 = (2k)^2 + 2(2k)(1) + (1)^2\nn^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\nNow, let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\nn^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\n\nSince 2k^2 + 2k is an integer (let's call it m), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nn^2 = 2m + 1\n\nThis is the same form as our original definition of an odd integer. Therefore, the square of an odd integer is also odd. QED."
