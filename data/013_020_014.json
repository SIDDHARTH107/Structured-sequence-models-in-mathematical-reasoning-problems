    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest Game, there are 10 participants who are asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game will be the participant whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all chosen numbers. If multiple participants have the same distance to two-thirds of the average, they will share the prize. What number should you choose to have the highest chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning, you should assume that the other participants are also trying to maximize their chances. This means that they will also choose numbers based on the same logic. Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. If all participants choose a number between 0 and 100, the maximum average would be 100, and two-thirds of that would be 200/3 ≈ 66.67. So, it's reasonable to assume that no one would choose a number greater than 66.67.\n\n2. Now, if all participants choose a number between 0 and 66.67, the maximum average would be 66.67, and two-thirds of that would be 400/9 ≈ 44.44. So, it's reasonable to assume that no one would choose a number greater than 44.44.\n\n3. Continuing this process, we can see that the range of possible numbers keeps getting smaller. However, this process converges to a specific number rather than continuing indefinitely.\n\nLet x be the number you should choose. If all participants choose x, then the average will also be x, and two-thirds of the average will be (2/3)x. To maximize your chances of winning, you should choose a number that is closest to (2/3)x.\n\nx = (2/3)x\n\nTo solve for x, divide both sides by (2/3):\n\nx / (2/3) = 1\n\nx * (3/2) = 1\n\nx = 1 * (2/3)\n\nx ≈ 0.67\n\nHowever, since the minimum number that can be chosen is 0, you should choose 1 to have the highest chance of winning. This is because 1 is the closest integer to the calculated value of 0.67."
