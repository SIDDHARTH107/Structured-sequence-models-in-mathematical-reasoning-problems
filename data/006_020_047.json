    "message_1": "In a community, 30% of the households own a dog and 20% of the households own a cat. If a household is selected at random, find the probability that it owns both a dog and a cat.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected household owns both a dog and a cat, we need to know the percentage of households that own both pets. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine this directly. We need additional information about the relationship between dog and cat ownership in the community, such as the percentage of households that own neither or the percentage that own at least one of the two pets."
