    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the root of a function. The formula for the method is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere x0 is the initial approximation, x1 is the next approximation, f(x0) is the value of the function at x0, and f'(x0) is the value of the derivative of the function at x0.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5, let's first find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, let's apply the Newton-Raphson method with the initial approximation x0 = 2:\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 2(2) - 5 = 8 - 4 - 5 = -1\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) = 2 - (-1) / 10 = 2 + 1/10 = 2.1\n\nNow, we can continue iterating the method to get more accurate results. However, it's important to note that the Newton-Raphson method may not always converge to the correct root, and the number of iterations needed for an accurate result may vary. For this problem, I'll perform one more iteration:\n\nf(2.1) = (2.1)^3 - 2(2.1) - 5 ≈ -0.289\nf'(2.1) = 3(2.1)^2 - 2 ≈ 12.23\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1) ≈ 2.1 - (-0.289) / 12.23 ≈ 2.1236\n\nAfter two iterations, the approximation for the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 is x ≈ 2.1236. You can continue iterating for more accuracy if needed."
