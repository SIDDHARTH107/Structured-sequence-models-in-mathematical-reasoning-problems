    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Fourier series method, we first assume that the solution can be represented as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$T'(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n\nThe boundary conditions for $X(x)$ are:\n\n$$X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $\\lambda = n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. So, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(nx)$$\n\nNow, we solve the equation for $T(t)$:\n\n$$T'(t) + n^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = C_n e^{-n^2t}$$\n\nThe solution for the partial differential equation is the product of $X_n(x)$ and $T_n(t)$:\n\n$$u_n(x,t) = A_n\\sin(nx)e^{-n^2t}$$\n\nNow, we find the Fourier series for the initial condition $u(x,0) = x$:\n\n$$x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(nx)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we multiply both sides by $\\sin(mx)$ and integrate from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi} x\\sin(mx) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(nx)\\sin(mx) dx$$\n\nUsing integration by parts and the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} x\\sin(nx) dx$$\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2}{n\\pi}(-1)^{n+1}$$\n\nFinally, the solution for the given partial differential equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n\\pi}(-1)^{n+1}\\sin(nx)e^{-n^2t}$$"
