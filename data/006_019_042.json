    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen voter does not support the current ruling party, we need to first determine the number of voters who do not support the party. \n\nTotal number of voters = 500\nNumber of voters supporting the ruling party = 360\n\nNumber of voters not supporting the ruling party = Total number of voters - Number of voters supporting the ruling party\n= 500 - 360\n= 140\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a randomly chosen voter not supporting the ruling party:\n\nProbability = (Number of voters not supporting the ruling party) / (Total number of voters)\n= 140 / 500\n= 0.28\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen voter does not support the current ruling party is 0.28 or 28%."
