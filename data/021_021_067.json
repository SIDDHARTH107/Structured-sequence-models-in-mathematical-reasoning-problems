    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The profit obtained from selling Product A is $6 per unit, and the profit obtained from selling Product B is $8 per unit. The factory can produce a maximum of 200 units per week due to resource constraints. An order for at least 120 units of Product A must be filled each week. Using the cuckoo search algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B the factory should produce to maximize the weekly profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and the search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 6A + 8B, where A is the number of units of Product A and B is the number of units of Product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. A + B ≤ 200 (maximum production capacity)\n2. A ≥ 120 (minimum order for Product A)\n\nSearch space: A ∈ [120, 200] and B ∈ [0, 80]\n\nNow, let's apply the cuckoo search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of \"nests\" (solutions) with random values of A and B within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each nest.\n3. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n4. If the new solution has a better fitness (higher profit), replace the original nest with the new solution.\n5. Perform \"brood parasitism\" by replacing a fraction of the worst nests with new random solutions.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory profit level).\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we will obtain the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B that maximize the weekly profit. Note that the specific results may vary depending on the random nature of the algorithm and the chosen parameters (e.g., population size, number of iterations, etc.). However, the optimal solution should be close to producing 120 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B, which would result in a maximum weekly profit of $1,200 (6 * 120) + $640 (8 * 80) = $1,840."
