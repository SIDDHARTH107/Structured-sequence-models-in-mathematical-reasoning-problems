    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 4)/(4x^2 + x) as x approaches infinity, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x, which in this case is x^2.\n\nf(x) = (3x^2/x^2 - 2x/x^2 + 4/x^2) / (4x^2/x^2 + x/x^2)\n\nf(x) = (3 - 2/x + 4/x^2) / (4 + 1/x)\n\nAs x approaches infinity, the terms with x in the denominator will approach 0:\n\nlim (x -> ∞) (2/x) = 0\nlim (x -> ∞) (4/x^2) = 0\nlim (x -> ∞) (1/x) = 0\n\nSo, the function simplifies to:\n\nf(x) = (3 - 0 + 0) / (4 + 0)\n\nf(x) = 3/4\n\nTherefore, the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 4)/(4x^2 + x) as x approaches infinity is 3/4."
