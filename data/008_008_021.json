    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of tables: Type A and Type B. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of Type A and 3 hours to produce one unit of Type B. The profit per unit of Type A is $100 and per unit of Type B is $150. The manufacturer has 40 hours of labor each week available for the production of tables. How many units of Type A and Type B should the manufacturer produce to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Type A tables produced and y be the number of Type B tables produced.\n\nThe time constraint can be represented as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 40\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = 100x + 150y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the constraint equation is an equality:\n2x + 3y = 40\n\nIf x = 0:\n2(0) + 3y = 40\ny = 40/3 ≈ 13.33\n\nIf y = 0:\n2x + 3(0) = 40\nx = 20\n\nSo, we have two points (0, 13.33) and (20, 0). Now we'll find the slope of the constraint line:\nm = (0 - 13.33) / (20 - 0) = -13.33 / 20 = -2/3\n\nSince the constraint is 2x + 3y ≤ 40, the feasible region is below the line. We'll check the integer points in the feasible region near the line:\n\n1. (0, 13): P(0, 13) = 100(0) + 150(13) = $1950\n2. (20, 0): P(20, 0) = 100(20) + 150(0) = $2000\n3. (10, 6): P(10, 6) = 100(10) + 150(6) = $1900\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved when producing 20 units of Type A and 0 units of Type B, with a profit of $2000."
