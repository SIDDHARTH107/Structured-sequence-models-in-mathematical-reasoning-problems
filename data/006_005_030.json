    "message_1": "A company wants to predict the probability of selling 2000 units of a product within the next 4 weeks. Based on historical data, it is estimated that there is a 65% chance of selling 500 units in a week. What is the probability that the company will sell 2000 units within the next 4 weeks?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of selling k sets of 500 units in n weeks\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n weeks taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of selling 500 units in a week (0.65)\n- n is the number of weeks (4)\n- k is the number of successful weeks needed to sell 2000 units (4, since 4 * 500 = 2000)\n\nWe want to find the probability of selling 2000 units within the next 4 weeks, which means selling 500 units each week for 4 weeks. So, we need to find P(X = 4).\n\nFirst, let's find C(4, 4):\nC(4, 4) = 4! / (4!(0!)) = 1\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\nP(X = 4) = C(4, 4) * p^4 * (1-p)^(4-4)\nP(X = 4) = 1 * (0.65)^4 * (1-0.65)^(0)\nP(X = 4) = 1 * (0.65)^4 * (0.35)^0\nP(X = 4) = 1 * 0.17850625 * 1\nP(X = 4) â‰ˆ 0.1785\n\nSo, the probability that the company will sell 2000 units within the next 4 weeks is approximately 17.85%."
