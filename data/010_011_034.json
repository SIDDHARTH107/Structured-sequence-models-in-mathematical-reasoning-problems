    "message_2": "Let's consider a connected, orientable 2-dimensional manifold M with genus 3. This means that M is a surface that can be formed by taking a sphere and attaching three handles to it. In other words, M is a surface with three \"holes\" or \"tunnels.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the complement of a point in M, which we can denote as M - {p}, where p is the point we are removing from M.\n\nSince M is connected, removing a single point p from it will not disconnect the surface. This is because there will still be paths between any two points on the surface that do not pass through the removed point p.\n\nTherefore, the complement of a point in M, M - {p}, has only one connected component."
