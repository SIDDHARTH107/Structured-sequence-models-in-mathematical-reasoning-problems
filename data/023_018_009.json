    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to the input signal x(t) = 2 sin(3t) using Fourier transform, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal. The Laplace transform of sin(at) is given by:\n\nL{sin(at)} = a / (s^2 + a^2)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of x(t) = 2 sin(3t) is:\n\nX(s) = L{2 sin(3t)} = 6 / (s^2 + 9)\n\nNow, we can find the output signal in the frequency domain by multiplying the transfer function H(s) with the Laplace transform of the input signal X(s):\n\nY(s) = H(s) * X(s) = [(5s + 1) / (s^2 + 10s + 25)] * [6 / (s^2 + 9)]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get the output signal y(t) in the time domain. To do this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to break Y(s) into simpler terms:\n\nY(s) = A / (s + 5) + B / (s^2 + 9)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the common denominator, we get:\n\n6(5s + 1) = A(s^2 + 9) + B(s + 5)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by substituting suitable values for s:\n\n1. s = -5:\n6(5(-5) + 1) = A((-5)^2 + 9)\nA = -30 / 16 = -15 / 8\n\n2. s = 0:\n6(5(0) + 1) = B(0 + 5)\nB = 6 / 5\n\nNow we can rewrite Y(s) as:\n\nY(s) = (-15/8) / (s + 5) + (6/5) / (s^2 + 9)\n\nNow we can find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)} = L^(-1){(-15/8) / (s + 5)} + L^(-1){(6/5) / (s^2 + 9)}\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of 1 / (s + a) is e^(-at), and the inverse Laplace transform of a / (s^2 + a^2) is sin(at). So, we have:\n\ny(t) = (-15/8) * e^(-5t) + (6/5) * sin(3t)\n\nThe first term represents the transient response, and the second term represents the steady-state response. Since we are only interested in the steady-state response, we can ignore the transient response:\n\ny_ss(t) = (6/5) * sin(3t)\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system to the input signal x(t) = 2 sin(3t) is y_ss(t) = (6/5) * sin(3t)."
