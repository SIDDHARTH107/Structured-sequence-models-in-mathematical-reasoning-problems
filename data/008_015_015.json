    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n9 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n20\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cholesky decomposition of A, which is a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T such that A = LL^T. However, the matrix A is not symmetric, and Cholesky decomposition requires a symmetric positive definite matrix. Therefore, we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations directly.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or iterative methods to solve this system of linear equations."
