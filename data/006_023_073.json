    "message_1": "Suppose that a grocery store stocks 200 boxes of cereal, 100 of which are Chocolate Flavored and 100 are Strawberry Flavored. It is known that 60% of shoppers prefer Chocolate Flavored cereal. If a customer selects a box of cereal at random from the store, what is the probability that they will select a box of Strawberry Flavored cereal?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a box of Strawberry Flavored cereal, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of Strawberry Flavored cereal boxes, which is 100. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cereal boxes, which is 200.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a box of Strawberry Flavored cereal is:\n\nProbability = 100 / 200 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a box of Strawberry Flavored cereal is 0.5 or 50%."
