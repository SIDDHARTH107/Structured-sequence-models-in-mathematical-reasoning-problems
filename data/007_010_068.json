    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given information can be written as:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\n\nWe can start by finding a number that satisfies the first congruence and then check if it also satisfies the second congruence. If not, we can keep adding multiples of 3 (since the first congruence involves 3) until we find a number that satisfies both congruences.\n\nLet's start with the first congruence:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nThe smallest positive integer value that satisfies this congruence is x = 1 (since 1 % 3 = 1).\n\nNow let's check if this value also satisfies the second congruence:\n\n1 ≡ 2 (mod 5)\n\nThis is not true (since 1 % 5 ≠ 2). So, let's add a multiple of 3 to our current value of x (1) and check again:\n\nx = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow let's check if this new value satisfies both congruences:\n\n4 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => 4 % 3 = 1 (True)\n4 ≡ 2 (mod 5) => 4 % 5 = 4 (False)\n\nSince the second congruence is not satisfied, let's add another multiple of 3:\n\nx = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nNow let's check if this new value satisfies both congruences:\n\n7 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => 7 % 3 = 1 (True)\n7 ≡ 2 (mod 5) => 7 % 5 = 2 (True)\n\nBoth congruences are satisfied, so the smallest possible positive integer value of x is 7."
