    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using matrix methods, we'll first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  4 | 10 ]\n[ 1 -1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 3  2 -1 |  4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll use Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix to its row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 2  3  4 | 10 ]\n[ 3  2 -1 |  4 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 0  5  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  5 -7 | -11 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 5:\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  5 -7 | -11 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 + Row 2 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 5 * Row 2:\n```\n[ 1  0  2 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0 -7 | -11 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by -7:\n```\n[ 1  0  2 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 11/7 ]\n```\n\n6. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - 2 * Row 3:\n```\n[ 1  0  0 | -3/7 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 11/7 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in its row-echelon form, and we can read the solutions for x, y, and z:\n\nx = -3/7\ny = 0\nz = 11/7"
