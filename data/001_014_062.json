    "message_2": "To simplify the square root of 72, we can find the prime factors of 72 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n72 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3\n\nWe have two pairs of the same factor: 2 × 2 and 3 × 3. We can rewrite the square root of 72 as:\n\n√(2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3) = √(2² × 2 × 3²)\n\nNow, we can take the square root of each pair of the same factor:\n\n2 × 3 = 6\n\nSo, the simplified square root of 72 is 6√2."
