    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∪ B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∪ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find B ∪ A:\n\nB ∪ A = {3, 4, 5, 6} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find A ∆ (B ∪ A):\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = {5, 6}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∪ B and A ∆ (B ∪ A):\n\n((A ∆ B) ∪ B) ∆ (A ∆ (B ∪ A)) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∆ {5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union. We want to show that A ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) for any sets A, B, and C.\n\nLet x be an element in A ∆ (B ∪ C). Then, x is in A or (B ∪ C), but not both. There are two cases:\n\n1. x is in A, but not in (B ∪ C). This means x is in A, but not in B or C. So, x is in A ∆ B and x is in A ∆ C. Therefore, x is in (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C).\n\n2. x is in (B ∪ C), but not in A. This means x is in B or C, but not in A. So, x is in A ∆ B or x is in A ∆ C. Therefore, x is in (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C).\n\nNow, let x be an element in (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C). Then, x is in A ∆ B or x is in A ∆ C. There are two cases:\n\n1. x is in A ∆ B. This means x is in A or B, but not both. If x is in A, but not in B, then x is in A and not in (B ∪ C), so x is in A ∆ (B ∪ C). If x is in B, but not in A, then x is in (B ∪ C), but not in A, so x is in A ∆ (B ∪ C).\n\n2. x is in A ∆ C. This means x is in A or C, but not both. If x is in A, but not in C, then x is in A and not in (B ∪ C), so x is in A ∆ (B ∪ C). If x is in C, but not in A, then x is in (B ∪ C), but not in A, so x is in A ∆ (B ∪ C).\n\nIn both cases, x is in A ∆ (B ∪ C). Therefore, A ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C), and the symmetric difference is distributive over union."
