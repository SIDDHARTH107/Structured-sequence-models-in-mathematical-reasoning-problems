    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 3∂²u/∂x²\n\nSubjected to the following initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = 2x + 1\n\nFind the solution to the equation given the initial condition at time t = 2 and on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t), where X(x) is a function of x only and T(t) is a function of t only. Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 3X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = 3X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = 3X''(x)/X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) T'(t) = -λT(t)\n2) X''(x) = -(λ/3)X(x)\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt), where C is a constant.\n\nSolving the second ODE, we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√(λ/3)x) + B*sin(√(λ/3)x), where A and B are constants.\n\nNow, we have u(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = (A*cos(√(λ/3)x) + B*sin(√(λ/3)x)) * Ce^(-λt)\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x, 0) = 2x + 1:\n\n2x + 1 = (A*cos(√(λ/3)x) + B*sin(√(λ/3)x)) * C\n\nSince the initial condition is a linear function, we can use the Fourier sine series to represent it:\n\n2x + 1 = Σ[(B_n * sin(nπx))], where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we can use the formula:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx, where L is the length of the interval (in this case, L = 1).\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[(2x + 1) * sin(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\nB_n = 2 * [(2x + 1) * (-cos(nπx)/(nπ)) - ∫(-cos(nπx)/(nπ))dx] from 0 to 1\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-2x - 1) * cos(nπx)/(nπ) + (sin(nπx)/((nπ)^2))] from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-2 - 1) * cos(nπ)/(nπ) + (sin(nπ)/((nπ)^2)) - (1 * cos(0)/(nπ) + (sin(0)/((nπ)^2)))]\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-3 * cos(nπ)/(nπ)) + (sin(nπ)/((nπ)^2))]\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(x, t) as:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ[(B_n * sin(nπx)) * Ce^(-λt)]\n\nFinally, we want to find the solution at time t = 2 and on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1:\n\nu(x, 2) = Σ[(B_n * sin(nπx)) * Ce^(-λ(2))]\n\nSince we are asked to round our answer to two decimal places, we can truncate the series after a few terms (say, 5 terms) to get an approximate solution:\n\nu(x, 2) ≈ Σ[(B_n * sin(nπx)) * Ce^(-λ(2))] for n = 1 to 5\n\nTo get the most accurate result, you can calculate the B_n values for n = 1 to 5 and substitute them into the equation above. Then, evaluate the sum for the given interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1."
