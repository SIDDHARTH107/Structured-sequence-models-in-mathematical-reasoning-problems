    "message_2": "First, let's recall the Sylow theorems, which will be useful in our analysis:\n\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible isomorphic structures for G.\n\n1. C120:\n\nC120 is the cyclic group of order 120. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, we know that C120 is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2 × C3 × C5. Since G has order 120, it has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 24 (120/5) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 40 (120/3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must also be normal. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 5. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 15. By the second isomorphism theorem, G has a subgroup isomorphic to C3 × C5, which is isomorphic to C15. Now, G has a normal subgroup of order 15, and since 120/15 = 8, G has a subgroup of order 8. By the first Sylow theorem, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which can be either C8, C4 × C2, or C2 × C2 × C2. Since G has a normal subgroup of order 15, by the direct product theorem, G can be isomorphic to C120, which is the direct product of C15 and one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Therefore, G can have the isomorphic structure C120.\n\n2. A5 × C2 × C2:\n\nA5 is the alternating group of degree 5, which has order 60. The order of G is 120, so the order of A5 × C2 × C2 is also 120. Since A5 is a simple group, it has no nontrivial normal subgroups. Therefore, G cannot have the isomorphic structure A5 × C2 × C2, as it would imply that G has a nontrivial normal subgroup.\n\n3. Any of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120:\n\nSince we have shown that G can have the isomorphic structure C120, it is possible that G is isomorphic to one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. However, we cannot determine which specific non-abelian group G is isomorphic to without further information.\n\nIn conclusion, G can have the isomorphic structure C120, but it cannot have the isomorphic structure A5 × C2 × C2. G may also be isomorphic to one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, but we cannot determine which specific non-abelian group without further information."
