    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 7 with respect to x using the power rule, we apply the rule to each term separately. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 3x^4:\nn = 4, so the derivative is 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\n\nFor the second term, -2x^2:\nn = 2, so the derivative is 2 * -2x^(2-1) = -4x.\n\nFor the third term, 7:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 0\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 7 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x"
