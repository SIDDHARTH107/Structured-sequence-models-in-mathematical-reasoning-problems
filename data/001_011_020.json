    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation (2x-5)/(x+3) = 1/2, we will first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD), which in this case is 2(x+3).\n\n2(x+3) * (2x-5)/(x+3) = 1/2 * 2(x+3)\n\nThe (x+3) terms cancel out on the left side:\n\n2(2x-5) = (x+3)\n\nNow, distribute the 2 on the left side:\n\n4x - 10 = x + 3\n\nNext, we'll isolate the x terms by subtracting x from both sides:\n\n4x - x - 10 = x - x + 3\n\n3x - 10 = 3\n\nNow, we'll isolate the x term by adding 10 to both sides:\n\n3x - 10 + 10 = 3 + 10\n\n3x = 13\n\nFinally, we'll solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n3x/3 = 13/3\n\nx = 13/3\n\nSo, the solution to the rational equation (2x-5)/(x+3) = 1/2 is x = 13/3."
