If the minimum daily production requirement is 900 products, how many days are needed to produce enough products using at least two of the factories?\n\n(Note: The problem involves using the \"with\" operator in linear logic which combines resources.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the combinations of at least two factories that can produce a minimum of 900 products per day. The factories produce 200, 350, and 500 products per day, respectively. Let's find the possible combinations:\n\n1. Factories 1 and 2: 200 + 350 = 550 products per day\n2. Factories 1 and 3: 200 + 500 = 700 products per day\n3. Factories 2 and 3: 350 + 500 = 850 products per day\n4. Factories 1, 2, and 3: 200 + 350 + 500 = 1050 products per day\n\nOnly the combination of all three factories can produce at least 900 products per day. Therefore, it would take 1 day to produce enough products using all three factories."
