    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a diameter of 40 meters and makes one full revolution in 60 seconds. A person on the Ferris wheel is at the bottommost point at time t=0. \n\nWhat is the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal function that models the height of the person above the ground as a function of time?",
    "message_2": "The amplitude of the sinusoidal function is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which represents the maximum height a person can be above or below the center of the wheel. Since the diameter is 40 meters, the amplitude is:\n\nAmplitude = (1/2) * 40 meters = 20 meters\n\nThe period of the sinusoidal function is the time it takes for the Ferris wheel to make one full revolution. In this case, it takes 60 seconds for one full revolution, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = 60 seconds"
