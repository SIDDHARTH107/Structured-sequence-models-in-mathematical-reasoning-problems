    "message_2": "If A is a set with 4 elements, then the number of elements in the power set of A is given by 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A. In this case, n = 4, so the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, let's prove that the number of elements in the power set of A is always greater than the number of elements in A. Let A be a set with n elements. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), contains all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nFor each element in A, there are two possibilities: either it is included in a subset or it is not. Therefore, for n elements, there are 2^n possible subsets, which is the number of elements in P(A).\n\nSince n ≥ 0, we have 2^n ≥ 2^0 = 1. If n = 0, then A is the empty set, and P(A) contains only the empty set, so |P(A)| = 1 > |A| = 0. If n > 0, then 2^n > 2^0 = 1, and since 2^n is an increasing function for n > 0, we have 2^n > n for all n > 0.\n\nThus, the number of elements in the power set of A is always greater than the number of elements in A."
