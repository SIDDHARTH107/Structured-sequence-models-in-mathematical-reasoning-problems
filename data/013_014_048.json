    "message_1": "On an online auction platform, there are three buyers and one seller. Each buyer has a maximum price they are willing to pay for the item being sold, and the seller wants to maximize their profit. Using mechanism design, design an auction that maximizes the revenue for the seller while ensuring that the auction is truthful (i.e., buyers will bid their true maximum price).\n\nAssume the following maximum prices for each buyer:\n\nBuyer 1: $100\nBuyer 2: $80\nBuyer 3: $120\n\nWhat auction mechanism should the seller use to maximize their revenue while ensuring that buyers bid truthfully? What would be the revenue for the seller under this mechanism?",
    "message_2": "The seller should use a second-price (Vickrey) auction mechanism to maximize their revenue while ensuring that buyers bid truthfully. In a second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the price submitted by the second-highest bidder. This mechanism incentivizes buyers to bid their true maximum price because they know they will only pay the second-highest bid if they win, so there is no advantage in underbidding or overbidding.\n\nIn this case, with the maximum prices for each buyer being:\n\nBuyer 1: $100\nBuyer 2: $80\nBuyer 3: $120\n\nBuyer 3 would win the auction with their $120 bid, but they would pay the second-highest bid, which is $100 from Buyer 1. Therefore, the revenue for the seller under this mechanism would be $100."
