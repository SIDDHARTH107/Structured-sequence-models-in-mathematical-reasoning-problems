    "message_1": "Suppose a farmer has 600 feet of fencing material and wants to enclose a rectangular pen next to a river using the river as one side of the pen. What are the dimensions of the pen that will maximize its area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the pen parallel to the river be x feet, and the width perpendicular to the river be y feet. Since the farmer is using the river as one side of the pen, he only needs to use fencing for the other three sides. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\nx + 2y = 600\n\nWe want to maximize the area A of the pen, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of x from the fencing equation:\n\ny = (600 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA = x((600 - x) / 2)\n\nA = (600x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo maximize the area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = (600 - 2x) / 2 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n600 - 2x = 0\n2x = 600\nx = 300\n\nNow, substitute this value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (600 - 300) / 2\ny = 300 / 2\ny = 150\n\nSo, the dimensions of the pen that will maximize its area are 300 feet parallel to the river and 150 feet perpendicular to the river."
