    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 2 > 16, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality:\n   3x + 2 - 2 > 16 - 2\n   3x > 14\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n   3x/3 > 14/3\n   x > 14/3\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x > 14/3, where x belongs to the set of real numbers."
