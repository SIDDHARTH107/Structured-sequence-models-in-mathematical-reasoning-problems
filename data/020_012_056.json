    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to optimize its profits by producing two types of products. Product A generates a profit of $10 per unit and requires 5 machine hours to produce, while Product B generates a profit of $15 per unit and requires 8 machine hours to produce. The company has 120 machine hours available per day. What is the maximum profit the company can generate each day if it produces both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe profit function is P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nThe constraint for the machine hours is 5x + 8y ≤ 120.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we will use the method of solving linear programming problems graphically.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for the constraint:\n\n5x + 8y ≤ 120\n\nWe can rewrite the constraint as:\n\ny ≤ (120 - 5x) / 8\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. We can do this by finding the points where the constraint equation is equal:\n\ny = (120 - 5x) / 8\n\nThe feasible region will be a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint equation intersects the x and y axes.\n\nWhen x = 0:\n\ny = (120 - 5(0)) / 8\ny = 120 / 8\ny = 15\n\nWhen y = 0:\n\nx = (120 - 8(0)) / 5\nx = 120 / 5\nx = 24\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 15) and (24, 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum profit at these vertices:\n\nP(0, 15) = 10(0) + 15(15) = 0 + 225 = $225\nP(24, 0) = 10(24) + 15(0) = 240 + 0 = $240\n\nThe maximum profit is $240 per day when the company produces 24 units of Product A and no units of Product B."
