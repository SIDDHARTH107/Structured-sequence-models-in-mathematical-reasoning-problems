    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of elements in each group:\n\n1. Cyclic group C10: This group has 10 elements, generated by a single element g, where the elements are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^9}.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5: This group has 10 elements, consisting of 5 rotations and 5 reflections of a regular pentagon. The elements can be represented as {r^k, sr^k} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10: There is no non-abelian group of order 10. To see this, let's use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 10 = 2 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, there must be a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so there can only be one Sylow 2-subgroup, which is then normal. Similarly, there can only be one Sylow 5-subgroup, which is also normal. Since both subgroups are normal, their product is the entire group G, and G must be a direct product of the two subgroups. The only possibility is G = C2 x C5, which is isomorphic to C10.\n\nNow, let's compare the group multiplication tables of C10 and D5. Since C10 is abelian, its group multiplication table is symmetric about the main diagonal. However, D5 is non-abelian, so its group multiplication table is not symmetric about the main diagonal. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to both C10 and D5.\n\nSince there is no non-abelian group of order 10, and G cannot be isomorphic to both C10 and D5, we conclude that G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10."
