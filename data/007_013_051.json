    "message_2": "Goldbach's conjecture is an unsolved problem in number theory that states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Since this conjecture has not been proven or disproven, it is impossible to provide the smallest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers according to Goldbach's conjecture."
