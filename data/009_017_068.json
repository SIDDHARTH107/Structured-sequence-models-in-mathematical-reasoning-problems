In a rectangular region with sides of length $1\\text{ m}$, assume that the electric field is given by\n\n$$\\vec{E}(x,y,z,t) = E_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right)\\hat{z}$$\n\nwhere $L = 0.1\\text{ m}$, $\\omega = 10^6\\text{ s}^{-1}$, and $E_0$ is the maximum magnitude of the electric field.\n\nFind the maximum magnitude of the electric field in the rectangular region, and determine the time it takes for the wave to travel from one corner of the region to the diagonally opposite corner.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum magnitude of the electric field in the rectangular region, we need to find the maximum value of the function:\n\n$$E(x,y,t) = E_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right)$$\n\nThe maximum value of the cosine function is 1, and the maximum value of the sine function is also 1. Therefore, the maximum magnitude of the electric field is simply:\n\n$$E_\\text{max} = E_0$$\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the wave to travel from one corner of the region to the diagonally opposite corner. The distance between these two corners is the diagonal of the rectangular region, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{3} \\text{ m}$$\n\nSince the wave travels at the speed of light, $c$, the time it takes for the wave to travel this distance is:\n\n$$t = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\text{ m}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 1.93 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$$\n\nSo, the maximum magnitude of the electric field in the rectangular region is $E_0$, and the time it takes for the wave to travel from one corner of the region to the diagonally opposite corner is approximately $1.93 \\times 10^{-9}$ seconds."
