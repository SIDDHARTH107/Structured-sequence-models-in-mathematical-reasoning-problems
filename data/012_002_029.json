    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph G, we need to find the chromatic number of the graph. The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, since the graph is connected and has vertices with degrees up to 4, we can start by considering the maximum degree of the graph, which is 4. A vertex with a degree of 4 has 4 adjacent vertices, so to ensure that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we would need at least 4 + 1 = 5 colors.\n\nHowever, we can try to find a coloring with fewer colors. Let's try with 4 colors:\n\n1. Color Vertex 3 (degree 4) with color A.\n2. Color its 4 adjacent vertices (let's say vertices 1, 2, 7, and 8) with colors B, C, D, and E, respectively.\n3. Now, Vertex 5 (degree 3) is adjacent to vertices 1, 2, and 8, which have colors B, C, and E, so we can color Vertex 5 with color D.\n4. Vertex 4 (degree 2) is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5, which have colors C and D, so we can color Vertex 4 with color B.\n5. Vertex 6 (degree 1) is adjacent to Vertex 1, which has color B, so we can color Vertex 6 with color C.\n6. Vertex 9 (degree 1) is adjacent to Vertex 7, which has color D, so we can color Vertex 9 with color A.\n7. Vertex 10 (degree 2) is adjacent to vertices 7 and 8, which have colors D and E, so we can color Vertex 10 with color B.\n\nIn this coloring, we have used only 4 colors (A, B, C, and D), and no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of this graph is 4."
