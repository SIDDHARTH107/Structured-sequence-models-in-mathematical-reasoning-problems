    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the volume of a sphere and the concept of related rates in calculus.\n\nThe volume V of a sphere with radius r is given by the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nWe are given that the volume is increasing at a rate of 5 cubic centimeters per second, which can be represented as dV/dt = 5 cm³/s. We want to find the rate at which the radius is increasing, represented as dr/dt, when the volume is 1350 cubic centimeters.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius when the volume is 1350 cm³. We can do this by plugging the volume into the formula and solving for r:\n\n1350 = (4/3)πr^3\n\nTo solve for r, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides by (4/3)π:\nr^3 = 1350 / [(4/3)π] = 1017.876\n\n2. Take the cube root of both sides:\nr = (1017.876)^(1/3) ≈ 10 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius when the volume is 1350 cm³, we can find the rate at which the radius is increasing. To do this, we will differentiate the volume formula with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = d/dt[(4/3)πr^3]\n\nSince (4/3)π is a constant, we can rewrite this as:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π * d/dt[r^3]\n\nNow, we will apply the chain rule to differentiate r^3 with respect to t:\n\nd/dt[r^3] = 3r^2 * dr/dt\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π * 3r^2 * dr/dt\n\nWe know that dV/dt = 5 cm³/s, and we found that r = 10 cm when V = 1350 cm³. We can now plug these values into the equation and solve for dr/dt:\n\n5 = (4/3)π * 3 * (10)^2 * dr/dt\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n5 = 400π * dr/dt\n\nNow, divide both sides by 400π to solve for dr/dt:\n\ndr/dt = 5 / (400π) ≈ 0.00398 cm/s\n\nSo, the radius of the balloon is increasing at a rate of approximately 0.00398 cm/s when its volume is 1350 cubic centimeters."
