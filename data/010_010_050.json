Let $a,b$ denote these critical points such that $f(a)>f(b)$. If $\\gamma(t)$ is a closed curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with winding number one around $a$ and winding number zero around $b$, determine the minimum possible number of critical points of $f\\circ\\gamma$ (the composition of $f$ with $\\gamma$).",
    "message_2": "Let $g(t) = f(\\gamma(t))$. We want to find the minimum possible number of critical points of $g(t)$. Since $\\gamma(t)$ is a closed curve with winding number one around $a$ and winding number zero around $b$, it must encircle $a$ but not $b$. \n\nConsider the level set $L = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : f(x) = f(a) - \\epsilon\\}$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$. Since $f(a) > f(b)$, we can choose $\\epsilon$ small enough such that $L$ encircles $a$ but not $b$. Moreover, since $f$ is smooth and $a$ is a non-degenerate critical point, $L$ is a simple closed curve around $a$. \n\nNow, let's analyze the function $g(t) = f(\\gamma(t))$. Since $\\gamma(t)$ has winding number one around $a$, it must intersect the level set $L$ at least once. Let $t_1$ be a point where this intersection occurs, i.e., $f(\\gamma(t_1)) = f(a) - \\epsilon$. Since $\\gamma(t)$ is a closed curve, there exists another point $t_2$ such that $f(\\gamma(t_2)) = f(a) - \\epsilon$. \n\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one point $t_0$ between $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that $f(\\gamma(t_0)) = f(a)$. Since $f(a)$ is a local maximum, $g'(t_0) = 0$, which means $t_0$ is a critical point of $g(t)$. \n\nSimilarly, since $\\gamma(t)$ does not encircle $b$, there must be a point $t_3$ such that $f(\\gamma(t_3)) = f(b)$. Since $f(b)$ is a local minimum, $g'(t_3) = 0$, which means $t_3$ is another critical point of $g(t)$. \n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of critical points of $f \\circ \\gamma$ is 2."
