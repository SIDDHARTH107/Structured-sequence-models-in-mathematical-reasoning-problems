    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to schedule the production of two products, product A and product B. Each unit of product A takes 4 hours to produce and generates a profit of $25. Each unit of product B takes 6 hours to produce and generates a profit of $30. The company has 160 hours of production time available per week. What is the optimal production schedule for the company to maximize its profit per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe time constraint can be represented as:\n4x + 6y ≤ 160\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = 25x + 30y\n\nTo find the optimal production schedule, we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function while satisfying the time constraint.\n\nFirst, we can try to express y in terms of x using the time constraint equation:\ny ≤ (160 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by taking the partial derivatives of the profit function with respect to x and y and setting them equal to 0:\n\n∂P/∂x = 25\n∂P/∂y = 30\n\nSince the partial derivatives are constants, there are no critical points in the interior of the feasible region. Therefore, we need to analyze the boundary of the feasible region.\n\nThe boundary of the feasible region is given by the equation:\n4x + 6y = 160\n\nWe can express y in terms of x:\ny = (160 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the profit function:\nP(x) = 25x + 30((160 - 4x) / 6)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\nP(x) = 25x + 30(80/3 - 2x/3)\nP(x) = 25x + 800 - 20x\nP(x) = 5x + 800\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers (as they represent the number of units produced), we can find the maximum profit by checking the integer values of x that satisfy the time constraint:\n\nx = 0: P(0) = 5(0) + 800 = 800\nx = 1: P(1) = 5(1) + 800 = 805\nx = 2: P(2) = 5(2) + 800 = 810\nx = 3: P(3) = 5(3) + 800 = 815\n...\nx = 40: P(40) = 5(40) + 800 = 1000\n\nWe can see that the maximum profit is achieved when x = 40, which corresponds to producing 40 units of product A. To find the number of units of product B, we can use the expression for y:\n\ny = (160 - 4x) / 6\ny = (160 - 4(40)) / 6\ny = (160 - 160) / 6\ny = 0\n\nSo, the optimal production schedule is to produce 40 units of product A and 0 units of product B, which will generate a maximum profit of $1000 per week."
