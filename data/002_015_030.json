    "message_1": "A circular garden has a radius of 5 meters. What is the perimeter of the garden in meters?",
    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circular garden is also known as its circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 meters, we can calculate the circumference:\n\nC = 2π(5)\nC = 10π\n\nApproximating π as 3.14, we get:\n\nC ≈ 10 * 3.14\nC ≈ 31.4 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the garden is approximately 31.4 meters."
