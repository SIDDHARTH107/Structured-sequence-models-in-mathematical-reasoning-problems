    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(8)³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(512)\n\nVolume = (2048/3)π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14159:\n\nVolume ≈ (2048/3) * 3.14159\n\nVolume ≈ 2144.66042 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 2144.66 cubic centimeters."
