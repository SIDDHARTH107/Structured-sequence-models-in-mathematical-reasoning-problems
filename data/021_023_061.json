    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex problems. In this case, we will use GWO to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- Initial population size: 5\n- Maximum iteration limit: 1000\n- Tolerance limit: 0.001\n\nStep 1: Initialize the grey wolf population\nGenerate 5 random positions (x-values) for the initial population of grey wolves.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fitness of each wolf\nEvaluate the function f(x) for each wolf's position and determine their fitness.\n\nStep 3: Identify the alpha, beta, and delta wolves\nThe alpha wolf is the one with the best fitness (lowest f(x) value), the beta wolf has the second-best fitness, and the delta wolf has the third-best fitness.\n\nStep 4: Update the positions of the wolves\nFor each iteration, update the positions of the wolves using the following equations:\n\nX_new = X_alpha - A * D_alpha\nY_new = X_beta - A * D_beta\nZ_new = X_delta - A * D_delta\n\nWhere A and D are calculated as:\n\nA = 2 * a * rand() - a\nD = 2 * rand() * |X_best - X_wolf|\n\nHere, a is a linearly decreasing parameter from 2 to 0 over the iterations, rand() is a random number between 0 and 1, X_best is the position of the best wolf (alpha, beta, or delta), and X_wolf is the position of the current wolf.\n\nStep 5: Update the fitness of the wolves\nCalculate the new fitness values for the updated positions of the wolves.\n\nStep 6: Check for convergence\nIf the difference between the best fitness value in the current iteration and the previous iteration is less than the tolerance limit (0.001), stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go back to Step 3 and repeat the process until the maximum iteration limit (1000) is reached.\n\nStep 7: Return the minimum value\nThe minimum value of the function f(x) is the fitness of the alpha wolf at the end of the algorithm.\n\nNote: The GWO algorithm is a stochastic process, and the results may vary depending on the initial population and random numbers generated during the iterations. To obtain a more accurate result, the algorithm can be run multiple times and the average of the results can be taken."
