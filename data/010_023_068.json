    "message_1": "Suppose we have a closed loop made of a string that has been tied into a knot. If we want to know how many times the string crosses itself, which numerical invariant of the knot should we compute?",
    "message_2": "To determine how many times the string crosses itself in a knot, you should compute the crossing number of the knot. The crossing number is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram representing the knot. It is a numerical invariant, meaning that it does not change under any continuous deformation of the knot."
