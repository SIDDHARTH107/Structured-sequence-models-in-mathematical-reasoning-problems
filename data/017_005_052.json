    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, which is a power of a prime (3^3), G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 27. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, which we will call H. Since H is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of H. Since H has order 9, it is also a p-group. By the Sylow theorems again, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of H is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 9. The possibilities are 1 and 3. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then H is cyclic of order 9. If there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, then H is non-cyclic and isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 (since there are two non-identity elements in each Sylow 3-subgroup and their union forms the entire group H).\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since H is normal in G, G/H is a group of order 3, which is a prime, so G/H is cyclic. Let K be a subgroup of G such that the quotient group G/H is isomorphic to K. Then, by the correspondence theorem, K is normal in G and has order 3.\n\nNow, we have two normal subgroups H and K of G with orders 9 and 3, respectively. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, by the internal direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K.\n\nIn summary, if H is cyclic of order 9, then G is cyclic of order 27. If H is non-cyclic and isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 (K) and a group of order 9 (H)."
