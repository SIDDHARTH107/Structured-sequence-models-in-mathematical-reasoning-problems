    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid, we will use the method of cylindrical shells. The volume of a cylindrical shell is given by the formula V = 2π * integral from a to b of (r * h) dx, where r is the radius and h is the height of the shell.\n\nFirst, we need to find the points of intersection between the two curves y = x and y = x^2. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx = x^2\n\nx^2 - x = 0\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nSo, the region enclosed by the curves is between x = 0 and x = 1.\n\nNow, we need to express the radius and height of the cylindrical shells in terms of x. Since we are revolving around the y-axis, the radius will be x, and the height will be the difference between the two curves, which is (x - x^2).\n\nNow we can set up the integral for the volume:\n\nV = 2π * integral from 0 to 1 of (x * (x - x^2)) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nV = 2π * (integral from 0 to 1 of (x^2 - x^3) dx)\n\nV = 2π * (1/3 * x^3 - 1/4 * x^4) evaluated from 0 to 1\n\nV = 2π * ((1/3 * 1^3 - 1/4 * 1^4) - (1/3 * 0^3 - 1/4 * 0^4))\n\nV = 2π * (1/3 - 1/4)\n\nV = 2π * (1/12)\n\nV = π/6\n\nSo, the volume of the solid is π/6 cubic units."
