    "message_2": "The Riemann mapping theorem states that there exists a unique conformal equivalence between the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ and any simply connected open subset of the complex plane that is not the whole plane, normalized such that $f(0) = 0$ and $f'(0) > 0$. In this case, we want to find a conformal equivalence between the unit disk and $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus [-1, 1]$.\n\nConsider the function $g(z) = z^2$. This is a holomorphic function on the unit disk, and it maps the unit disk to the complex plane minus the segment $[-1, 1]$. However, it does not satisfy the normalization conditions, as $g(0) = 0$ but $g'(0) = 0$.\n\nTo find a function that satisfies the normalization conditions, we can compose $g(z)$ with a Möbius transformation. Let $h(z) = \\frac{z - a}{1 - \\bar{a}z}$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{D}$. This is a Möbius transformation that maps the unit disk to itself and satisfies $h(0) = a$ and $h'(0) = 1 - |a|^2 > 0$.\n\nNow, let $f(z) = g(h(z)) = (h(z))^2$. Then $f(0) = a^2 = 0$, so $a = 0$. Moreover, $f'(z) = 2h(z)h'(z)$, so $f'(0) = 2h(0)h'(0) = 2(1 - |a|^2) > 0$. Thus, $f(z) = g(h(z)) = z^2$ is the desired conformal equivalence between the unit disk and $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus [-1, 1]$ that satisfies the normalization conditions."
