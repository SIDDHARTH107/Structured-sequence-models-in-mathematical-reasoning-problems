    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation of the sun, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the angle of elevation as θ. In this problem, the flagpole is the side opposite the angle (25 feet), and the shadow is the side adjacent to the angle (40 feet).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(θ) = 25 / 40\ntan(θ) = 0.625\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ whose tangent is 0.625. We can do this using the arctangent (inverse tangent) function:\n\nθ = arctan(0.625)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 32.01°\n\nSo, the angle of elevation of the sun is approximately 32.01°."
