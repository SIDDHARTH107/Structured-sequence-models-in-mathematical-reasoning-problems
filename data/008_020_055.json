    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the elimination method, we need to eliminate one variable at a time. Let's start by eliminating the variable z from the first two equations.\n\nFirst, we can multiply the first equation by -1 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n(-1)(x + 2y + z) = (-1)(8)\n- x - 2y - z = -8\n\nNow we have:\n\n- x - 2y - z = -8\n2x - 3y + z = -2\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(- x - 2y - z) + (2x - 3y + z) = -8 + (-2)\nx - 5y = -10 (1)\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n(2)(2x - 3y + z) = (2)(-2)\n4x - 6y + 2z = -4\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x - 6y + 2z = -4\n3x + y - 2z = 7\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate z:\n\n(4x - 6y + 2z) + (3x + y - 2z) = -4 + 7\n7x - 5y = 3 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\nx - 5y = -10 (1)\n7x - 5y = 3 (2)\n\nTo eliminate y, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(7x - 5y) - (x - 5y) = 3 - (-10)\n6x = 13\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 13/6\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into equation (1) to find the value of y:\n\n(13/6) - 5y = -10\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n13 - 30y = -60\n\nAdd 60 to both sides:\n\n-30y = -47\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = 47/30\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can substitute them back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. Let's use the first equation:\n\nx + 2y + z = 8\n(13/6) + 2(47/30) + z = 8\n\nMultiply both sides by 30 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n65 + 94 + 30z = 240\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n159 + 30z = 240\n\nSubtract 159 from both sides:\n\n30z = 81\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz = 81/30\nz = 27/10\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 13/6\ny = 47/30\nz = 27/10"
