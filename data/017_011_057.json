    "message_2": "Let x be an element of G with order 6. Since the order of x is 6, we know that x^6 = e, where e is the identity element of G. \n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by x, i.e., H = {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5}. Since x has order 6, all these elements are distinct, and thus, H has order 6. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. Therefore, the order of H (which is 6) divides the order of G (which is 12). \n\nNow, let's consider the cosets of H in G. Since the order of G is 12 and the order of H is 6, there are two cosets: H itself and another coset, say K. Let y be an element of K. Note that y cannot be in H, as K and H are distinct cosets.\n\nNow, we will show that every element of G can be written as a product of x^i * y^j, where i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 5 and j = 0, 1. This will imply that G is generated by x and y, and since x has order 6 and y has order 2 (as y^2 is in H, and y is not in H), G will be isomorphic to C12.\n\nLet z be an arbitrary element of G. If z is in H, then z = x^i for some i, and we can write z as x^i * e = x^i * y^0. If z is not in H, then z is in K, and we can write z as y * x^j for some j, as K is a coset of H. Thus, z = x^j * y.\n\nIn both cases, we have expressed z as a product of x^i * y^j, where i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 5 and j = 0, 1. Therefore, G is generated by x and y, and since x has order 6 and y has order 2, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12."
