    "message_1": "A water distribution network has 3 sources and 5 sinks. Source 1 can supply a maximum flow of 8 units, source 2 can supply a maximum flow of 6 units and source 3 can supply a maximum flow of 10 units. Each sink has a demand of 4 units. Find the maximum flow that can be sent through the network.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow that can be sent through the network, we need to consider the total supply from the sources and the total demand from the sinks.\n\nTotal supply from sources:\nSource 1: 8 units\nSource 2: 6 units\nSource 3: 10 units\nTotal supply: 8 + 6 + 10 = 24 units\n\nTotal demand from sinks:\nSink 1: 4 units\nSink 2: 4 units\nSink 3: 4 units\nSink 4: 4 units\nSink 5: 4 units\nTotal demand: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 units\n\nSince the total supply (24 units) is greater than the total demand (20 units), the maximum flow that can be sent through the network is equal to the total demand, which is 20 units."
