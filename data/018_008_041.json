    "message_1": "Consider the sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product A × B and B × A. Show that the Cartesian product is not commutative by comparing the two results.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Similarly, B × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nLet's find A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find B × A:\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nComparing the two results, we can see that A × B ≠ B × A. The elements in the sets are different, even though they have the same number of elements. This shows that the Cartesian product is not commutative."
