    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo n is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo n. In this case, we are looking for quadratic residues modulo 7. To find them, we need to compute the squares of the integers from 0 to 6 (since 7 is the modulus) and then reduce them modulo 7.\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3² ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n4² ≡ 16 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5² ≡ 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n6² ≡ 36 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the quadratic residues modulo 7 are {0, 1, 2, 4}."
