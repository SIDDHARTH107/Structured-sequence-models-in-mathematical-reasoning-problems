    "message_1": "A mechanical system is modeled by the following differential equation: \n\ny'' + 4y' + 4y = 2sin(2t) \n\nwhere y is the displacement of the system from its equilibrium position and t is time. Use Fourier transform to analyze the stability of the system. What are the frequencies of the sinusoidal components present in the solution and is the system stable?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system using Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of y''(t), y'(t), and y(t) are denoted by (iω)^2Y(ω), iωY(ω), and Y(ω), respectively, where Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and ω is the angular frequency. The Fourier transform of 2sin(2t) is π[δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)], where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given equation, we get:\n\n(iω)^2Y(ω) + 4iωY(ω) + 4Y(ω) = π[δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = π[δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)] / [(ω^2 - 4ω + 4)]\n\nY(ω) = π[δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)] / [(ω - 2)^2]\n\nThe poles of Y(ω) are at ω = 2, which are simple poles. Since the poles lie on the imaginary axis and not in the right half of the complex plane, the system is marginally stable.\n\nThe frequencies of the sinusoidal components present in the solution can be found by taking the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω). The inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) will have sinusoidal components with frequencies corresponding to the locations of the Dirac delta functions in the Fourier transform of the forcing function, which are at ω = ±2. Therefore, the frequencies of the sinusoidal components present in the solution are f = ±1 Hz (since ω = 2πf).\n\nIn conclusion, the system is marginally stable, and the frequencies of the sinusoidal components present in the solution are ±1 Hz."
