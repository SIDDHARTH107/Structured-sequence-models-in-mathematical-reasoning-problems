    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the initial displacement of the string, which can be represented as a function of position x. Since the string is set into motion with an initial velocity of 10 cm/s, we can write the initial displacement function as:\n\nu(x,0) = 0 (since the string is initially at rest)\n\nThe initial velocity function is given as:\n\nv(x,0) = 10 cm/s\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial displacement and velocity functions. Since the initial displacement is zero, its Fourier transform will also be zero. The Fourier transform of the initial velocity function is:\n\nV(k,0) = ∫ v(x,0) * e^(-ikx) dx\n\nSince v(x,0) = 10 cm/s, we have:\n\nV(k,0) = 10 * ∫ e^(-ikx) dx\n\nTo find the displacement of the string at time t = 0.02 seconds, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the Fourier transform of the initial velocity function and the time:\n\nU(x, t) = F^(-1)[V(k,0) * t]\n\nU(x, 0.02) = F^(-1)[10 * ∫ e^(-ikx) dx * 0.02]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of this expression. The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nU(x, 0.02) = (1/2π) * ∫ [10 * ∫ e^(-ikx) dx * 0.02] * e^(ikx) dk\n\nAfter solving the inner integral, we get:\n\nU(x, 0.02) = (1/2π) * ∫ [(-10/ik) * e^(-ikx) * 0.02] * e^(ikx) dk\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by multiplying e^(-ikx) and e^(ikx):\n\nU(x, 0.02) = (1/2π) * ∫ [(-10/ik) * 0.02] dk\n\nU(x, 0.02) = (-0.2/2π) * ∫ (1/ik) dk\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to k:\n\nU(x, 0.02) = (-0.2/2π) * [ln(ik)]\n\nTo find the displacement of the string at time t = 0.02 seconds, we need to evaluate this expression at the given position x. However, without knowing the position x, we cannot find the exact displacement. But we have the general expression for the displacement of the string at time t = 0.02 seconds:\n\nU(x, 0.02) = (-0.2/2π) * ln(ik)"
