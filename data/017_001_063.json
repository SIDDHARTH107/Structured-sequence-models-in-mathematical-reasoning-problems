    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider the possible orders of the elements in G.\n\nRecall that the order of an element g in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 4. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n1. The identity element e has order 1 by definition.\n\nNow let's consider the other elements a, b, and c.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that a has order 4. Then, a^4 = e, and a, a^2, a^3, and a^4 = e are distinct elements of G. Since G has only 4 elements, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}. This means that G is generated by a single element (a), and thus G is a cyclic group of order 4, i.e., G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements have order 2.\n\nIn this case, a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. We will show that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4 = {e, x, y, z} with x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = e and xy = z, yz = x, zx = y.\n\nWe can define an isomorphism φ: G → V4 as follows:\n\nφ(e) = e\nφ(a) = x\nφ(b) = y\nφ(c) = z\n\nWe need to show that φ is a homomorphism and bijective.\n\nHomomorphism: Since a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, we have φ(a^2) = φ(e) = e, φ(b^2) = φ(e) = e, and φ(c^2) = φ(e) = e. Also, φ(ab) = φ(c) = z = xy = φ(a)φ(b), φ(bc) = φ(a) = x = yz = φ(b)φ(c), and φ(ca) = φ(b) = y = zx = φ(c)φ(a). Thus, φ is a homomorphism.\n\nInjective: φ is injective since it maps distinct elements of G to distinct elements of V4.\n\nSurjective: φ is surjective since every element of V4 is the image of some element in G.\n\nSince φ is a bijective homomorphism, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
