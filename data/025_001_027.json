    "message_2": "To use Bezout's Theorem, we first need to find the degrees of the two curves. The degree of a curve is the highest total degree of any term in the equation.\n\nFor C1: x^2 + y^2 - 5x - 8y + 12 = 0, the highest total degree is 2 (from the x^2 and y^2 terms).\n\nFor C2: 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 3x + y - 1 = 0, the highest total degree is also 2 (from the 2x^2 and 2y^2 terms).\n\nNow we can apply Bezout's Theorem, which states that the number of intersection points between two curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves intersect transversally (i.e., they do not share any common components).\n\nIn this case, the product of the degrees is 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 intersection points between the two curves over the complex numbers, assuming that the intersection points are transversal."
