    "message_1": "During a recent election in a country, the probability of a voter being male was 0.6 and the probability of a male voter voting for a certain political party was 0.3. What is the probability that a randomly chosen voter is a male who voted for the political party?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen voter is a male who voted for the political party, we need to multiply the probability of a voter being male (0.6) by the probability of a male voter voting for the political party (0.3).\n\n0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen voter is a male who voted for the political party is 0.18 or 18%."
