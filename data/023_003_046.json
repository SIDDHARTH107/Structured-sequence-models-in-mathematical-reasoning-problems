    "message_1": "A metal plate with dimensions 2x2 units is heated to a uniform temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. At time t=0, the edges of the plate are insulated so that the temperature on the edges remains constant. After a few minutes, the insulation is removed and the temperature on the edges of the plate drop to 0 degrees Celsius. \n\nUsing Fourier series, find the temperature distribution on the plate at time t=0.5 minutes assuming that the initial temperature was given by f(x,y) = xy.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution on the plate at time t=0.5 minutes using Fourier series, we can use the following formula for the temperature distribution in a 2D rectangular plate:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑(m=1 to ∞) ∑(n=1 to ∞) B_mn * sin(mπx/a) * sin(nπy/b) * exp(-(m²π²α²t/a² + n²π²α²t/b²))\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) at time t, a and b are the dimensions of the plate (2x2 units), α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal, and B_mn is the Fourier coefficient given by:\n\nB_mn = (4/(ab)) * ∫(x=0 to a) ∫(y=0 to b) f(x, y) * sin(mπx/a) * sin(nπy/b) dx dy\n\nGiven the initial temperature distribution f(x, y) = xy, we can calculate B_mn:\n\nB_mn = (4/(2*2)) * ∫(x=0 to 2) ∫(y=0 to 2) xy * sin(mπx/2) * sin(nπy/2) dx dy\n\nTo solve the double integral, we can first integrate with respect to x:\n\n∫(x=0 to 2) x * sin(mπx/2) dx = (-4/(mπ)) * cos(mπx/2) | evaluated from x=0 to 2\n\nNow, integrate with respect to y:\n\n∫(y=0 to 2) y * sin(nπy/2) dy = (-4/(nπ)) * cos(nπy/2) | evaluated from y=0 to 2\n\nNow, we can find B_mn:\n\nB_mn = (1/4) * ((-4/(mπ)) * (cos(mπ) - 1)) * ((-4/(nπ)) * (cos(nπ) - 1))\n\nB_mn = (16/(m²n²π²)) * (1 - cos(mπ)) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\nNow, we can plug B_mn back into the formula for u(x, y, t) and evaluate it at t=0.5 minutes (t=30 seconds):\n\nu(x, y, 30) = ∑(m=1 to ∞) ∑(n=1 to ∞) (16/(m²n²π²)) * (1 - cos(mπ)) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(mπx/2) * sin(nπy/2) * exp(-(m²π²α²*30/4 + n²π²α²*30/4))\n\nThis formula gives the temperature distribution on the plate at time t=0.5 minutes. To find the actual temperature values at specific points (x, y), you would need to know the thermal diffusivity α of the metal and evaluate the infinite series."
