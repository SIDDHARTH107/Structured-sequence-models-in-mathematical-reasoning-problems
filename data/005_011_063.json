The quality control department decides to test a sample of 25 washing machines. Calculate the probability that the sample mean life of the washing machines exceeds 11 years.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the sample mean life of the washing machines exceeds 11 years, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 10 years, the population standard deviation (σ) is 2 years, and the sample size (n) is 25.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 2 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 2 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 0.4 years\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score corresponding to a sample mean of 11 years:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (11 - 10) / 0.4\nz = 1 / 0.4\nz = 2.5\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 2.5. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the right of the z-score. \n\nP(Z > 2.5) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 2.5)\nP(Z > 2.5) = 1 - 0.9938\nP(Z > 2.5) = 0.0062\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean life of the washing machines exceeds 11 years is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%."
