    "message_1": "Since Causal logic deals with cause-and-effect relationships, here is an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a car travels at a constant speed of 50 mph. If it takes the car 2 hours to travel a distance of 100 miles, how long would it take the car to travel a distance of 250 miles at the same speed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe are given the speed (50 mph) and the distance (250 miles). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTime = 250 miles / 50 mph\n\nTime = 5 hours\n\nSo, it would take the car 5 hours to travel a distance of 250 miles at the same speed of 50 mph."
