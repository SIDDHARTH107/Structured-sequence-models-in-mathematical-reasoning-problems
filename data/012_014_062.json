If they are, provide an isomorphism between the two graphs. If they are not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "G and H are not isomorphic. Here's why:\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nFor graph G:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 1 (connected to vertex 2)\n- Vertex 2 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 3)\n- Vertex 3 has degree 1 (connected to vertex 2)\n\nFor graph H:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 3)\n- Vertex 2 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 3)\n- Vertex 3 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 2)\n\nSince the degree sequences of the two graphs are different (G has degrees 1, 2, 1 and H has degrees 2, 2, 2), they cannot be isomorphic. Isomorphic graphs must have the same degree sequence."
