    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of y''(t) is (-jω)^2Y(ω) and the Fourier transform of y(t) is Y(ω), where Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\n(-jω)^2Y(ω) + 9Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) [(-jω)^2 + 9] = 0\n\nSince Y(ω) is not equal to 0, we can divide both sides by Y(ω):\n\n(-jω)^2 + 9 = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for ω:\n\n(-jω)^2 = -9\n\nω^2 = -9 / -j^2 = 9\n\nω = ±3\n\nThe frequency response of the system is given by H(ω) = Y(ω) / X(ω), where X(ω) is the input and Y(ω) is the output. In this case, the system is described by the equation:\n\nH(ω) = 1 / ((-jω)^2 + 9)\n\nNow, let's determine if the system is stable or unstable. A system is stable if its impulse response, h(t), is absolutely integrable. The impulse response can be found by taking the inverse Fourier transform of H(ω):\n\nh(t) = F^(-1)[H(ω)]\n\nSince H(ω) is a rational function, we can use the inverse Fourier transform to find h(t):\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) ∫ H(ω) e^(jωt) dω\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) ∫ (1 / ((-jω)^2 + 9)) e^(jωt) dω\n\nThe integral above represents a sum of complex exponentials, which are absolutely integrable. Therefore, the system is stable."
