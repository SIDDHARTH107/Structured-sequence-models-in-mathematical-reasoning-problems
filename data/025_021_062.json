    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem related to mirror symmetry:\n\nGiven two mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y, their Hodge numbers are related by some symmetry constrains. Suppose X has Hodge numbers h11 = 1, h21 = 101, h31 = 1; while Y has Hodge numbers h11 = 1, h21 = 1, h31 = 101. Find the Euler characteristic χ(X) and χ(Y) of the two manifolds and verify the mirror symmetry prediction that χ(X) = χ(Y).",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic χ of a Calabi-Yau manifold can be computed using the Hodge numbers as follows:\n\nχ = 2(h11) - 2(h21) + 2(h31)\n\nFor manifold X, we have h11 = 1, h21 = 101, and h31 = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ(X) = 2(1) - 2(101) + 2(1) = 2 - 202 + 2 = -198\n\nFor manifold Y, we have h11 = 1, h21 = 1, and h31 = 101. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ(Y) = 2(1) - 2(1) + 2(101) = 2 - 2 + 202 = 198\n\nThe mirror symmetry prediction states that χ(X) = -χ(Y). In this case, we have χ(X) = -198 and χ(Y) = 198, so the prediction is verified:\n\n-198 = -1 * 198"
