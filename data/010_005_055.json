    "message_2": "A topological space (X, τ) is said to be connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, there are no two non-empty open sets A and B such that A ∪ B = X and A ∩ B = ∅.\n\nLet's examine the given topology τ = {∅, {1}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}. We can see that the set {1} and its complement {2, 3, 4, 5} are both open in this topology. Moreover, {1} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5} = X and {1} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = ∅. Therefore, the space (X, τ) is not connected.\n\nNow, let's check if the space (X, τ) is path-connected. A topological space is path-connected if for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nIn our case, let's consider the points 1 and 2 in X. We need to find a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 2. However, since {1} and {2, 3, 4, 5} are both open sets in τ and their intersection is empty, there is no continuous function that can connect 1 and 2 in this topology. Therefore, the space (X, τ) is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the topological space (X, τ) is neither connected nor path-connected."
