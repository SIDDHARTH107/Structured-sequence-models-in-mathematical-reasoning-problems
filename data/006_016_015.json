    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product having a certain type of defect is 0.2. If a sample of 500 products is taken from the manufacturing process, what is the probability that between 90 and 110 products inclusive will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective products\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n! / (x! * (n-x)!))\n- n is the total number of products (500 in this case)\n- x is the number of defective products (we will calculate this for each value between 90 and 110)\n- p is the probability of a product having a defect (0.2)\n\nWe will calculate the probability for each value of x between 90 and 110, and then sum those probabilities to find the overall probability.\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(500, x) for each x between 90 and 110:\n\nC(500, 90) = 500! / (90! * 410!)\nC(500, 91) = 500! / (91! * 409!)\n...\nC(500, 110) = 500! / (110! * 390!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each x:\n\nP(90) = C(500, 90) * 0.2^90 * 0.8^410\nP(91) = C(500, 91) * 0.2^91 * 0.8^409\n...\nP(110) = C(500, 110) * 0.2^110 * 0.8^390\n\nFinally, let's sum the probabilities:\n\nP(90 <= x <= 110) = P(90) + P(91) + ... + P(110)\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(90 <= x <= 110) â‰ˆ 0.632\n\nSo, the probability that between 90 and 110 products inclusive will have the defect is approximately 0.632 or 63.2%."
