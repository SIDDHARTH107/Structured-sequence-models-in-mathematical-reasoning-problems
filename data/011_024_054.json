The network infrastructure consists of several nodes, each with a limited capacity to transmit data. The transmission capacity between each node is represented by the following matrix:\n\n    |   | Node 1 | Node 2 | Node 3 | Node 4 |\n    |---|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n    | 1 |   0    |   20   |   30   |   0    |\n    | 2 |   0    |   0    |   50   |   10   |\n    | 3 |   0    |   50   |   0    |   30   |\n    | 4 |   0    |   0    |   0    |   0    |\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted from the source node (Node 1) to the destination node (Node 4) per hour, assuming all nodes are operational and there are no network failures?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted from Node 1 to Node 4 per hour, we need to find the maximum flow through the network. We can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow.\n\nFirst, let's find the possible paths from Node 1 to Node 4:\n\n1. Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4\n2. Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 4\n3. Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 4\n\nNow, let's find the bottleneck capacity (minimum capacity) of each path:\n\n1. Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4: min(20, 50, 30) = 20\n2. Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 4: min(30, 30) = 30\n3. Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 4: min(20, 10) = 10\n\nThe maximum flow is the sum of the bottleneck capacities of the paths:\n\nMaximum flow = 20 + 30 + 10 = 60 GB per hour\n\nSo, the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted from Node 1 to Node 4 per hour is 60 GB."
