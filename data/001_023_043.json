    "message_2": "First, we need to isolate the sine function. To do this, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation and then divide by 4:\n\n4sin(2x) - 3 = 0\n4sin(2x) = 3\nsin(2x) = 3/4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of 2x that satisfy the equation sin(2x) = 3/4 over the interval [0, 2π]. To do this, we can take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\n2x = arcsin(3/4)\n\nSince the sine function has a period of 2π, we need to consider all possible solutions for 2x within the interval [0, 4π] (since we are solving for 2x, we need to double the interval):\n\n2x = arcsin(3/4) + 2πn\n2x = π - arcsin(3/4) + 2πn\n\nwhere n is an integer.\n\nNow, we can find the values of 2x that are within the interval [0, 4π]:\n\nFor n = 0:\n2x = arcsin(3/4) ≈ 0.8481\n2x = π - arcsin(3/4) ≈ 2.2935\n\nFor n = 1:\n2x = arcsin(3/4) + 2π ≈ 6.9907\n2x = π - arcsin(3/4) + 2π ≈ 8.4361\n\nNow, we can divide these values by 2 to find the values of x within the interval [0, 2π]:\n\nx ≈ 0.4240\nx ≈ 1.1468\nx ≈ 3.4954\nx ≈ 4.2180\n\nSo, the solutions for x within the interval [0, 2π] are approximately:\n\nx ≈ 0.4240, 1.1468, 3.4954, 4.2180"
