    "message_2": "To find the mean number of products sold per month during this period, we need to add the number of products sold in each month and then divide the total by the number of months.\n\nMean = (Total number of products sold) / (Number of months)\n\nTotal number of products sold = January sales + February sales + March sales\nTotal number of products sold = 50 + 65 + 80 = 195\n\nNumber of months = 3\n\nMean = 195 / 3 = 65\n\nThe mean number of products sold per month during this period is 65."
