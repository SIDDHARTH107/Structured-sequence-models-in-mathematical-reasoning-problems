    "message_1": "A student is trying to decide between two brands of laptops, A and B. Laptop A costs $1000 and has a probability of 0.8 of lasting for 3 years without needing any major repairs. Laptop B costs $800 and has a probability of 0.9 of lasting for 3 years without needing any major repairs. Using decision theory, which laptop should the student choose to minimize the expected cost over the next 3 years?",
    "message_2": "To determine which laptop the student should choose, we can calculate the expected cost for each laptop over the next 3 years. \n\nFor Laptop A:\nExpected cost = (Initial cost) + (Probability of needing major repairs) * (Cost of major repairs)\nAssuming the cost of major repairs is the same for both laptops, we can denote it as C. \n\nExpected cost of Laptop A = $1000 + (1 - 0.8) * C = $1000 + 0.2 * C\n\nFor Laptop B:\nExpected cost of Laptop B = $800 + (1 - 0.9) * C = $800 + 0.1 * C\n\nTo minimize the expected cost, we can compare the expected costs of both laptops:\n\n$1000 + 0.2 * C > $800 + 0.1 * C\n0.1 * C > $200\nC > $2000\n\nIf the cost of major repairs (C) is greater than $2000, then Laptop B would be the better choice. However, if the cost of major repairs is less than or equal to $2000, then Laptop A would be the better choice.\n\nIn most cases, the cost of major repairs for a laptop is less than $2000. Therefore, the student should choose Laptop A to minimize the expected cost over the next 3 years."
