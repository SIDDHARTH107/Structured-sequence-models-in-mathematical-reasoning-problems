    "message_2": "To find the volume of the remaining cube after carving out a sphere of radius 4 cm from its center, we can first find the volume of the cube and then subtract the volume of the sphere. However, since the problem asks to use integration, we will use a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the cube to be centered at the origin (0, 0, 0) with side length 2a (where a = 4 cm). The equation of the sphere centered at the origin with radius 4 cm is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 16\n\nWe will use triple integration to find the volume of the cube with the sphere removed. We will integrate over the region where the sphere is not present. To do this, we will integrate over the region where x^2 + y^2 + z^2 > 16.\n\nThe volume of the remaining cube can be found using the following triple integral:\n\nV = ∫∫∫_R dV\n\nwhere R is the region defined by the cube with the sphere removed. We can set up the integral in Cartesian coordinates as follows:\n\nV = ∫(x=-4 to 4) ∫(y=-4 to 4) ∫(z=-4 to 4) H(x, y, z) dz dy dx\n\nwhere H(x, y, z) is the Heaviside step function, which is 1 if x^2 + y^2 + z^2 > 16 and 0 otherwise.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can first find the limits of integration for z. Given x and y, the limits for z are the points where the sphere intersects the cube. We can find these points by solving the equation of the sphere for z:\n\nz = ±√(16 - x^2 - y^2)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral as follows:\n\nV = ∫(x=-4 to 4) ∫(y=-4 to 4) ∫(z=-√(16 - x^2 - y^2) to √(16 - x^2 - y^2)) dz dy dx\n\nEvaluating the innermost integral, we get:\n\nV = ∫(x=-4 to 4) ∫(y=-4 to 4) [2√(16 - x^2 - y^2)] dy dx\n\nNow, we can use polar coordinates to evaluate the remaining double integral. Let x = r*cos(θ) and y = r*sin(θ). Then, the Jacobian of the transformation is r, and the integral becomes:\n\nV = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 4) [2r√(16 - r^2)] dr dθ\n\nEvaluating the inner integral, we get:\n\nV = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) [-(1/3)(16 - r^2)^(3/2)](r=0 to 4) dθ\n\nPlugging in the limits of integration for r, we get:\n\nV = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) [(1/3)(16 - 16)^(3/2) - (1/3)(16 - 0)^(3/2)] dθ\n\nV = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) [(1/3)(0) - (1/3)(16)^(3/2)] dθ\n\nV = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) [-(64/3)] dθ\n\nEvaluating the outer integral, we get:\n\nV = [-(64/3)] * [θ](θ=0 to 2π)\n\nV = [-64π/3] * [2π - 0]\n\nV = -128π^2/3\n\nSince the volume cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nV = 128π^2/3\n\nSo, the volume of the remaining cube after carving out the sphere is approximately 128π^2/3 cubic centimeters."
