    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind, which is denoted by S(n, k) and represents the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets.\n\nHowever, in this case, we want to find the number of ways to divide a set of 7 objects into any number of non-empty subsets. To do this, we need to sum the Stirling numbers of the second kind for all possible values of k, from 1 to 7.\n\nSo, we want to find the sum S(7,1) + S(7,2) + S(7,3) + S(7,4) + S(7,5) + S(7,6) + S(7,7).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we get:\n\nS(7,1) = 1 (putting all 7 objects in a single subset)\nS(7,2) = 63\nS(7,3) = 301\nS(7,4) = 350\nS(7,5) = 140\nS(7,6) = 21\nS(7,7) = 1 (each object in its own subset)\n\nNow, summing these values:\n\n1 + 63 + 301 + 350 + 140 + 21 + 1 = 877\n\nSo, there are 877 ways to divide a set of 7 objects into non-empty subsets."
