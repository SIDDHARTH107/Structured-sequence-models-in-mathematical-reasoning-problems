If the length of the pipe is $L=10\\text{ m}$ and the flow is fully developed, what is the volume flow rate $Q$ of the fluid (in $\\text{m}^3/\\text{s}$)?",
    "message_2": "For a fully developed turbulent flow in a pipe, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to find the volume flow rate $Q$. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is given by:\n\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi D^4 \\Delta p}{128 \\nu L}$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the diameter of the pipe, $\\Delta p$ is the pressure difference between the ends of the pipe, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $L$ is the length of the pipe.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have:\n\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi (0.2\\text{ m})^4 (5000\\text{ Pa})}{128 (0.01 \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s})(10\\text{ m})}$$\n\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi (0.0016\\text{ m}^4) (5000\\text{ Pa})}{1.28 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}}$$\n\n$$Q \\approx \\frac{0.0251\\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}}{1.28}$$\n\n$$Q \\approx 0.0196\\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$$\n\nSo, the volume flow rate of the fluid is approximately $0.0196\\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$."
