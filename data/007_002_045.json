    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 968 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the digits of 968:\n\n9 + 6 + 8 = 23\n\n23 is not divisible by 9, so 968 is not divisible by 9. To find the remainder, we can divide 968 by 9:\n\n968 รท 9 = 107 with a remainder of 5\n\nSo, the remainder when 968 is divided by 9 is 5."
