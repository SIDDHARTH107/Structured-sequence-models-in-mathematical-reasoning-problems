    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of machine components, A and B. The profit for each unit of component A is $12 and for each unit of component B is $8. The production of A requires 2 hours on machine X and 1 hour on machine Y. The production of B requires 1 hour on machine X and 2 hours on machine Y. Each day machine X can be operated for 12 hours and machine Y can be operated for 10 hours. Assuming that the manufacturer wants to maximize profit, what is the optimal number of units of each component that should be produced?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of component A produced and y be the number of units of component B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the machines' operation hours are:\n\n2x + y ≤ 12 (Machine X)\nx + 2y ≤ 10 (Machine Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 12x + 8y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 12 can be rewritten as y ≤ -2x + 12\nx + 2y ≤ 10 can be rewritten as y ≤ -0.5x + 5\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,5), (4,4), and (6,0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(0,0) = 12(0) + 8(0) = $0\nP(0,5) = 12(0) + 8(5) = $40\nP(4,4) = 12(4) + 8(4) = $80\nP(6,0) = 12(6) + 8(0) = $72\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (4,4), where the manufacturer produces 4 units of component A and 4 units of component B. The maximum profit is $80."
