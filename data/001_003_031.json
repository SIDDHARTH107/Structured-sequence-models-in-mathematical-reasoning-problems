    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(x + y) + (3x - y) = 8 + 4\nx + y + 3x - y = 12\n4x = 12\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 12 / 4\nx = 3\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of x back into either equation to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n3 + y = 8\ny = 8 - 3\ny = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3 and y = 5."
