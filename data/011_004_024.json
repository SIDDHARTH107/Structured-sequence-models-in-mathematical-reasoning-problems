    "message_1": "A company has five positions to fill: CEO, CFO, COO, CTO, and CMO. There are ten candidates who have applied for these positions. In how many ways can the company fill the positions with one person per position?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 10 candidates and 5 positions to fill, we can calculate the number of ways to fill the positions as follows:\n\n10 candidates for the CEO position,\n9 remaining candidates for the CFO position,\n8 remaining candidates for the COO position,\n7 remaining candidates for the CTO position, and\n6 remaining candidates for the CMO position.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to fill the positions is:\n\n10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 30,240 ways."
