    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log(base 5) [(5^3 * 5^5)/5^4], we can use the properties of logarithms and exponents.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\n(5^3 * 5^5) / 5^4\n\nUsing the property of exponents that states a^(m+n) = a^m * a^n, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n5^(3+5) / 5^4\n\nNow, we have:\n\n5^8 / 5^4\n\nUsing the property of exponents that states a^(m-n) = a^m / a^n, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n5^(8-4)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n5^4\n\nNow, we can rewrite the logarithmic expression as:\n\nlog(base 5) (5^4)\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that states log(base a) (a^x) = x, we can simplify the expression to:\n\n4\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\n4"
