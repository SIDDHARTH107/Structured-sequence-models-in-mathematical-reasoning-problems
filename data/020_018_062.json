The matrix is:\n\n|   | Rock | Paper | Scissor |\n|---|------|-------|---------|\n| R | 0,-1 | 1,0   |  -1,1   |\n| P | -1,1 | 0,-1  |   1,0   |\n| S | 1,-1 | -1,1  |   0,0   |\n\nIf Rohan always plays Rock, what should Arnav do to minimize Rohan's point gain and maximize his own?",
    "message_2": "If Rohan always plays Rock, Arnav should always play Paper. This is because, according to the payoff matrix, when Rohan plays Rock and Arnav plays Paper, Rohan gains 1 point and Arnav loses 0 points (1,0). This minimizes Rohan's point gain and maximizes Arnav's points."
