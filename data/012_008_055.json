    "message_2": "Kuratowski's theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to either K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 6 vertices with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nTo determine if the graph G is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have v = 10 vertices and e = 15 edges. We can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for the number of faces:\n\nf = e - v + 2\nf = 15 - 10 + 2\nf = 7\n\nNow, let's consider the number of edges in a planar graph. A planar graph must satisfy the inequality:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nFor our graph G, we have:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, we still need to check if G contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3.\n\nSince G has only 10 vertices and 15 edges, it is not possible for it to contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5, as K5 has 5 vertices and 10 edges. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3.\n\nAt this point, we cannot definitively conclude whether G is planar or non-planar using only Kuratowski's theorem and the given information. We would need more information about the structure of the graph or a drawing of the graph to determine if it contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3."
