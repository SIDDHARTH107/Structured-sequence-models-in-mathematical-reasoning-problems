The payoff matrix for the game is given as follows:\n\n```\n              Player B\n              L    R\nPlayer A  U  (2,2) (6,0)\n              D  (0,6) (4,4)\n```\n\nThe first number in each pair represents the payoff for player A, and the second number represents the payoff for player B.\n\nFind the Nash Equilibrium for this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nFirst, let's analyze player A's strategies:\n\n1. If player B chooses L, player A should choose U (2 > 0).\n2. If player B chooses R, player A should choose U (6 > 4).\n\nNow, let's analyze player B's strategies:\n\n1. If player A chooses U, player B should choose L (2 > 0).\n2. If player A chooses D, player B should choose R (4 > 6).\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players choose their best response to the other player's strategy. In this case, the Nash Equilibrium is when player A chooses U and player B chooses L. The corresponding payoff is (2, 2)."
