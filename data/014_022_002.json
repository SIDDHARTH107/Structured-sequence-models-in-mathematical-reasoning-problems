    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"UZLTAZRHBXRI\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create a 5x5 Playfair square using the key.\n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill in the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet (excluding the letter 'J', which is combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher), in order.\n\nThe resulting Playfair square is:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the ciphertext:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into pairs of letters: UZ LT AZ RH BX RI\n2. For each pair of letters, locate them in the Playfair square.\n3. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary). If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary). If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other column of the rectangle.\n4. Combine the decrypted letter pairs to get the plaintext.\n\nDecrypting the given ciphertext:\n\nUZ -> PL\nLT -> AY\nAZ -> F\nRH -> AI\nBX -> R\nRI -> E\n\nThe decrypted plaintext is \"PLAYFAIRE\"."
