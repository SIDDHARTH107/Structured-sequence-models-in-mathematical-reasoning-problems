    "message_2": "Let f(x) be the differentiable function on the closed interval [a, b] with the property that |f'(x)| ≤ 1 for all x in [a, b]. We want to find the maximum possible value of |f(b) - f(a)|.\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the open interval (a, b) such that\n\nf'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a).\n\nSince |f'(c)| ≤ 1, we have\n\n|(f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)| ≤ 1.\n\nMultiplying both sides by |b - a|, we get\n\n|f(b) - f(a)| ≤ |b - a|.\n\nThus, the maximum possible value of the difference between the values of the function at a and b is |b - a|."
