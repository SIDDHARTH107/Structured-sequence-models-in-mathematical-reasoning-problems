    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. At each level, the number of mini pyramids (tetrahedra) increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of mini pyramids in a level 6 Sierpinski pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal mini pyramids = (4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 + 4^4 + 4^5 + 4^6)\n\nCalculating the powers of 4:\n\n4^0 = 1\n4^1 = 4\n4^2 = 16\n4^3 = 64\n4^4 = 256\n4^5 = 1024\n4^6 = 4096\n\nAdding these values together:\n\n1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 + 4096 = 5461\n\nSo, the total number of mini pyramids that make up a level 6 Sierpinski pyramid is 5461."
