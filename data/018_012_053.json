    "message_2": "To show that (A × B) ∩ A = A × (B ∩ A) does not hold, we will compute both sides of the equation and compare the results.\n\nFirst, let's compute A × B, which is the Cartesian product of sets A and B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection of (A × B) and A:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅ (empty set)\n\nThis is because there are no elements in common between the Cartesian product (A × B) and set A.\n\nNext, let's compute the intersection of B and A:\n\nB ∩ A = ∅ (empty set)\n\nThis is because there are no elements in common between sets B and A.\n\nNow, let's compute A × (B ∩ A):\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = A × ∅ = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅\nA × (B ∩ A) = ∅\n\nIn this case, both sides of the equation are equal, which means (A × B) ∩ A = A × (B ∩ A) holds. The initial claim that it does not hold is incorrect."
