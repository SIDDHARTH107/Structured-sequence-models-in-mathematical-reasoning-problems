    "message_1": "Suppose we have three sets A, B and C, where A has 5 elements, B has 7 elements, and C has 4 elements. Using higher-order logic, how many possible non-empty subsets can we form by taking elements from A, B, and C combined?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-empty subsets that can be formed by taking elements from A, B, and C combined, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFor each set, there are 2^n possible subsets, where n is the number of elements in the set. This includes the empty set. So for A, there are 2^5 = 32 subsets; for B, there are 2^7 = 128 subsets; and for C, there are 2^4 = 16 subsets.\n\nNow, consider the combined set of A, B, and C, which has 5 + 7 + 4 = 16 elements. There are 2^16 = 65,536 possible subsets, including the empty set.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of non-empty subsets. To do this, we simply subtract the empty set from the total number of subsets: 65,536 - 1 = 65,535.\n\nTherefore, there are 65,535 possible non-empty subsets that can be formed by taking elements from A, B, and C combined."
