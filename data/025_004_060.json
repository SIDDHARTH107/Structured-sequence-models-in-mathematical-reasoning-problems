    "message_2": "The degree of a curve in the projective plane is the highest total degree of its homogeneous equation. In this case, the homogeneous equation is:\n\nzy - x^3 - 2x^2z - 3xz^2 - 4z^3 = 0\n\nLet's find the total degree of each term:\n\n1. zy: degree 1 (z) + degree 1 (y) = 2\n2. x^3: degree 3 (x) = 3\n3. 2x^2z: degree 2 (x) + degree 1 (z) = 3\n4. 3xz^2: degree 1 (x) + degree 2 (z) = 3\n5. 4z^3: degree 3 (z) = 3\n\nThe highest total degree among these terms is 3. Therefore, the degree of the rational curve in the projective plane is 3."
