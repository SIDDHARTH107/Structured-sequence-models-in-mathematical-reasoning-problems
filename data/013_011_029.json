    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, competing in a Bertrand Game. Their marginal costs are $10 and $12 respectively. The demand curve is given by P = 50 â€“ Q, where P is the price and Q is the total output (Q = QA + QB) of the two firms. What will be the equilibrium price in this market?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms set the same price, they share the market demand equally. Firms will continue to undercut each other's prices until they reach their respective marginal costs.\n\nLet's find the reaction functions for both firms A and B. A firm's reaction function shows the optimal price it should set given the price set by the other firm.\n\nFirm A's reaction function: \nFirm A will set its price PA equal to or slightly below Firm B's price PB if PB > 10 (its marginal cost). If PB <= 10, Firm A will set its price equal to its marginal cost, PA = 10.\n\nFirm B's reaction function: \nFirm B will set its price PB equal to or slightly below Firm A's price PA if PA > 12 (its marginal cost). If PA <= 12, Firm B will set its price equal to its marginal cost, PB = 12.\n\nNow, let's find the equilibrium price:\n\n1. If Firm A sets PA = 10, Firm B will not lower its price below its marginal cost of 12. So, Firm B will set PB = 12.\n2. If Firm B sets PB = 12, Firm A will not lower its price below its marginal cost of 10. So, Firm A will set PA = 10.\n\nIn this Bertrand competition, the equilibrium prices are PA = 10 and PB = 12. Since consumers will buy from the firm with the lowest price, Firm A will capture the entire market demand at a price of 10. Therefore, the equilibrium price in this market is $10."
