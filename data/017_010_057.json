    "message_2": "Let G be a group with 10 elements. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G must divide the order of G, which is 10. Let n_2 and n_5 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups, respectively. Then, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_5 divides 2 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom condition 1, we see that n_2 can only be 1 or 5. From condition 2, we see that n_5 can only be 1 or 2. We will consider the possible cases for n_2 and n_5.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are coprime (2 and 5), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_2 ∩ P_5 = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. By the product formula, we have |P_2P_5| = |P_2||P_5|/|P_2 ∩ P_5| = 2 * 5 = 10. Thus, G = P_2P_5, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is the cyclic group C10.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 2\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups P_5 and P_5'. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. However, neither P_5 nor P_5' is normal in G. Let a be an element of order 2 in P_2 and b be an element of order 5 in P_5. Then, the group G is generated by a and b, and we can write any element of G in the form ab^i for some i (0 ≤ i ≤ 4). Since P_5 is not normal in G, there exists an element x in G such that xP_5x^(-1) = P_5'. Let x = ab^j for some j (1 ≤ j ≤ 4). Then, we have xP_5x^(-1) = (ab^j)P_5(b^(-j)a^(-1)) = P_5'. Since a has order 2, we have a^(-1) = a. Thus, we can rewrite xP_5x^(-1) as (ab^j)P_5(b^(-j)a). Now, let y = b^jP_5b^(-j)a. Then, y is an element of order 5 in P_5', and G is generated by a and y. Since a has order 2 and y has order 5, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and we can similarly show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 2\nIn this case, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups and two Sylow 5-subgroups. However, this case is not possible, because the total number of distinct elements in all Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups would be greater than 10, which contradicts the fact that G has only 10 elements.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. The non-abelian group of order 10 is actually the dihedral group D5, so G is isomorphic to either C10 or D5."
