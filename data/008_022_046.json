    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be written as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 3 |\n| 5  7  8 | 9 |\n| 3  4  6 | 6 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get the largest pivot in the first row:\n\n| 5  7  8 | 9 |\n| 2  3  4 | 3 |\n| 3  4  6 | 6 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in Row 2 and Row 3:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (2/5) * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (3/5) * Row 1\n\n| 5   7    8  |  9  |\n| 0  -1/5  4/5| -3/5|\n| 0  -1/5  6/5|  3/5|\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 2 by -5 to make the pivot in the second row equal to 1:\n\nRow 2 = -5 * Row 2\n\n| 5   7    8  |  9  |\n| 0   1   -4  |  3  |\n| 0  -1/5  6/5|  3/5|\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in Row 3:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 + (1/5) * Row 2\n\n| 5   7    8  |  9  |\n| 0   1   -4  |  3  |\n| 0   0    2  |  4  |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 2 to make the pivot in the third row equal to 1:\n\nRow 3 = (1/2) * Row 3\n\n| 5   7    8  |  9  |\n| 0   1   -4  |  3  |\n| 0   0    1  |  2  |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 2.\n\nSubstitute z into the second row:\n\ny - 4(2) = 3\ny - 8 = 3\ny = 11\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first row:\n\n5x + 7(11) + 8(2) = 9\n5x + 77 + 16 = 9\n5x = -84\nx = -16.8\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -16.8, y = 11, and z = 2."
