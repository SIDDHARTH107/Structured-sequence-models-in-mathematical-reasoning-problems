    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 3, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 3)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative by differentiating f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 + 4x + 5)\nf''(x) = 6x + 4\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 3 is f''(x) = 6x + 4."
