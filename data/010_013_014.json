    "message_1": "Let $E$ be a vector bundle over a topological space $X$ with rank $k$. If $c_1(E) = 5$ and $c_2(E) = 10$, what is the value of the total Chern class $c(E)$?",
    "message_2": "The total Chern class $c(E)$ of a vector bundle $E$ is given by the product of its individual Chern classes $c_i(E)$, where $i$ ranges from $0$ to the rank $k$ of the bundle. In our case, the rank of the vector bundle is $k=2$, and we are given the values of $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$.\n\nRecall that the total Chern class can be expressed as:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + \\cdots + c_k(E).$$\n\nSince the rank of the vector bundle is $k=2$, we only need to consider the first three terms:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E).$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$, we have:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + 5 + 10 = 16.$$\n\nTherefore, the total Chern class $c(E)$ of the vector bundle is $16$."
