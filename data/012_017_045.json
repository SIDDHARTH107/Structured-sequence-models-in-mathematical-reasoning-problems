    "message_2": "In this graph, a perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all the vertices such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. There are two perfect matchings in this graph:\n\n1. A-B and C-D\n2. A-C and B-D\n\nSo, the maximum number of perfect matchings that can be identified in this graph is 2."
