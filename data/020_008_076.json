The cost (in dollars) of delivering to each location is given in the table below. \n\n| Location | Cost of Delivery |\n|----------|------------------|\n| A        | 30               |\n| B        | 25               |\n| C        | 35               |\n| D        | 40               |\n| E        | 30               |\n\nHowever, the company wants to optimize their delivery route in order to minimize the total cost of delivery. What is the optimal route and the minimum cost of delivery?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route and the minimum cost of delivery, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total cost of all possible routes and then choose the route with the lowest cost. Since there are 5 locations, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is equal to 120 routes. \n\nHowever, since the delivery route is a round trip (starting and ending at the same point), we can divide the number of routes by 2, since each route will have a reverse route with the same cost. This leaves us with 60 unique routes to consider.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of each route:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E: 30 + 25 + 35 + 40 + 30 = 160\n2. A-B-C-E-D: 30 + 25 + 35 + 30 + 40 = 160\n3. A-B-D-C-E: 30 + 25 + 40 + 35 + 30 = 160\n4. A-B-D-E-C: 30 + 25 + 40 + 30 + 35 = 160\n5. A-B-E-C-D: 30 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 = 160\n6. A-B-E-D-C: 30 + 25 + 30 + 40 + 35 = 160\n...\n\nAs we can see, the total cost of delivery remains the same for all possible routes, which is 160 dollars. Therefore, there is no optimal route in this case, as all routes have the same minimum cost of delivery, which is 160 dollars."
