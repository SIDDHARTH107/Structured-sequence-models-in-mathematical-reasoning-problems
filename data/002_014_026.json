    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 8 cm x 6 cm = 48 square cm\n2. Length x Height: 8 cm x 4 cm = 32 square cm\n3. Width x Height: 6 cm x 4 cm = 24 square cm\n\nNow, we add the areas of each type of face together and multiply by 2 (since there are 2 of each type of face):\n\n(48 + 32 + 24) x 2 = 104 x 2 = 208 square cm\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 square cm."
