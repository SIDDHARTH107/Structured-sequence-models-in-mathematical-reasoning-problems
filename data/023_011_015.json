    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(w) of the given signal f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt), we can use the following formula for the Fourier transform:\n\nF(w) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) * e^(-jw*t) dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of each term separately:\n\n1) For cos(2πt), we have:\n\nF1(w) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} cos(2πt) * e^(-jw*t) dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite the cosine function as:\n\ncos(2πt) = (e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt))/2\n\nSo,\n\nF1(w) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [(e^(j2πt) + e^(-j2πt))/2] * e^(-jw*t) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF1(w) = (1/2) * [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(j(2π-w)t) dt + ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j(w+2π)t) dt]\n\nThese integrals are Dirac delta functions:\n\nF1(w) = (1/2) * [δ(w - 2π) + δ(w + 2π)]\n\n2) For sin(4πt), we have:\n\nF2(w) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} sin(4πt) * e^(-jw*t) dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite the sine function as:\n\nsin(4πt) = (e^(j4πt) - e^(-j4πt))/(2j)\n\nSo,\n\nF2(w) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [(e^(j4πt) - e^(-j4πt))/(2j)] * e^(-jw*t) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF2(w) = (1/2j) * [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(j(4π-w)t) dt - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j(w+4π)t) dt]\n\nThese integrals are Dirac delta functions:\n\nF2(w) = (1/2j) * [δ(w - 4π) - δ(w + 4π)]\n\nNow, we can find the total Fourier transform F(w) by adding F1(w) and F2(w):\n\nF(w) = F1(w) + F2(w) = (1/2) * [δ(w - 2π) + δ(w + 2π)] + (1/2j) * [δ(w - 4π) - δ(w + 4π)]\n\nFinally, we can find the value of F(2π) by substituting w = 2π:\n\nF(2π) = (1/2) * [δ(0) + δ(0)] + (1/2j) * [δ(-2π) - δ(6π)]\n\nSince δ(-2π) and δ(6π) are zero (the Dirac delta function is only non-zero when its argument is zero), we have:\n\nF(2π) = (1/2) * [δ(0) + δ(0)] = δ(0)\n\nHowever, the Dirac delta function δ(0) is not well-defined as a real number, but rather as a distribution. In practice, this means that F(2π) would be infinite at w = 2π, and the strength of the impulse would be determined by the context in which the Fourier transform is being used."
