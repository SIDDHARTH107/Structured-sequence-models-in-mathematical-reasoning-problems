    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, player A decides how much money to give to player B, and player B has no influence over the decision. The amount player B receives depends on player A's choice. Since there is no specific information about player A's preferences or strategy, we cannot determine the exact amount player B will receive in either condition. However, we can discuss some possibilities.\n\na) The game is played only once.\nIn this case, player A might choose to give any amount between $0 and $50 to player B. Some common choices could be splitting the money evenly ($25 each), giving nothing to player B ($50 for A, $0 for B), or any other division based on player A's preferences or sense of fairness.\n\nb) The game is played repeatedly for 5 rounds.\nIn this scenario, player A might consider the possibility of building a reputation or establishing trust with player B. They might choose to give more money to player B in the initial rounds to establish trust and then adjust their strategy in the later rounds based on player B's behavior. However, since player B has no influence over the decision, the amount they receive still depends solely on player A's choices. The total amount player B receives after 5 rounds will be the sum of the amounts given in each round, which could range from $0 to $250 (5 rounds * $50 per round)."
