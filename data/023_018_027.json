    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit and the integral is taken over all t.\n\nFor the given function f(t) = sin(3t) + 2cos(5t), we will find the Fourier transform F(ω):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(sin(3t) + 2cos(5t)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[sin(3t) * e^(-jωt)] dt + 2∫[cos(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can use the following integration formulas:\n\n∫[sin(at) * e^(bt)] dt = (a * cos(at) * e^(bt) - b * sin(at) * e^(bt)) / (a^2 + b^2) + C\n\n∫[cos(at) * e^(bt)] dt = (a * sin(at) * e^(bt) + b * cos(at) * e^(bt)) / (a^2 + b^2) + C\n\nApplying these formulas to our integrals:\n\nF(ω) = [(3 * cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) + jω * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt)) / (9 + (jω)^2)] + 2[(5 * sin(5t) * e^(-jωt) - jω * cos(5t) * e^(-jωt)) / (25 + (jω)^2)]\n\nNow, we have the Fourier transform F(ω) of the function f(t). However, to find the values of f(3π/5) and f(4π/5), we don't need to use the Fourier transform. We can directly plug these values into the original function:\n\nf(3π/5) = sin(3 * 3π/5) + 2cos(5 * 3π/5) = sin(9π/5) + 2cos(15π/5) = sin(9π/5) + 2cos(3π)\n\nf(4π/5) = sin(3 * 4π/5) + 2cos(5 * 4π/5) = sin(12π/5) + 2cos(20π/5) = sin(12π/5) + 2cos(4π)\n\nNow, we can use the properties of sine and cosine functions:\n\nsin(9π/5) = sin(π - 4π/5) = sin(π/5)\ncos(3π) = -1\nsin(12π/5) = sin(2π + 2π/5) = sin(2π/5)\ncos(4π) = 1\n\nSo, the values of the function at the given points are:\n\nf(3π/5) = sin(π/5) - 2 = 0.9510565163 - 2 ≈ -1.0489434837\n\nf(4π/5) = sin(2π/5) + 2 = 0.5877852523 + 2 ≈ 2.5877852523"
