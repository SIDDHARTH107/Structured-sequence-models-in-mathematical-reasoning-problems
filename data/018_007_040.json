    "message_2": "A power set of a set A is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The number of elements in the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A.\n\nIn this case, A has 4 elements, so the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of elements in the power set of A with the number of elements in A itself. The power set of A has 16 elements, while A has 4 elements. Clearly, the power set of A is larger than the set A itself.\n\nTo prove that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself, let's consider a general set A with n elements. The number of elements in the power set of A is 2^n, and we want to show that 2^n > n for all n.\n\nWe can prove this by induction:\n\nBase case: For n = 1, we have 2^1 = 2 > 1. So, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that 2^k > k for some positive integer k. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by the properties of exponents)\n\nSince 2^k > k (by the inductive hypothesis), we have:\n\n2 * 2^k > 2 * k\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > (k+1). This is equivalent to showing that k > 1. Since k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 (by the induction assumption), this inequality holds.\n\nThus, we have shown that 2^(k+1) > (k+1), completing the inductive step.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, we have proven that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself for all positive integers n."
