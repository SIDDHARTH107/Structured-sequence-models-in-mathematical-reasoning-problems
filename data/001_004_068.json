    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients, which is 3:\n\n3(x^2 + 2x - 5)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials (ax + b)(cx + d) such that:\n\n1. a * c = 1 (coefficient of x^2)\n2. b * d = -5 (constant term)\n3. ad + bc = 2 (coefficient of x)\n\nThe possible factor pairs of -5 are (-1, 5) and (1, -5). We can see that (1, -5) works because:\n\na = 1, b = -5, c = 1, d = 5\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n3(x - 1)(x + 5)"
