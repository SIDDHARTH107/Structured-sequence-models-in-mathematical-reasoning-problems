    "message_2": "The halting problem in computability theory states that there is no general algorithm that can determine whether a given computer program will halt or run indefinitely, given any input. In other words, it is undecidable. Therefore, there is no maximum possible number of steps to determine if a given computer program will halt, as there is no universal method to make this determination."
