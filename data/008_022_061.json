    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 3  4 -5 | 7\n| 2  3 -4 | 5\n| 7  6 -8 | 12\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have a larger pivot element:\n\n| 2  3 -4 | 5\n| 3  4 -5 | 7\n| 7  6 -8 | 12\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in row 2 and row 3:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (3/2) * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (7/2) * Row 1\n\n| 2   3  -4 |  5\n| 0  -0.5  1 | -0.5\n| 0  -4.5  6 |  1.5\n\nStep 3: Multiply row 2 by -2 to make the pivot element 1:\n\n| 2   3  -4 |  5\n| 0   1  -2 |  1\n| 0  -4.5  6 |  1.5\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in row 1 and row 3:\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 - (3/2) * Row 2\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 9 * Row 2\n\n| 2  0  2 |  2\n| 0  1 -2 |  1\n| 0  0  0 |  0\n\nThe resulting matrix is in row echelon form. Since the last row is all zeros, we have a free variable (z). Let's express the solution in terms of z:\n\nz = t (t is a parameter)\ny = 1 + 2t\nx = 1 - t\n\nThe solution set is given by:\n\n{x = 1 - t, y = 1 + 2t, z = t} for all values of t.\n\nNow, let's check if the matrix is ill-conditioned. We will calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\n| 2  3 -4 |\n| 3  4 -5 |\n| 7  6 -8 |\n\nDeterminant = 2(4 * -8 - (-5) * 6) - 3(3 * -8 - (-5) * 7) + 4(3 * 6 - 4 * 7)\nDeterminant = 2(-32 + 30) - 3(-24 + 35) + 4(18 - 28)\nDeterminant = 2(-2) + 3(11) + 4(-10)\nDeterminant = -4 + 33 - 40\nDeterminant = -11\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is not ill-conditioned."
