    "message_2": "To find the equation of a line passing through two points in the projective plane, we can use the cross product of their homogeneous coordinates. Let's denote the two points as P1 = (2 : 1 : 1) and P2 = (1 : -1 : 2).\n\nThe cross product of P1 and P2 is given by:\n\nP1 x P2 = ( (1)(2) - (1)(-1), (1)(1) - (2)(2), (2)(-1) - (1)(1) )\nP1 x P2 = ( 2 + 1, 1 - 4, -2 - 1 )\nP1 x P2 = ( 3, -3, -3 )\n\nSo, the homogeneous coordinates of the line passing through P1 and P2 are (3, -3, -3). The equation of this line in the projective plane can be written as:\n\n3x - 3y - 3z = 0"
