    "message_2": "To find the equation of the polynomial function, we can use the general form of a polynomial of degree 2 (since we have 3 points):\n\nf(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n\nNow, we can plug in the given points into the equation and create a system of linear equations to solve for a, b, and c.\n\nFor point (1, 3):\n3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c\n\nFor point (2, -1):\n-1 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c\n\nFor point (3, 5):\n5 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1. 3 = a + b + c\n2. -1 = 4a + 2b + c\n3. 5 = 9a + 3b + c\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrices. Let's use the elimination method:\n\nFirst, subtract equation 1 from equation 2 and equation 3:\n\n2 - 1: -4 = 3a + b\n3 - 1: 2 = 8a + 2b\n\nNow, we can multiply the first new equation by 2 and subtract it from the second new equation:\n\n(2 * (3a + b)) - (8a + 2b): 8 = -2a\n\nNow we can solve for a:\na = -4\n\nNow we can substitute the value of a back into the new equations to find b and c:\n\n-4 = 3(-4) + b\nb = 8\n\n3 = -4 + 8 + c\nc = -1\n\nSo, the equation of the polynomial function is:\n\nf(x) = -4x^2 + 8x - 1"
