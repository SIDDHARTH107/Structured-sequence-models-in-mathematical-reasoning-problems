The company wants to know which advertising strategy has a higher impact on the customer's decisions. The payoff matrix is given below:\n\n|        | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |\n|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Ad A   | 10, 20   | 20, 30   | 30, 40 | 40, 50|\n| Ad B   | 20, 10   | 30, 20   | 40, 30 | 50, 40|\n\nUsing the Nash equilibrium concept, determine which advertising strategy is the best for the company.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best response for each player (the company and the customers) given the other player's strategy. In this case, the company chooses between Ad A and Ad B, and the customers choose between Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, and Option 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the best response for the company given the customers' choices:\n\n- If customers choose Option 1, the company's best response is Ad B (20 > 10).\n- If customers choose Option 2, the company's best response is Ad B (30 > 20).\n- If customers choose Option 3, the company's best response is Ad B (40 > 30).\n- If customers choose Option 4, the company's best response is Ad B (50 > 40).\n\nNow, let's find the best response for the customers given the company's choices:\n\n- If the company chooses Ad A, the customers' best response is Option 4 (50 > 40 > 30 > 20).\n- If the company chooses Ad B, the customers' best response is Option 4 (40 > 30 > 20 > 10).\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose their best response given the other player's strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when the company chooses Ad B and the customers choose Option 4, with payoffs (50, 40).\n\nTherefore, the best advertising strategy for the company is Ad B."
