    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 10 and E = 15. We want to find out if there exists a value for F such that the equation holds true.\n\nHowever, before we do that, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nFor a graph to be planar, it must satisfy the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds true, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we still need to check if it contains a subdivision of K5 or K3,3.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a graph with 10 vertices without forming a K5 subgraph is given by:\n\nE(K5-free) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a graph with 10 vertices without forming a K3,3 subgraph is given by:\n\nE(K3,3-free) = 3 * (10 - 3) = 3 * 7 = 21\n\nSince our graph has 15 edges, it is possible that it does not contain a K5 or K3,3 subgraph. However, without more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot definitively determine whether or not the graph is planar."
