    "message_2": "In this topology, the open sets are {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, and the entire space X = {a, b, c}. The closed sets are the complements of these open sets, which are âˆ…, {b, c}, {a, c}, {a, b}, {a}, {b}, and {a, b, c}.\n\nThe closure of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A. In this case, A = {a, b}. We can see that {a, b} is already a closed set in this topology. Therefore, the closure of the set {a, b} is {a, b}."
