    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply the 2D Fourier Transform to the image.\n2. Obtain the magnitude and phase spectra.\n3. Apply the inverse 2D Fourier Transform to the magnitude and phase spectra.\n4. Reconstruct the image.\n5. Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images.\n\nLet's assume the given image is represented by the matrix I.\n\nStep 1: Apply the 2D Fourier Transform to the image.\nWe can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the 2D Fourier Transform of the image. In Python, we can use the `numpy.fft.fft2` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nF = np.fft.fft2(I)\n```\n\nStep 2: Obtain the magnitude and phase spectra.\nThe magnitude spectrum is the absolute value of the Fourier Transform, and the phase spectrum is the angle of the Fourier Transform.\n\n```python\nmagnitude_spectrum = np.abs(F)\nphase_spectrum = np.angle(F)\n```\n\nStep 3: Apply the inverse 2D Fourier Transform to the magnitude and phase spectra.\nFirst, we need to combine the magnitude and phase spectra to create a complex spectrum. Then, we can apply the inverse 2D Fourier Transform using the `numpy.fft.ifft2` function:\n\n```python\ncomplex_spectrum = magnitude_spectrum * np.exp(1j * phase_spectrum)\nreconstructed_image = np.fft.ifft2(complex_spectrum)\n```\n\nStep 4: Reconstruct the image.\nSince the inverse Fourier Transform might return complex values, we need to take the real part of the reconstructed image:\n\n```python\nreconstructed_image = np.real(reconstructed_image)\n```\n\nStep 5: Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images.\nThe MSE is the average of the squared differences between the original image and the reconstructed image:\n\n```python\nmse = np.mean((I - reconstructed_image) ** 2)\n```\n\nNow, we have computed the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images."
