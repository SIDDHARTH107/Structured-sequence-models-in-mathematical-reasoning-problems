    "message_2": "To find the roots of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 9, we need to find the values of x for which f(x) = 0.\n\nFirst, we can try to find any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (9 in this case) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (1 in this case). The factors of 9 are ±1, ±3, and ±9. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, and ±9.\n\nNow, we can test these possible rational roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\nf(1) = 1^3 - 5(1)^2 + 3(1) + 9 = 1 - 5 + 3 + 9 = 8 ≠ 0\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 5(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 9 = -1 - 5 - 3 + 9 = 0\nf(3) = 3^3 - 5(3)^2 + 3(3) + 9 = 27 - 45 + 9 + 9 = 0\nf(-3) = (-3)^3 - 5(-3)^2 + 3(-3) + 9 = -27 - 45 - 9 + 9 ≠ 0\nf(9) = 9^3 - 5(9)^2 + 3(9) + 9 ≠ 0\nf(-9) = (-9)^3 - 5(-9)^2 + 3(-9) + 9 ≠ 0\n\nWe found two rational roots: x = -1 and x = 3. Now, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining root.\n\nDividing the polynomial by (x + 1) and (x - 3) using synthetic division:\n\n(x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 9) / (x + 1) = x^2 - 6x + 9\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) / (x - 3) = x - 3\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 3)(x - 3). The roots are x = -1, x = 3 (with multiplicity 2).\n\nNow, to graph the equation on a coordinate plane, we can plot the roots and sketch the curve:\n\n1. Plot the roots: (-1, 0) and (3, 0)\n2. Since the leading term is x^3, the graph will have a similar shape to a cubic function.\n3. The graph will start in the bottom left quadrant (since the coefficient of x^3 is positive) and end in the top right quadrant.\n4. The graph will touch the x-axis at x = 3 (due to the multiplicity of 2) and cross the x-axis at x = -1.\n\nBy connecting these points and following the general shape of a cubic function, you can sketch the graph of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 9 on a coordinate plane."
