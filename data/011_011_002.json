    "message_2": "A partition of a number is a way of expressing it as a sum of positive integers. In this case, we want to partition the number 6 into distinct positive integers, meaning each integer in the partition must be different.\n\nHere are the possible partitions of 6 into distinct positive integers:\n\n1. 6\n2. 5 + 1\n3. 4 + 2\n4. 3 + 2 + 1\n\nThere are 4 ways to partition the number 6 into distinct positive integers."
