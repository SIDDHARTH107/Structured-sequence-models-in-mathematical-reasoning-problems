    "message_2": "In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the shared secret key can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret integer, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret integer.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n\nIf the protocol is executed correctly, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this value will be the shared secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key using the given values:\n\n1. A = 5^9 mod 23\n2. B = 5^6 mod 23\n3. K_A = B^9 mod 23\n4. K_B = A^6 mod 23\n\nCalculating A and B:\nA = 5^9 mod 23 = 1953125 mod 23 = 6\nB = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 2\n\nCalculating K_A and K_B:\nK_A = 2^9 mod 23 = 512 mod 23 = 18\nK_B = 6^6 mod 23 = 46656 mod 23 = 18\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 18."
