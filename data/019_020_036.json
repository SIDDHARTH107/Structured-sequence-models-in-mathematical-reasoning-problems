    "message_2": "If a decision problem can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine in 2^100 steps or less, the highest complexity class this problem can belong to is NP. This is because NP is the set of decision problems for which a solution can be verified by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, and 2^100 is a constant, which is a special case of polynomial time."
