    "message_1": "During a performance, a magician places three identical boxes in front of an audience. Two boxes are empty and one contains a prize. A volunteer is selected and asked to choose one box. The magician then opens one of the other boxes, which is empty. The volunteer is given the option to either keep their original choice or switch to the remaining unopened box. What is the probability that the volunteer wins the prize if they switch boxes?",
    "message_2": "Using the Monty Hall problem as a reference, the probability that the volunteer wins the prize if they switch boxes is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%. Here's why:\n\nWhen the volunteer initially chooses a box, there is a 1/3 chance that it contains the prize and a 2/3 chance that it does not. After the magician opens an empty box, the probability distribution does not change for the initial choice. So, the volunteer's initial choice still has a 1/3 chance of containing the prize.\n\nHowever, since the magician has revealed an empty box, the probability of the remaining unopened box containing the prize is now 2/3. This is because the probability must add up to 1, and if the initial choice has a 1/3 chance of being correct, the remaining probability (2/3) must be assigned to the other unopened box.\n\nSo, if the volunteer switches boxes, they have a 2/3 chance of winning the prize."
