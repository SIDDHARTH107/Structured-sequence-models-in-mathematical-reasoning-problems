    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has noticed that an increase in the number of workers on a shift results in an increase in the number of units produced. Using causal logic, if 10 workers can produce 500 units in 8 hours, how many units will 15 workers produce in 12 hours?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the production rate per worker per hour. \n\n10 workers produce 500 units in 8 hours, so the production rate is:\n\n500 units / (10 workers * 8 hours) = 500 / 80 = 6.25 units per worker per hour\n\nNow, let's calculate how many units 15 workers can produce in 12 hours:\n\n15 workers * 12 hours * 6.25 units per worker per hour = 1125 units\n\nSo, 15 workers will produce 1125 units in 12 hours."
