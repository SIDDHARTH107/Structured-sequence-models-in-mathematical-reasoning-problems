    "message_1": "What is the probability of a heart transplant patient surviving for at least 1 year after the transplant surgery, given that the average survival time for this type of surgery is 8 months with a standard deviation of 3 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-score) to find the probability. First, we need to convert the given information into a Z-score.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (in this case, 12 months for 1 year), μ is the mean (average survival time, which is 8 months), and σ is the standard deviation (3 months).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nZ = (12 - 8) / 3\nZ = 4 / 3\nZ ≈ 1.33\n\nNow, we need to find the probability associated with this Z-score. We can use a Z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probability. The Z-table gives us the probability of a value being less than the given Z-score. Since we want the probability of surviving at least 1 year, we need to find the probability of the value being greater than the Z-score.\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a Z-score less than 1.33 is approximately 0.9082. To find the probability of surviving at least 1 year, we need to find the complement of this probability:\n\nP(surviving at least 1 year) = 1 - P(Z < 1.33)\nP(surviving at least 1 year) = 1 - 0.9082\nP(surviving at least 1 year) ≈ 0.0918\n\nSo, the probability of a heart transplant patient surviving for at least 1 year after the transplant surgery is approximately 9.18%."
