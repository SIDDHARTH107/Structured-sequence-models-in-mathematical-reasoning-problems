    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The total length of the curve increases with each order, and the length of the curve at any given order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Side length of the initial curve) × (Number of line segments in the curve)\n\nFor a 4th order Hilbert curve with an initial side length of 4 and each line segment of length 1, we first need to determine the number of line segments in the curve. The number of line segments in a Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^(Order of the curve)\n\nFor a 4th order Hilbert curve:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^4 = 256\n\nNow, we can calculate the total length of the 4th order Hilbert curve:\n\nLength = (Initial side length) × (Number of line segments) = 4 × 256 = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the 4th order Hilbert curve is 1024."
