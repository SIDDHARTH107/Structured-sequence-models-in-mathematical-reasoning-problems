    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will use the Sylow Theorems and properties of groups of order 8.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow Theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k divides the order of G, and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 8:\n\n1. Since 8 = 2^3, by the first Sylow theorem, G has a subgroup of order 2^3 = 8. This subgroup must be G itself.\n2. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of subgroups of order 2^2 = 4 divides the order of G (which is 8), and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, there is either 1 or 4 subgroups of order 4 in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: There is only 1 subgroup of order 4 in G.\nIn this case, the unique subgroup of order 4 must be normal in G (since it is the only one and all subgroups of the same order are conjugate). Let H be this normal subgroup of order 4. Since G has order 8 and H has order 4, G/H has order 8/4 = 2. Thus, G/H is a cyclic group of order 2. By the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and G/H. Since H is a cyclic group of order 4 and G/H is a cyclic group of order 2, G is isomorphic to the direct product of C4 and C2, which is the dihedral group D4.\n\nCase 2: There are 4 subgroups of order 4 in G.\nLet x be an element of G not in any of these subgroups of order 4. Then the order of x must be 8 (since it cannot be 1, 2, or 4). Thus, G has an element of order 8, which means G is a cyclic group of order 8, i.e., G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nNow, we have shown that G is either isomorphic to C8 or D4. The only remaining possibility is that G is isomorphic to Q8. To show this, we need to consider the structure of G. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to C8. If G has an element of order 4 and all its subgroups of order 4 are normal, then G is isomorphic to D4. If G has no elements of order 8 and not all its subgroups of order 4 are normal, then G must be isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4."
