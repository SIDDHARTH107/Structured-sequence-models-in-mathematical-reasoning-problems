Determine the number of possible isomorphism classes using the formula: k(G) = k(2^3) * k(3) * k(5), where k(G) is the number of isomorphism classes of a group of order G.\n\nThe number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 2^3 (8) is 5, which are:\n- Cyclic group C_8\n- Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 4, C_2 × C_4\n- Direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, C_2 × C_2 × C_2 (also known as the elementary abelian group of order 8)\n- Dihedral group D_4\n- Quaternion group Q_8\n\nThe number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 3 (3) is 1, which is the cyclic group C_3.\n\nThe number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 5 (5) is 1, which is the cyclic group C_5.\n\nNow, using the formula, we have k(120) = k(2^3) * k(3) * k(5) = 5 * 1 * 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. Their respective isomorphism classes are:\n\n1. C_120\n2. C_2 × C_4 × C_3 × C_5\n3. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_3 × C_5\n4. D_4 × C_3 × C_5\n5. Q_8 × C_3 × C_5"
