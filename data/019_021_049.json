    "message_2": "In a game of rock-paper-scissors, there are 3 possible outcomes for each player: win, lose, or draw. Since each player chooses one of the three options with equal probability, the probability of each outcome is 1/3.\n\nLet's consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Player 1 wins, Player 2 loses: Probability = 1/3\n2. Player 1 loses, Player 2 wins: Probability = 1/3\n3. Draw: Probability = 1/3\n\nThe prize is only awarded if there is a winner. In the case of a draw, neither player receives the prize. Therefore, we only need to consider the first two outcomes when calculating the expected value.\n\nFor each player, the expected value of the prize is the sum of the probabilities of winning multiplied by the prize value:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Winning) * (Prize Value)\n\nFor both players, the probability of winning is 1/3, and the prize value is 5 dollars. So, the expected value of the prize for each player is:\n\nExpected Value = (1/3) * 5 = 5/3 â‰ˆ 1.67 dollars"
