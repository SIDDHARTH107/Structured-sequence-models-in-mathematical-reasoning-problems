    "message_2": "For a particle in a one-dimensional box, the wave function in the ground state (n=1) can be described by the following equation:\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere L is the width of the box, n is the energy level, and x is the position within the box. In this case, L = 3 meters and n = 1.\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/3) * sin(πx/3)\n\nThe probability density function is given by the square of the wave function:\n\nP(x) = |Ψ(x)|^2 = (2/3) * sin^2(πx/3)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being between 0.5 and 1 meter, we need to integrate the probability density function over this range:\n\nP(0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1) = ∫[0.5, 1] (2/3) * sin^2(πx/3) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nP(0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1) = ∫[0.5, 1] (2/3) * (1 - cos(2πx/3))/2 dx\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nP(0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1) = (1/3) * ∫[0.5, 1] (1 - cos(2πx/3)) dx\n\nP(0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1) = (1/3) * [x - (3/4π) * sin(2πx/3)] evaluated from 0.5 to 1\n\nP(0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1) = (1/3) * [(1 - (3/4π) * sin(2π/3)) - (0.5 - (3/4π) * sin(π/3))]\n\nP(0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1) ≈ 0.2113\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle between 0.5 and 1 meter is approximately 21.13%."
