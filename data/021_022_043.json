    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution for various optimization problems. Here, we will use the firefly algorithm to find the optimal solution for the given problem.\n\nStep 1: Initialization\n- Define the objective function f(x, y)\n- Define the constraint function g(x, y) = x + 2y - 8\n- Set the number of fireflies n, maximum iterations max_iter, and other algorithm parameters (alpha, beta, gamma)\n\nStep 2: Generate initial firefly population\n- Randomly generate n fireflies within the search space, ensuring they satisfy the constraint g(x, y) >= 0\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each firefly\n- Calculate the fitness value for each firefly using the objective function f(x, y)\n\nStep 4: Update the firefly positions\n- For each firefly, compare its brightness (fitness) with other fireflies\n- If a firefly is attracted to a brighter firefly, update its position using the following formula:\n  x_new = x_old + beta * exp(-gamma * r^2) * (x_bright - x_old) + alpha * rand()\n  where x_new and x_old are the new and old positions, x_bright is the position of the brighter firefly, r is the distance between the two fireflies, and rand() is a random number between -1 and 1.\n\nStep 5: Check the constraints\n- If a firefly's new position violates the constraint g(x, y) < 0, move it back to the feasible region by projecting it onto the constraint boundary.\n\nStep 6: Repeat steps 3-5 for max_iter iterations\n\nStep 7: Find the optimal solution\n- After max_iter iterations, the firefly with the best fitness value represents the optimal solution.\n\nNote that the firefly algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the solution may vary depending on the initial population and algorithm parameters. To increase the chance of finding the global optimum, you can run the algorithm multiple times with different initial populations and parameters.\n\nIn this case, since the problem is a simple quadratic function with a linear constraint, you can also find the optimal solution using other optimization methods such as the Lagrange multiplier method or gradient-based methods."
