    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic space, the area of a hyperbolic triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area (A) of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ in a space with curvature K is:\n\nA = (-K) * (π - (α + β + γ))\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given angles to radians:\n\n60° = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n75° = (75 * π) / 180 = 5π/12 radians\n45° = (45 * π) / 180 = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the angles and the curvature value into the formula:\n\nA = (-(-3)) * (π - (π/3 + 5π/12 + π/4))\nA = 3 * (π - (4π/12 + 5π/12 + 3π/12))\nA = 3 * (π - (12π/12))\nA = 3 * (π - π)\nA = 3 * 0\n\nThe area of the hyperbolic triangle is 0."
