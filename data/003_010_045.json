    "message_1": "A student wants to find the height of a building. Standing 50 meters away from the building, they measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 60 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the distance from the building (adjacent side) is 50 meters, and the height of the building (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 50\n\nFirst, we find the value of tan(60°):\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\n1.732 = height / 50\n\nTo find the height, we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nheight ≈ 1.732 * 50\n\nheight ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 86.6 meters."
