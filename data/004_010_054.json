    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x + 3, we need to find a function F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x). We can do this by integrating f(x) with respect to x.\n\n∫(2x + 3) dx\n\nWe can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫2x dx + ∫3 dx\n\nNow, we find the antiderivative of each term:\n\n(2/2)x^2 + 3x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 3x\n\nHowever, when finding the antiderivative, we must also include the constant of integration, C:\n\nF(x) = x^2 + 3x + C"
