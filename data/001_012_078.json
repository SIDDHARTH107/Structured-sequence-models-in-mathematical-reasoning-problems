    "message_2": "To simplify the rational expression (7x^2 + 14x) / (21x), we can first factor out the common factor of x from the numerator:\n\nx(7x + 14) / (21x)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor of 7 from the expression inside the parentheses in the numerator:\n\nx(7(x + 2)) / (21x)\n\nNext, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator. The common factor of x can be canceled out:\n\n7(x + 2) / 21\n\nFinally, we can cancel out the common factor of 7:\n\n(7/7)(x + 2) / (21/7)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(x + 2) / 3\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(x + 2) / 3"
