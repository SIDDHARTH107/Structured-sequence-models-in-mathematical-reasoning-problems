    "message_1": "In a restaurant, there are 7 different entrees, 5 different main course dishes, and 4 different desserts. How many different three-course meals can be made, where each course is different? (Hint: Use Polya's Enumeration Theorem)",
    "message_2": "We don't need Polya's Enumeration Theorem for this problem. We can simply use the counting principle.\n\nFor each meal, there are 3 courses: entree, main course, and dessert. We have 7 choices for the entree, 5 choices for the main course, and 4 choices for the dessert. To find the total number of different three-course meals, we multiply the number of choices for each course:\n\n7 entrees * 5 main courses * 4 desserts = 140 different three-course meals."
