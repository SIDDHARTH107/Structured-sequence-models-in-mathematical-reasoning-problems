    "message_1": "A long cylindrical conductor of radius 2cm has a charge density of 3C/m³. Determine the electric potential distribution inside and outside the conductor using Laplace's equation. Assume potential is 0 at infinity.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the electric field inside and outside the conductor and then integrate the electric field to find the electric potential. \n\nFor a long cylindrical conductor, we can use Gauss's law to find the electric field. Gauss's law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed by the surface divided by the permittivity of free space (ε₀).\n\nΦ = Q_enclosed / ε₀\n\nFor a cylindrical Gaussian surface with radius r and length L, the electric field is constant on the surface, and the electric flux is given by:\n\nΦ = E * 2πrL\n\nThe charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is given by the charge density (ρ) multiplied by the volume enclosed:\n\nQ_enclosed = ρ * π(R^2 - r^2)L, where R is the radius of the conductor (2 cm = 0.02 m).\n\nNow, equating the electric flux and the charge enclosed, we get:\n\nE * 2πrL = ρ * π(R^2 - r^2)L / ε₀\n\nSolving for the electric field E:\n\nE = ρ * (R^2 - r^2) / (2ε₀r)\n\nNow, we will find the electric potential (V) by integrating the electric field:\n\nV = -∫E dr\n\nFor r < R (inside the conductor):\n\nV_inside = -∫(ρ * (R^2 - r^2) / (2ε₀r)) dr from r to R\n\nV_inside = (ρ / (2ε₀)) * (R^2 * ln(R) - R^2 * ln(r) - R^2 + r^2) + C1\n\nFor r > R (outside the conductor):\n\nV_outside = -∫(ρ * (R^2 - r^2) / (2ε₀r)) dr from r to infinity\n\nV_outside = (ρ * R^2 / (2ε₀)) * (1 / r) + C2\n\nNow, we need to find the constants C1 and C2. Since the potential is 0 at infinity:\n\n0 = (ρ * R^2 / (2ε₀)) * (1 / infinity) + C2\n\nC2 = 0\n\nAnd at the surface of the conductor (r = R), the potential must be continuous:\n\nV_inside(R) = V_outside(R)\n\n(ρ / (2ε₀)) * (R^2 * ln(R) - R^2 * ln(R) - R^2 + R^2) + C1 = (ρ * R^2 / (2ε₀)) * (1 / R)\n\nC1 = 0\n\nSo, the electric potential distribution inside and outside the conductor is:\n\nV_inside(r) = (ρ / (2ε₀)) * (R^2 * ln(R) - R^2 * ln(r) - R^2 + r^2) for r < R\n\nV_outside(r) = (ρ * R^2 / (2ε₀)) * (1 / r) for r > R\n\nWhere ρ = 3 C/m³, R = 0.02 m, and ε₀ = 8.854 x 10^(-12) F/m."
