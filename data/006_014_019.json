    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, we can first find the probability that none of the components will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component will not fail is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 (90%).\n\nSince the components are independent, the probability that all 5 components will not fail is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\n0.90 * 0.90 * 0.90 * 0.90 * 0.90 = 0.90^5 ≈ 0.59049\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component will fail by subtracting the probability that none of them will fail from 1:\n\n1 - 0.59049 ≈ 0.40951\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component will fail in the system is approximately 40.95%."
