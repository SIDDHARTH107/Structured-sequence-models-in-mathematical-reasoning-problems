    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 120 and 84 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (120) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder.\n   120 รท 84 = 1 with a remainder of 36.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (120) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (36).\n   Now we have to find the GCD of 84 and 36.\n\n3. Repeat the process:\n   84 รท 36 = 2 with a remainder of 12.\n\n4. Replace the numbers again:\n   Now we have to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\n5. Repeat the process:\n   36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. So, the GCD of 120 and 84 is 12."
