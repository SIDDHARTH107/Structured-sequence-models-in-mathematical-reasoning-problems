    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression 2^3 x 2^5, we can use the product of powers property, which states that when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we can add the exponents. In this case, the base is 2.\n\n2^3 x 2^5 = 2^(3+5) = 2^8\n\nNow, we can calculate 2^8:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is 256."
