    "message_1": "A two-player zero-sum game is played between two friends, Alex and Bailey. Alex chooses whether to play Rock, Paper or Scissors and Bailey chooses from the same three options. The winner takes a prize of $10. If both players choose the same option, no one wins anything. Alex thinks that Bailey will choose Rock with a probability of 0.3, Paper with a probability of 0.5 and Scissors with a probability of 0.2. Develop a strategy for Alex that maximizes his expected prize money. What is the expected prize money that Alex can win?",
    "message_2": "To maximize his expected prize money, Alex should choose the option that has the highest probability of winning against Bailey's choices. We can calculate the expected prize money for each of Alex's choices:\n\n1. If Alex chooses Rock:\n- Wins $10 against Scissors (0.2 probability)\n- Loses against Paper (0.5 probability)\n- Draws against Rock (0.3 probability)\nExpected prize money = 0.2 * $10 = $2\n\n2. If Alex chooses Paper:\n- Wins $10 against Rock (0.3 probability)\n- Loses against Scissors (0.2 probability)\n- Draws against Paper (0.5 probability)\nExpected prize money = 0.3 * $10 = $3\n\n3. If Alex chooses Scissors:\n- Wins $10 against Paper (0.5 probability)\n- Loses against Rock (0.3 probability)\n- Draws against Scissors (0.2 probability)\nExpected prize money = 0.5 * $10 = $5\n\nBased on the expected prize money, Alex should choose Scissors as his strategy to maximize his expected prize money. The expected prize money that Alex can win is $5."
