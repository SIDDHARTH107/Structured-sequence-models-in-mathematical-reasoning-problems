    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the Duffing oscillator, we can use the method of harmonic balance. This involves assuming a solution of the form x(t) = A*cos(ωt - δ), where A is the amplitude and δ is the phase shift. We can then substitute this solution into the Duffing oscillator equation and solve for A.\n\nFirst, let's find the natural frequency of the linear system (without the nonlinear term αx^3). The natural frequency ω_n is given by:\n\nω_n = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the values for k and m, we get:\n\nω_n = sqrt(2.0/0.5) = sqrt(4) = 2 rad/s\n\nNow, let's find the dimensionless frequency, which is the ratio of the forcing frequency to the natural frequency:\n\nΩ = ω/ω_n = 1.2/2 = 0.6\n\nNext, we need to find the dimensionless damping coefficient, which is given by:\n\nγ = c/(2*m*ω_n) = 0.3/(2*0.5*2) = 0.15\n\nNow, we can use the following equation to find the dimensionless amplitude (A'):\n\nA'^3 - 3*Ω^2*A' + 4*Ω^4 = (F/(m*ω_n^2*α))^2\n\nPlugging in the values for F, m, ω_n, and α, we get:\n\nA'^3 - 3*(0.6)^2*A' + 4*(0.6)^4 = (0.8/(0.5*2^2*(-1.5)))^2\n\nSolving this equation numerically, we find that the dimensionless amplitude A' is approximately 0.95.\n\nFinally, we can find the actual amplitude A by multiplying the dimensionless amplitude by the factor m*ω_n^2/α:\n\nA = A'*(m*ω_n^2/α) = 0.95*(0.5*2^2/(-1.5)) ≈ 1.27 m\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude of the Duffing oscillator is approximately 1.27 meters."
