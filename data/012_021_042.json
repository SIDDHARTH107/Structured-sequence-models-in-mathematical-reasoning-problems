The tree decomposition is a representation of the graph by a tree, where each node of the tree corresponds to a subset of vertices, and each edge corresponds to a separator set of vertices that separates the subsets on either side of the edge. The width of a tree decomposition is defined as the size of the largest separator set minus one.",
