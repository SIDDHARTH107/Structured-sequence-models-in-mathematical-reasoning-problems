    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 24 is isomorphic to either C24, A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of the group.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. Then, the order of G can be factored as 2^3 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 8 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 or 3, and n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we analyze the cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since both are unique, they are normal in G. The intersection of P and Q is trivial, so the product of their orders is equal to the order of G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C8 x C3 = C24, the cyclic group of order 24.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not unique, so they are not normal. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. The action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of P in G, which has index 3 in G. Thus, the kernel is isomorphic to Q, and the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S3 of order 8. The only such subgroup is the dihedral group D4. So, G is a semidirect product of Q and D4. There are two non-isomorphic semidirect products in this case, which correspond to two of the non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. The Sylow 3-subgroups are not unique, so they are not normal. Let Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. The action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S4. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of Q in G, which has index 4 in G. Thus, the kernel is isomorphic to P, and the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S4 of order 6. The only such subgroup is the symmetric group S3. So, G is a semidirect product of P and S3. There are three non-isomorphic semidirect products in this case, which correspond to the remaining three non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are unique, so they are not normal. However, this case cannot occur, as it would imply that there are 3 * 2 = 6 elements of order 2 and 4 * 2 = 8 elements of order 3 in G, which would leave no room for the identity element.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 24 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5 (which is one of the non-abelian groups of order 24), or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24."
