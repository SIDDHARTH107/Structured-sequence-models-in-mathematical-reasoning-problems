    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 120. We want to determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120. If G is cyclic, then it has an element of order 120. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must divide 24 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G, denoted by n_2, must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. If G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then both are normal in G, and G would be the direct product of these two subgroups. In this case, G would be isomorphic to C120.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2. The group A5 has order 60, and C2 × C2 has order 4. The direct product A5 × C2 × C2 has order 60 × 4 = 240, which is not equal to 120. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nFinally, let's consider the possibility that G is one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. If G is not isomorphic to C120, then it must have more than one Sylow 5-subgroup or more than one Sylow 2-subgroup. In either case, G would not be a direct product of a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup, and thus G would be non-abelian. Since there are 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, G could be isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional information about the group G, we cannot definitively determine whether it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. However, we have shown that G can only be isomorphic to C120 if it has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, and that G cannot be isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2. If G does not satisfy the conditions for being isomorphic to C120, then it must be one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120."
