    "message_2": "In this problem, we have three circles: two larger circles with radius 2 and one smaller circle with radius 1. The Apollonian gasket is formed by the area enclosed by these three circles.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the larger circles. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nFor the larger circles, the radius is 2, so the area of each larger circle is:\n\nA = π(2)² = 4π\n\nSince there are two larger circles, the total area of the larger circles is:\n\n2 * 4π = 8π\n\nNow, let's find the area of the smaller circle. The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so its area is:\n\nA = π(1)² = π\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the region enclosed by the three circles. To do this, we can imagine a triangle formed by the centers of the three circles. This triangle is equilateral, with each side having a length equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles that form it (i.e., 2 + 1 = 3).\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula A = (s²√3)/4. In this case, s = 3, so the area of the triangle is:\n\nA = (3²√3)/4 = (9√3)/4\n\nNow, we can find the area of the three circular segments that make up the Apollonian gasket. Each circular segment is formed by one of the larger circles and the smaller circle. The area of a circular segment is given by the formula A = (r²/2)(θ - sinθ), where r is the radius of the circle and θ is the angle in radians subtended by the segment at the center of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the angle θ is the same for all three circular segments and is equal to 2π/3 radians (since the triangle formed by the centers of the circles is equilateral and has angles of π/3 radians). The radius of the larger circles is 2, so the area of each circular segment formed by the larger circles is:\n\nA = (2²/2)(2π/3 - sin(2π/3)) = 2(2π/3 - √3/2)\n\nThe radius of the smaller circle is 1, so the area of the circular segment formed by the smaller circle is:\n\nA = (1²/2)(2π/3 - sin(2π/3)) = (2π/3 - √3/2)\n\nNow, we can find the total area of the Apollonian gasket by subtracting the area of the three circular segments from the total area of the three circles:\n\nTotal area = (8π + π) - 3(2π/3 - √3/2) = 9π - 2π + √3 = 7π + √3\n\nSo, the total area of the Apollonian gasket formed by these circles is 7π + √3 square units."
