    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of X(f), we need to compute the following integral:\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[X(f) * e^(j2πft) df] from -∞ to ∞\n\nFirst, let's rewrite X(f) in a more convenient form:\n\nX(f) = 2(f - 1)(f + 1) / (f^2 + 4) = 2(f^2 - 1) / (f^2 + 4)\n\nNow, we can use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite X(f) as the sum of two simpler fractions:\n\nX(f) = A / (f - j2) + B / (f + j2)\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the following equations:\n\nA(f - j2) + B(f + j2) = 2(f^2 - 1)\n\nBy substituting f = j2, we get:\n\nA(j2 - j2) + B(j2 + j2) = 2(j2^2 - 1)\nB = 1/2\n\nBy substituting f = -j2, we get:\n\nA(-j2 - j2) + B(-j2 + j2) = 2(-j2^2 - 1)\nA = -1/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite X(f) as:\n\nX(f) = -1/2 * (1 / (f - j2)) + 1/2 * (1 / (f + j2))\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of X(f):\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[(-1/2 * (1 / (f - j2)) + 1/2 * (1 / (f + j2))) * e^(j2πft) df] from -∞ to ∞\n\nUsing the linearity property of the inverse Fourier transform, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * (-1/2 * ∫[(1 / (f - j2)) * e^(j2πft) df] from -∞ to ∞ + 1/2 * ∫[(1 / (f + j2)) * e^(j2πft) df] from -∞ to ∞)\n\nNow, we can recognize that the integrals are of the form of the inverse Fourier transform of the functions 1/(f - j2) and 1/(f + j2). The inverse Fourier transforms of these functions are given by:\n\nx1(t) = e^(-2π|t|)\nx2(t) = e^(2π|t|)\n\nNow, we can find x(t) by combining x1(t) and x2(t):\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * (-1/2 * x1(t) + 1/2 * x2(t))\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * (-1/2 * e^(-2π|t|) + 1/2 * e^(2π|t|))\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of X(f) is:\n\nx(t) = (1 / (2π)) * (-1/2 * e^(-2π|t|) + 1/2 * e^(2π|t|))"
