    "message_1": "A flagpole stands on level ground. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the pole is 35 degrees. The distance from the point to the base of the pole is 20 meters. How tall is the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 35 degrees, the distance from the point to the base of the pole (adjacent side) is 20 meters, and we want to find the height of the flagpole (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(35°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(35°) = height of flagpole / 20 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the flagpole:\n\nheight of flagpole = 20 meters * tan(35°)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the tangent of 35 degrees:\n\ntan(35°) ≈ 0.7002\n\nNow, multiply this value by 20 meters:\n\nheight of flagpole ≈ 20 meters * 0.7002 ≈ 14.004 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 14.004 meters."
