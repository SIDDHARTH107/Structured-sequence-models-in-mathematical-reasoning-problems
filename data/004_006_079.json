    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5, we first need to find its first and second derivatives.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), represents the slope of the tangent line to the function at any point x. Critical points occur where the first derivative is either zero or undefined. \n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0.\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first factor out a 3:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\nNow we can factor the quadratic expression:\n\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), to determine the nature of these critical points (local maximum, local minimum, or point of inflection).\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow we evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 is a local maximum. \nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5 has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 3. There are no points of inflection."
