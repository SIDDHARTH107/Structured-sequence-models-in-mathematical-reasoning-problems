    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the given function, we can use the linearity property of the Laplace transform, which states that the Laplace transform of a sum of functions is equal to the sum of the Laplace transforms of the individual functions. \n\nSo, we can find the Laplace transform of each term in the function f(t) = 3t^2 + 5sin(2t) - 7cos(3t) separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Laplace transform of 3t^2:\n\nL{3t^2} = 3 * L{t^2}\n\nUsing the formula L{t^n} = n! / s^(n+1), where n = 2:\n\nL{3t^2} = 3 * (2! / s^3) = 6 / s^3\n\n2. Laplace transform of 5sin(2t):\n\nL{5sin(2t)} = 5 * L{sin(2t)}\n\nUsing the formula L{sin(at)} = a / (s^2 + a^2), where a = 2:\n\nL{5sin(2t)} = 5 * (2 / (s^2 + 2^2)) = 10 / (s^2 + 4)\n\n3. Laplace transform of -7cos(3t):\n\nL{-7cos(3t)} = -7 * L{cos(3t)}\n\nUsing the formula L{cos(at)} = s / (s^2 + a^2), where a = 3:\n\nL{-7cos(3t)} = -7 * (s / (s^2 + 3^2)) = -7s / (s^2 + 9)\n\nNow, we can add the Laplace transforms of the individual terms together:\n\nL{f(t)} = L{3t^2} + L{5sin(2t)} + L{-7cos(3t)}\n\nL{f(t)} = (6 / s^3) + (10 / (s^2 + 4)) - (7s / (s^2 + 9))\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3t^2 + 5sin(2t) - 7cos(3t) is:\n\nF(s) = (6 / s^3) + (10 / (s^2 + 4)) - (7s / (s^2 + 9))"
