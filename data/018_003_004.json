To find the union of set A and set B, we will list all the distinct elements from both sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 4, 6}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that this union is a superset of both sets A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C. In other words, if D ⊆ C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ⊆ A ∪ B.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that B ⊆ A ∪ B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} is a superset of both sets A and B."
