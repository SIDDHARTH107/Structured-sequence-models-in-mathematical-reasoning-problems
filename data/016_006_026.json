    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using an iterated function system (IFS) with the given coordinate transformations (f1, f2, f3, and f4). The scaling factor is not a single value, but rather a set of probabilities associated with each transformation. These probabilities determine how often each transformation is applied during the generation process.\n\nFor the Barnsley fern, the probabilities are as follows:\n\n- p1 = 0.01 for f1(x, y) = (0, 0.16y)\n- p2 = 0.85 for f2(x, y) = (0.85x + 0.04y, -0.04x + 0.85y + 1.6)\n- p3 = 0.07 for f3(x, y) = (0.2x - 0.26y, 0.23x + 0.22y + 1.6)\n- p4 = 0.07 for f4(x, y) = (-0.15x + 0.28y, 0.26x + 0.24y + 0.44)\n\nThese probabilities are the scaling factors used in generating the Barnsley fern fractal."
