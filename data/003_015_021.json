    "message_1": "What is the period and amplitude of y = 2cos(3x) for x values between 0 and 2π?",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2cos(3x).\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function, which in this case is 2. So, the amplitude is 2.\n\nThe period of the function is the length of one complete cycle of the cosine function. To find the period, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of x inside the cosine function. In this case, B = 3.\n\nPeriod = 2π / |3|\nPeriod = 2π / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude is 2 and the period is (2π/3) for x values between 0 and 2π."
