    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 758203 is divided by 14 using modular arithmetic, we can use the modulo operation. The modulo operation is denoted by the percentage symbol (%) and returns the remainder after division.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n758203 % 14\n\nCalculating the remainder:\n\n758203 % 14 = 1\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 758203 is divided by 14 is 1."
