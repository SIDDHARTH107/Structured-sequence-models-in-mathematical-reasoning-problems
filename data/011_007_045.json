    "message_1": "Let's say there are 5 friends who want to go out for dinner every day for the next 7 days. They want to make sure that they never go to the same restaurant twice. How many possible restaurant schedules are there for the group of friends?",
    "message_2": "Since the group of friends wants to go out for dinner every day for the next 7 days without repeating a restaurant, we need to find the number of ways they can choose a different restaurant for each day.\n\nLet's use the counting principle to solve this problem. For the first day, they can choose from any of the available restaurants. Let's assume there are R restaurants in total. So, for the first day, they have R choices.\n\nFor the second day, they have already visited one restaurant, so they have R-1 choices left. For the third day, they have R-2 choices left, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of possible restaurant schedules for the group of friends is:\n\nR * (R-1) * (R-2) * (R-3) * (R-4) * (R-5) * (R-6)\n\nHowever, we don't know the value of R (the total number of restaurants). To find the minimum value of R, we can set up an inequality:\n\nR * (R-1) * (R-2) * (R-3) * (R-4) * (R-5) * (R-6) >= 1\n\nThis inequality states that there must be at least one possible restaurant schedule for the group of friends. To find the minimum value of R, we can start testing values:\n\nFor R = 6, the product is 0, which is not enough.\nFor R = 7, the product is 5,040, which is enough.\n\nSo, the minimum number of restaurants needed is 7. With 7 restaurants, there are 5,040 possible restaurant schedules for the group of friends."
