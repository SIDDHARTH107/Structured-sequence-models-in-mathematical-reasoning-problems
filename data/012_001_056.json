Find the shortest path between node 1 and node 6.\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/TtOmlmu.png)\n\n(Note: The weights on the edges represent the distance between the connected nodes.)",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and mark it as visited.\n\n3. Update the distances of the neighboring nodes (nodes 2, 3, and 4) by adding the distance from the current node (node 1) to the edge weight. If the new distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (node 6) is visited.\n\nHere's the algorithm applied to the given graph:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞, 6: ∞, 7: ∞}\n\n2. Visit node 1.\n   Unvisited nodes: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\n3. Update distances:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 5: ∞, 6: ∞, 7: ∞}\n\n4. Visit node 3 (smallest distance among unvisited nodes).\n   Unvisited nodes: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\n5. Update distances:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: ∞, 7: ∞}\n\n6. Visit node 2 (smallest distance among unvisited nodes).\n   Unvisited nodes: {4, 5, 6, 7}\n\n7. Update distances:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 5, 7: ∞}\n\n8. Visit node 5 (smallest distance among unvisited nodes).\n   Unvisited nodes: {4, 6, 7}\n\n9. Update distances:\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 5, 7: 6}\n\n10. Visit node 6 (smallest distance among unvisited nodes).\n    Target node visited, stop the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path between node 1 and node 6 is 5. The path is 1 → 3 → 2 → 6."
