    "message_2": "Let E_1 and E_2 be the two elliptic curves such that the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to E_1 x E_2. Since the Jacobian of a curve is an abelian variety, the dimension of J is equal to the genus g of C. In this case, the dimension of J is the sum of the dimensions of E_1 and E_2, which are both 1 (as they are elliptic curves). Therefore, g = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow, we will use the Hasse-Weil bound to relate the number of points on C to its genus. The Hasse-Weil bound states that for a smooth projective algebraic curve C defined over a finite field with q elements,\n\nq + 1 - 2g√q ≤ #C(𝔽_q) ≤ q + 1 + 2g√q,\n\nwhere #C(𝔽_q) denotes the number of 𝔽_q-rational points on C.\n\nSince the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to E_1 x E_2, we have\n\n#J(𝔽_q) = #E_1(𝔽_q) × #E_2(𝔽_q).\n\nBy the Hasse-Weil bound for elliptic curves, we have\n\n(q + 1 - 2√q)² ≤ #J(𝔽_q) ≤ (q + 1 + 2√q)².\n\nNow, by the Lefschetz fixed-point formula, we know that\n\n#C(𝔽_q) = q + 1 - (number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on C).\n\nSince the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to E_1 x E_2, the number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on C is equal to the number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on J, which is equal to the product of the number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on E_1 and E_2. Therefore, we have\n\n#C(𝔽_q) = q + 1 - #E_1(𝔽_q) × #E_2(𝔽_q) + 1 = q + 2 - #J(𝔽_q).\n\nCombining the Hasse-Weil bounds for C and J, we get\n\nq + 1 - 2g√q ≤ q + 2 - (q + 1 + 2√q)² ≤ q + 2 - (q + 1 - 2√q)².\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we obtain\n\n(4g² - 4)q ≤ 16g² - 16.\n\nSince q is a prime number, we have q ≥ 2. Dividing both sides of the inequality by 4q, we get\n\ng² - 1 ≤ 4g - 4.\n\nRearranging the inequality, we obtain\n\ng² - 4g + 3 ≤ 0.\n\nFactoring the quadratic, we get\n\n(g - 1)(g - 3) ≤ 0.\n\nSince g is a positive integer (the genus of a curve), the only possible values for g are 1, 2, and 3. However, we already know that g = 2, as the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to the product of two elliptic curves. Therefore, the genus of C is 2."
