    "message_2": "To prove that the given group G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, we need to find a bijective function φ that preserves the group operation between G and either C4 or V4.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given group G:\n\n1. The identity element is 1.\n2. Each element has an inverse: a is its own inverse (a * a = 1), b is its own inverse (b * b = 1), and c is its own inverse (c * c = 1).\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group C4 = {1, x, x^2, x^3} with the operation of multiplication modulo 4. The operation table for C4 is:\n\n    | 1 x x^2 x^3\n----|------------\n 1  | 1 x x^2 x^3\n x  | x x^2 x^3 1\n x^2| x^2 x^3 1 x\n x^3| x^3 1 x x^2\n\nNotice that in C4, the element x has order 4 (x^4 = 1). However, in the given group G, all non-identity elements have order 2 (a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1). Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C4.\n\nNow, let's consider the Klein four-group V4 = {1, y, z, w} with the operation of addition modulo 2. The operation table for V4 is:\n\n    | 1 y z w\n----|---------\n 1  | 1 y z w\n y  | y 1 w z\n z  | z w 1 y\n w  | w z y 1\n\nNotice that in V4, all non-identity elements have order 2 (y^2 = z^2 = w^2 = 1), which matches the properties of the given group G.\n\nNow, let's define a function φ: G → V4 as follows:\n\nφ(1) = 1\nφ(a) = y\nφ(b) = z\nφ(c) = w\n\nWe can verify that φ is a bijective function that preserves the group operation:\n\n1. φ(1 * 1) = φ(1) = 1 = 1 * 1 = φ(1) * φ(1)\n2. φ(a * a) = φ(1) = 1 = y * y = φ(a) * φ(a)\n3. φ(b * b) = φ(1) = 1 = z * z = φ(b) * φ(b)\n4. φ(c * c) = φ(1) = 1 = w * w = φ(c) * φ(c)\n5. φ(a * b) = φ(c) = w = y * z = φ(a) * φ(b)\n6. φ(a * c) = φ(b) = z = y * w = φ(a) * φ(c)\n7. φ(b * c) = φ(a) = y = z * w = φ(b) * φ(c)\n\nSince φ is a bijective function that preserves the group operation, the given group G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
