    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x_ij be the number of goods shipped from factory i to warehouse j. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP = 20,000 * (sum of all x_ij) - 10,000 * (sum of all x_ij) - (sum of all x_ij * transportation cost)\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1. The sum of goods shipped from each factory to all warehouses must be less than or equal to the production capacity of the factory.\n2. The sum of goods shipped to each warehouse from all factories must be equal to the demand of the warehouse.\n\nLet's simplify the profit function:\nP = 10,000 * (sum of all x_ij) - (sum of all x_ij * transportation cost)\n\nNow we can set up the linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize P = 10,000 * (sum of all x_ij) - (sum of all x_ij * transportation cost)\n\nSubject to:\n1. x_11 + x_12 + x_13 + x_14 + x_15 + x_16 + x_17 + x_18 <= 50\n2. x_21 + x_22 + x_23 + x_24 + x_25 + x_26 + x_27 + x_28 <= 100\n3. x_31 + x_32 + x_33 + x_34 + x_35 + x_36 + x_37 + x_38 <= 75\n4. x_41 + x_42 + x_43 + x_44 + x_45 + x_46 + x_47 + x_48 <= 200\n5. x_51 + x_52 + x_53 + x_54 + x_55 + x_56 + x_57 + x_58 <= 120\n6. x_61 + x_62 + x_63 + x_64 + x_65 + x_66 + x_67 + x_68 <= 70\n7. x_71 + x_72 + x_73 + x_74 + x_75 + x_76 + x_77 + x_78 <= 80\n8. x_81 + x_82 + x_83 + x_84 + x_85 + x_86 + x_87 + x_88 <= 150\n\nAnd the demand constraints:\n9. x_11 + x_21 + x_31 + x_41 + x_51 = 50\n10. x_12 + x_22 + x_32 + x_42 + x_52 = 100\n11. x_13 + x_23 + x_33 + x_43 + x_53 = 75\n12. x_14 + x_24 + x_34 + x_44 + x_54 = 200\n13. x_15 + x_25 + x_35 + x_45 + x_55 = 120\n14. x_16 + x_26 + x_36 + x_46 + x_56 = 70\n15. x_17 + x_27 + x_37 + x_47 + x_57 = 80\n16. x_18 + x_28 + x_38 + x_48 + x_58 = 150\n\nSolving this linear programming problem, we get the optimal solution:\n\nx_11 = 50, x_22 = 100, x_33 = 75, x_44 = 200, x_55 = 120, x_26 = 70, x_37 = 80, x_48 = 150, and all other x_ij = 0.\n\nThe maximum profit that the company can earn is:\n\nP = 10,000 * (50 + 100 + 75 + 200 + 120 + 70 + 80 + 150) - (50 * 100 + 100 * 250 + 75 * 400 + 200 * 550 + 120 * 700 + 70 * 250 + 80 * 400 + 150 * 950)\nP = 10,000 * 845 - (5000 + 25000 + 30000 + 110000 + 84000 + 17500 + 32000 + 142500)\nP = 8,450,000 - 462,000\nP = $7,988,000\n\nSo, the optimal amount of goods to be shipped from each factory to each warehouse is as follows:\n\nFactory 1: 50 to Warehouse 1\nFactory 2: 100 to Warehouse 2, 70 to Warehouse 6\nFactory 3: 75 to Warehouse 3, 80 to Warehouse 7\nFactory 4: 200 to Warehouse 4\nFactory 5: 120 to Warehouse 5\nFactory 6: None\nFactory 7: None\nFactory 8: 150 to Warehouse 8\n\nThe maximum profit that the company can earn is $7,988,000."
