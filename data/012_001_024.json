    "message_2": "To find the shortest path distance from node A to node D, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the graph visually.\n\n1. From node A, there are two possible paths: A -> B and A -> C. The weights of these edges are 2 and 3, respectively.\n2. From node B, there is a direct path to node D with a weight of 1. So, the total weight from A -> B -> D is 2 + 1 = 3.\n3. From node C, there is a direct path to node D with a weight of 1 as well. So, the total weight from A -> C -> D is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nComparing the two paths, A -> B -> D has a shorter total weight of 3, while A -> C -> D has a total weight of 4. Therefore, the shortest path distance from node A to node D is 3."
