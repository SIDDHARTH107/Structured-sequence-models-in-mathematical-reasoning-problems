    "message_1": "If an initial angle of 1 degree and an initial angular velocity of 0 is given to a double pendulum with lengths of 1 meter and 0.5 meter respectively, and the gravitational acceleration is 9.81 m/s², what is the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum after one minute of chaotic motion?",
    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum is highly complex and chaotic, which means that it is very sensitive to initial conditions and cannot be predicted easily using a simple formula. To find the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum after one minute of chaotic motion, we need to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum numerically.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum are given by:\n\nθ₁''(t) = (−g(2m₁+m₂)sin(θ₁)−m₂g*sin(θ₁−2θ₂)−2*sin(θ₁−θ₂)*m₂(θ₂'^2*L₂+θ₁'^2*L₁*cos(θ₁−θ₂)))/(L₁*(2m₁+m₂−m₂*cos(2θ₁−2θ₂)))\n\nθ₂''(t) = (2*sin(θ₁−θ₂)*(θ₁'^2*L₁*(m₁+m₂)+g*(m₁+m₂)*cos(θ₁)+θ₂'^2*L₂*m₂*cos(θ₁−θ₂)))/(L₂*(2m₁+m₂−m₂*cos(2θ₁−2θ₂)))\n\nHere, θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles of the first and second pendulums, L₁ and L₂ are the lengths of the pendulums, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the pendulums (which are not given in the problem, but their ratio would be important), g is the gravitational acceleration, and t is time.\n\nTo solve these equations numerically, you can use a numerical integration method like the Runge-Kutta method or any other suitable method. You would need to convert the initial angle from degrees to radians, set the initial angular velocities to 0, and integrate the equations for one minute (60 seconds).\n\nAfter obtaining the numerical solution, you can find the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum by analyzing the θ₂(t) data.\n\nPlease note that without the masses of the pendulums, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer to this problem. However, the approach described above would allow you to find the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum for any given set of initial conditions and parameters."
