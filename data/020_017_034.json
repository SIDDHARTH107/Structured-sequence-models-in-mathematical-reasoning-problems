    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of producing cylindrical metal containers with a volume of 50 cubic centimeters. The containers must have a flat top and bottom and are to be made from a material that costs $0.03 per square centimeter for the sides and $0.05 per square centimeter for the top and bottom. Determine the minimum cost of the materials required for each container.",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the base of the cylinder and h be its height. The volume V of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe are given that the volume is 50 cubic centimeters, so:\n\n50 = πr^2h\n\nNow we need to find the surface area of the cylinder, which consists of the lateral surface area (the sides) and the areas of the top and bottom. The lateral surface area is given by the formula:\n\nA_lateral = 2πrh\n\nThe area of the top and bottom is given by the formula:\n\nA_top_bottom = 2πr^2\n\nNow we can find the cost of the materials for the sides, top, and bottom:\n\nCost = 0.03A_lateral + 0.05A_top_bottom\nCost = 0.03(2πrh) + 0.05(2πr^2)\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we need to express h in terms of r using the volume formula:\n\nh = 50 / (πr^2)\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nCost = 0.03(2πr(50 / (πr^2))) + 0.05(2πr^2)\nCost = (3πr(50 / r^2)) + 0.1πr^2\n\nNow we need to find the critical points of this function by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Cost)/dr = (150π / r^2) - 0.2πr\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n(150π / r^2) - 0.2πr = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by r^2:\n\n150π - 0.2πr^3 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by π:\n\n150 - 0.2r^3 = 0\n\nSolving for r^3:\n\nr^3 = 150 / 0.2 = 750\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = (750)^(1/3) ≈ 9.08 cm\n\nNow we can find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 50 / (π(9.08)^2) ≈ 0.193 cm\n\nNow we can find the minimum cost using the cost function:\n\nCost = 0.03(2π(9.08)(0.193)) + 0.05(2π(9.08)^2)\nCost ≈ 3.30 + 25.89\nCost ≈ $29.19\n\nSo the minimum cost of the materials required for each container is approximately $29.19."
