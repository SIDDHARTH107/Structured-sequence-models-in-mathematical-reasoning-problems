    "message_2": "First, let's find the total weight of the 10 fruits with the incorrect measurement:\n\nMean weight = Total weight / Number of fruits\n75 grams = Total weight / 10\nTotal weight = 75 grams * 10 = 750 grams\n\nNow, let's correct the incorrect measurement:\n\nIncorrect measurement: 95 grams\nCorrect measurement: 45 grams\nDifference: 95 grams - 45 grams = 50 grams\n\nSubtract the difference from the total weight to get the correct total weight:\n\nCorrect total weight = 750 grams - 50 grams = 700 grams\n\nNow, find the correct mean weight:\n\nCorrect mean weight = Correct total weight / Number of fruits\nCorrect mean weight = 700 grams / 10 = 70 grams\n\nThe correct mean weight of the fruits is 70 grams."
