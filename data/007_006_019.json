    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 204 and 36 using the Euclidean algorithm, we'll perform a series of divisions with remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Then, the GCD will be the last non-zero remainder.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide 204 by 36:\n204 รท 36 = 5 with a remainder of 24\n\nStep 2:\nNow, divide the previous divisor (36) by the remainder from the previous step (24):\n36 รท 24 = 1 with a remainder of 12\n\nStep 3:\nDivide the previous remainder (24) by the new remainder (12):\n24 รท 12 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. Therefore, the GCD of 204 and 36 is 12."
