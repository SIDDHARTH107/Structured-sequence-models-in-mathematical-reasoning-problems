    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, and it has a shape similar to a cardioid (a heart-shaped curve). The area of the main cardioid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (π/4) * (2/3)^2\n\nArea ≈ 0.392699081698724\n\nSo, the area of the largest connected region (the main cardioid) on the Mandelbrot set defined by |c| < 0.25 is approximately 0.3927."
