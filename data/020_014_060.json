    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The production process of each product requires two types of raw materials, A and B. The cost per unit of raw material A is $4 and the cost per unit of raw material B is $6. The production process of Product X requires 2 units of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B. The production process of Product Y requires 4 units of raw material A and 1 unit of raw material B. The company has 10,000 units of raw material A and 15,000 units of raw material B. \n\nIf the selling price of Product X is $20 and that of Product Y is $30, determine the optimal production quantities of Products X and Y that maximizes the company's revenue, given that the production quantities must be integers.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product X and y be the number of units of Product Y.\n\nThe constraints for the raw materials are:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 10,000 (raw material A)\n3x + y ≤ 15,000 (raw material B)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the revenue is:\n\nRevenue = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints for x and y:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 10,000\nx + 2y ≤ 5,000\ny ≤ (5,000 - x)/2\n\n3x + y ≤ 15,000\ny ≤ 15,000 - 3x\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (5,000 - x)/2 and y = 15,000 - 3x:\n\n(5,000 - x)/2 = 15,000 - 3x\n5,000 - x = 30,000 - 6x\n5x = 25,000\nx = 5,000\n\ny = (5,000 - 5,000)/2 = 0\n\nVertex 1: (5,000, 0)\n\n2.

Intersection of y = 15,000 - 3x and x = 0:\n\ny = 15,000 - 3(0) = 15,000\n\nVertex 3: (0, 15,000)\n\nHowever, this vertex is not in the feasible region since it doesn't satisfy the constraint y ≤ (5,000 - x)/2. So, we will only consider the first two vertices.\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at these vertices:\n\nVertex 1: Revenue = 20(5,000) + 30(0) = 100,000\nVertex 2: Revenue = 20(0) + 30(2,500) = 75,000\n\nThe maximum revenue is achieved at Vertex 1, with a revenue of $100,000. Therefore, the optimal production quantities are 5,000 units of Product X and 0 units of Product Y."
