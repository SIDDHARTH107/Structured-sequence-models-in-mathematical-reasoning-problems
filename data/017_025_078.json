    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will analyze its properties and compare them to the properties of the given groups.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C120. A group is cyclic if and only if it has a single generator. The order of G is 120, which has prime factorization 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C120\n2. C2 × C60\n3. C3 × C40\n4. C4 × C30\n5. C5 × C24\n6. C6 × C20\n7. C8 × C15\n8. C10 × C12\n9. C2 × C2 × C30\n10. C2 × C3 × C20\n11. C2 × C4 × C15\n12. C2 × C5 × C12\n13. C2 × C6 × C10\n14. C3 × C4 × C10\n15. C3 × C5 × C8\n16. C2 × C2 × C2 × C15\n17. C2 × C2 × C3 × C10\n18. C2 × C2 × C5 × C6\n19. C2 × C3 × C4 × C5\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C120, then it is a cyclic group. To check this, we can use the fact that a group of order n is cyclic if and only if there is no integer k > 1 that divides n and satisfies φ(k) = n/k, where φ is the Euler's totient function. For n = 120, we have the following divisors:\n\nk = 2, φ(2) = 1\nk = 3, φ(3) = 2\nk = 4, φ(4) = 2\nk = 5, φ(5) = 4\nk = 6, φ(6) = 2\nk = 8, φ(8) = 4\nk = 10, φ(10) = 4\nk = 12, φ(12) = 4\nk = 15, φ(15) = 8\nk = 20, φ(20) = 8\nk = 24, φ(24) = 8\nk = 30, φ(30) = 8\nk = 40, φ(40) = 16\nk = 60, φ(60) = 16\nk = 120, φ(120) = 32\n\nThere is no k > 1 that satisfies φ(k) = 120/k, so G could be isomorphic to C120.\n\nNext, let's consider the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2. The group A5 is simple and non-abelian, and has order 60. The direct product A5 × C2 × C2 has order 60 * 2 * 2 = 120. Since A5 is non-abelian, the direct product is also non-abelian. If G is isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2, then G must be non-abelian. We don't have enough information to determine whether G is abelian or non-abelian, so we cannot rule out the possibility that G is isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nFinally, let's consider the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. If G is isomorphic to one of these groups, then G must be non-abelian. Again, we don't have enough information to determine whether G is abelian or non-abelian, so we cannot rule out the possibility that G is isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the properties of G, we cannot determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or any of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120."
