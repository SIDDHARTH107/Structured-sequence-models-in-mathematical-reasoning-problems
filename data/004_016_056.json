    "message_1": "A car drives along a straight road with a velocity of 10 m/s. After 10 seconds, the velocity of the car increases to 30 m/s. Use the Mean Value Theorem to determine the acceleration of the car during this time interval.",
    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we are given the initial velocity (10 m/s) and the final velocity (30 m/s) of the car, as well as the time interval (10 seconds). We can represent the velocity function as v(t), where t is the time in seconds.\n\nThe average rate of change of the velocity function over the interval [0, 10] is:\n\n(30 m/s - 10 m/s) / (10 s - 0 s) = 20 m/s / 10 s = 2 m/s²\n\nNow, we need to find a point c in the interval (0, 10) such that the derivative of the velocity function at c is equal to the average rate of change. The derivative of the velocity function, v'(t), represents the acceleration of the car.\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 10) such that:\n\nv'(c) = 2 m/s²\n\nSince the car's acceleration is constant throughout the interval, we can conclude that the acceleration of the car during this time interval is 2 m/s²."
