    "message_1": "A company produces three products: chairs, tables, and shelves. The production process takes 2 hours for chairs, 3 hours for tables, and 5 hours for shelves. The company has 100 hours available for production. The profit per unit of chair is $20, per unit of table is $30, and per unit of shelf is $50. The company wants to maximize its profit.\n\nAssuming the company can only produce whole units of each product, what is the optimal combination of products that the company should produce to maximize its profit?",
