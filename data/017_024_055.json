    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by the product of the partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. The partitions of 5 (the exponent of 2) are (5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1), and (2, 1, 1, 1). The partitions of 1 (the exponent of 3) are (1). So, we have 6 * 1 = 6 possible groups of order 96.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 96. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we can find the number of abelian groups by finding the number of ways to partition the exponents of the prime factorization. For 2^5, we have the partitions (5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2, 1), and (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). For 3^1, we have the partition (1). So, we have 5 * 1 = 5 abelian groups of order 96.\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96 by subtracting the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups: 6 - 5 = 1. So, there is only 1 non-abelian group of order 96.\n\nNow, let's determine if this non-abelian group is isomorphic to the direct product of A4, C4, and C2. The order of A4 is 12, the order of C4 is 4, and the order of C2 is 2. The direct product of these groups would have order 12 * 4 * 2 = 96. Since there is only 1 non-abelian group of order 96, it must be isomorphic to the direct product of A4, C4, and C2."
