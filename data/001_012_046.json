    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n3x^3 - 9x^2 = 3x^2(x - 3)\n\nDenominator:\n6x^2 - 18x = 6x(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n(3x^2(x - 3)) / (6x(x - 3))\n\nSince (x - 3) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(3x^2) / (6x)\n\nNow, we can simplify further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3x:\n\n(3x^2) / (6x) = (3x^2 / 3x) / (6x / 3x) = x / 2\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\nx / 2"
