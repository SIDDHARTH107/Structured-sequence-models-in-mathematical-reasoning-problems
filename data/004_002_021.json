    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (4x^2 - 16x + 11)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator.\n\n4x^2 - 16x + 11 can be factored as (2x - 1)(2x - 11). So, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = ((2x - 1)(2x - 11))/(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can use the limit properties to find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x→1) f(x) = lim (x→1) ((2x - 1)(2x - 11))/(x - 1)\n\nSince the denominator approaches zero as x approaches 1, we need to find a way to cancel out the (x - 1) term in the denominator. However, there is no common factor between the numerator and the denominator that would allow us to cancel out the (x - 1) term.\n\nIn this case, we can use L'Hôpital's rule, which states that if the limit of the ratio of the derivatives of the numerator and denominator exists, then the limit of the original function exists and is equal to that limit.\n\nSo, let's find the derivatives of the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: d/dx (4x^2 - 16x + 11) = 8x - 16\nDenominator: d/dx (x - 1) = 1\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule:\n\nlim (x→1) f(x) = lim (x→1) (8x - 16)/1\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 1 into the simplified expression:\n\nlim (x→1) (8x - 16) = 8(1) - 16 = -8\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (4x^2 - 16x + 11)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1 is -8."
