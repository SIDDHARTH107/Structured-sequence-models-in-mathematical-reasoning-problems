    "message_2": "To determine if G1 and G2 are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of G1 and G2 such that the adjacency of vertices is preserved.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree sequence of both graphs. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\nFor G1, it has 6 vertices and 7 edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (by the Handshaking Lemma). So, the sum of the degrees in G1 is 2 * 7 = 14. Since there are 6 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in G1 is 14 / 6 â‰ˆ 2.33. This means that at least one vertex in G1 must have a degree of 3 or more.\n\nFor G2, it has 6 vertices and 6 edges. The sum of the degrees in G2 is 2 * 6 = 12. The average degree of a vertex in G2 is 12 / 6 = 2. This means that all vertices in G2 have a degree of 2.\n\nSince there is at least one vertex in G1 with a degree of 3 or more, and all vertices in G2 have a degree of 2, there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of G1 and G2 that preserves adjacency. Therefore, the graphs G1 and G2 are not isomorphic."
