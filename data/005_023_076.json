The scores received by a group of 20 students are:\n\n60, 70, 75, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100, 100\n\nUsing the rule of thumb method for outlier detection, determine if any scores are outliers.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers using the rule of thumb method, we first need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) and then use it to find the lower and upper bounds for the scores.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the quartiles.\nQ1 (first quartile) is the median of the lower half of the data. In this case, the lower half is 60, 70, 75, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92. The median is the average of 82 and 84, so Q1 = 83.\nQ3 (third quartile) is the median of the upper half of the data. In this case, the upper half is 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100, 100. The median is the average of 96 and 97, so Q3 = 96.5.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the interquartile range (IQR).\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 96.5 - 83 = 13.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the lower and upper bounds.\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 83 - 1.5 * 13.5 = 63.25\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 96.5 + 1.5 * 13.5 = 116.25\n\nStep 4: Check for outliers.\nNow we check if any scores are below the lower bound or above the upper bound. In this case, all scores are between 63.25 and 116.25, so there are no outliers."
