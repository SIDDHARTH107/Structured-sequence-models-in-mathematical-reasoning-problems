    "message_2": "To prove that the statement \"All swans are white\" is necessarily true using modal logic, we will use the given modal formula □(x)(Sx → Wx). This formula states that for any x, if x is a swan, then x is necessarily white.\n\nTo prove this, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Assume that there exists a swan x (Sx).\n2. According to the given modal formula, if x is a swan, then x is necessarily white (Sx → Wx).\n3. From steps 1 and 2, we can deduce that x is necessarily white (Wx).\n4. Since x was an arbitrary swan, this holds true for all swans.\n5. Therefore, all swans are necessarily white.\n\nIn conclusion, using the modal formula □(x)(Sx → Wx), we have proven that the statement \"All swans are white\" is necessarily true."
