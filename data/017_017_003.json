    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C30, D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G:\n\n1. For the 2-Sylow subgroup, we have p = 2 and n = 15. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3.\n\n2. For the 3-Sylow subgroup, we have p = 3 and n = 10. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 10 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 10.\n\n3. For the 5-Sylow subgroup, we have p = 5 and n = 6. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 6 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C30, then G is a cyclic group of order 30. In this case, there is only one Sylow subgroup for each prime divisor of 30, i.e., n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. This is consistent with our findings above.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to D15, then G is a dihedral group of order 30 (2 * 15). In this case, there are two 2-Sylow subgroups (corresponding to the reflections), i.e., n_2 = 2. However, this contradicts our finding that n_2 can only be 1 or 3. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to D15.\n\n3. If G is a non-abelian group of order 30, then it cannot be cyclic. Suppose n_2 = 3, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 1. In this case, there are 3 * 2 = 6 elements of order 2, 10 * 2 = 20 elements of order 3, and 1 * 4 = 4 elements of order 5. This accounts for all 30 elements in G. Therefore, G can be a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30 or the non-abelian group of order 30, but not the dihedral group D15."
