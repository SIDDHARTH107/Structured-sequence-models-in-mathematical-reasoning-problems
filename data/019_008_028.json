The responses were then represented using fuzzy sets as follows:\t\n- Very satisfied (VS) = $[(6,0), (10,1)]$\n- Satisfied (S) = $[(4,0), (8,1), (10,0)]$\n- Not satisfied (NS) = $[(0,1), (4,0)]$\n\nIf a customer rates the restaurant a 7, what is the membership grade of this rating for each of the fuzzy sets used above?",
    "message_2": "To find the membership grade for each fuzzy set, we need to determine the degree of membership for the given rating (7) in each set. We can do this by finding the equation of the line segment that contains the rating and then plugging in the rating to find the membership grade.\n\n1. Very Satisfied (VS) fuzzy set:\nThe line segment containing the rating 7 is between points (6,0) and (10,1). We can find the equation of this line segment using the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).\n\nFirst, find the slope (m):\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (1 - 0) / (10 - 6) = 1 / 4\n\nNow, find the y-intercept (b) using one of the points, for example, (6,0):\n0 = (1/4) * 6 + b\nb = -3/2\n\nSo, the equation of the line segment is y = (1/4)x - 3/2. Now, plug in the rating (x = 7) to find the membership grade:\ny = (1/4) * 7 - 3/2 = 7/4 - 3/2 = 1/2\n\nMembership grade for Very Satisfied (VS) = 0.5\n\n2. Satisfied (S) fuzzy set:\nThe line segment containing the rating 7 is between points (8,1) and (10,0). Find the equation of this line segment:\n\nFirst, find the slope (m):\nm = (0 - 1) / (10 - 8) = -1 / 2\n\nNow, find the y-intercept (b) using one of the points, for example, (8,1):\n1 = (-1/2) * 8 + b\nb = 5\n\nSo, the equation of the line segment is y = (-1/2)x + 5. Now, plug in the rating (x = 7) to find the membership grade:\ny = (-1/2) * 7 + 5 = -7/2 + 10/2 = 3/2\n\nMembership grade for Satisfied (S) = 1.5\n\nHowever, since the membership grade cannot be greater than 1, we need to adjust it to the maximum value of 1.\n\nMembership grade for Satisfied (S) = 1\n\n3. Not Satisfied (NS) fuzzy set:\nSince the rating 7 is not within the range of the Not Satisfied fuzzy set (0 to 4), the membership grade for this set is 0.\n\nMembership grade for Not Satisfied (NS) = 0\n\nIn summary, the membership grades for the given rating of 7 are:\n- Very Satisfied (VS): 0.5\n- Satisfied (S): 1\n- Not Satisfied (NS): 0"
