    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine the period of the function. Since the function has a discontinuity at x = 2π and repeats itself after that, the period is T = 4π.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ[a_n * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, a₀, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients:\n\n1. a₀:\na₀ = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\na₀ = (1/(4π)) * [∫[0 * 1]dx from 0 to 2π + ∫[1 * 1]dx from 2π to 4π]\n\na₀ = (1/(4π)) * [0 + (x) from 2π to 4π] = (1/(4π)) * (4π - 2π) = 1/2\n\n2. a_n:\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx)]dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [∫[0 * cos(nωx)]dx from 0 to 2π + ∫[1 * cos(nωx)]dx from 2π to 4π]\n\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [0 + ∫[cos(nωx)]dx from 2π to 4π]\n\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [(1/nω) * sin(nωx) from 2π to 4π]\n\na_n = (1/(2π)) * [(1/nω) * (sin(2nπ) - sin(nπ))]\n\nSince sin(2nπ) = 0 and sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\n3. b_n:\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx)]dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [∫[0 * sin(nωx)]dx from 0 to 2π + ∫[1 * sin(nωx)]dx from 2π to 4π]\n\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [0 + ∫[sin(nωx)]dx from 2π to 4π]\n\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [(-1/nω) * cos(nωx) from 2π to 4π]\n\nb_n = (1/(2π)) * [(-1/nω) * (cos(2nπ) - cos(nπ))]\n\nFor even values of n, cos(2nπ) = 1 and cos(nπ) = 1, so b_n = 0.\nFor odd values of n, cos(2nπ) = 1 and cos(nπ) = -1, so b_n = (2/nω).\n\nTherefore, b_n = 0 for even n and b_n = (2/nω) for odd n.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ[(0) * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ[b_n * sin(nωx)], where b_n = 0 for even n and b_n = (2/nω) for odd n, and ω = 2π/T = π/2."
