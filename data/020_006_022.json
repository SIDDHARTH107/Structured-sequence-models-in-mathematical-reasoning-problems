    "message_1": "A company produces two types of mobile phones: basic and smart. The basic phones require 2 hours of assembly time and generate a profit of $30 each. The smart phones require 3 hours of assembly time and generate a profit of $50 each. The factory has 180 hours of assembly time per week available. Write a mixed-integer programming problem to determine the number of basic and smart phones to manufacture each week to maximize the profit for the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of basic phones and y be the number of smart phones produced each week.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nMaximize P = 30x + 50y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Assembly time constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 180\n2. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n3. Integer constraint: x and y must be integers\n\nThe mixed-integer programming problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize P = 30x + 50y\n\nSubject to:\n2x + 3y ≤ 180\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx, y ∈ Z (x and y are integers)"
