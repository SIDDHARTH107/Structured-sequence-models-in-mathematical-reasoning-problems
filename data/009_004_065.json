    "message_2": "1. Equation of motion of the oscillation:\n\nThe equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle. Since the mass is initially set into motion, we can assume φ = 0. \n\n2. Frequency of the oscillation:\n\nThe problem states that the mass completes 10 cycles in 20 seconds. Therefore, the frequency (f) is:\n\nf = (number of cycles) / (time)\nf = 10 cycles / 20 seconds\nf = 0.5 Hz\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) is related to the frequency by:\n\nω = 2πf\nω = 2π(0.5 Hz)\nω = π rad/s\n\n3. Maximum speed of the mass during its motion:\n\nThe maximum speed (v_max) of the mass occurs when the spring is at its equilibrium position (x = 0) and is given by:\n\nv_max = Aω\n\nwhere A is the amplitude (0.04 m) and ω is the angular frequency (π rad/s).\n\nv_max = (0.04 m)(π rad/s)\nv_max = 0.04π m/s ≈ 0.1257 m/s\n\n4. Maximum acceleration of the mass during its motion:\n\nThe maximum acceleration (a_max) of the mass occurs when the spring is at its maximum displacement (x = A) and is given by:\n\na_max = -ω^2 * A\n\na_max = -(π rad/s)^2 * (0.04 m)\na_max = -π^2 * 0.04 m/s² ≈ -0.3948 m/s²\n\n5. Total energy of the system:\n\nThe total energy (E) of the system is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, which is constant for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n\nE = (1/2)kA^2\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (50 N/m) and A is the amplitude (0.04 m).\n\nE = (1/2)(50 N/m)(0.04 m)^2\nE = 0.5 * 50 * 0.0016 J\nE = 0.04 J\n\nSo, the equation of motion is x(t) = 0.04 * cos(πt), the frequency is 0.5 Hz, the maximum speed is approximately 0.1257 m/s, the maximum acceleration is approximately -0.3948 m/s², and the total energy of the system is 0.04 J."
