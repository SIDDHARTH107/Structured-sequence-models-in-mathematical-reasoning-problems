    "message_1": "A student wants to compare the ages of two groups of individuals. One group consists of 12 people and the other group has 15 people. The ages of the first group are 22, 28, 25, 31, 24, 27, 29, 23, 26, 30, 31 and 33. The ages of the second group are 28, 30, 27, 26, 29, 31, 35, 34, 33, 24, 26, 31, 30, 28 and 25. \n\nThe student needs to determine if there is a significant difference in the ages of the two groups using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. Calculations are required to reach a conclusion at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the two groups and sort them in ascending order.\n2. Assign ranks to each value. If there are ties, assign the average rank.\n3. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n4. Calculate the test statistic W and compare it to the critical value.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Combined and sorted data: \n22, 23, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 26, 27, 27, 28, 28, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 30, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 33, 33, 34, 35\n\n2. Assign ranks:\n(1) 22, (2) 23, (3.5) 24, (3.5) 24, (5.5) 25, (5.5) 25, (8) 26, (8) 26, (8) 26, (11) 27, (11) 27, (14) 28, (14) 28, (14) 28, (14) 28, (18.5) 29, (18.5) 29, (21) 30, (21) 30, (21) 30, (24.5) 31, (24.5) 31, (24.5) 31, (24.5) 31, (24.5) 31, (29.5) 33, (29.5) 33, (31) 34, (32) 35\n\n3. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group:\nGroup 1: 1 + 2 + 3.5 + 5.5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 18.5 + 21 + 24.5 + 24.5 + 29.5 = 183.5\nGroup 2: 3.5 + 5.5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 + 18.5 + 21 + 21 + 24.5 + 24.5 + 29.5 + 31 = 244.5\n\n4. Calculate the test statistic W:\nW = min(W1, W2) = min(183.5, 244.5) = 183.5\n\nNow, we need to compare W to the critical value. Since we have 12 observations in group 1 and 15 observations in group 2, we can use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test table to find the critical value for a 5% level of significance. The critical value for n1=12 and n2=15 at a 5% level of significance is 176.\n\nSince W (183.5) is greater than the critical value (176), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in the ages of the two groups at a 5% level of significance."
