    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a week)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the total number of trials (days in a week)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 7 (days in a week)\n- k = 3 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.35 (probability of rain on any given day)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(7, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 rainy days out of 7 days. The formula for C(n, k) is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\nSo, C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(7, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(7-3)\nP(X = 3) = 35 * (0.35)^3 * (1-0.35)^(7-3)\nP(X = 3) = 35 * (0.35)^3 * (0.65)^4\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 35 * 0.04287 * 0.17850\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.2698\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain exactly 3 days out of a 7-day week is approximately 0.2698 or 26.98%."
