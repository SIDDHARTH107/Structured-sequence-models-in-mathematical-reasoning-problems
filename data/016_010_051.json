    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the spaces between tangent circles with smaller circles. The order of an Apollonian gasket refers to the number of iterations performed to generate it. In this case, we are asked to find the total number of circles required to construct an Apollonian gasket of order six.\n\nFor each iteration, the number of circles added is a power of 3. Specifically, for the nth iteration, 3^(n-1) circles are added. To find the total number of circles for an Apollonian gasket of order six, we need to sum the number of circles added in each iteration, including the initial circle.\n\nTotal circles = 1 (initial circle) + 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5\n\nTotal circles = 1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243\n\nTotal circles = 365\n\nSo, the total number of circles required to construct an Apollonian gasket of order six is 365."
