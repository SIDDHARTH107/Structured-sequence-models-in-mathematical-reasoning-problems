    "message_2": "To prove that there exist exactly nine non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will first find the possible structures of these groups using the Sylow theorems and then construct each group. Finally, we will show that none of them are isomorphic.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. Since 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2(G) = 1 or 3, and n_3(G) = 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will construct the groups based on these possibilities:\n\n1. G is abelian:\n   a. G is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups: G = C_4 x C_9 (C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n).\n   b. G = C_2 x C_2 x C_9.\n   c. G = C_36.\n\n2. G is non-abelian:\n   a. G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup N of order 9 and a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 4. Then G = N x P, where N is either C_9 or C_3 x C_3, and P is either C_4 or C_2 x C_2. This gives us four possibilities:\n      i. G = C_9 x C_4 (semi-direct product).\n      ii. G = C_9 x (C_2 x C_2).\n      iii. G = (C_3 x C_3) x C_4.\n      iv. G = (C_3 x C_3) x (C_2 x C_2).\n\n   b. G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup N of order 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 9. Then G = N x P, where N is either C_4 or C_2 x C_2, and P is either C_9 or C_3 x C_3. This gives us four possibilities:\n      i. G = C_4 x C_9 (semi-direct product).\n      ii. G = (C_2 x C_2) x C_9.\n      iii. G = C_4 x (C_3 x C_3).\n      iv. G = (C_2 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3).\n\nHowever, the groups in 2a and 2b are isomorphic, so we have only five non-isomorphic non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, we have constructed 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 36. To show that there are no other non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems to show that any group of order 36 must have a Sylow subgroup structure that matches one of the nine groups we constructed. Since we have exhausted all possibilities, there can be no other non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
