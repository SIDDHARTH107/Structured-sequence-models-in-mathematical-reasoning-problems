    "message_2": "To find the Hilbert series of the algebra A/I, we first need to find a generating function for the number of monomials in A/I of each degree. Let's denote the Hilbert series of A/I as H(t) = 1 + h_1t + h_2t^2 + h_3t^3 + ..., where h_i is the number of monomials of degree i in A/I.\n\nWe know that the Hilbert series of the polynomial ring A in variables x, y, and z is given by H_A(t) = 1/(1-t^3), since there are three variables and each variable contributes a factor of 1/(1-t) to the Hilbert series.\n\nNow, let's consider the ideal I generated by the polynomials xz - y and yz - x^2. We can rewrite these polynomials as y = xz and x^2 = yz. Using these relations, we can express any monomial in A/I in terms of x and z only. This means that A/I is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in two variables, say, x and z.\n\nLet's denote the Hilbert series of this polynomial ring as H_B(t). Since there are two variables, the Hilbert series of this polynomial ring is given by H_B(t) = 1/(1-t^2).\n\nNow, we can find the Hilbert series of A/I by dividing the Hilbert series of A by the Hilbert series of B:\n\nH(t) = H_A(t) / H_B(t) = (1/(1-t^3)) / (1/(1-t^2)) = (1-t^2)/(1-t^3).\n\nThus, the Hilbert series of the algebra A/I is H(t) = (1-t^2)/(1-t^3)."
