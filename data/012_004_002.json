    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the next edge with the lowest weight to the tree, making sure it doesn't form a cycle.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are (number of vertices - 1) edges in the tree.\n\nSorted edges by weight:\n(3,7,1), (1,4,2), (2,5,2), (4,5,2), (7,6,1), (6,8,3), (1,3,3), (4,3,3), (5,6,3), (1,2,4), (2,6,5), (7,8,5), (2,3,7), (5,8,7), (3,6,6)\n\nNow, let's build the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge (3,7,1) to the tree. Current tree: {(3,7,1)}. Total weight: 1.\n2. Add edge (1,4,2) to the tree. Current tree: {(3,7,1), (1,4,2)}. Total weight: 3.\n3. Add edge (2,5,2) to the tree. Current tree: {(3,7,1), (1,4,2), (2,5,2)}. Total weight: 5.\n4. Add edge (4,5,2) to the tree. Current tree: {(3,7,1), (1,4,2), (2,5,2), (4,5,2)}. Total weight: 7.\n5. Add edge (7,6,1) to the tree. Current tree: {(3,7,1), (1,4,2), (2,5,2), (4,5,2), (7,6,1)}. Total weight: 8.\n6. Add edge (6,8,3) to the tree. Current tree: {(3,7,1), (1,4,2), (2,5,2), (4,5,2), (7,6,1), (6,8,3)}. Total weight: 11.\n\nNow we have a tree with 7 edges (number of vertices - 1), so we stop here.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is {(3,7,1), (1,4,2), (2,5,2), (4,5,2), (7,6,1), (6,8,3)} with a total weight of 11."
