    "message_1": "A stock price S follows a geometric Brownian motion with a constant volatility of 30% per annum, and the risk-free rate is 5% per annum. An investor wants to buy a call option with a strike price of $100 that expires in one year. Use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to calculate the current price of the call option if the current stock price is $90.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the current price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we need to find the values of d1 and d2, and then plug them into the formula. The Black-Scholes-Merton formula for the call option price is:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = call option price\nS = current stock price\nX = strike price\nr = risk-free rate\nT = time to expiration (in years)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nln(x) = natural logarithm of x\nσ = volatility (annualized)\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nS = $90\nX = $100\nr = 5% per annum = 0.05\nσ = 30% per annum = 0.30\nT = 1 year\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(90/100) + (0.05 + (0.30^2)/2) * 1) / (0.30 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (ln(0.9) + (0.05 + 0.045) * 1) / 0.30\nd1 = (-0.10536 + 0.095) / 0.30\nd1 = -0.03453\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.03453 - 0.30 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.33453\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). These values can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in cumulative distribution function. For this problem, we have:\n\nN(d1) = N(-0.03453) = 0.4864\nN(d2) = N(-0.33453) = 0.3691\n\nFinally, we can plug these values into the Black-Scholes-Merton formula:\n\nC = 90 * 0.4864 - 100 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * 0.3691\nC = 43.776 - 100 * 0.9512 * 0.3691\nC = 43.776 - 35.259\nC = 8.517\n\nThe current price of the call option is approximately $8.52."
