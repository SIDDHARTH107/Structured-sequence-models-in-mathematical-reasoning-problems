    "message_2": "To find the x-coordinate of the first three peaks of the chaotic attractor in the Rössler system, we need to numerically solve the system of differential equations with the given parameter values and initial conditions. The Rössler system is defined by the following set of equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nwhere a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7. The initial conditions are x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, and z(0) = 0.\n\nWe can use numerical methods like the Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations. However, this requires programming and is beyond the scope of this platform. You can use software like MATLAB or Python to implement the numerical method and find the x-coordinate of the first three peaks.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet using the SciPy library to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef rossler_system(t, xyz, a, b, c):\n    x, y, z = xyz\n    return [-y - z, x + a * y, b + z * (x - c)]\n\na = 0.2\nb = 0.2\nc = 5.7\ninitial_conditions = [0, 0, 0]\nt_span = (0, 100)\nt_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 10000)\n\nsol = solve_ivp(rossler_system, t_span, initial_conditions, args=(a, b, c), t_eval=t_eval)\n\n# Find the first three peaks\npeaks_x = []\nfor i in range(1, len(sol.t) - 1):\n    if sol.y[2, i] > sol.y[2, i - 1] and sol.y[2, i] > sol.y[2, i + 1]:\n        peaks_x.append(sol.y[0, i])\n        if len(peaks_x) == 3:\n            break\n\nprint(\"The x-coordinates of the first three peaks are:\", peaks_x)\n```\n\nThis code will output the x-coordinates of the first three peaks in the chaotic attractor of the Rössler system with the given parameters and initial conditions. Note that the results may vary slightly depending on the numerical method and step size used."
