    "message_1": "A factory produces electronic bulbs with a mean life of 800 hours and a standard deviation of 60 hours. A sample of 100 bulbs is selected. Find the 95% confidence interval for the mean life of the bulbs in the sample.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the mean life of the bulbs in the sample, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\nx̄ = 800 hours (mean life of the bulbs)\nσ = 60 hours (standard deviation)\nn = 100 (sample size)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard Z-score table).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence interval = 800 ± (1.96 * (60 / √100))\n\nConfidence interval = 800 ± (1.96 * (60 / 10))\n\nConfidence interval = 800 ± (1.96 * 6)\n\nConfidence interval = 800 ± 11.76\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean life of the bulbs in the sample is (788.24, 811.76) hours."
