    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx + 2y = 5\n3x + 6y = 15 â†’ x + 2y = 5\n\nNow, we can see that both equations are the same:\n\nx + 2y = 5\nx + 2y = 5\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system of linear equations. To express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (5 - x) / 2\n\nThe solutions to the system of linear equations are all points (x, y) where y = (5 - x) / 2."
