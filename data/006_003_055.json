    "message_1": "Suppose you have a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a spade card?",
    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 spades (Ace through King). To find the probability of drawing a spade, you can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (since there are 13 spades), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (since there are 52 cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a spade is:\n\nProbability = 13/52 = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a spade card is 0.25 or 25%."
