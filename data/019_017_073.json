Let T be the theory consisting of the axioms stating that \"<\" is a linear ordering with no maximum and no minimum elements. Let M be the structure whose domain is the set of rational numbers, where \"<\" is interpreted as the usual ordering on the rationals. \n\nDetermine whether the sentence \"There exist two distinct elements such that one is less than the other\" is true or false in the model M.",
    "message_2": "The sentence \"There exist two distinct elements such that one is less than the other\" can be written in the first-order logic as:\n\n∃x∃y (x ≠ y ∧ x < y)\n\nNow, let's determine if this sentence is true or false in the model M, where the domain is the set of rational numbers and \"<\" is the usual ordering on the rationals.\n\nWe need to find two distinct rational numbers x and y such that x < y. Let's consider the rational numbers x = 1/2 and y = 3/4. These are distinct rational numbers, and it is true that 1/2 < 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"There exist two distinct elements such that one is less than the other\" is true in the model M."
