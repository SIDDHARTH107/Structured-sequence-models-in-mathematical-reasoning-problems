The temperature of the bar at time t = 0 is given by the function:\n\nf(x) = 4x(2 - x)\n\nwhere -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. Find the temperature distribution along the bar at any time t using the Fourier transform method. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the steel bar is 10^-5 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the bar at any time t using the Fourier transform method, we need to solve the heat equation:\n\n∂u(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²u(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the position along the bar.\n\nFirst, let's normalize the length of the bar by defining a new variable y = x + 1, so that 0 ≤ y ≤ 2. The initial temperature distribution function becomes:\n\ng(y) = 4(y-1)y\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier series expansion to represent the initial temperature distribution function:\n\ng(y) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπy/L)]\n\nwhere L = 2 (the length of the bar), and B_n is the Fourier coefficient given by:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[g(y) * sin(nπy/L)] dy, integrated from 0 to L.\n\nNow, we need to find the B_n coefficients:\n\nB_n = (1/1) * ∫[4(y-1)y * sin(nπy/2)] dy, integrated from 0 to 2.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 4(y-1)y, dv = sin(nπy/2) dy\ndu = 4(2y-1) dy, v = (-2/nπ) * cos(nπy/2)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nB_n = (1/1) * [(-2/nπ) * 4(y-1)y * cos(nπy/2)] | from 0 to 2 - (1/1) * ∫[(-2/nπ) * 4(2y-1) * cos(nπy/2)] dy, integrated from 0 to 2.\n\nThe first term of the equation becomes 0 since cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(0) = 1.\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nB_n = (8/nπ) * ∫[(2y-1) * cos(nπy/2)] dy, integrated from 0 to 2.\n\nAgain, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = (2y-1), dv = cos(nπy/2) dy\ndu = 2 dy, v = (2/nπ) * sin(nπy/2)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nB_n = (8/nπ) * [(2/nπ) * (2y-1) * sin(nπy/2)] | from 0 to 2 - (8/nπ) * ∫[(2/nπ) * 2 * sin(nπy/2)] dy, integrated from 0 to 2.\n\nThe first term of the equation becomes 0 since sin(nπ) = 0 and sin(0) = 0.\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nB_n = (-16/n²π²) * ∫[sin(nπy/2)] dy, integrated from 0 to 2.\n\nIntegrating the sine function:\n\nB_n = (-16/n²π²) * [(-2/nπ) * cos(nπy/2)] | from 0 to 2.\n\nB_n = (32/n³π³) * [cos(nπ) - 1].\n\nNow, we have the B_n coefficients, and we can write the Fourier series expansion for the initial temperature distribution:\n\ng(y) = Σ [(32/n³π³) * [cos(nπ) - 1] * sin(nπy/2)]\n\nThe solution to the heat equation with this initial condition is given by:\n\nu(y,t) = Σ [(32/n³π³) * [cos(nπ) - 1] * sin(nπy/2) * exp(-α(nπ/2)²t)]\n\nwhere α = 10^-5 m²/s is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the steel bar at any time t using the Fourier transform method."
