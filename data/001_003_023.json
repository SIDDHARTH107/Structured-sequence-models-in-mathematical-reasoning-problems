    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations will cancel each other when summed:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 3:\n\n1*(2x + 3y) = 1*(10)\n3*(5x - y) = 3*(-7)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n15x - 3y = -21\n\nNow, we will add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(2x + 3y) + (15x - 3y) = 10 + (-21)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n17x = -11\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\nx = -11/17\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 10\n2(-11/17) + 3y = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 17 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n-22 + 51y = 170\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n\n51y = 192\ny = 192/51\ny = 4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -11/17\ny = 4"
