    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen consumer prefers Product A, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of consumers who prefer Product A) / (Total number of consumers)\n\nIn this case, there are 60 consumers who prefer Product A and a total of 100 consumers. So the probability is:\n\nProbability = 60 / 100 = 0.6 or 60%\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen consumer prefers Product A is 60%."
