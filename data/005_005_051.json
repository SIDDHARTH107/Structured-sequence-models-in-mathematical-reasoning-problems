    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces light bulbs and has observed that 5% of them are defective. If a customer purchases 10 light bulbs, what is the probability that at least one of them is defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one light bulb is defective, we can first find the probability that none of them are defective and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single light bulb is not defective is 95%, or 0.95 (since 100% - 5% = 95%).\n\nFor 10 independent light bulbs, the probability that all of them are not defective is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all not defective) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one is defective by subtracting the probability that none are defective from 1:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(all not defective) = 1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that at least one light bulb is defective is approximately 40.13%."
