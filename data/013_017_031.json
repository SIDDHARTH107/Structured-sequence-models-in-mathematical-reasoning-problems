    "message_1": "Consider a job market where there are two types of workers: high-quality and low-quality. High-quality workers produce 10 units of output per hour, while low-quality workers produce only 5 units per hour. There are two employers, A and B, each of whom needs to hire one worker. Employer A values high-quality workers at $20/hour and low-quality workers at $10/hour, while Employer B values high-quality workers at $25/hour and low-quality workers at $15/hour. In this market, there are 10 high-quality workers and 10 low-quality workers available for hire. However, each employer can only assess the quality of a worker by observing their previous output, and therefore cannot distinguish between high-quality and low-quality workers in advance. \n\nWhat are the equilibrium wages and employment outcomes in this market under adverse selection?",
    "message_2": "Under adverse selection, employers cannot distinguish between high-quality and low-quality workers in advance. Therefore, they will offer a wage based on the average productivity of the workers in the market.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average productivity of the workers in the market:\n\nAverage productivity = (Total output of high-quality workers + Total output of low-quality workers) / Total number of workers\n\nTotal output of high-quality workers = 10 workers * 10 units/hour = 100 units/hour\nTotal output of low-quality workers = 10 workers * 5 units/hour = 50 units/hour\n\nAverage productivity = (100 + 50) / 20 = 150 / 20 = 7.5 units/hour\n\nNow, let's calculate the average value of a worker for each employer:\n\nEmployer A's average value = (Value of high-quality worker + Value of low-quality worker) / 2\nEmployer A's average value = ($20/hour + $10/hour) / 2 = $30/hour / 2 = $15/hour\n\nEmployer B's average value = (Value of high-quality worker + Value of low-quality worker) / 2\nEmployer B's average value = ($25/hour + $15/hour) / 2 = $40/hour / 2 = $20/hour\n\nSince Employer B values the average worker more than Employer A, Employer B will offer a higher wage to attract workers. In equilibrium, both employers will hire one worker each, and the wage will be determined by the average value of a worker for Employer A, which is $15/hour.\n\nIn this market under adverse selection, the equilibrium wage is $15/hour, and each employer hires one worker. High-quality workers are underpaid relative to their productivity, while low-quality workers are overpaid. This inefficiency is a result of the information asymmetry in the market."
