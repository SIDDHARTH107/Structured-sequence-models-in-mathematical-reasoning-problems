    "message_2": "In a Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. To find the key value, we can compare the positions of the letters in the plaintext and the ciphertext.\n\nLet's take the first letter of the plaintext, \"H\", and the first letter of the ciphertext, \"M\". The position of \"H\" in the alphabet is 8, and the position of \"M\" is 13. The difference between these positions is 13 - 8 = 5. \n\nWe can check if this key value holds for the other letters as well:\n\nE (5) -> J (10) : 10 - 5 = 5\nL (12) -> Q (17) : 17 - 12 = 5\nL (12) -> Q (17) : 17 - 12 = 5\nO (15) -> T (20) : 20 - 15 = 5\n\nThe key value used in the Caesar cipher is 5."
