    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 487 is divided by 15 using modular arithmetic, we can use the following formula:\n\nremainder = a (mod n)\n\nwhere a is the number we want to divide (487) and n is the divisor (15).\n\nremainder = 487 (mod 15)\n\nNow, we can find the remainder by dividing 487 by 15 and finding the remainder:\n\n487 รท 15 = 32 with a remainder of 7\n\nSo, the remainder when 487 is divided by 15 is 7. In modular arithmetic notation, this can be written as:\n\n487 โก 7 (mod 15)"
