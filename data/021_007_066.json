    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subject of Numerical Analysis, specifically in the subtopic Solving Nonlinear Equations using Newton-Raphson method:\n\nUsing the Newton-Raphson method, find the root of the nonlinear equation f(x) = e^(2x) - 6x - 7, accurate up to four decimal places. Use an initial guess of x = 2.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given nonlinear equation f(x) = e^(2x) - 6x - 7 using the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d(e^(2x) - 6x - 7) / dx = 2e^(2x) - 6\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe are given an initial guess of x_0 = 2. Now, we will iterate using the Newton-Raphson formula until the difference between successive approximations is less than 0.0001 (to ensure accuracy up to four decimal places).\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f(x_0) / f'(x_0)\nx_1 = 2 - (e^(2*2) - 6*2 - 7) / (2e^(2*2) - 6)\nx_1 ≈ 1.6726\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = x_1 - f(x_1) / f'(x_1)\nx_2 = 1.6726 - (e^(2*1.6726) - 6*1.6726 - 7) / (2e^(2*1.6726) - 6)\nx_2 ≈ 1.6781\n\nSince the difference between x_1 and x_2 is less than 0.0001, we can stop the iterations here. Therefore, the root of the nonlinear equation f(x) = e^(2x) - 6x - 7, accurate up to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 1.6781."
