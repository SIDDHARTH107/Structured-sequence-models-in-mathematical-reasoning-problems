    "message_2": "To use Pollard's rho algorithm to factorize n = pq, where p = 13 and q = 17, we first compute n:\n\nn = pq = 13 * 17 = 221\n\nNow, we will use Pollard's rho algorithm to find a non-trivial factor of n. The algorithm is based on the idea of iterating a function and looking for a cycle in the sequence of values produced. We will use the function f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod n).\n\n1. Choose an initial value x = 2 and y = 2.\n2. Iterate the function f(x) to update x and y:\n   x = f(x) = f(2) = (2^2 + 1) % 221 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 221 = 26\n3. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n:\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 221) = GCD(21, 221) = 1\n   Since the GCD is 1, we continue iterating.\n4. Update x and y again:\n   x = f(x) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 221 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(135) = (135^2 + 1) % 221 = 197\n5. Compute the GCD of |x - y| and n:\n   GCD(|26 - 197|, 221) = GCD(171, 221) = 13\n\nNow we have found a non-trivial factor of n, which is 13. To find the other factor, we can divide n by 13:\n\nn / 13 = 221 / 13 = 17\n\nSo, the factorization of n = 221 is 13 * 17, which are the original prime numbers p and q."
