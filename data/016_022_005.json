    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid construction is a fractal pattern that starts with a pyramid made up of 4 triangles on its base. With each iteration, the number of triangles increases as smaller triangles are formed within the larger triangles.\n\nIn the Sierpinski pyramid, the number of triangles at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of triangles = (4^5 - 1) / 3\nNumber of triangles = (1024 - 1) / 3\nNumber of triangles = 1023 / 3\nNumber of triangles = 341\n\nSo, there are 341 triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction with 4 triangles on its base."
