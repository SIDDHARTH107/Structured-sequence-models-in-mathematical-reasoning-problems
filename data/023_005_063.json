    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier Transform, we first need to take the Fourier Transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier Transform of a function $f(x)$ is given by:\n\n$$F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx$$\n\nTaking the Fourier Transform of both sides of the given differential equation, we get:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y''\\} + 4\\mathcal{F}\\{y\\} = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier Transform of $y''$ and $y$. Using the properties of the Fourier Transform, we know that:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y''\\} = (2\\pi i k)^2 Y(k)$$\n\nwhere $Y(k)$ is the Fourier Transform of $y(x)$. Substituting this into the transformed differential equation, we get:\n\n$$(2\\pi i k)^2 Y(k) + 4Y(k) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $Y(k)$:\n\n$$Y(k) = \\frac{0}{(2\\pi i k)^2 + 4}$$\n\nSince the right-hand side is 0, we have:\n\n$$Y(k) = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to take the inverse Fourier Transform of $Y(k)$ to find the solution $y(x)$. However, since $Y(k) = 0$, the inverse Fourier Transform will also be 0. Therefore, the solution to the given differential equation is:\n\n$$y(x) = 0$$\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the initial conditions $y(0) = 2$ and $y'(0) = -3$. This indicates that the given differential equation and initial conditions are inconsistent, and there is no solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial conditions."
