    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set containing elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and A be the set containing elements 1, 2, 3, and B be the complement set of A. Show that the union of set A and its complement set B is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To show that the union of set A and its complement set B is equal to the universal set U, we need to show that every element in U is either in A or B, and there are no other elements in the union of A and B.\n\nSet A contains elements 1, 2, and 3. Since B is the complement set of A, it contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. So, B contains elements 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement set B. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement set B contains all the elements in the universal set U, and there are no other elements in the union of A and B.\n\nTherefore, the union of set A and its complement set B is equal to the universal set U."
