    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nTo find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, we first find their intersection and then remove the common elements from the union of A and B.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\nUnion of A and B: A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we remove the common elements (the intersection) from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of sets B and A:\n\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of B and A: B ∩ A = {2, 3, 4}\nUnion of B and A: B ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we remove the common elements (the intersection) from the union:\n\nB Δ A = {1, 5}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of sets A and B (A Δ B) is equal to the symmetric difference of sets B and A (B Δ A), which is {1, 5}. This proves that the symmetric difference operation is commutative, meaning that the order of the sets does not affect the result."
