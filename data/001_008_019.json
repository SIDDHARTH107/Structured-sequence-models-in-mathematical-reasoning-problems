Draw a number line with the numbers -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n2. Place a closed circle on the number 4 (since x can be equal to 4).\n3. Shade the number line to the right of the closed circle (since x can be greater than 4).\n\nThe graph of the solution set on the number line shows that all values of x greater than or equal to 4 are included in the solution set."
