    "message_2": "To show that L is a free curve on X, we need to show that the restriction of the Picard group Pic(X) to L is isomorphic to Z. We will do this by showing that the normal bundle of L in X is trivial, which implies that L is a free curve on X.\n\nFirst, let's recall some facts about the geometry of smooth quartic surfaces in P3. A smooth quartic surface X in P3 is a K3 surface, meaning that it has trivial canonical bundle, i.e., K_X ≅ O_X. Moreover, the degree of X is 4, so the hyperplane section H of X is a divisor of degree 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the line L on X. Since L is a line in P3, it is isomorphic to P1. The normal bundle N_L of L in P3 is O(1), and the restriction of the tangent bundle T_P3 to L is T_P3 |_L ≅ O(1) ⊕ O(1) ⊕ O(1). \n\nNext, let's compute the normal bundle N_LX of L in X. The exact sequence of normal bundles is given by:\n\n0 → N_LX → N_L → N_X |_L → 0\n\nSince N_L ≅ O(1), we have:\n\n0 → N_LX → O(1) → N_X |_L → 0\n\nNow, we want to compute N_X |_L. The tangent bundle T_X of X is given by the Euler sequence:\n\n0 → O_X → O_X(1)^4 → T_X → 0\n\nRestricting this sequence to L, we get:\n\n0 → O_L → O_L(1)^4 → T_X |_L → 0\n\nSince L is a line in P3, it is isomorphic to P1, and T_X |_L ≅ O_L ⊕ O_L. Thus, we have:\n\n0 → O_L → O_L(1)^4 → O_L ⊕ O_L → 0\n\nNow, we can compute the normal bundle N_X |_L using the fact that N_X |_L ≅ T_P3 |_L / T_X |_L. From the previous sequences, we have T_P3 |_L ≅ O(1) ⊕ O(1) ⊕ O(1) and T_X |_L ≅ O_L ⊕ O_L. Therefore, N_X |_L ≅ O(1) ⊕ O(1).\n\nGoing back to the sequence for N_LX, we have:\n\n0 → N_LX → O(1) → O(1) ⊕ O(1) → 0\n\nThis sequence splits, and we obtain N_LX ≅ O. This means that the normal bundle of L in X is trivial.\n\nSince the normal bundle N_LX is trivial, L is a free curve on X. Therefore, the restriction of the Picard group Pic(X) to L is isomorphic to Z."
