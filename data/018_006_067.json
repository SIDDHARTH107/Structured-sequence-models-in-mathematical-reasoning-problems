The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nA' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. In this case, the union of A and A' will contain all the elements from A and all the elements from A'.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nWe can see that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U.\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nHence, we have proved that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
