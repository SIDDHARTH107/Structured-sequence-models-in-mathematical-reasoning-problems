    "message_2": "To determine the amount of substance remaining after 30 days, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 200g, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 200g * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal amount = 200g * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 200g * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 25g\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be 25g of the radioactive substance remaining."
