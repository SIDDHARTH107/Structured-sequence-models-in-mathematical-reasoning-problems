    "message_2": "To find the genus of the graph, we can use the formula:\n\ngenus = (e - n + 2)/2\n\nwhere e is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices.\n\nFrom the given graph, we can count the number of vertices (n) and edges (e):\n\nn = 8 (vertices)\ne = 12 (edges)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ngenus = (12 - 8 + 2)/2\ngenus = (6)/2\ngenus = 3\n\nSo, the genus of the given graph is 3."
