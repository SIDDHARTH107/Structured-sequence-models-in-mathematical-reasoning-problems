    "message_2": "To partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers, we need to find the number of ways to represent 10 as a sum of distinct positive integers. We can use the method of Ferrers diagrams or use the formula for partitioning into distinct parts.\n\nThe formula for the number of partitions of a number n into distinct parts is given by P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2) - P(n-5) - P(n-7) + P(n-12) + P(n-15) - ...\n\nIn this formula, the sequence of numbers in the parentheses (1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, ...) are the generalized pentagonal numbers. The signs alternate between positive and negative. The formula continues until the numbers in the parentheses are greater than n.\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to find the number of ways to partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers:\n\nP(10) = P(9) + P(8) - P(5) - P(3)\nP(9) = P(8) + P(7) - P(4) - P(2)\nP(8) = P(7) + P(6) - P(3) - P(1)\nP(7) = P(6) + P(5) - P(2) - P(0)\nP(6) = P(5) + P(4) - P(1) - P(-1)\nP(5) = P(4) + P(3) - P(0) - P(-2)\nP(4) = P(3) + P(2) - P(-1) - P(-3)\nP(3) = P(2) + P(1) - P(-2) - P(-4)\nP(2) = P(1) + P(0) - P(-3) - P(-5)\nP(1) = 1\nP(0) = 1\n\nNow, we can calculate the values of P(n) for n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:\n\nP(2) = 1 + 1 = 2\nP(3) = 2 + 1 = 3\nP(4) = 3 + 2 = 5\nP(5) = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7\nP(6) = 7 + 5 - 1 = 11\nP(7) = 11 + 7 - 2 - 1 = 15\nP(8) = 15 + 11 - 3 - 1 = 22\nP(9) = 22 + 15 - 5 - 2 = 30\n\nFinally, we can calculate the number of ways to partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers:\n\nP(10) = P(9) + P(8) - P(5) - P(3) = 30 + 22 - 7 - 3 = 42\n\nSo, there are 42 ways to partition the number 10 into distinct positive integers."
