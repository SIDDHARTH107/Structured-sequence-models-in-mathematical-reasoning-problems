    "message_2": "We will use the Hadamard's formula for entire functions of finite order. The Hadamard's formula states that for an entire function $f(z)$ of order $\\rho$ and having zeros at $z_1, z_2, \\dots$ (counting multiplicity), we can write\n\n$$f(z) = e^{g(z)} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n),$$\n\nwhere $g(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $\\rho$, $k_n$ are integers, and $E_k(z)$ is the canonical product given by\n\n$$E_k(z) = (1 - z) e^{z + \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\cdots + \\frac{z^k}{k}}.$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is of order 1, we have\n\n$$f(z) = e^{az + b} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n),$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants. We are given that $f(0) = 1$, so\n\n$$1 = e^{a \\cdot 0 + b} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(0/z_n) = e^b.$$\n\nThis implies that $b = 0$, and thus\n\n$$f(z) = e^{az} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n).$$\n\nNow, we are given that $|f(z)| \\leq e^{2|\\text{Re}(z)|}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Taking the modulus of both sides of the equation above, we get\n\n$$|f(z)| = |e^{az}| \\left|\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n)\\right| \\leq e^{2|\\text{Re}(z)|}.$$\n\nSince $|e^{az}| = e^{a \\text{Re}(z)}$, we have\n\n$$e^{a \\text{Re}(z)} \\left|\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n)\\right| \\leq e^{2|\\text{Re}(z)|}.$$\n\nDividing both sides by $e^{a \\text{Re}(z)}}$, we get\n\n$$\\left|\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n)\\right| \\leq e^{(2-a)|\\text{Re}(z)|}.$$\n\nNow, we will use the fact that $f(z)$ is of order 1. This means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_\\epsilon$ such that\n\n$$\\left|\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n)\\right| \\leq C_\\epsilon e^{(1+\\epsilon)|z|}.$$\n\nComparing this with the inequality above, we see that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we must have $2 - a \\leq 1 + \\epsilon$. This implies that $a \\geq 1$. However, since $f(z)$ is of order 1, we also have $a \\leq 1$. Thus, $a = 1$, and\n\n$$f(z) = e^{z} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(z/z_n).$$\n\nFinally, we want to find the value of $f(i)$. Plugging in $z = i$, we get\n\n$$f(i) = e^{i} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{k_n}(i/z_n).$$\n\nSince $|f(i)| \\leq e^{2|\\text{Re}(i)|} = e^0 = 1$, we must have $|f(i)| = 1$. Moreover, since $f(i)$ is a product of factors with modulus 1, we conclude that $f(i) = e^i$."
