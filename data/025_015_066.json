    "message_2": "To find the points on the surface where the gradient vector is parallel to the vector <1,1,1>, we first need to find the gradient of the given equation. The gradient of a scalar function F(x, y, z) is given by the vector (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z).\n\nGiven the equation 4x^2 + 4y^2 - z^2 = 16, let F(x, y, z) = 4x^2 + 4y^2 - z^2 - 16. Then, the gradient of F is:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z) = (8x, 8y, -2z)\n\nNow, we want to find the points where the gradient vector is parallel to the vector <1,1,1>. Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. So, we have:\n\n(8x, 8y, -2z) = k(1, 1, 1)\n\nThis gives us the following equations:\n\n8x = k\n8y = k\n-2z = k\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) that satisfy these equations and also lie on the surface 4x^2 + 4y^2 - z^2 = 16.\n\nFrom the first two equations, we get:\n\nx = k/8\ny = k/8\n\nSubstituting these values into the surface equation, we get:\n\n4(k/8)^2 + 4(k/8)^2 - (k/-2)^2 = 16\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nk^2/16 + k^2/16 - k^2/4 = 16\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\nk^2/8 - k^2/4 = 16\nk^2/8 = 16\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8, we get:\n\nk^2 = 128\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nk = ±8√2\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding x, y, and z values:\n\nx = k/8 = ±√2\ny = k/8 = ±√2\nz = -k/2 = ±4√2\n\nSo, the points on the surface where the gradient vector is parallel to the vector <1,1,1> are:\n\n(√2, √2, -4√2) and (-√2, -√2, 4√2)"
