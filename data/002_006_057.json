    "message_2": "To find the distance a runner covers in completing one lap around the track, we need to calculate the circumference of the circular track. The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is given as 100 meters, the radius (r) is half of that, which is 50 meters. Now, we can plug in the value of r into the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * 50\n\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 50\n\nC ≈ 314.159 * 50\n\nC ≈ 15707.95\n\nThe distance a runner covers in completing one lap around the track is approximately 15707.95 meters."
