    "message_2": "In a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), the space of states on a closed orientable 2-manifold M is given by the vector space V assigned to M. In this case, M is a torus with a nontrivial spin structure, and the theory assigns to M a vector space V with dimension 3.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of states on the torus is equal to the dimension of V, which is 3."
