    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 11 is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of prime order is always cyclic.\n\nLet G be a group of order 11. Since 11 is a prime number, we can use Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. In our case, the possible orders of subgroups H are divisors of 11, which are 1 and 11.\n\nNow, let's consider an element a in G such that a is not the identity element (denoted as e). By definition, the subgroup generated by a, denoted as <a>, consists of all the powers of a: {a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^n} for some n.\n\nSince a is not the identity element, the order of <a> cannot be 1 (otherwise, <a> would only contain the identity element). By Lagrange's theorem, the only other possibility for the order of <a> is 11, which means that <a> must contain all 11 elements of G.\n\nTherefore, G is generated by a single element a, and we can conclude that G is a cyclic group."
