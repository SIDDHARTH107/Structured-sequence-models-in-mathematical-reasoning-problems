    "message_2": "To find all the possible Cayley tables of a group of order 10, we need to consider the possible structures of the group. A group of order 10 can be either cyclic or non-cyclic. There are three possible isomorphism types for groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, and the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\n1. Cyclic group C10:\nThe cyclic group of order 10 is generated by a single element, say g, such that g^10 = e (identity element). The Cayley table for C10 is:\n\n```\n  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9\n  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9  e\n  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9  e  g\n  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9  e  g  g^2\n  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9  e  g  g^2  g^3\n  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4\n  g^6  g^7  g^8  g^9  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5\n  g^7  g^8  g^9  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6\n  g^8  g^9  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7\n  g^9  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  g^5  g^6  g^7  g^8\n```\n\n2. Dihedral group D5:\nThe dihedral group D5 is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. It has 10 elements, consisting of 5 rotations and 5 reflections. Let r be the rotation by 72 degrees and s be a reflection. The group is generated by r and s, with relations r^5 = e, s^2 = e, and (rs)^2 = e. The Cayley table for D5 is:\n\n```\n  e  r  r^2  r^3  r^4  s  sr  sr^2  sr^3  sr^4\n  r  r^2  r^3  r^4  e  sr  sr^2  sr^3  sr^4  s\n  r^2  r^3  r^4  e  r  sr^2  sr^3  sr^4  s  sr\n  r^3  r^4  e  r  r^2  sr^3  sr^4  s  sr  sr^2\n  r^4  e  r  r^2  r^3  sr^4  s  sr  sr^2  sr^3\n  s  sr^4  sr^3  sr^2  sr  e  r^4  r^3  r^2  r\n  sr  s  sr^4  sr^3  sr^2  r  e  r^4  r^3  r^2\n  sr^2  sr  s  sr^4  sr^3  r^2  r  e  r^4  r^3\n  sr^3  sr^2  sr  s  sr^4  r^3  r^2  r  e  r^4\n  sr^4  sr^3  sr^2  sr  s  r^4  r^3  r^2  r  e\n```\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10:\nThere is no non-abelian group of order 10. This is because the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. For a group of order 10, the Sylow subgroups have orders 2 and 5 (prime factors of 10). Since both 2 and 5 are prime, the Sylow subgroups are cyclic, and the group is a semi-direct product of these cyclic subgroups. However, for a group of order 10, the semi-direct product is a direct product, which is abelian. Therefore, there is no non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two isomorphism types for groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5. The Cayley tables for these groups are shown above."
