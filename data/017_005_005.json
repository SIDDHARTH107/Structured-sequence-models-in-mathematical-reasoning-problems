    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Third Theorem, we have that n_3 divides the order of G and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Since the order of G is 27, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is H. Since H is a subgroup of G and has the same order as G, we have that H = G. Thus, G is a p-group (a group of prime power order), and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic or a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since the order of G is 27, G must be either cyclic of order 27 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let H, K, and L be these three subgroups. Since the order of each subgroup is 27, the intersection of any two of these subgroups must have order 3 (by the formula for the order of the intersection of two subgroups). Let M = H ∩ K. Then, the order of M is 3, and M is a normal subgroup of H and K. \n\nNow, consider the product HK. Since H and K are both subgroups of G, the product HK is a subset of G. Moreover, the order of HK is given by |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 27 * 27 / 3 = 243. However, this is a contradiction, as the order of G is 27, and thus HK cannot be a subset of G. Therefore, our assumption that n_3 = 3 must be incorrect.\n\nThus, we conclude that n_3 = 1, and G must be either cyclic of order 27 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
