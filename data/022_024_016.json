    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = α^2(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by α^2XYT to separate the variables:\n\nT'(t) / (α^2T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y)\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on t and the right-hand side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (α^2T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow we have three ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) X''(x) + λX(x) = 0\n2) Y''(y) + λY(y) = 0\n3) T'(t) + λα^2T(t) = 0\n\nWe first solve the boundary value problem for X(x) and Y(y):\n\nX(0) = X(1) = 0\nY(0) = Y(1) = 0\n\nThe solutions to the ODEs for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x) = sin(nπx)\nY(y) = sin(mπy)\n\nwhere n and m are positive integers. The corresponding eigenvalue is λ = n^2π^2 + m^2π^2.\n\nNow, we solve the ODE for T(t):\n\nT'(t) + λα^2T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λα^2t)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for u(x, y, t) as a sum of products of X(x), Y(y), and T(t):\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑C_nm * sin(nπx) * sin(mπy) * e^(-(n^2π^2 + m^2π^2)α^2t)\n\nTo find the coefficients C_nm, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)sin(πy):\n\nsin(πx)sin(πy) = ∑∑C_nm * sin(nπx) * sin(mπy)\n\nComparing both sides, we can see that C_11 = 1 and all other coefficients are zero. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx) * sin(πy) * e^(-2π^2α^2t)\n\nFinally, we find the temperature distribution at time t = 0.5:\n\nu(x, y, 0.5) = sin(πx) * sin(πy) * e^(-2π^2α^2 * 0.5)"
