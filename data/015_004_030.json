    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, which means it has a non-integer dimension and an infinitely complex boundary. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate its exact area. However, we can estimate the area of the largest copy of the Mandelbrot set that fits within a square with a side length of 4 units.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is typically displayed within a region of the complex plane with real part between -2 and 1 and imaginary part between -1.5 and 1.5. This means that the largest copy of the Mandelbrot set that can fit within a square of side length 4 units would be the entire Mandelbrot set itself.\n\nEstimating the area of the Mandelbrot set is not a straightforward task, but it has been approximated to be around 1.50659177 square units. So, the area of the largest copy of the Mandelbrot set within a square with side length of 4 units is approximately 1.50659177 square units."
