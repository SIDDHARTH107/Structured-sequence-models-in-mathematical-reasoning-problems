    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7  |\n    | 11 |\n\n2. Find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) if it exists.\n\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula:\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 3) - (3 * 4) = 6 - 12 = -6\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find the adjugate of A:\n\nadj(A) = |  3  -3 |\n         | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = (-1/6) * adj(A) = | -1/2  1/2  |\n                          |  2/3 -1/3 |\n\n3. Multiply A_inv by B to get the solution matrix X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = | -1/2  1/2  | * | 7  |\n    |  2/3 -1/3 |   | 11 |\n\nX = | (-1/2)*7 + (1/2)*11 |\n    | (2/3)*7 - (1/3)*11 |\n\nX = | -3.5 + 5.5 |\n    |  4.67 - 3.67 |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution is (x, y) = (2, 1)."
