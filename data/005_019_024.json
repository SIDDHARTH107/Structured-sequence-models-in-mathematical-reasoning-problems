    "message_2": "To find the probability of making at least 4 out of the next 5 free throws, we can consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. The player makes exactly 4 free throws.\n2. The player makes all 5 free throws.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each scenario and then add them up.\n\nScenario 1: The player makes exactly 4 free throws.\nThere are 5 ways this can happen: MMMMF, MMMFM, MMFMM, MFMMM, FMMMM (where M represents a made free throw and F represents a missed free throw).\n\nThe probability of each of these sequences occurring is (0.8)^4 * (0.2)^1 = 0.08192.\n\nSince there are 5 ways this can happen, the total probability for this scenario is 5 * 0.08192 = 0.4096.\n\nScenario 2: The player makes all 5 free throws.\nThere is only 1 way this can happen: MMMMM.\n\nThe probability of this sequence occurring is (0.8)^5 = 0.32768.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of both scenarios to find the probability of making at least 4 out of the next 5 free throws:\n\n0.4096 + 0.32768 = 0.73728.\n\nSo, the probability that the player will make at least 4 out of their next 5 free throws is approximately 73.73%."
