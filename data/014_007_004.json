    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a pseudorandom sequence of binary digits to encrypt a message. Suppose you have a stream cipher that generates a keystream of length 24, and you want to encrypt a message of length 48. What is the maximum number of unique keystreams that can be generated by the stream cipher?",
    "message_2": "A stream cipher generates a pseudorandom sequence of binary digits (bits), where each bit can be either 0 or 1. If the keystream has a length of 24, then there are 2^24 possible unique keystreams that can be generated by the stream cipher. \n\nTo calculate 2^24, you can use the formula:\n\n2^24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × ... × 2 (24 times)\n\n2^24 = 16,777,216\n\nSo, the maximum number of unique keystreams that can be generated by the stream cipher is 16,777,216."
