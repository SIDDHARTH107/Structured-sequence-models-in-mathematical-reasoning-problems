    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet s(t) be the position function of the car, and let v(t) be its velocity function (i.e., the speedometer reading). We are given that v(0) = 40 mph and v(3) = 60 mph. We want to find a time t in the interval [0, 3] when v(t) = 50 mph.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of change of the velocity function over the interval [0, 3]. This is given by:\n\n(v(3) - v(0)) / (3 - 0) = (60 - 40) / 3 = 20 / 3 mph\n\nNow, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to the velocity function v(t) over the interval [0, 3]. Since the car is traveling on a straight road, we can assume that the velocity function is continuous and differentiable on this interval. Therefore, there exists a time t in the interval (0, 3) such that the derivative of the velocity function at t is equal to the average rate of change of the velocity function over the interval [0, 3]:\n\nv'(t) = 20 / 3 mph\n\nv'(t) represents the acceleration of the car. Since the acceleration is constant (20/3 mph) during the interval [0, 3], we can find the time t when the car's speedometer reads exactly 50 mph by solving the following equation:\n\nv(0) + (20/3) * t = 50\n\n40 + (20/3) * t = 50\n\n(20/3) * t = 10\n\nt = (3/2)\n\nSo, at time t = 1.5 seconds, the car's speedometer reads exactly 50 mph."
