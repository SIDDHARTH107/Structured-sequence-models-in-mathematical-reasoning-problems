    "message_2": "To find the number of critical points on the surface of a torus using Morse theory, we need to compute the Euler characteristic of the torus and relate it to the number of critical points of different indices.\n\nThe Euler characteristic (χ) of a torus is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. For a torus, χ = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the Morse function on the torus. A Morse function is a smooth function with non-degenerate critical points. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of different indices to the Euler characteristic.\n\nLet m_k denote the number of critical points of index k. According to Morse theory, the Euler characteristic of the torus can be expressed as:\n\nχ = Σ(-1)^k * m_k.\n\nSince χ = 0 for a torus, we have:\n\n0 = m_0 - m_1 + m_2 - m_3 + ...\n\nHowever, we know that a torus is a 2-dimensional manifold, so there are no critical points of index greater than 2. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n0 = m_0 - m_1 + m_2.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of m_0, m_1, and m_2. On a torus, there is always one minimum (m_0 = 1) and one maximum (m_2 = 1). To find the number of saddle points (m_1), we can plug the values of m_0 and m_2 into the equation:\n\n0 = 1 - m_1 + 1.\n\nSolving for m_1, we get:\n\nm_1 = 2.\n\nSo, there are 2 saddle points on the surface of the torus. In total, there are 1 minimum, 2 saddle points, and 1 maximum, which gives us 4 critical points on the surface of the torus using Morse theory."
