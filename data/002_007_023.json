    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a bottom base of 5 cm, a top base of 10 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the bottom base is 5 cm, the top base is 10 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (5 + 10) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (15) * 8\n\nArea = 7.5 * 8\n\nArea = 60 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 60 square centimeters."
