    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of 5455 using Pollard's Rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factor (5455 in this case).\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating x = f(x) and y = f(f(y)) until a non-trivial factor is found.\n\nLet's start iterating:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 5455 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 5455 = 26\ngcd(5455, |5 - 26|) = gcd(5455, 21) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 5455 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 5455 = 2906\ngcd(5455, |26 - 2906|) = gcd(5455, 2880) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 5455 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2906)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 5455 = 2906\ngcd(5455, |677 - 2906|) = gcd(5455, 2229) = 3\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 3. Now we can divide 5455 by 3 to get the other factor:\n\n5455 / 3 = 1815\n\nNow we need to check if 3 and 1815 are prime. 3 is a prime number, but we need to check 1815 using Pollard's Rho algorithm again:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 1815 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 1815 = 26\ngcd(1815, |5 - 26|) = gcd(1815, 21) = 3\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 3. Now we can divide 1815 by 3 to get the other factor:\n\n1815 / 3 = 605\n\nNow we need to check if 3 and 605 are prime. 3 is a prime number, but we need to check 605 using Pollard's Rho algorithm again:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 605 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 605 = 26\ngcd(605, |5 - 26|) = gcd(605, 21) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 605 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 605 = 364\ngcd(605, |26 - 364|) = gcd(605, 338) = 13\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 13. Now we can divide 605 by 13 to get the other factor:\n\n605 / 13 = 47\n\nBoth 13 and 47 are prime numbers.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 5455 using Pollard's Rho algorithm is:\n\n5455 = 3 × 3 × 13 × 47 = 3^2 × 13 × 47"
