    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person is a smoker, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of smokers (400), and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of people in the community (1,000).\n\nProbability = 400 / 1,000 = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person from this community is a smoker is 0.4 or 40%."
