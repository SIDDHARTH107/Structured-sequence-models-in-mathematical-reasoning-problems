    "message_2": "To find the values of $x_{10}$ and $y_{10}$, we need to iterate the Poincaré map 10 times starting from the initial conditions $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 1)$. Since both equations are the same, we can just compute one of them and apply the result to both $x$ and $y$. Let's compute $x_{10}$:\n\n1. $x_1 = x_0^2 - 2 = 1^2 - 2 = -1$\n2. $x_2 = x_1^2 - 2 = (-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1$\n3. $x_3 = x_2^2 - 2 = (-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1$\n\nWe can see that the sequence is repeating itself: $-1, -1, -1, ...$. Therefore, $x_{10} = -1$.\n\nSince the equations for $x$ and $y$ are the same and they have the same initial conditions, we can conclude that $y_{10} = -1$ as well.\n\nSo, the values of $x_{10}$ and $y_{10}$ are both $-1$. The point at the 10th iteration is $(-1, -1)$."
