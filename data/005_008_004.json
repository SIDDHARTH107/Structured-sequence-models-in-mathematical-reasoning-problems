    "message_2": "To forecast the number of visitors in Week 11 using time series analysis techniques, we can use a simple moving average method. In this case, we will use a 3-week moving average to make the forecast.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moving averages for Weeks 8, 9, and 10:\n\nMoving average for Week 8:\n(Week 5 + Week 6 + Week 7) / 3 = (136 + 146 + 160) / 3 = 442 / 3 = 147.33\n\nMoving average for Week 9:\n(Week 6 + Week 7 + Week 8) / 3 = (146 + 160 + 174) / 3 = 480 / 3 = 160\n\nMoving average for Week 10:\n(Week 7 + Week 8 + Week 9) / 3 = (160 + 174 + 182) / 3 = 516 / 3 = 172\n\nNow, let's forecast the number of visitors for Week 11 using the moving average:\n\nForecast for Week 11:\n(Week 8 + Week 9 + Week 10) / 3 = (174 + 182 + 190) / 3 = 546 / 3 = 182\n\nUsing the 3-week moving average method, we forecast that there will be 182 visitors in Week 11."
