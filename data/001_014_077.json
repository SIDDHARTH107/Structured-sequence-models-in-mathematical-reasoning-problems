    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(48), we need to find the prime factors of 48 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n48 can be factored as 2 × 24, 24 can be factored as 2 × 12, and 12 can be factored as 2 × 6, and finally, 6 can be factored as 2 × 3. So, the prime factorization of 48 is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3, or 2^4 × 3.\n\nNow, we look for pairs of the same factor. We have two pairs of 2s (2 × 2 and 2 × 2). We can take one 2 from each pair out of the square root:\n\n√(48) = √(2^4 × 3) = 2^2 × √(3) = 4√(3)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 4√(3)."
