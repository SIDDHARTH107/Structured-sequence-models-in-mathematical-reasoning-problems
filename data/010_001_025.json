    "message_2": "To find the closure of Y in X, we need to find the smallest closed set in X that contains Y. Recall that a set is closed if its complement is open. \n\nFirst, let's find the complement of Y in X, denoted as X \\ Y. Since Y consists of all numbers greater than or equal to 1, its complement will consist of all numbers less than 1, including 0. So, X \\ Y = {x ∈ X | x < 1}.\n\nNow, let's check if X \\ Y is open in X. According to the given condition, a subset U of X is open if and only if 0 does not belong to U. Since 0 is in X \\ Y, this set is not open in X.\n\nSince X \\ Y is not open, its complement, Y, is not closed. To find the closure of Y, we need to add the limit points of Y to the set. A limit point of Y is a point in X such that every open neighborhood of that point intersects Y.\n\nIn this case, the only limit point of Y is 1, as every open set containing 1 will also contain points greater than 1, which are in Y. So, the closure of Y in X is the set Y ∪ {1} = {x ∈ X | x ≥ 1}."
