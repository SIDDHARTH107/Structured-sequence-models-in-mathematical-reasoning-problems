    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set and A be a set such that A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. Find the complement of A, A' and show that the union of A and A' is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A (denoted as A'), we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since we are not given a specific universal set, let's assume U contains all the integers from 1 to 10. Then, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we can find A' by listing all the elements in U that are not in A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nTo show that the union of A and A' is equal to U, we need to find the union of A and A' (denoted as A ∪ A') and check if it contains all the elements in U.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nComparing A ∪ A' with U, we can see that they contain the same elements:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nThus, the union of A and A' is equal to the universal set U."
