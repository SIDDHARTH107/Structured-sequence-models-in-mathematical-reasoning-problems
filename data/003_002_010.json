    "message_2": "To find the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle, we can use the sine and cosine functions of the 30-degree angle.\n\nLet's denote the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle as \"a\" and the side opposite to the 30-degree angle as \"b\".\n\nUsing the cosine function:\ncos(30) = a / 10\n\nThe cosine of 30 degrees is equal to √3/2, so:\n(√3/2) = a / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for \"a\":\na = 10 * (√3/2)\na = 5√3 units\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(30) = b / 10\n\nThe sine of 30 degrees is equal to 1/2, so:\n(1/2) = b / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for \"b\":\nb = 10 * (1/2)\nb = 5 units\n\nSo, the length of the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle is 5√3 units, and the length of the side opposite to the 30-degree angle is 5 units."
