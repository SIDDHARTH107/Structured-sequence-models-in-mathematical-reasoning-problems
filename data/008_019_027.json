    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 6x + 9yi = 3+6i\n(2) 6x - 4yi = 4-6i\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate y:\n\n(1) - (2): 13yi = 9i - 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 13i:\n\ny = (9i - 1) / 13i\n\nTo simplify this expression, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is -13i:\n\ny = ((9i - 1) * -13i) / (13i * -13i)\n\ny = (-9i^2 + 13) / 169\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we have:\n\ny = (9 + 13) / 169\n\ny = 22 / 169\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of x. Let's use equation (1):\n\n6x + 9yi = 3+6i\n\n6x + 9(22 / 169)i = 3+6i\n\n6x + (198 / 169)i = 3+6i\n\nNow, subtract (198 / 169)i from both sides:\n\n6x = 3 + 6i - (198 / 169)i\n\n6x = 3 + (6 - 198 / 169)i\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6:\n\nx = (3/6) + (1 - 33 / 169)i\n\nx = 1/2 + (136 / 169)i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 1/2 + (136 / 169)i\ny = 22 / 169"
