Find the homotopy class of the composition fg in the fundamental group of X.",
    "message_2": "Since f is homotopic to the identity map, there exists a homotopy H: X × [0, 1] → X such that H(x, 0) = f(x) and H(x, 1) = x for all x in X. Similarly, since g is homotopic to the constant map that sends every point on X to the point 1 + 0i, there exists a homotopy G: X × [0, 1] → X such that G(x, 0) = g(x) and G(x, 1) = 1 + 0i for all x in X.\n\nNow, consider the composition fg: X → X. We want to find the homotopy class of fg in the fundamental group of X. To do this, we will construct a homotopy K: X × [0, 1] → X between fg and some known map, and then determine the homotopy class of that known map.\n\nDefine K(x, t) = H(G(x, t), t) for all x in X and t in [0, 1]. Note that K(x, 0) = H(g(x), 0) = fg(x) and K(x, 1) = H(1 + 0i, 1) = 1 + 0i for all x in X. Thus, K is a homotopy between fg and the constant map that sends every point on X to the point 1 + 0i.\n\nThe fundamental group of the unit circle X is isomorphic to the integers, with the homotopy class of a loop corresponding to its winding number around the origin. Since the constant map that sends every point on X to the point 1 + 0i has winding number 0, the homotopy class of fg in the fundamental group of X is also 0."
