    "message_1": "A math student wants to study geometric invariant theory within algebraic geometry. Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nLet G be the group of all degree 2 linear transformations of the plane generated by the matrices \n\na =  \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} , \n\nb = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\nFind the fixed point set of the linear action of G on the polynomial ring in two variables 𝐷⟨𝑥,𝑦⟩ = 𝐶[𝑥,𝑦].",
    "message_2": "To find the fixed point set of the linear action of G on the polynomial ring D⟨x,y⟩ = C[x,y], we need to determine the polynomials that are invariant under the action of both matrices a and b.\n\nLet's first find the action of a on a polynomial f(x,y) ∈ C[x,y]. We have:\n\na ⋅ (x,y) = (x + y, y)\n\nSo, the action of a on f(x,y) is f(x + y, y). We want to find the polynomials that are invariant under this action, i.e., f(x,y) = f(x + y, y).\n\nNow let's find the action of b on a polynomial f(x,y) ∈ C[x,y]. We have:\n\nb ⋅ (x,y) = (-x, y)\n\nSo, the action of b on f(x,y) is f(-x, y). We want to find the polynomials that are invariant under this action, i.e., f(x,y) = f(-x, y).\n\nTo find the fixed point set, we need to find the polynomials that satisfy both conditions:\n\nf(x,y) = f(x + y, y) = f(-x, y)\n\nThe polynomials that satisfy these conditions are the polynomials that depend only on the variable y. Therefore, the fixed point set of the linear action of G on the polynomial ring D⟨x,y⟩ = C[x,y] is the set of polynomials of the form g(y), where g(y) ∈ C[y]."
