A bifurcation diagram is a plot of the stable points of the logistic map function as a function of the parameter r. In the period-doubling route to chaos, as r increases, the system undergoes a series of period-doubling bifurcations, eventually leading to chaos.\n\nFor r = 3.5, the bifurcation diagram shows that the system is in a chaotic regime. This is because, at r = 3.5, the system has already passed through the period-doubling bifurcations and entered the chaotic region. The iterations do not seem to converge to a single value or a periodic orbit, as seen from the calculated iterations above.\n\nIn conclusion, for the given logistic map function with x₀ = 0.25 and r = 3.5, the system goes into chaos and does not converge to a value or a periodic orbit. The bifurcation diagram confirms this behavior, showing that the system is in a chaotic regime."
