    "message_2": "In a simple substitution cipher, the most common letter in the encrypted message is likely to correspond to the most common letter in the original message. In English, the most common letter is E. In the given frequency distribution, the letter with the highest frequency is E with a count of 20. Therefore, it is most likely that the letter E in the encrypted message corresponds to the letter E in the original message."
