    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nS(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\nS_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nS_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\nE = S_u • S_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = S_u • S_v = 4uv\nG = S_v • S_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives:\nS_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nS_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we find the second fundamental form coefficients:\nL = S_uu • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = S_uv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nN = S_vv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the coefficients, we get:\nE = 5\nF = 4\nG = 5\nL = -2 / sqrt(9)\nM = -2 / sqrt(9)\nN = -2 / sqrt(9)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\nK = ((-2 / sqrt(9)) * (-2 / sqrt(9)) - (-2 / sqrt(9))^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2)\nK = (4 / 9 - 4 / 9) / (25 - 16)\nK = 0 / 9\nK = 0\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is 0."
