    "message_1": "A pizza parlour offers 5 different toppings to choose from. How many unique combinations of toppings can be added to a pizza if the customer can choose between 0 and all 5 toppings?(express your answer using Bell numbers).",
    "message_2": "To find the number of unique combinations of toppings, we can use the power set formula, which is 2^n, where n is the number of toppings. In this case, n = 5.\n\n2^5 = 32\n\nSo there are 32 unique combinations of toppings, including the option of choosing no toppings at all.\n\nHowever, you asked for the answer using Bell numbers. Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set, which is not the same as finding the number of unique combinations of toppings. Therefore, using Bell numbers would not be appropriate for this problem. The correct answer is 32 unique combinations."
