    "message_2": "A group of order 40 has a prime factorization of 40 = 2^3 * 5. By Sylow's theorems, we can determine the possible numbers of subgroups of order 2 and order 5.\n\nFor subgroups of order 2 (2^1):\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide the index 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1 and 5.\n\nFor subgroups of order 5 (5^1):\n- The number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide the index 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible numbers of Sylow 5-subgroups are 1 and 8.\n\nNow, let's use this information to determine whether the group is isomorphic to C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\n1. Cyclic group C40:\n- A cyclic group of order 40 has a unique subgroup of each order dividing 40. Therefore, it has 1 subgroup of order 2 and 1 subgroup of order 5.\n\n2. Dihedral group D20:\n- A dihedral group of order 2n has n subgroups of order 2 and 1 subgroup of order n. In this case, D20 has 10 subgroups of order 2 and 1 subgroup of order 20. This does not match the possible numbers of subgroups of order 2 and order 5 for a group of order 40.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 40:\n- There are eight non-abelian groups of order 40. However, we can rule them out based on the number of subgroups of order 2 and order 5. Non-abelian groups will have more than 1 subgroup of order 2 and more than 1 subgroup of order 5, which does not match the possible numbers of subgroups we found.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group of order 40 has 1 subgroup of order 2 and 1 subgroup of order 5, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40. If it has a different number of subgroups of order 2 and order 5, it cannot be isomorphic to C40 or D20 and must be one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40."
