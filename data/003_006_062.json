    "message_1": "A triangle has angle measures of 30° and 60°, and its opposite sides have lengths of 5cm and 7cm. What is the length of the third side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°, the third angle can be found by subtracting the given angles from 180°:\n\n180° - 30° - 60° = 90°\n\nNow we have a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1:√3:2. Let's match the given side lengths to the ratio:\n\n1. If the side opposite the 30° angle is 5cm, then the side opposite the 60° angle is 5√3 cm, and the side opposite the 90° angle (the hypotenuse) is 10cm. However, this doesn't match the given side length of 7cm.\n\n2. If the side opposite the 60° angle is 5cm, then the side opposite the 30° angle is 5/√3 cm, and the side opposite the 90° angle (the hypotenuse) is 10/√3 cm. This doesn't match the given side lengths either.\n\n3. If the side opposite the 30° angle is 7cm, then the side opposite the 60° angle is 7√3 cm, and the side opposite the 90° angle (the hypotenuse) is 14cm. This doesn't match the given side lengths either.\n\n4. If the side opposite the 60° angle is 7cm, then the side opposite the 30° angle is 7/√3 cm, and the side opposite the 90° angle (the hypotenuse) is 14/√3 cm. This matches the given side length of 5cm for the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle (the side opposite the 30° angle) is 7/√3 cm. To rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\n(7/√3) * (√3/√3) = 7√3/3\n\nTherefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 7√3/3 cm."
