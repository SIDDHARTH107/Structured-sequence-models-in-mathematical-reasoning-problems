The factory owner wants to maximize their profits while producing at least 200 units of each type. How many widgets of each type should the factory produce daily?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A widgets, y be the number of type B widgets, and z be the number of type C widgets produced daily. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z = 1000 (total number of widgets produced daily)\n2. x >= 200 (at least 200 type A widgets)\n3. y >= 200 (at least 200 type B widgets)\n4. z >= 200 (at least 200 type C widgets)\n\nThe profit for each type of widget is the selling price minus the production cost. So, the profit for type A is $10 - $5 = $5, for type B is $14 - $8 = $6, and for type C is $20 - $12 = $8.\n\nThe factory owner wants to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal Profit = 5x + 6y + 8z\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to produce more of the widget with the highest profit margin, which is type C. However, we must also satisfy the constraints.\n\nSince we need to produce at least 200 units of each type, let's start with the minimum values for x, y, and z:\n\nx = 200\ny = 200\nz = 600 (since x + y + z = 1000)\n\nNow we have:\n\nTotal Profit = 5(200) + 6(200) + 8(600) = 1000 + 1200 + 4800 = 7000\n\nSo, to maximize the profit, the factory should produce 200 type A widgets, 200 type B widgets, and 600 type C widgets daily, resulting in a total profit of $7000."
