    "message_2": "To find the number of different hands that contain exactly two aces and three kings, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose two aces from the four available aces in the deck. This can be calculated as:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose three kings from the four available kings in the deck. This can be calculated as:\n\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4\n\nNow, to find the total number of different hands that contain exactly two aces and three kings, we multiply the number of ways to choose the aces by the number of ways to choose the kings:\n\nTotal hands = (Ways to choose 2 aces) * (Ways to choose 3 kings) = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 different hands that contain exactly two aces and three kings."
