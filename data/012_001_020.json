    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 5 using Dijkstra's algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the distance values for all nodes. Set the distance for the starting node (node 1) to 0 and set the distance for all other nodes to infinity.\n\n   Distance values: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\n\n2. Create a set of unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n3. Start with the node with the smallest distance value (node 1) and update the distance values for its neighbors.\n\n   - Update distance for node 2: min(∞, 0 + 3) = 3\n   - Update distance for node 3: min(∞, 0 + 5) = 5\n\n   Distance values: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\n\n4. Mark node 1 as visited and remove it from the unvisited set: {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n5. Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest distance value (node 2) and update the distance values for its neighbors.\n\n   - Update distance for node 3: min(5, 3 + 2) = 5\n   - Update distance for node 4: min(∞, 3 + 7) = 10\n\n   Distance values: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 10, 5: ∞}\n\n6. Mark node 2 as visited and remove it from the unvisited set: {3, 4, 5}\n\n7. Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest distance value (node 3) and update the distance values for its neighbors.\n\n   - Update distance for node 5: min(∞, 5 + 1) = 6\n\n   Distance values: {1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 10, 5: 6}\n\n8. Mark node 3 as visited and remove it from the unvisited set: {4, 5}\n\n9. Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest distance value (node 5). Since this is the destination node, we can stop the algorithm.\n\n10. The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is found with a total weight of 6. To find the path itself, backtrack from node 5:\n\n   - Node 5 has a distance of 6, which was updated by node 3 (5 + 1 = 6)\n   - Node 3 has a distance of 5, which was updated by node 1 (0 + 5 = 5)\n\n   So the shortest path is: 1 -> 3 -> 5"
