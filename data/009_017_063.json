    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 1 cm from the axis of the conductor, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) passing through the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮ B * dl = μ₀ * I\n\nFor a cylindrical conductor, the magnetic field (B) is in the circumferential direction and is constant at a fixed distance (r) from the axis of the conductor. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's Law as:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nHere, I_enclosed is the current enclosed by the loop at a distance of 1 cm from the axis of the conductor. Since the total current (I) is uniformly distributed across the conductor's cross-sectional area, we can find the current enclosed by the loop as follows:\n\nI_enclosed = I * (Area enclosed by the loop / Total cross-sectional area of the conductor)\n\nThe area enclosed by the loop is the area of a circle with a radius of 1 cm:\n\nArea_enclosed = π * (1 cm)^2 = π cm²\n\nThe total cross-sectional area of the conductor is the area of a circle with a radius of 2 cm:\n\nTotal_area = π * (2 cm)^2 = 4π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the enclosed current:\n\nI_enclosed = 2 A * (π cm² / 4π cm²) = 0.5 A\n\nNow we can use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field (B):\n\nB * 2π(1 cm) = μ₀ * 0.5 A\n\nB = (μ₀ * 0.5 A) / (2π * 1 cm)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Substituting this value, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 0.5 A) / (2π * 0.01 m)\n\nB = (2π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) / 0.01 m\n\nB ≈ 2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 1 cm from the axis of the conductor is approximately 2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
