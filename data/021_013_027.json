    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for the mathematics student to solve in regards to solving optimization problems using simulated annealing method:\n\nSuppose a manufacturing company produces two types of products; A and B. The production cost for A is $20 per unit and the profit per unit sold is $45. The production cost for B is $30 per unit and the profit per unit sold is $70. The company has a total production capacity of 400 units and it wants to maximize its total profit. Using simulated annealing, find the quantity of units for each product that should be produced.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using simulated annealing, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function represents the total profit that the company wants to maximize. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function is:\n\nF(x, y) = 45x + 70y\n\n2. Define the constraints: The company has a total production capacity of 400 units. Therefore, the constraint is:\n\nx + y ≤ 400\n\n3. Initialize the parameters for simulated annealing: Choose an initial solution (x0, y0), an initial temperature T0, a cooling rate α, and a stopping criterion (e.g., a minimum temperature or a maximum number of iterations).\n\n4. Perform the simulated annealing algorithm:\n  a. Generate a random neighboring solution (x', y') by perturbing the current solution (x, y).\n  b. Calculate the change in the objective function ΔF = F(x', y') - F(x, y).\n  c. If ΔF > 0 (i.e., the new solution is better), accept the new solution (x', y').\n  d. If ΔF ≤ 0 (i.e., the new solution is worse), accept the new solution with a probability of exp(ΔF / T).\n  e. Update the temperature T = α * T.\n  f. Repeat steps a-e until the stopping criterion is met.\n\n5. The final solution (x, y) represents the optimal number of units for each product that should be produced to maximize the total profit.\n\nNote that the simulated annealing algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the solution may vary depending on the initial solution, temperature, cooling rate, and random perturbations. To obtain a more accurate solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best solution among the runs."
