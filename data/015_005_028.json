    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is a measure of the sensitivity of a dynamical system to initial conditions. For the Rössler system, the MLE depends on the parameters a, b, and c. The Rössler system is described by the following set of differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize the system around its attractor and compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix J for the Rössler system is:\n\nJ = |  0   -1   -1  |\n    |  1    a    0  |\n    |  z    0   x-c |\n\nIn this case, the parameters are a = 0.1, b = 0.1, and c = 14. To find the MLE, we need to find the attractor of the system, which is not possible analytically. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to find the attractor and then compute the MLE.\n\nOne common method to estimate the MLE is the Wolf algorithm. However, this requires numerical simulations and is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response.\n\nIn summary, to find the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system with the given parameters, you would need to use numerical methods like the Wolf algorithm to estimate the MLE."
