    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^6 - 12x^4 + 7x^2 - 3, we will use the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(4x^6)/dx - d(12x^4)/dx + d(7x^2)/dx - d(3)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 4x^6:\nn = 6, so f'(x) = 6 * 4x^(6-1) = 24x^5\n\nFor the second term, -12x^4:\nn = 4, so f'(x) = 4 * -12x^(4-1) = -48x^3\n\nFor the third term, 7x^2:\nn = 2, so f'(x) = 2 * 7x^(2-1) = 14x^1 = 14x\n\nFor the fourth term, -3:\nSince this term is a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 24x^5 - 48x^3 + 14x\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^6 - 12x^4 + 7x^2 - 3 is f'(x) = 24x^5 - 48x^3 + 14x."
