It can be generated by a single element, say a, with the property a^72 = 1.\n\n2. C_36 × C_2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 36 and a cyclic group of order 2.

C_9 × (C_4 × C_2): The direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2. It can be generated by three elements, say a, b, and c, with the properties a^9 = b^4 = c^2 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, and bc = cb.\n\n5. (C_3 × C_3) × C_8: The direct product of a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 8. It can be generated by three elements, say a, b, and c, with the properties a^3 = b^3 = c^8 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, and bc = cb.\n\n6. C_9 ⋊ C_8: The semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 8, with a nontrivial action. It can be generated by two elements, say a and b, with the properties a^9 = b^8 = 1 and b^(-1)ab = a^3.\n\n7. C_3 × (C_3 ⋊ C_4): The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 4, with a nontrivial action. It can be generated by three elements, say a, b, and c, with the properties a^3 = b^3 = c^4 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, and b^(-1)cb = c^(-1).\n\n8. (C_3 × C_3) ⋊ C_4: The semidirect product of a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 4, with a nontrivial action. It can be generated by three elements, say a, b, and c, with the properties a^3 = b^3 = c^4 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, and b^(-1)cb = c^(-1).\n\n9.
