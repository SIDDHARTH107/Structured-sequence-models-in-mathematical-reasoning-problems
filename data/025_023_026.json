    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $IH^3$ of the variety, we first need to understand the geometry of the variety. Let's denote the variety by $V$. The variety $V$ is defined by the following two equations in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^3$:\n\n1. $x^2y^2z^2 = 1$\n2. $x + y + z = 2$\n\nFirst, let's dehomogenize the equations by setting $w = 1$. Then we have the following equations in $\\mathbb{A}^3$:\n\n1. $x^2y^2z^2 = 1$\n2. $x + y + z = 1$\n\nNow, let's analyze the geometry of the variety $V$. The first equation is a product of three quadrics, which means that it is a singular variety. The second equation is a plane in $\\mathbb{A}^3$. The intersection of these two varieties will be a curve in $\\mathbb{A}^3$. Since the first variety is singular, the intersection cohomology group $IH^3$ will be nontrivial.\n\nTo compute the dimension of $IH^3$, we can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem. The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ and a hyperplane section $Y \\subset X$, the restriction map $H^k(X) \\to H^k(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $k < n - 1$ and injective for $k = n - 1$. In our case, $X$ is the projective closure of the variety defined by $x^2y^2z^2 = 1$, and $Y$ is the intersection of $X$ with the hyperplane $x + y + z = 2$. Since $X$ is singular, we need to use a resolution of singularities to apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n\nLet $\\tilde{X}$ be a smooth projective variety that is a resolution of singularities of $X$, and let $\\tilde{Y}$ be the intersection of $\\tilde{X}$ with the hyperplane $x + y + z = 2$. Then the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem applies to $\\tilde{X}$ and $\\tilde{Y}$, and we have:\n\n1. $H^k(\\tilde{X}) \\cong H^k(\\tilde{Y})$ for $k < 2$\n2. $H^2(\\tilde{X}) \\to H^2(\\tilde{Y})$ is injective\n\nSince $X$ and $\\tilde{X}$ have the same cohomology groups in degree $k \\leq 2$, we can compute the dimension of $IH^3(V)$ using the cohomology groups of $\\tilde{X}$ and $\\tilde{Y}$. We have:\n\n1. $H^0(\\tilde{X}) \\cong H^0(\\tilde{Y}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$\n2. $H^1(\\tilde{X}) \\cong H^1(\\tilde{Y}) \\cong 0$\n3. $H^2(\\tilde{X}) \\to H^2(\\tilde{Y})$ is injective\n\nSince $H^2(\\tilde{X}) \\to H^2(\\tilde{Y})$ is injective, the dimension of $IH^3(V)$ is equal to the difference between the dimensions of $H^2(\\tilde{X})$ and $H^2(\\tilde{Y})$. We have:\n\n$\\dim IH^3(V) = \\dim H^2(\\tilde{X}) - \\dim H^2(\\tilde{Y})$\n\nTo compute the dimensions of $H^2(\\tilde{X})$ and $H^2(\\tilde{Y})$, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a smooth projective variety is equal to the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups. We have:\n\n$\\chi(\\tilde{X}) = \\dim H^0(\\tilde{X}) - \\dim H^1(\\tilde{X}) + \\dim H^2(\\tilde{X}) = 1 - 0 + \\dim H^2(\\tilde{X})$\n\n$\\chi(\\tilde{Y}) = \\dim H^0(\\tilde{Y}) - \\dim H^1(\\tilde{Y}) + \\dim H^2(\\tilde{Y}) = 1 - 0 + \\dim H^2(\\tilde{Y})$\n\nSince $\\tilde{X}$ is a resolution of singularities of $X$, the Euler characteristic of $\\tilde{X}$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $X$. Similarly, the Euler characteristic of $\\tilde{Y}$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $Y$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\dim IH^3(V) = \\chi(X) - \\chi(Y)$\n\nTo compute the Euler characteristics of $X$ and $Y$, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ of degree $d$ is equal to $d^3 - d$. In our case, $X$ is the projective closure of the variety defined by $x^2y^2z^2 = 1$, which is a hypersurface of degree $6$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\chi(X) = 6^3 - 6 = 198$\n\nThe variety $Y$ is the intersection of $X$ with the hyperplane $x + y + z = 2$, which is a hypersurface of degree $1$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\chi(Y) = 1^3 - 1 = 0$\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n$\\dim IH^3(V) = \\chi(X) - \\chi(Y) = 198 - 0 = 198$\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group $IH^3$ of the variety $V$ is 198."
