    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo n is an integer x such that there exists an integer y with x ≡ y^2 (mod n). We want to find the smallest positive integer that is a quadratic residue modulo 18 but not modulo 6.\n\nFirst, let's list the quadratic residues modulo 18:\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 18)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 18)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 18)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 18)\n4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 18)\n5^2 ≡ 7 (mod 18)\n6^2 ≡ 0 (mod 18)\n7^2 ≡ 1 (mod 18)\n8^2 ≡ 4 (mod 18)\n9^2 ≡ 9 (mod 18)\n\nThe quadratic residues modulo 18 are {0, 1, 4, 7, 9, 16}.\n\nNow, let's list the quadratic residues modulo 6:\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 6)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 6)\n3^2 ≡ 3 (mod 6)\n4^2 ≡ 4 (mod 6)\n5^2 ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n\nThe quadratic residues modulo 6 are {0, 1, 3, 4}.\n\nComparing the two sets, we see that 7 is the smallest positive integer that is a quadratic residue modulo 18 but not modulo 6."
