    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric differences:\n\n1. (A x B) △ B\nTo find the symmetric difference between a Cartesian product and a set, we need to consider the elements in the Cartesian product that have the second element from the set B and remove them. Then, we need to add the elements that are not in the Cartesian product but have the second element from the set B.\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1, 3), (2, 2)} △ {2, 3}\nRemoving elements with second element from B: {(1, 3), (2, 2)} - {(1, 2), (2, 3)} = {(1, 3)}\nAdding elements not in the Cartesian product but with second element from B: {(1, 3)} ∪ {(1, 2)} = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nSo, (A x B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\n2. A x (B △ B)\nSince the symmetric difference of a set with itself is an empty set, B △ B = ∅. The Cartesian product of a set with an empty set is also an empty set.\n\nA x (B △ B) = A x ∅ = ∅\n\n3. (A x B) △ (B x A)\n(A x B) △ (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} △ {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\nThe symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nIntersection: (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2, 2)}\nSymmetric difference: (A x B) △ (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)} - {(2, 2)} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to symmetric difference:\n\n(A x B) △ B ≠ A x (B △ B) , so the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
