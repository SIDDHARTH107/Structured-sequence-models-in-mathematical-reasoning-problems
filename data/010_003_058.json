    "message_2": "Proof that X is a Hausdorff space:\n\nRecall that a topological space X is a Hausdorff space (also called a T2 space) if for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U and V containing x and y, respectively.\n\nSince X is a topological space in which any two distinct points can be separated by open neighborhoods, let x and y be any two distinct points in X. By the given property, there exist open neighborhoods U_x containing x and U_y containing y such that U_x and U_y are disjoint (i.e., U_x ∩ U_y = ∅).\n\nThus, for any two distinct points x and y in X, we can find disjoint open neighborhoods containing them. Therefore, X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nCounterexample for a general topological space:\n\nConsider the topological space X = {a, b} with the topology τ = {∅, X}. This is a valid topological space, but it does not satisfy the separation axiom mentioned above.\n\nIn this space, there are no open neighborhoods that can separate the points a and b, since the only non-empty open set is X itself, which contains both points. Therefore, this space is not Hausdorff.\n\nThis counterexample shows that the given property (any two distinct points can be separated by open neighborhoods) is not true for a general topological space without the separation axiom."
