    "message_2": "The Koch Island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the perimeter of the Koch Island increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter after the 4th iteration:\n\nInitial perimeter (P0) = 12 units\n\n1st iteration (P1) = P0 * (4/3) = 12 * (4/3) = 16 units\n\n2nd iteration (P2) = P1 * (4/3) = 16 * (4/3) = 64/3 units\n\n3rd iteration (P3) = P2 * (4/3) = (64/3) * (4/3) = 256/9 units\n\n4th iteration (P4) = P3 * (4/3) = (256/9) * (4/3) = 1024/27 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch Island after the 4th iteration is 1024/27 units."
