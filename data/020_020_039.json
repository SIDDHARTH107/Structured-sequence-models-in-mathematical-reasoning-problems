    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of materials for the cylindrical canister, we need to minimize the surface area while maintaining the required volume of 400 cm³. \n\nLet r be the radius and h be the height of the canister. The volume V of the cylinder is given by:\n\nV = πr²h\n\nSince we know that the volume must be 400 cm³, we can write:\n\n400 = πr²h\n\nNow, we need to express h in terms of r:\n\nh = 400 / (πr²)\n\nThe surface area A of the cylinder consists of the top and bottom circles and the side:\n\nA = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nSubstitute h from the volume equation:\n\nA = 2πr² + 2πr(400 / (πr²))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nA = 2πr² + 800/r\n\nNow, we need to minimize the cost function. The cost function C is given by:\n\nC = 0.10(2πr²) + 0.05(2πrh)\n\nSubstitute h from the volume equation:\n\nC = 0.10(2πr²) + 0.05(2πr(400 / (πr²)))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nC = 0.20πr² + 40/r\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of C with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 0\n\nThe derivative of C with respect to r is:\n\ndC/dr = 0.40πr - 40/r²\n\nSetting dC/dr equal to 0:\n\n0.40πr - 40/r² = 0\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\n0.40πr = 40/r²\n\nr³ = 40 / (0.40π)\n\nr³ = 100 / π\n\nr = (100 / π)^(1/3)\n\nr ≈ 2.72 cm\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the volume equation:\n\nh = 400 / (π(2.72)²)\n\nh ≈ 17.09 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the canister that will minimize the cost of materials are approximately r = 2.72 cm and h = 17.09 cm."
