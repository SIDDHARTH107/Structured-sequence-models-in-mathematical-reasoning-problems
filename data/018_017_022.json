    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (Δ) of (A × B) and A, and (B × A) and A. Recall that the symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\n(A × B) Δ A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} Δ {1, 2}\n(B × A) Δ A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} Δ {1, 2}\n\nSince A contains only single elements and A × B and B × A contain ordered pairs, there is no intersection between these sets. Therefore, the symmetric difference is just the union of the sets:\n\n(A × B) Δ A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 1, 2}\n(B × A) Δ A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1, 2}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to symmetric difference:\n\n(A × B) Δ A ≠ (B × A) Δ A\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 1, 2} ≠ {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1, 2}\n\nSince the two sets are not equal, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
