    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime larger than 10,000, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 > 10,000 and M_n is prime.\n\nWe can start by testing prime values of n:\n\nn = 3: M_n = 2^3 - 1 = 7 (too small)\nn = 5: M_n = 2^5 - 1 = 31 (too small)\nn = 7: M_n = 2^7 - 1 = 127 (too small)\nn = 11: M_n = 2^11 - 1 = 2047 (too small)\nn = 13: M_n = 2^13 - 1 = 8191 (too small)\nn = 17: M_n = 2^17 - 1 = 131071 (greater than 10,000)\n\nNow we need to check if M_n = 131071 is prime. 131071 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Mersenne prime larger than 10,000 is 131071."
