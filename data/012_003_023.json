    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest possible independent set in the graph.\n\nTo find the maximum independent set in this graph, we can analyze the graph and identify the non-adjacent vertices.\n\nThe graph can be divided into three subgraphs:\n\nSubgraph 1: 1-2-3-4-5 (forming a cycle)\nSubgraph 2: 6-7-8 (forming a cycle)\nSubgraph 3: 9-10 (forming a single edge)\n\nFor Subgraph 1, we can select vertices 1, 4, and 5 or vertices 2 and 3. Both options give us an independent set of size 3.\n\nFor Subgraph 2, we can select either vertices 6 and 8 or vertices 7. Both options give us an independent set of size 2.\n\nFor Subgraph 3, we can select either vertex 9 or vertex 10. Both options give us an independent set of size 1.\n\nTo find the maximum independent set for the entire graph, we can combine the maximum independent sets from each subgraph. In this case, we can select vertices 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 (or 1, 4, 5, 7, 6, and 10).\n\nThus, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 6."
