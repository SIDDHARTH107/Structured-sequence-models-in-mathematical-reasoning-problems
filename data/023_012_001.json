    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to calculate the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. Since the function is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. So, we only need to calculate the b_n coefficients and a_0.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx, where L = 1 (the interval is [-1, 1])\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, its integral over a symmetric interval will be zero. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts, one for the interval [-1, 0) and another for the interval [0, 1]:\n\nb_n = (2/1) * [∫[-1, 0] (-1) * sin(nπx) dx + ∫[0, 1] (1) * sin(nπx) dx]\n\nNow, let's solve the integrals:\n\n∫[-1, 0] (-1) * sin(nπx) dx = [cos(nπx) / (nπ)] from -1 to 0\n= (1/(nπ)) - 0\n= 1/(nπ)\n\n∫[0, 1] sin(nπx) dx = [-cos(nπx) / (nπ)] from 0 to 1\n= -(-1)^n / (nπ) - (-1) / (nπ)\n= ((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)\n\nNow, let's add the two parts:\n\nb_n = 2 * (1/(nπ) + ((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ))\n= 2 * (1 + (-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)\n= 2((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the function f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n= Σ [0 * cos(nπx) + (2((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)) * sin(nπx)]\n= Σ (2((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)) * sin(nπx)\n\nNow, let's check the convergence at x = 0:\n\nAt x = 0, all the sine terms will be zero (sin(0) = 0). Therefore, the Fourier series converges to zero at x = 0.\n\nHowever, the function f(x) has a jump discontinuity at x = 0, with f(x) = -1 for x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for x > 0. Therefore, the Fourier series does not converge to the function value at x = 0."
