If each farmer acts in their own self-interest and grazes as many cows as they can, what is the total number of cows that will be grazed on the pasture? Then, calculate the optimal number of cows each farmer should graze on the pasture to maximize the total number of cows on the pasture while also ensuring the pasture's sustainability.",
    "message_2": "If each farmer acts in their own self-interest and grazes as many cows as they can, each farmer will graze 10 cows. Since there are 10 farmers, the total number of cows that will be grazed on the pasture is 10 farmers * 10 cows = 100 cows.\n\nTo ensure the pasture's sustainability, we need to find the optimal number of cows each farmer should graze on the pasture. Since the total carrying capacity of the pasture is 100 cows and there are 10 farmers, the optimal number of cows each farmer should graze is 100 cows / 10 farmers = 10 cows.\n\nIn this case, the optimal number of cows each farmer should graze is the same as the maximum number of cows they can graze. Therefore, the total number of cows on the pasture will be maximized while also ensuring the pasture's sustainability."
