    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line. The equation of the regression line is given by y = mx + b, where y is the exam score, x is the study time, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the study time (x) and the mean of the exam scores (y):\n\nMean of study time (x̄) = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4\nMean of exam scores (ȳ) = (50 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 90) / 5 = 350 / 5 = 70\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (m). The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / Σ(x - x̄)^2\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator = (2 - 4)(50 - 70) + (3 - 4)(60 - 70) + (4 - 4)(70 - 70) + (5 - 4)(80 - 70) + (6 - 4)(90 - 70)\n= (-2)(-20) + (-1)(-10) + (0)(0) + (1)(10) + (2)(20)\n= 40 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 40\n= 100\n\nDenominator = (-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2 + (2)^2\n= 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4\n= 10\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\n\nm = 100 / 10 = 10\n\nTo find the y-intercept (b), we can use the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\n\nb = 70 - 10 * 4 = 70 - 40 = 30\n\nNow we have the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = 10x + 30\n\nFor every extra hour a student spends studying, their exam score is expected to increase by 10 points, as that is the slope of the regression line."
