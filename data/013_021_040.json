    "message_1": "A Centipede Game is a sequential game in which two players take turns choosing between two different payoffs until one player decides to end the game. The game ends as soon as one player decides to end the game. Player 1 starts by choosing whether to “Pass” or “End”, then Player 2 can choose whether to “Pass” or “End” and so on until one player decides to “End” the game. The player who ends the game receives a larger payoff than the other player. \n\nHere's a numerical question for you: \n\nIn a Centipede Game, Player 1 has a choice to pass or end the game. If he passes, Player 2 can choose to pass and get $2 or end the game and get $10. If Player 2 passes, Player 1 can choose to pass and get $4 or end the game and get $8. If Player 1 passes, Player 2 can choose to pass and get $6 or end the game and get $12. If Player 2 passes, Player 1 can choose to pass and get $8 or end the game and get $16. What should be the optimal decision for both Player 1 and Player 2 to maximize their payoffs in this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal decision for both Player 1 and Player 2, we can use backward induction to analyze the game from the end to the beginning.\n\nStarting from the last decision point:\n- If Player 2 passes, Player 1 can choose to pass and get $8 or end the game and get $16. Player 1 should choose to end the game and get $16.\n\nNow, moving to the previous decision point:\n- If Player 1 passes, Player 2 can choose to pass and get $6 or end the game and get $12. Since Player 1 will end the game and get $16 if Player 2 passes, Player 2 should choose to end the game and get $12.\n\nMoving to the next decision point:\n- If Player 2 passes, Player 1 can choose to pass and get $4 or end the game and get $8. Since Player 2 will end the game and get $12 if Player 1 passes, Player 1 should choose to end the game and get $8.\n\nFinally, at the first decision point:\n- Player 1 has a choice to pass or end the game. If he passes, Player 2 will end the game and get $12. If he ends the game, he gets $0. Player 1 should choose to pass.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal decision for both players to maximize their payoffs in this game is for Player 1 to pass and Player 2 to end the game. Player 1 will get $0, and Player 2 will get $12."
