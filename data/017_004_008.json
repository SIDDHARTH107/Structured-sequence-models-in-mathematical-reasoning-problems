    "message_2": "We will use the structure theorem for finite abelian groups to determine the possible structures of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 5^2 = 25, we know that G is an abelian group. The structure theorem for finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In our case, the prime is 5, so the possible structures for G are:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 25 (i.e., G is cyclic).\n2. G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nNow, let's determine which of these structures is possible for G.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where G is cyclic. If G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be written as a power of g. In other words, G = {g^0, g^1, ..., g^24}. Since the order of G is 25, the order of g must be 25. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 25, denoted as Z_25.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. In this case, G can be written as G = H x K, where H and K are cyclic groups of order 5. Let h and k be generators of H and K, respectively. Then, every element of G can be written as (h^i, k^j) for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 4. The order of G in this case is |H| * |K| = 5 * 5 = 25. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted as Z_5 x Z_5.\n\nIn conclusion, G can either be cyclic and isomorphic to Z_25, or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, Z_5 x Z_5. Without additional information about G, we cannot determine which of these structures is the correct one."
