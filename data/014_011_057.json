Let's compare the original message \"MATHEMATICS\" and the transposed message \"AEMTSTCIHMA\".\n\nOriginal:  M  A  T  H  E  M  A  T  I  C  S\nPosition:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11\n\nTransposed: A  E  M  T  S  T  C  I  H  M  A\nPosition:   2  5  1  3 11  8 10  9  4  6  7\n\nNow we can see the permutation used to encrypt the message:\n\n1 -> 2\n2 -> 5\n3 -> 1\n4 -> 3\n5 -> 11\n6 -> 8\n7 -> 10\n8 -> 9\n9 -> 4\n10 -> 6\n11 -> 7\n\nSo the permutation used for the transposition cipher is (2, 5, 1, 3, 11, 8, 10, 9, 4, 6, 7)."
