    "message_1": "Consider the two algebraic equations: \n\n* x^2 + y^2 - 25 = 0\n* x + y - 7 = 0\n\nFind the number of solutions to this system of equations using Bezout's theorem.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem is not applicable in this situation, as it is used for finding the number of intersections between two curves defined by polynomial equations in two variables, under certain conditions. In this case, we have a system of algebraic equations, and we can solve it using substitution or elimination methods.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express y in terms of x:\ny = 7 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\nx^2 + (7 - x)^2 - 25 = 0\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\nx^2 + 49 - 14x + x^2 - 25 = 0\n2x^2 - 14x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 2:\nx^2 - 7x + 12 = 0\n\nFactor the equation:\n(x - 3)(x - 4) = 0\n\nSo, x = 3 or x = 4. Now, find the corresponding values for y:\nIf x = 3, y = 7 - 3 = 4\nIf x = 4, y = 7 - 4 = 3\n\nThus, there are two solutions to this system of equations: (x, y) = (3, 4) and (x, y) = (4, 3)."
