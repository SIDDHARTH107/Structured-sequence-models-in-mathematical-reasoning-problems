The production time in minutes for each product on each machine is shown below:\n\n| Product | Machine X | Machine Y |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 11        | 7         |\n| B       | 6         | 9         |\n\nThe factory can operate up to 60 minutes on machine X and 45 minutes on machine Y. The profit for product A is $150 and for product B is $200. Using mixed-integer programming, determine how many units of each product should be produced to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 150x + 200y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n11x + 6y <= 60 (Machine X constraint)\n7x + 9y <= 45 (Machine Y constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (Non-negative production quantities)\n\nThis is a mixed-integer programming problem. To solve it, we can use the graphical method or an optimization solver. Here, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 11x + 6y <= 60\ny <= (60 - 11x) / 6\n\n2. 7x + 9y <= 45\ny <= (45 - 7x) / 9\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. By plotting these inequalities, we find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n(0, 0), (0, 5), (3, 2), and (5, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 150(0) + 200(0) = 0\nP(0, 5) = 150(0) + 200(5) = 1000\nP(3, 2) = 150(3) + 200(2) = 1050\nP(5, 0) = 150(5) + 200(0) = 750\n\nThe maximum profit is $1,050, which occurs when producing 3 units of product A and 2 units of product B."
