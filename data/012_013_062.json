    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted as P(G, k), is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph. A proper k-coloring is an assignment of k colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe given graph G is a cycle of length 5, which we can denote as C5. To find the chromatic polynomial of C5, we can use the recursive formula for the chromatic polynomial of a cycle:\n\nP(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1)\n\nIn our case, n = 5. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nP(C5, k) = (k-1)^5 + (-1)^5 (k-1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nP(C5, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G."
