    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is constructed by dividing the initial square into 9 smaller squares (3x3 grid) and removing the central square at each iteration. Then, the remaining squares are divided into 9 smaller squares again, and the process is repeated.\n\nLet's denote the area of the initial square as A0. After the first iteration, we have 5 smaller squares, each with an area of (1/3)^2 = 1/9 of the initial square. So, the total area after the first iteration is 5 * (1/9) * A0.\n\nNow, let's find the general formula for the area after n iterations. At each iteration, the number of squares increases by a factor of 5, and the area of each square decreases by a factor of 9. Therefore, the total area after n iterations is given by:\n\nAn = 5^n * (1/9)^n * A0\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the area after 6 iterations to the initial area:\n\n(An / A0) = (5^6 * (1/9)^6 * A0) / A0\n\nThe A0 terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\n(An / A0) = 5^6 * (1/9)^6 = 15625 / 531441 â‰ˆ 0.0294\n\nSo, the ratio of the area of the Vicsek fractal after 6 iterations to its initial area is approximately 0.0294."
