    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the dataset in ascending order:\n\n4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10\n\nNow, let's calculate the median, lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3).\n\nMedian: Since there are 10 data points, the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th values. So, (7 + 7) / 2 = 7.\n\nLower Quartile (Q1): Since there are 10 data points, Q1 will be the average of the 2.5th and 3rd values. So, (5 + 5) / 2 = 5.\n\nUpper Quartile (Q3): Similarly, Q3 will be the average of the 7.5th and 8th values. So, (8 + 8) / 2 = 8.\n\nNow, let's use Tukey's method to detect outliers. We need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) and the lower and upper bounds for outliers.\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 8 - 5 = 3\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 5 - 1.5 * 3 = 0.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 8 + 1.5 * 3 = 12.5\n\nSince all the test scores are within the range of 0.5 to 12.5, there are no outliers in this dataset according to Tukey's method.\n\nIn summary:\n- Median: 7\n- Lower Quartile (Q1): 5\n- Upper Quartile (Q3): 8"
