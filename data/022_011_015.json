    "message_2": "To determine the singularities of the function $f(z)$, we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. The denominator is given by:\n\n$z^2 + 2z + 1$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$(z + 1)^2$\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we find that the only singularity is at $z = -1$.\n\nNow we need to determine the type and order of the singularity. Since the denominator has a factor of $(z + 1)^2$, the singularity at $z = -1$ is a pole. To find the order of the pole, we look at the exponent of the factor $(z + 1)$ in the denominator. In this case, the exponent is 2, so the order of the pole is 2.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z)$ has a pole of order 2 at $z = -1$."
