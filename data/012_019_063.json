    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 10 vertices and 17 edges, the maximum degree can be determined by considering the average degree of the vertices:\n\nAverage degree = (2 * number of edges) / number of vertices = (2 * 17) / 10 = 3.4\n\nSince the average degree is 3.4, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher. Therefore, Δ(G) ≥ 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the chromatic index χ'(G). By Vizing's theorem, we know that:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nSince Δ(G) ≥ 4, we have two possibilities for the chromatic index: χ'(G) = 4 or χ'(G) = 5.\n\nTo determine which value is the chromatic index, we need to check if it's possible to properly color the edges of the graph with 4 colors. If it's not possible, then the chromatic index must be 5.\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the specific structure of the graph G, we cannot definitively determine if it's possible to color the edges with 4 colors or if 5 colors are needed. However, we can conclude that the chromatic index χ'(G) is either 4 or 5."
