The following table shows the distances (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\n\n| Location | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | - | 10 | 8 | 15 | 20 |\n| 2 | 10 | - | 5 | 12 | 18 |\n| 3 | 8 | 5 | - | 6 | 12 |\n| 4 | 15 | 12 | 6 | - | 10 |\n| 5 | 20 | 18 | 12 | 10 | - |\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the driver to visit all 5 locations and return to the starting point, and what is the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible permutations of the locations and then choose the one with the minimum distance. Since there are 5 locations, there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible permutations.
