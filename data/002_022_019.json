    "message_1": "A torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 cm around a line that is 7cm away from the center of the circle. Find the volume of the torus.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we can use the following formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the circle to the line around which the circle is revolved (7 cm), and r is the radius of the circle (3 cm).\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 7 * 3^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 7 * 9\nVolume = 126 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 1239.37 cubic centimeters."
