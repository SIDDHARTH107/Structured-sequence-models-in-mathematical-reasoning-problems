    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C48, A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^4 = 16 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both are unique, they are both normal in G. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial, so G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is a group of order 16 and P_3 is a group of order 3, G ≅ C16 × C3 ≅ C48, which is the cyclic group of order 48.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16. Then, the product of P_2 and P_3, denoted by P_2P_3, is a subgroup of G with order 48. Since |G| = 48, we have G = P_2P_3. Now, we consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, denoted by P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_3 ≅ C3, there are two possible actions of P_3 on P_2: the trivial action and the non-trivial action.\n\nIf the action is trivial, then G ≅ P_2 × P_3 ≅ C16 × C3 ≅ C48, which is the cyclic group of order 48.\n\nIf the action is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. Then, the product of P_2 and P_3, denoted by P_2P_3, is a subgroup of G with order 48. Since |G| = 48, we have G = P_2P_3. Now, we consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, denoted by P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_2 ≅ C16, there are four possible actions of P_3 on P_2: the trivial action and three non-trivial actions.\n\nIf the action is trivial, then G ≅ P_2 × P_3 ≅ C16 × C3 ≅ C48, which is the cyclic group of order 48.\n\nIf the action is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is no normal Sylow subgroup. However, we can still consider the semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, denoted by P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_2 ≅ C16 and P_3 ≅ C3, there are eight possible actions of P_3 on P_2. Among these actions, one is trivial, and the other seven are non-trivial.\n\nIf the action is trivial, then G ≅ P_2 × P_3 ≅ C16 × C3 ≅ C48, which is the cyclic group of order 48.\n\nIf the action is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C48, A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
