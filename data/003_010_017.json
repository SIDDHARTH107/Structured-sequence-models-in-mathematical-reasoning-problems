    "message_1": "A student is standing 30 meters away from a flagpole. If the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is 50°, what is the height of the flagpole, to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have:\n\ntan(50°) = height of flagpole / distance from flagpole\n\nWe are given the distance from the flagpole (30 meters) and the angle of elevation (50°). We can now solve for the height of the flagpole:\n\nheight of flagpole = tan(50°) * 30 meters\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nheight of flagpole ≈ 1.1918 * 30 meters\nheight of flagpole ≈ 35.754 meters\n\nTo the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 36 meters."
