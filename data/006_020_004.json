    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the \"Birthday Paradox.\" However, it's easier to calculate the probability that no one shares the same birthday and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years). The probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365/365 (which is 1). The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364/365. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363/365, and so on.\n\nFor a community of 500 people, the probability that all of them have unique birthdays is:\n\n(365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (365-499/365)\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the formula:\n\nP(unique birthdays) = (365! / (365^n * (365-n)!))\n\nwhere n is the number of people (500 in this case), and \"!\" denotes the factorial function.\n\nP(unique birthdays) = (365! / (365^500 * (365-500)!))\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday, which is the complement of the probability that all of them have unique birthdays:\n\nP(at least 2 share a birthday) = 1 - P(unique birthdays)\n\nUsing a calculator or computer software to compute the factorials and probabilities, we get:\n\nP(at least 2 share a birthday) â‰ˆ 1 - 2.97 * 10^(-68)\n\nSince 2.97 * 10^(-68) is extremely close to 0, the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday in a community of 500 people is approximately 1, or 100%."
