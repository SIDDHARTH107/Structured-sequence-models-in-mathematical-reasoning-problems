    "message_1": "A company has a production plan for the upcoming month that involves the production of two products, product A and product B. The expected profit from product A is $20 per unit and from product B is $30 per unit. However, due to the uncertain demand, the company wants to ensure a minimum profit of $5000 in the upcoming month. \n\nProduct A requires 4 hours of machine time per unit, while Product B requires 6 hours of machine time per unit. The total machine time available is limited to 50 hours. \n\nAssuming that the demand for both products is uncertain and can vary between 50 to 100 units each, how many units of each product should the company manufacture in order to ensure a minimum profit of $5000 for the upcoming month?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit constraint is:\n20x + 30y >= 5000\n\nThe machine time constraint is:\n4x + 6y <= 50\n\nThe demand constraint is:\n50 <= x <= 100\n50 <= y <= 100\n\nNow we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy these constraints.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the machine time constraint:\n2x + 3y <= 25\n\nNext, we can find the minimum value of y that satisfies the profit constraint for each value of x in the demand range:\n\nFor x = 50:\n20(50) + 30y >= 5000\n1000 + 30y >= 5000\n30y >= 4000\ny >= 4000/30\ny >= 133.33\n\nSince y must be an integer and within the demand constraint, the minimum value of y is 134 when x = 50. However, this value of y does not satisfy the machine time constraint, so we need to try other values of x.\n\nFor x = 51:\n20(51) + 30y >= 5000\n1020 + 30y >= 5000\n30y >= 3980\ny >= 3980/30\ny >= 132.67\n\nAgain, since y must be an integer and within the demand constraint, the minimum value of y is 133 when x = 51. Now we need to check if this combination satisfies the machine time constraint:\n\n2(51) + 3(133) = 102 + 399 = 501\n\nThis value does not satisfy the machine time constraint, so we need to continue trying other values of x.\n\nFor x = 52:\n20(52) + 30y >= 5000\n1040 + 30y >= 5000\n30y >= 3960\ny >= 3960/30\ny >= 132\n\nNow we need to check if this combination satisfies the machine time constraint:\n\n2(52) + 3(132) = 104 + 396 = 500\n\nThis value satisfies the machine time constraint, so the company should manufacture 52 units of product A and 132 units of product B to ensure a minimum profit of $5000 for the upcoming month."
