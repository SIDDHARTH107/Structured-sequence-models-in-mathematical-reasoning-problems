    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is still connected after removing any 3 edges, we can use the concept of edge connectivity. Edge connectivity is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nIn a connected graph with n vertices and m edges, the edge connectivity (λ) can be found using the formula:\n\nλ = min(2m/n)\n\nIn our case, n = 8 and m = 11. So, we have:\n\nλ = min(2 * 11 / 8) = min(22 / 8) ≈ 2.75\n\nSince edge connectivity is an integer value, we round down to the nearest integer:\n\nλ = 2\n\nThis means that the graph can be disconnected by removing a minimum of 2 edges. Since we are removing 3 edges, which is more than the edge connectivity, it is possible that the graph will not be connected after removing any 3 edges. However, this does not guarantee that the graph will always be disconnected after removing any 3 edges, but it is a possibility."
