    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of non-intersecting great circles that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of geodesic domes. A geodesic dome is a spherical structure composed of a network of triangles or polygons that distribute stress evenly across the structure. The vertices of these triangles or polygons lie on the surface of the sphere, and the edges form great circles.\n\nOne way to create a geodesic dome is by subdividing the faces of a regular polyhedron, such as a tetrahedron, octahedron, or icosahedron, into smaller triangles. The vertices of these triangles lie on the surface of the sphere, and the edges form great circles.\n\nFor example, if we start with a tetrahedron, we can subdivide each of its four faces into four smaller triangles, resulting in a total of 16 triangles. The edges of these triangles form six great circles, which are non-intersecting.\n\nIf we start with an octahedron, we can subdivide each of its eight faces into four smaller triangles, resulting in a total of 32 triangles. The edges of these triangles form 12 great circles, which are non-intersecting.\n\nIf we start with an icosahedron, we can subdivide each of its 20 faces into four smaller triangles, resulting in a total of 80 triangles. The edges of these triangles form 30 great circles, which are non-intersecting.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-intersecting great circles that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere is 30, which can be achieved by using the edges of the triangles formed by subdividing the faces of an icosahedron. Note that the radius of the sphere does not affect the number of non-intersecting great circles that can be drawn."
