    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the method of characteristics, we first rewrite the PDE in the form:\n\n∂u/∂t + 2∂u/∂x = 0\n\nas a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along the characteristic curves:\n\ndx/dt = 2, du/dt = 0\n\nNow, we solve these ODEs. For the first equation, we have:\n\ndx/dt = 2\n\nIntegrating with respect to t, we get:\n\nx(t) = 2t + C1\n\nFor the second equation, we have:\n\ndu/dt = 0\n\nIntegrating with respect to t, we get:\n\nu(t) = C2\n\nNow, we need to find the initial conditions for the characteristic curves. At t = 0, we have:\n\nx(0) = 2(0) + C1 = C1\nu(0) = C2 = 5e^(-x^2/2)\n\nSo, the characteristic curves are given by:\n\nx(t) = 2t + x(0)\nu(t) = 5e^(-(2t + x(0))^2/2)\n\nNow, we want to find the solution u(x, t) at time t = 0.5 for the value of x = 1. We have:\n\nx(0.5) = 2(0.5) + x(0) = 1\n\nSolving for x(0), we get:\n\nx(0) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can find the solution u(x, t) at time t = 0.5 for the value of x = 1:\n\nu(0.5) = 5e^(-(2(0.5) + 0)^2/2) = 5e^(-1) ≈ 1.8394\n\nSo, the solution u(x, t) at time t = 0.5 for the value of x = 1 is approximately 1.8394."
