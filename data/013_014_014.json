    "message_1": "Suppose two players are trying to split a cake that is worth $10. If player 1 gets a piece that is worth $x, then player 2 gets the remaining piece that is worth $10 - x. Each player's utility (or satisfaction) is equal to the value of the piece they receive. How much should player 1 claim their piece is worth in order to maximize their utility? Assume that player 2 will agree to the proposed split if their utility is positive.",
    "message_2": "To maximize player 1's utility, they should claim as much of the cake as possible while still ensuring that player 2's utility is positive. In other words, player 1 should claim a piece worth $x$ such that player 2's piece is worth just slightly more than $0.\n\nMathematically, we want to find the maximum value of $x$ such that $10 - x > 0$. This inequality simplifies to $x < 10$. To maximize player 1's utility, they should claim a piece worth just slightly less than $10$, say $x = 10 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a very small positive number. This will give player 2 a piece worth $\\epsilon$, which is still positive, and player 1 will have maximized their utility."
