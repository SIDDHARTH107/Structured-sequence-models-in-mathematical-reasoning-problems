    "message_1": "A metal ball of radius 2 cm rolls in a horizontal plane without slipping. What is the length of the path traced out by a point on the circumference of the ball after it has completed one full revolution? Assume that π = 3.14. (Hint: Use the symplectic geometry equation for the path of rolling without slipping)",
    "message_2": "When a ball rolls without slipping, the distance it covers in one full revolution is equal to the circumference of the circle formed by the ball. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the metal ball is 2 cm. Using the given value of π = 3.14, we can calculate the circumference:\n\nC = 2 × 3.14 × 2\nC = 12.56 cm\n\nSo, after one full revolution, the length of the path traced out by a point on the circumference of the ball is 12.56 cm."
