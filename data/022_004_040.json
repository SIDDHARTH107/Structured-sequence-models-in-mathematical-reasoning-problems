    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the complex function f(z) = (z^4 - 1) / (z - 1)^2, we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero, as these are the points where the function is undefined.\n\nThe denominator is (z - 1)^2. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n(z - 1)^2 = 0\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nz - 1 = 0\n\nSolving for z, we find that z = 1.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this singularity is removable, a pole, or an essential singularity. To do this, we can examine the limit of the function as z approaches the singularity.\n\nLet's factor the numerator to see if there's any cancellation:\n\nz^4 - 1 = (z^2 + 1)(z + 1)(z - 1)\n\nNow, the function can be rewritten as:\n\nf(z) = [(z^2 + 1)(z + 1)(z - 1)] / (z - 1)^2\n\nWe can see that there is a cancellation between the (z - 1) term in the numerator and one of the (z - 1) terms in the denominator. After the cancellation, the function becomes:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 1)(z + 1) / (z - 1)\n\nNow, let's examine the limit as z approaches 1:\n\nlim (z -> 1) (z^2 + 1)(z + 1) / (z - 1)\n\nSince the numerator and denominator are both continuous functions, we can simply plug in z = 1:\n\n(1^2 + 1)(1 + 1) / (1 - 1) = (2)(2) / 0\n\nThe limit does not exist, which means that the singularity at z = 1 is a pole. Therefore, the function f(z) = (z^4 - 1) / (z - 1)^2 has a pole at z = 1."
