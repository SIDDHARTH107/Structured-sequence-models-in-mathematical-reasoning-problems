    "message_2": "To encrypt a 128-bit message using a 64-bit block cipher, you will need to divide the message into two blocks, each of size 64 bits.\n\nBlock 1: 64 bits\nBlock 2: 64 bits\n\nSince the block cipher operates on 64-bit blocks, the size of the resulting ciphertext for each block will also be 64 bits. Therefore, the total size of the resulting ciphertext for the 128-bit message will be:\n\nCiphertext Block 1: 64 bits\nCiphertext Block 2: 64 bits\n\nTotal size of the resulting ciphertext = 64 bits + 64 bits = 128 bits."
