    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve related to global optimization:\n\nSuppose you want to build a cylindrical tank with a volume of 200 cubic meters. The tank must be made from a material costing $20 per square meter for the curved walls and $30 per square meter for the circular ends. Find the dimensions of the tank that minimize the cost of materials.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of materials for the cylindrical tank, we need to find the dimensions (radius and height) that result in the lowest cost while maintaining a volume of 200 cubic meters.\n\nLet r be the radius of the tank and h be the height of the tank. The volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe are given that the volume of the tank must be 200 cubic meters:\n\n200 = πr^2h\n\nNow, we need to find the cost function, which depends on the surface area of the tank. The surface area A of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nA = 2πrh + 2πr^2\n\nThe cost of the materials for the curved walls is $20 per square meter, and the cost for the circular ends is $30 per square meter. So, the total cost C can be expressed as:\n\nC = 20(2πrh) + 30(2πr^2)\n\nNow, we need to minimize the cost function C. To do this, we can first eliminate one of the variables (either r or h) by expressing it in terms of the other variable using the volume equation. Let's solve for h:\n\nh = 200 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC(r) = 20(2πr(200 / (πr^2))) + 30(2πr^2)\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC(r) = 8000/r + 60πr^2\n\nNow, to minimize the cost function, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of C(r) with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = -8000/r^2 + 120πr\n\nSet dC/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -8000/r^2 + 120πr\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n8000/r^2 = 120πr\n\nMultiply both sides by r^2:\n\n8000 = 120πr^3\n\nDivide by 120π:\n\nr^3 = 8000 / (120π)\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = (8000 / (120π))^(1/3)\n\nr ≈ 1.315 meters\n\nNow, substitute the value of r back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 200 / (π(1.315)^2)\n\nh ≈ 3.630 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the tank that minimize the cost of materials are approximately r ≈ 1.315 meters and h ≈ 3.630 meters."
