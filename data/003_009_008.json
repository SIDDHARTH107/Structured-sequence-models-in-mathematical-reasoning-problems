    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the lengths of the other two sides. We can use the sine and cosine functions to do this.\n\nLet's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle \"b\".\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(30) = a / 20\na = 20 * sin(30)\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we have:\na = 20 * (1/2)\na = 10 cm\n\nUsing the cosine function:\ncos(30) = b / 20\nb = 20 * cos(30)\n\nSince cos(30) = √3/2, we have:\nb = 20 * (√3/2)\nb = 10√3 cm\n\nNow we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides:\nPerimeter = a + b + hypotenuse\nPerimeter = 10 + 10√3 + 20\nPerimeter = 30 + 10√3 cm"
