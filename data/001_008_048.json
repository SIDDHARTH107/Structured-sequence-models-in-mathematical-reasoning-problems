    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 5 ≥ 14, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   3x + 5 - 5 ≥ 14 - 5\n   3x ≥ 9\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 3:\n   3x/3 ≥ 9/3\n   x ≥ 3\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x ≥ 3.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with the numbers from 0 to 6 (you can include more numbers if you want, but these are enough to show the solution).\n\n2. Since x is greater than or equal to 3, we will put a closed circle at 3 on the number line to indicate that 3 is included in the solution.\n\n3. Shade the number line to the right of the closed circle at 3, indicating that all numbers greater than 3 are also part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution on the number line will look like this:\n\n```\n----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n   0    1    2   [3]   4    5    6\n```\n\nThe closed circle at 3 and the shaded region to the right of it represent the solution x ≥ 3."
