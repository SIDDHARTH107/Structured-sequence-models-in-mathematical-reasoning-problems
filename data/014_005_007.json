    "message_1": "Assuming that we're talking about the RSA digital signature scheme, here's a question for a math student to solve: \n\nSuppose that Alice wants to sign a message using her RSA private key (d = 13), where her RSA modulus (n) is 3233. If Alice's message is \"123\", what is the resulting digital signature (S) that Alice should produce? Show your work.",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature (S) using the RSA digital signature scheme, Alice needs to raise the message (M) to the power of her private key (d) and then take the result modulo her RSA modulus (n). In other words, we need to compute:\n\nS ≡ M^d (mod n)\n\nIn this case, Alice's message (M) is 123, her private key (d) is 13, and her RSA modulus (n) is 3233. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nS ≡ 123^13 (mod 3233)\n\nTo compute this, we can use the exponentiation by squaring method, which is an efficient way to compute large powers modulo a number. Here's the process:\n\n1. Write the exponent (13) in binary: 1101\n2. Start with the base (123) and square it for each digit in the binary representation, taking the result modulo 3233:\n   - 123^2 ≡ 15129 (mod 3233) ≡ 2658\n   - 2658^2 ≡ 7062564 (mod 3233) ≡ 3074\n   - 3074^2 ≡ 9451876 (mod 3233) ≡ 1594\n3. Multiply the results corresponding to the non-zero digits in the binary representation (ignoring the first digit), taking the result modulo 3233:\n   - 123 * 3074 * 1594 ≡ 603964764 (mod 3233) ≡ 2162\n\nSo, the resulting digital signature (S) that Alice should produce is 2162."
