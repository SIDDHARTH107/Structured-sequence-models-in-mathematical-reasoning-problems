    "message_2": "If both players play optimally, they will try to ensure that they are the ones to take the last coin. Let's analyze the game from the end to the beginning.\n\nIf there are 1, 2, or 3 coins left, the current player can take all the remaining coins and win. If there are 4 coins left, no matter how many coins the current player takes (1, 2, or 3), the next player can take the remaining coins and win. So, in an optimal strategy, the players will try to leave 4 coins for their opponent.\n\nNow, let's work backwards:\n\n- If there are 5, 6, or 7 coins left, the current player can take 1, 2, or 3 coins, respectively, and leave 4 coins for their opponent, ensuring a win.\n- If there are 8 coins left, no matter how many coins the current player takes, the next player can leave 4 coins for the current player and win.\n\nThis pattern repeats every 4 coins. So, in an optimal strategy, the players will try to leave a multiple of 4 coins for their opponent.\n\nSince there are 100 coins initially, Player 1 can take 1, 2, or 3 coins, leaving 99, 98, or 97 coins, respectively. In each of these cases, the remaining coins are not a multiple of 4, so Player 2 can take enough coins to leave a multiple of 4 coins for Player 1. From that point on, both players can continue to leave multiples of 4 coins for their opponent, ensuring that Player 2 will eventually take the last coin and win.\n\nTherefore, there are no possible ways the game can be played optimally for Player 1 to win."
