    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to arrange 5 pairs of parentheses such that the sequence is valid, we can use the formula for the nth Catalan number:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n!)/(n! * n!)\n\nIn this case, n = 5, so we have:\n\nC(5) = (1/(5+1)) * (2*5!)/(5! * 5!)\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * (10!)/(5! * 5!)\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5!)/(5! * 5!)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common 5! terms:\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6)/(5!)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6)\n\nC(5) = (1/6) * 30240\n\nC(5) = 5040\n\nSo, there are 5040 ways to arrange 5 pairs of parentheses such that the sequence is valid according to the Catalan number sequence."
