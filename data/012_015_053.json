    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 5 vertices, so a connected graph would need at least 4 edges.\n\nSince our graph G has 6 edges, which is more than the minimum required for a connected graph, it is possible for G to be connected. However, we need to check if there is a way to distribute these 6 edges among the 5 vertices such that the graph remains connected.\n\nConsider the following distribution of edges:\n\n1. Vertex 1 connects to Vertex 2\n2. Vertex 2 connects to Vertex 3\n3. Vertex 3 connects to Vertex 4\n4. Vertex 4 connects to Vertex 5\n5. Vertex 5 connects to Vertex 1\n6. An additional edge between any two vertices, for example, Vertex 1 and Vertex 3\n\nWith this distribution of edges, we can see that all vertices are connected, and there is a path between any two vertices in the graph. Therefore, the graph G is connected.\n\nSince the graph is connected, there is only one connected component, which is the entire graph itself."
