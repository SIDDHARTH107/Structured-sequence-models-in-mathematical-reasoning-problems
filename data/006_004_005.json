    "message_2": "In a standard roulette wheel, there are 38 pockets. When you bet on a single number, the probability of the ball landing on your number in one spin is 1/38.\n\nTo find the probability of the ball landing on your number exactly five times in a row, you need to multiply the probability of one successful spin by itself five times:\n\n(1/38) * (1/38) * (1/38) * (1/38) * (1/38) = (1/38)^5 = 1/789609053\n\nSo the probability of the ball landing on your number exactly five times in a row is 1 in 789,609,053."
