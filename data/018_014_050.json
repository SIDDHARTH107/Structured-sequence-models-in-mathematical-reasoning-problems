    "message_2": "To find the complements of sets A and B, we need to define a universal set U that contains all the elements in A and B. Let's define U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n1. A complement: The complement of A is the set of elements in U that are not in A. \n   A complement = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {4, 5}\n\n2. B complement: The complement of B is the set of elements in U that are not in B.\n   B complement = {x ∈ U | x ∉ B} = {1, 5}\n\n3. The Cartesian product of A and B: The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n   A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\n4. The complement of A Cartesian product B: The complement of A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) ∈ U × U such that (x, y) ∉ A × B.\n   (A × B) complement = {(1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\n5. The Cartesian product of the complement of A and the complement of B: This is the Cartesian product of (A complement) and (B complement), denoted as (A complement) × (B complement).\n   (A complement) × (B complement) = {(4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)}\n\n6. Compare the result of 4 and 5 and prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement:\n\n   (A × B) complement = {(1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\n   (A complement) × (B complement) = {(4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) complement ≠ (A complement) × (B complement). This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
