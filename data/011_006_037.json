    "message_1": "A student needs to distribute 10 identical candies to 4 different children. How many ways are there to distribute the candies such that each child receives at least one candy? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to represent the distribution of candies as a polynomial. Since each child must receive at least one candy, we can represent the distribution of candies to the 4 children as:\n\n(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ...)(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ...)(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ...)(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ...)\n\nHere, each factor represents the distribution of candies to one child, and the exponent of x represents the number of candies given to that child.\n\nNow, since we want to distribute 10 candies in total, we need to find the coefficient of x^10 in the product of these polynomials.\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can rewrite each factor as a geometric series:\n\n(1 - x)^(-1) (1 - x)^(-1) (1 - x)^(-1) (1 - x)^(-1)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^10 in the product of these four factors. We can use the multinomial theorem to expand the product:\n\n(1 - x)^(-4)\n\nThe multinomial theorem states that:\n\n(1 - x)^(-4) = sum(C(-4, k) * (-x)^k) for k = 0 to infinity\n\nwhere C(-4, k) is the binomial coefficient with negative integers, which can be calculated as:\n\nC(-4, k) = (-4)(-5)...(-4-k+1) / k!\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^10 in this series. We can do this by plugging in k = 10:\n\nC(-4, 10) = (-4)(-5)(-6)...(-13) / 10!\n\nC(-4, 10) = (-1)^10 * (4)(5)(6)...(13) / 10!\n\nC(-4, 10) = 1 * 8648640 / 3628800\n\nC(-4, 10) = 2380\n\nSo, there are 2380 ways to distribute the 10 identical candies to the 4 different children such that each child receives at least one candy."
