    "message_1": "A metal sample has a complex impedance of $Z=2+j3$ ohms when a sinusoidal voltage of frequency $f=100$Hz is applied to it. Using Fourier transform, determine the resistance and reactance of the sample.",
    "message_2": "The complex impedance, Z, is given as $Z = R + jX$, where R is the resistance and X is the reactance. In this case, we are given $Z = 2 + j3$ ohms.\n\nSince the impedance is already given in the frequency domain, there is no need to use the Fourier transform to determine the resistance and reactance. We can directly read the values from the given complex impedance.\n\nThe resistance, R, is the real part of the complex impedance, which is 2 ohms. The reactance, X, is the imaginary part of the complex impedance, which is 3 ohms.\n\nTherefore, the resistance of the metal sample is 2 ohms, and the reactance is 3 ohms."
