    "message_2": "To solve the equation 7^x ≡ 11 (mod 17), we can use the method of successive squaring and modular exponentiation.\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 7 modulo 17:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n7^4 ≡ (7^2)^2 ≡ 15^2 ≡ 225 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we can see that 7^4 ≡ 1 (mod 17). This means that 7 has an order of 4 modulo 17. In other words, 7^x ≡ 1 (mod 17) if and only if x is a multiple of 4.\n\nNow, let's try to express 11 as a power of 7 modulo 17. Since 7^4 ≡ 1 (mod 17), we can multiply 7^2 by itself to get 11:\n\n7^2 * 7^2 ≡ 15 * 15 ≡ 225 ≡ 11 (mod 17)\n\nSo, 7^4 ≡ 11 (mod 17). Therefore, the solution to the equation 7^x ≡ 11 (mod 17) is x = 4."
