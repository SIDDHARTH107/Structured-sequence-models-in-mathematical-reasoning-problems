    "message_2": "To find a birational transformation that maps $C_1$ onto $C_2$, we will look for a transformation of the form $(x, y) \\mapsto (X(x, y), Y(x, y))$ such that the equation of $C_2$ is satisfied when we substitute $X(x, y)$ and $Y(x, y)$ for $x$ and $y$ respectively.\n\nLet's start by finding a transformation for $x$. We can try a simple transformation like $X(x, y) = x^2$. Now, let's substitute this into the equation of $C_2$:\n\n$y^2 = (x^2)^5 + 2(x^2)$\n$y^2 = x^{10} + 2x^2$\n\nNow, let's find a transformation for $y$. We can try a transformation like $Y(x, y) = yx^3$. Now, let's substitute this into the equation of $C_1$:\n\n$(yx^3)^2 = x^3 + 1$\n$y^2x^6 = x^3 + 1$\n\nNow, let's substitute the transformation for $x$ into this equation:\n\n$y^2(x^2)^6 = (x^2)^3 + 1$\n$y^2x^{12} = x^6 + 1$\n\nComparing this equation with the equation we obtained for $C_2$ after substituting the transformation for $x$, we can see that they are the same if we multiply the equation for $C_2$ by $x^6$:\n\n$x^6(y^2) = x^6(x^{10} + 2x^2)$\n$y^2x^{12} = x^6 + 1$\n\nThus, the birational transformation that maps $C_1$ onto $C_2$ is given by:\n\n$(x, y) \\mapsto (X(x, y), Y(x, y)) = (x^2, yx^3)$"
