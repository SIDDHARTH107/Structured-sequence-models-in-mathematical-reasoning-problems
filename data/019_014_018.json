    "message_1": "If there are 10 sets, each containing 5 elements, and you take any 3 sets, what is the minimum number of unique elements that must be in each of the 3 sets?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of unique elements in the 3 sets, we can arrange the elements in such a way that there is maximum overlap between the sets. We can do this by having 4 common elements between each pair of sets and 1 unique element in each set. \n\nFor example, let's label the elements as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O. We can arrange the sets as follows:\n\nSet 1: A, B, C, D, E\nSet 2: A, B, C, D, F\nSet 3: A, B, C, D, G\nSet 4: A, B, C, D, H\nSet 5: A, B, C, D, I\nSet 6: E, F, G, H, I\nSet 7: E, F, G, H, J\nSet 8: E, F, G, H, K\nSet 9: E, F, G, H, L\nSet 10: E, F, G, H, M\n\nNow, if we take any 3 sets, the minimum number of unique elements will be 7. For example, if we take sets 1, 2, and 3, the unique elements are A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Similarly, if we take sets 1, 6, and 7, the unique elements are A, B, C, D, E, F, and J."
