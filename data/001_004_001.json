    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial completely, we look for two binomials whose product equals the given polynomial. We can use the factoring method known as \"factoring by grouping\" or simply find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (9) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (6).\n\nIn this case, the two numbers are 3 and 3, since 3 * 3 = 9 and 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial x^2 + 6x + 9 is:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 3) or (x + 3)^2"
