    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, if we raise an integer a to the power of a prime number p, and then divide the result by p, the remainder will be a.\n\nIn this case, we have a = 3 and p = 17 (which is a prime number). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, 3^17 ≡ 3 (mod 17).\n\nSo, the remainder when 3^17 is divided by 17 is 3."
