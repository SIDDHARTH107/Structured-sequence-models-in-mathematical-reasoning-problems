    "message_1": "What is the length of the Peano curve in the unit square?\n\nHint: The Peano curve is a fractal curve that fills a square with a side length of 1. It is defined by a recursive process where each segment is divided into three equal parts, and the middle part is replaced with two sides of a smaller equilateral triangle. The length of the curve is the limit of the sum of the lengths of these segments as the number of iterations approaches infinity.",
    "message_2": "The length of the Peano curve in the unit square is infinite. This is because, with each iteration, the curve becomes more complex and fills more of the square, but never overlaps itself. As the number of iterations approaches infinity, the curve will continue to fill the square, but its length will also continue to increase without bound."
