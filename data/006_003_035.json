    "message_2": "There are 4 kings in a standard deck of 52 cards (one king for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). The probability of drawing a king is the ratio of the number of kings to the total number of cards in the deck. \n\nProbability = (Number of kings) / (Total number of cards) = 4/52 = 1/13 â‰ˆ 0.0769 or 7.69%."
