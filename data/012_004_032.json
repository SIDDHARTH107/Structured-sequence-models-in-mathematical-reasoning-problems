    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (D-B, 1), (C-D, 3), (A-B, 4), (A-C, 5)\n\nNow, let's build the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge (D-B, 1) to the tree.\n```\n  A    B\n   \\  /\n    D\n```\n2. Add edge (C-D, 3) to the tree.\n```\n  A    B\n   \\  /\n    D\n     \\\n      C\n```\n3. Add edge (A-B, 4) to the tree. Adding this edge will not form a cycle.\n```\n     4\n  A----B\n   \\  /\n    D\n     \\\n      C\n```\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete, and its total weight is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8."
