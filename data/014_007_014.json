    "message_2": "To calculate the total number of possible keys for a stream cipher with a key length of 10 bits, we use the formula:\n\nNumber of possible keys = 2^key_length\n\nIn this case, the key length is 10 bits, so the number of possible keys is:\n\nNumber of possible keys = 2^10 = 1024\n\nNow, to calculate the number of possible encryption permutations for a plaintext message that is 56 bits long, we use the formula:\n\nNumber of possible encryption permutations = (Number of possible keys)^(plaintext_length/key_length)\n\nIn this case, the plaintext length is 56 bits, and the key length is 10 bits, so the number of possible encryption permutations is:\n\nNumber of possible encryption permutations = 1024^(56/10) ≈ 1024^5.6 ≈ 1.34 x 10^17\n\nSo, there are 1024 possible keys and approximately 1.34 x 10^17 possible encryption permutations that can be generated using this stream cipher."
