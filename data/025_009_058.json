    "message_2": "The given Weierstrass equation is of the form $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-t)$, which is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = (3-1)/2 = 1$. However, the problem asks for the dimension of the moduli space of smooth genus $3$ curves, which is not consistent with the given equation.\n\nIf we assume that the problem is asking for the dimension of the moduli space of smooth genus $1$ curves (elliptic curves) with the given Weierstrass equation, then we can proceed as follows:\n\nFor a smooth genus $1$ curve, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves and the isomorphism classes of their associated lattices in the complex plane. The moduli space of elliptic curves can be identified with the quotient space of the upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H}$ by the action of the modular group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H}$ is a two-dimensional space, and the action of the modular group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ has a fundamental domain of finite volume. Thus, the moduli space of smooth genus $1$ curves (elliptic curves) is a one-dimensional complex space, or equivalently, a two-dimensional real space.\n\nIn the case of the given Weierstrass equation, the parameter $t$ determines the isomorphism class of the elliptic curve. Therefore, the dimension of the moduli space of smooth genus $1$ curves with a fixed Weierstrass equation of the form $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-t)$, where $t$ is a non-zero complex number, is also one-dimensional complex space or two-dimensional real space."
