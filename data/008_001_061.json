    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the augmented matrix and row reduction (Gaussian elimination) method.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 3  2 -4 |  2 |\n\nNow, we will perform row reduction to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 (to have 1 as the first element):\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 3  2 -4 |  2 |\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1 + Row 2) and Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1 + Row 3):\n\n| 1 -1  2 | -1 |\n| 0  5 -5 |  7 |\n| 0  5 -10|  5 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 5:\n\n| 1 -1  2  | -1 |\n| 0  1 -1  |  7/5 |\n| 0  5 -10 |  5  |\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 3 with (-5 * Row 2 + Row 3):\n\n| 1 -1  2  | -1   |\n| 0  1 -1  |  7/5 |\n| 0  0  5  | -2   |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 5:\n\n| 1 -1  2  | -1   |\n| 0  1 -1  |  7/5 |\n| 0  0  1  | -2/5 |\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the last row, we have z = -2/5.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - z = 7/5, so y = 7/5 + (-2/5) = 1.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x - y + 2z = -1, so x = -1 + 1 - 2(-2/5) = -1 + 4/5 = -1/5.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1/5, y = 1, and z = -2/5."
