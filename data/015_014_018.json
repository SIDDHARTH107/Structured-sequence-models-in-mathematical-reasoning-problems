    "message_1": "Suppose a weather system exhibits chaotic behavior with a Lyapunov exponent of 0.084 inverse days. If you make a small change in the initial conditions of the system, how long will it take for the two trajectories to diverge by a factor of 10?",
    "message_2": "To determine the time it takes for the two trajectories to diverge by a factor of 10, we can use the formula:\n\nt = (1/λ) * ln(d)\n\nwhere t is the time, λ is the Lyapunov exponent (0.084 inverse days), d is the divergence factor (10), and ln is the natural logarithm.\n\nt = (1/0.084) * ln(10)\n\nt ≈ 11.90 days\n\nSo, it will take approximately 11.90 days for the two trajectories to diverge by a factor of 10."
