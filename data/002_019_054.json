    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cone, we need to find the sum of the base area and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe base area (A_base) of a cone can be found using the formula:\n\nA_base = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nThe lateral surface area (A_lateral) of a cone can be found using the formula:\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nl = √(r^2 + h^2)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\nr = 5 cm\nh = 12 cm\n\nl = √(5^2 + 12^2) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13 cm\n\nNow we can find the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_base = π * 5^2 = 25π cm^2\nA_lateral = π * 5 * 13 = 65π cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 25π + 65π = 90π cm^2\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is 90π cm^2, or approximately 282.74 cm^2."
