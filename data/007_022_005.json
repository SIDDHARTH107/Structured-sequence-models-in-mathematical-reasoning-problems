    "message_2": "To find the order of the point P(3, 7) on the elliptic curve y¬≤ = x¬≥ + 4x + 20 over the prime field ùîΩ‚Çö with p = 29, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that nP = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element in the group of points on the elliptic curve).\n\nWe will use the double-and-add algorithm to find the multiples of P until we reach the point at infinity. The algorithm involves point doubling and point addition on the elliptic curve.\n\nFirst, let's define the formulas for point doubling and point addition:\n\n1. Point doubling (2P = R):\n   x_R = (3x_P^2 + a) * (2y_P)^(-1) mod p\n   y_R = (2y_P * x_R - x_P^3 - a * x_P) mod p\n\n2. Point addition (P + Q = R):\n   x_R = (y_Q - y_P) * (x_Q - x_P)^(-1) mod p\n   y_R = (y_P * x_R - x_P * x_R - y_P) mod p\n\nNow, let's find the multiples of P:\n\n1. 2P:\n   x_R = (3 * 3^2 + 4) * (2 * 7)^(-1) mod 29\n   x_R = (81 + 4) * 14^(-1) mod 29\n   x_R = 85 * 14^(-1) mod 29\n   x_R = 27\n   y_R = (2 * 7 * 27 - 3^3 - 4 * 3) mod 29\n   y_R = (14 * 27 - 27 - 12) mod 29\n   y_R = 378 - 39 mod 29\n   y_R = 339 mod 29\n   y_R = 6\n   2P = (27, 6)\n\n2. 3P = P + 2P:\n   x_R = (6 - 7) * (27 - 3)^(-1) mod 29\n   x_R = (-1) * 24^(-1) mod 29\n   x_R = 28 * 24^(-1) mod 29\n   x_R = 28 * 25 mod 29\n   x_R = 700 mod 29\n   x_R = 15\n   y_R = (7 * 15 - 3 * 15 - 7) mod 29\n   y_R = 105 - 45 - 7 mod 29\n   y_R = 53 mod 29\n   y_R = 24\n   3P = (15, 24)\n\n3. 4P = 2P + 2P:\n   x_R = (6 - 6) * (27 - 27)^(-1) mod 29\n   This is undefined since the denominator is 0. Therefore, 4P = O (point at infinity).\n\nThus, the order of the point P(3, 7) on the elliptic curve y¬≤ = x¬≥ + 4x + 20 over the prime field ùîΩ‚Çö with p = 29 is 4."
