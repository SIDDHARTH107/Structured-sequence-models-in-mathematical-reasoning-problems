    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. We have a set of 6 objects, and we want to partition them into subsets of size 2 or 3.\n\nThere are two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Three subsets of size 2\nIn this case, we will have three pairs of objects. To find the number of ways to form these pairs, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFor the first pair, we have 6 objects to choose from, so the number of ways to form the first pair is:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15\n\nNow, we have 4 objects left. The number of ways to form the second pair is:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6\n\nFinally, we have 2 objects left, and they will form the last pair. There is only 1 way to do this.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to partition the set into three subsets of size 2 is:\n\n15 * 6 * 1 = 90\n\nHowever, we have to divide by 3! to account for the fact that the order of the pairs doesn't matter (i.e., we don't want to count the same partition multiple times):\n\n90 / 3! = 90 / 6 = 15\n\nCase 2: One subset of size 3 and one subset of size 2\nIn this case, we will have one subset of 3 objects and one subset of 2 objects. First, let's find the number of ways to form the subset of 3 objects:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20\n\nNow, we have 3 objects left. The number of ways to form the subset of 2 objects is:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3\n\nSo, the total number of ways to partition the set into one subset of size 3 and one subset of size 2 is:\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\nNow, we add the number of ways for both cases:\n\n15 (Case 1) + 60 (Case 2) = 75\n\nTherefore, there are 75 ways to partition a set of 6 objects into subsets of size 2 or 3."
