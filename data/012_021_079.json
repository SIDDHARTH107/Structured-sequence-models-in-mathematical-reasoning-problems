    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of the given graph, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find a tree decomposition of the graph.\n2. Calculate the size of the largest bag in the tree decomposition.\n3. Subtract 1 from the size of the largest bag to get the treewidth.\n\nA tree decomposition of the given graph can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Bag 1: {A, B, C}\n2. Bag 2: {B, C, D}\n3. Bag 3: {C, D, E}\n4. Bag 4: {D, E, F}\n5. Bag 5: {D, F, G}\n6. Bag 6: {D, G, H}\n\nThe tree decomposition looks like this:\n\n```\n  1\n  |\n  2\n / \\\n3   5\n|   |\n4   6\n```\n\nThe size of the largest bag in the tree decomposition is 3. Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
