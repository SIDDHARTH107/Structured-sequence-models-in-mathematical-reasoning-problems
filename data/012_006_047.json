    "message_2": "First, let's determine if the graph G is Eulerian or Hamiltonian.\n\nA graph is Eulerian if all its vertices have even degrees. Let's check the degrees of all vertices in graph G:\n\n- Vertex A: degree 3\n- Vertex B: degree 3\n- Vertex C: degree 3\n- Vertex D: degree 3\n- Vertex E: degree 4\n- Vertex F: degree 4\n\nSince not all vertices have even degrees, the graph G is not Eulerian.\n\nA graph is Hamiltonian if there exists a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in graph G:\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle is: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> A\n\nSo, the graph G is Hamiltonian, and the Hamiltonian cycle is A-B-C-D-E-F-A."
