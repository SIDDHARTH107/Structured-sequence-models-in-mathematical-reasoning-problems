    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between City A and City D, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the possible paths and their distances.\n\nThere are two possible paths from City A to City D:\n\n1. City A → City B → City D\n2. City A → City C → City D\n\nNow, let's calculate the distances for each path:\n\n1. City A → City B → City D:\n   City A to City B = 5\n   City B to City D = 6\n   Total distance = 5 + 6 = 11\n\n2. City A → City C → City D:\n   City A to City C = 8\n   City C to City D = 2\n   Total distance = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nComparing the total distances of both paths, we can see that the shortest distance between City A and City D is 10, which is the path City A → City C → City D."
