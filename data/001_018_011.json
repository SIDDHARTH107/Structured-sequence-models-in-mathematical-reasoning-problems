    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\log_2 (8x) - \\log_2 2 = 3$, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that $\\log_b a - \\log_b c = \\log_b \\frac{a}{c}$. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n$\\log_2 \\frac{8x}{2} = 3$\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the logarithm:\n\n$\\log_2 (4x) = 3$\n\nNext, we can use the property of logarithms that states that if $\\log_b a = c$, then $b^c = a$. In our case, this means that:\n\n$2^3 = 4x$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$8 = 4x$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n$x = \\frac{8}{4}$\n\n$x = 2$\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is $x = 2$."
