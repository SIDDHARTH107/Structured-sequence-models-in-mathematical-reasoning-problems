    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments that form an equilateral triangle with the removed segment. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet P_n be the perimeter of the curve after n iterations, and let s be the length of the original triangle's side (in this case, s = 6 units). The perimeter of the original triangle is P_0 = 3s.\n\nAfter the first iteration, each side of the original triangle is replaced by two segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side. So, the new perimeter is P_1 = 3 * (2 * (1/3) * s) = 2 * P_0.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 6 segments from the first iteration is replaced by two segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, the new perimeter is P_2 = 6 * (2 * (1/3) * (1/3) * s) = 4 * P_0.\n\nFollowing this pattern, we can see that the perimeter after the nth iteration is P_n = 2^n * P_0.\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter after the 4th iteration:\n\nP_4 = 2^4 * P_0 = 16 * (3 * s) = 16 * (3 * 6) = 16 * 18 = 288 units.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 4th iteration is approximately 288 units."
