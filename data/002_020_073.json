    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the pizza slice, we need to add the arc length and the two radii. The arc length is given as 5 cm, and the radius is given as 8 cm.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle of the pizza slice in radians. We can use the formula:\n\nArc length = radius × angle (in radians)\n\n5 cm = 8 cm × angle\n\nTo find the angle, divide the arc length by the radius:\n\nAngle = 5 cm / 8 cm = 0.625 radians\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the pizza slice. The perimeter consists of the arc length and the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2 × radius\n\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 2 × 8 cm\n\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 16 cm\n\nPerimeter = 21 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the pizza slice is 21 cm."
