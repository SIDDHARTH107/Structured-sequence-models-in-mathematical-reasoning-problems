Let $L$ be the lattice dual to $\\Lambda$, i.e., $L = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 : \\langle z , w\\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ for all } w\\in \\Lambda \\}$ where $\\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle$ is the dot product. \n\nIf $\\tau = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i$, determine a basis for $L$ and compute the volume of the fundamental domain $D$ of $\\Lambda$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find a basis for $\\Lambda$. Since $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z} + \\tau \\mathbb{Z}$, a basis for $\\Lambda$ is given by $\\{1, \\tau\\}$. Now, let's find a basis for the dual lattice $L$. Let $z = x + yi \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We want to find $z$ such that $\\langle z, w \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for all $w \\in \\Lambda$. In particular, we want to find $z$ such that $\\langle z, 1 \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\langle z, \\tau \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nFor $\\langle z, 1 \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nFor $\\langle z, \\tau \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $x(1) + y(\\sqrt{3}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nNow, let's find a basis for $L$. Let $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$ be elements of $L$. Then, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1. $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n2. $a(1) + b(\\sqrt{3}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n3. $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n4. $c(1) + d(\\sqrt{3}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2), we can see that $a = 0$ and $b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. From equations (3) and (4), we can see that $c = 1$ and $d = 0$. Therefore, a basis for $L$ is given by $\\{z_1, z_2\\} = \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}i, 1 \\right\\}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the volume of the fundamental domain $D$ of $\\Lambda$. The volume of $D$ is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the basis vectors of $\\Lambda$. In this case, the matrix is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & \\sqrt{3}i\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $(1)(\\sqrt{3}i) - (1)(0) = \\sqrt{3}i$. The absolute value of the determinant is $|\\sqrt{3}i| = \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the volume of the fundamental domain $D$ of $\\Lambda$ is $\\sqrt{3}$."
