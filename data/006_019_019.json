    "message_1": "In a country, a study shows that 60% of the population is in favor of a new policy. If a group of 500 individuals is selected at random from the population, what is the probability that at least 300 of them are in favor of the new policy?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of individuals selected), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of individuals in favor of the new policy), p is the probability of success (in this case, 60% or 0.6), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 300 individuals are in favor of the new policy, so we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 300, 301, ..., 500.\n\nP(X >= 300) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 300 to 500\n\nCalculating this sum directly would be computationally intensive, so we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of a binomial distribution are given by:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nFor our problem, μ = 500 * 0.6 = 300 and σ = sqrt(500 * 0.6 * 0.4) ≈ 9.798.\n\nNow, we can standardize the problem by finding the z-score for k = 299.5 (using the continuity correction):\n\nz = (299.5 - 300) / 9.798 ≈ -0.051\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability for a z-score of -0.051 is approximately 0.4801. Since we want the probability of at least 300 individuals in favor of the new policy, we need to find the area to the right of this z-score:\n\nP(X >= 300) ≈ 1 - 0.4801 = 0.5199\n\nSo, the probability that at least 300 individuals are in favor of the new policy is approximately 51.99%."
