    "message_2": "To find the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes formula, we need to use the following equation:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price\nX = strike price\nr = risk-free interest rate\nT = time to expiration (in years)\nN(d) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nσ = annual volatility of the stock price\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nS = $100\nX = $110\nr = 0.03\nT = 0.5 (6 months = 0.5 years)\nσ = 0.20\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.03 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = (ln(0.9091) + (0.03 + 0.02) * 0.5) / (0.20 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.025) / 0.1414\nd1 ≈ -0.497\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.497 - 0.20 * 0.7071\nd2 ≈ -0.638\n\nNow, we need to find the cumulative distribution function values N(d1) and N(d2). You can use a standard normal distribution table or an online calculator to find these values:\n\nN(-0.497) ≈ 0.3095\nN(-0.638) ≈ 0.2615\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option price:\n\nCall option price = 100 * 0.3095 - 110 * e^(-0.03 * 0.5) * 0.2615\nCall option price = 30.95 - 110 * 0.9851 * 0.2615\nCall option price ≈ 30.95 - 28.38\nCall option price ≈ $2.57\n\nSo, the price of the European call option with a strike price of $110 and an expiration date of 6 months is approximately $2.57."
