    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the permutation of the numbers 1 through 10 that was used to rearrange the letters of the plaintext \"MATHROCKS\" to obtain the ciphertext \"HKTSMOACRR\". \n\nFirst, let's write the plaintext and ciphertext in a table with 10 columns, since the key is a permutation of 1 to 10:\n\nPlaintext:\nM A T H R\nO C K S\n\nCiphertext:\nH K T S M\nO A C R R\n\nNow, we can compare the positions of the letters in the plaintext and ciphertext to find the key:\n\n1. M -> H (5th position)\n2. A -> K (2nd position)\n3. T -> T (3rd position)\n4. H -> S (4th position)\n5. R -> M (1st position)\n6. O -> O (6th position)\n7. C -> A (7th position)\n8. K -> C (9th position)\n9. S -> R (8th position)\n10.  -> R (10th position)\n\nSo, the key used to encrypt the plaintext is the permutation (5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 9, 8, 10)."
