    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 2, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 4x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule and the constant rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 4 = 0\n\nTo solve for x, we can first isolate the x^2 term:\n\nx^2 = 4/3\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nx = ±√(4/3)\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 2 are x = √(4/3) and x = -√(4/3)."
