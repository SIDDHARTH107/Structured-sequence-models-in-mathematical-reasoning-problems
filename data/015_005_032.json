    "message_2": "Calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a given dynamical system, such as the Rössler system, requires numerical methods and simulations. It is not possible to provide an exact answer using only the given parameters without running a simulation. However, I can provide you with a general approach to calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Rössler system.\n\n1. Define the Rössler system equations:\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\n2. Choose initial conditions for x, y, and z.\n\n3. Integrate the system of equations using a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, for a certain amount of time.\n\n4. Calculate the Jacobian matrix of the system and its eigenvalues.\n\n5. Calculate the Lyapunov exponents by taking the average of the logarithm of the absolute values of the eigenvalues over time.\n\n6. Identify the maximum Lyapunov exponent among the calculated exponents.\n\nTo obtain a specific value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent with the given parameters, you would need to perform these steps using a numerical software package or programming language."
