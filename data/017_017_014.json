    "message_2": "First, let's recall some definitions and theorems that will be useful in solving this problem:\n\n1. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be written as a power of g.\n2. A group G is abelian if the group operation is commutative, i.e., for all a, b in G, a * b = b * a.\n3. The dihedral group D_n is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon, and has order 2n. It is non-abelian for n â‰¥ 3.\n4. Sylow's Theorems: Let G be a group of order p^a * m, where p is a prime not dividing m. Then:\n   (a) G has a subgroup of order p^a (called a Sylow p-subgroup).\n   (b) All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate.\n   (c) The number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted n_p, divides m and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 30. Since 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, we can apply Sylow's Theorems to find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nFor p = 2, we have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. \n\nFor p = 3, we have a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. By Sylow's third theorem, n_3 divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n\nFor p = 5, we have a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. By Sylow's third theorem, n_5 divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nSince n_5 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5. By Sylow's second theorem, H is a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, if n_3 = 1, there would be a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say K, of order 3, and K would also be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for n_2 and n_3:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique normal subgroups of orders 2, 3, and 5. Since the orders of these subgroups are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is a cyclic group of order 30 (C30).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 or 15 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup K of order 3. Since |G| = 30 and |K| = 3, we have |G/K| = 10. By the Correspondence Theorem, G/K has a subgroup of order 5, say L/K. Then, L is a subgroup of G with |L| = 15. Since L has order 15, it must be cyclic (by the same argument as in Case 1). Thus, G contains a cyclic subgroup of index 2, which implies that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 or 15 and n_3 = 10\nIn this case, G has no unique normal Sylow subgroups other than H. This means that G cannot be isomorphic to C30 or D15, as both of these groups have unique normal subgroups of orders 2 and 3. Thus, G must be a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 30 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or a non-abelian group of order 30, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups it has."
