    "message_2": "According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. In other words, the remainder when a^(p-1) is divided by p is 1.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\na^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p)\n\nHowever, if a is divisible by p, then the remainder when a^(p-1) is divided by p is 0.\n\nSo, the remainder when a^(p-1) is divided by p is:\n\n1, if a is not divisible by p (i.e., gcd(a, p) = 1)\n0, if a is divisible by p (i.e., gcd(a, p) = p)"
