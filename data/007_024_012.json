    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer x such that $7^x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{13}$, we can use the brute force method by calculating the powers of 7 modulo 13 until we find the one that is congruent to 5.\n\n1. $7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}$\n2. $7^2 \\equiv 49 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\n3. $7^3 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 10 \\equiv 70 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$\n4. $7^4 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 8 \\equiv 56 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n5. $7^5 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 28 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$\n6. $7^6 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 14 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n7. $7^7 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}$\n\nNow, we can see that the powers of 7 are repeating modulo 13, so we won't find a power of 7 that is congruent to 5 modulo 13. Therefore, there is no smallest positive integer x such that $7^x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{13}$."
