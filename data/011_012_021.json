    "message_1": "A math student is arranging a dinner party and wants to create a menu using 5 dishes from a list of 10 options. How many possible menu combinations can the student create if they want to include at least 2 vegetarian options (assuming there are exactly 4 vegetarian dishes on the list)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We will consider three cases: having exactly 2, 3, or 4 vegetarian dishes in the menu.\n\nCase 1: 2 vegetarian dishes and 3 non-vegetarian dishes\nThere are 4 vegetarian dishes to choose from, so we can choose 2 in C(4,2) ways. There are 6 non-vegetarian dishes (10 total - 4 vegetarian), so we can choose 3 in C(6,3) ways. Therefore, there are C(4,2) * C(6,3) combinations in this case.\n\nCase 2: 3 vegetarian dishes and 2 non-vegetarian dishes\nWe can choose 3 vegetarian dishes in C(4,3) ways and 2 non-vegetarian dishes in C(6,2) ways. Therefore, there are C(4,3) * C(6,2) combinations in this case.\n\nCase 3: 4 vegetarian dishes and 1 non-vegetarian dish\nWe can choose all 4 vegetarian dishes in C(4,4) ways and 1 non-vegetarian dish in C(6,1) ways. Therefore, there are C(4,4) * C(6,1) combinations in this case.\n\nNow, we will calculate the combinations for each case and sum them up:\n\nCase 1: C(4,2) * C(6,3) = (4!/(2!2!)) * (6!/(3!3!)) = 6 * 20 = 120\nCase 2: C(4,3) * C(6,2) = (4!/(3!1!)) * (6!/(2!4!)) = 4 * 15 = 60\nCase 3: C(4,4) * C(6,1) = (4!/(4!0!)) * (6!/(1!5!)) = 1 * 6 = 6\n\nTotal combinations = 120 + 60 + 6 = 186\n\nSo, the student can create 186 possible menu combinations with at least 2 vegetarian options."
