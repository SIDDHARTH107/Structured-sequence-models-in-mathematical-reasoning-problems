Suppose H^1(X, ℤ) is a free abelian group of rank 5. \n\nWhat is the dimension of the vector space H^2(X, ℚ) of the second cohomology group of X with rational coefficients?",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of H^2(X, ℚ), we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology. The theorem states that for any topological space X and abelian group G, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H^1(X, ℤ), G) → H^2(X, G) → Hom(H^2(X, ℤ), G) → 0\n\nIn our case, G = ℚ (the rational numbers). Since ℚ is a divisible abelian group, the Ext group vanishes, i.e., Ext(H^1(X, ℤ), ℚ) = 0. Thus, the short exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → H^2(X, ℚ) → Hom(H^2(X, ℤ), ℚ) → 0\n\nThis implies that H^2(X, ℚ) is isomorphic to Hom(H^2(X, ℤ), ℚ). Therefore, the dimension of H^2(X, ℚ) is equal to the rank of H^2(X, ℤ).\n\nNow, we need to find the rank of H^2(X, ℤ). Since X is a complex projective variety of dimension 2, it is a compact Kähler manifold. For compact Kähler manifolds, the Hodge decomposition theorem holds. The theorem states that the cohomology groups can be decomposed into the direct sum of Hodge components:\n\nH^k(X, ℂ) = ⊕_{p+q=k} H^p,q(X)\n\nIn particular, for k = 2, we have:\n\nH^2(X, ℂ) = H^0,2(X) ⊕ H^1,1(X) ⊕ H^2,0(X)\n\nThe Betti numbers b^k are the dimensions of the cohomology groups with complex coefficients, i.e., b^2 = dim H^2(X, ℂ). The Hodge numbers h^p,q are the dimensions of the Hodge components, i.e., h^1,1 = dim H^1,1(X).\n\nBy the Hodge symmetry, h^p,q = h^q,p, so h^0,2 = h^2,0. The rank of H^2(X, ℤ) is equal to the Betti number b^2 minus twice the Hodge number h^0,2:\n\nrank(H^2(X, ℤ)) = b^2 - 2h^0,2\n\nSince X is a complex projective variety of dimension 2, the Betti numbers are even, and b^2 is even as well. Therefore, the rank of H^2(X, ℤ) is also even.\n\nNow, we know that H^1(X, ℤ) is a free abelian group of rank 5. By the Künneth formula, we have:\n\nH^2(X, ℤ) = H^1(X, ℤ) ⊗ H^1(X, ℤ) ⊕ H^0(X, ℤ) ⊗ H^2(X, ℤ) ⊕ H^2(X, ℤ) ⊗ H^0(X, ℤ)\n\nThe rank of H^2(X, ℤ) is the sum of the ranks of the tensor products on the right-hand side. Since H^0(X, ℤ) is a free abelian group of rank 1, the rank of H^2(X, ℤ) is:\n\nrank(H^2(X, ℤ)) = 5 * 5 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 25 + 1 + 1 = 27\n\nFinally, the dimension of H^2(X, ℚ) is equal to the rank of H^2(X, ℤ), which is 27."
