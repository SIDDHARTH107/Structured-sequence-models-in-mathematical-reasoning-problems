    "message_2": "To construct the Morse-Smale complex for the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x on the interval [-2, 2], we first need to find the critical points of the function. The critical points are the points where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) is:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 3\n\nSetting f'(x) to 0, we get:\n3x^2 - 3 = 0\nx^2 = 1\nx = Â±1\n\nSo, we have two critical points: x = -1 and x = 1.\n\nNow, we need to determine the index of each critical point. The index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix for f(x) is a 1x1 matrix, as it is a one-dimensional function. The second derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf''(x) = 6x\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nf''(-1) = -6 (negative, so index 1)\nf''(1) = 6 (positive, so index 0)\n\nThus, we have two index pairs: (-1, 1) and (1, 0).\n\nFor the Morse-Smale complex, we have the following cells:\n\n- 0-cells: Two critical points (x = -1 and x = 1)\n- 1-cells: One interval connecting the two critical points\n\nIn summary, the constructed Morse-Smale complex has 2 critical points, 2 index pairs, and 3 cells (2 0-cells and 1 1-cell)."
