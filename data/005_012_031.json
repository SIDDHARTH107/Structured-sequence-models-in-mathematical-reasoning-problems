    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average number of hours its employees work in a week. They have a population of 100 employees. How many employees should be included in the sample to estimate the average number of hours worked per week with a 95% confidence interval and a margin of error of 2 hours?",
    "message_2": "To determine the sample size needed for a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 2 hours, we need to use the following formula:\n\nn = (Z^2 * σ^2) / E^2\n\nwhere:\nn = sample size\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96)\nσ = population standard deviation (unknown)\nE = margin of error (2 hours)\n\nSince we don't know the population standard deviation (σ), we can use an estimate or a pilot study to get an approximate value. If no information is available, a conservative approach is to assume the maximum possible standard deviation, which is half of the range of the data. In this case, let's assume a reasonable range of hours worked per week is between 20 and 60 hours. Therefore, the range is 40 hours, and half of that is 20 hours. We will use 20 hours as our estimated standard deviation.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 20^2) / 2^2\nn = (3.8416 * 400) / 4\nn = 1536.64 / 4\nn = 384.16\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an employee, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company should include 385 employees in the sample to estimate the average number of hours worked per week with a 95% confidence interval and a margin of error of 2 hours.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the company only has 100 employees, so it would be best to survey all 100 employees in this case. The sample size calculation is more relevant when dealing with larger populations where it's not feasible to survey everyone."
