    "message_1": "A company makes smartphones and the probability of a battery failure is 0.03. If the company produces 10,000 smartphones, what is the probability that at least 300 will have battery failure?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k battery failures\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a single battery failure (0.03)\n- n is the total number of smartphones produced (10,000)\n- k is the number of battery failures\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 300 battery failures, which means we need to find the probability of 300 failures, 301 failures, 302 failures, and so on, up to 10,000 failures. To do this, we can find the complementary probability (the probability of having fewer than 300 failures) and subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of having fewer than 300 failures:\n\nP(X < 300) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 299)\n\nCalculating all these probabilities individually would be very time-consuming, so we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The normal distribution is defined by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), which for a binomial distribution are:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nIn our case:\n\nμ = 10,000 * 0.03 = 300\nσ = sqrt(10,000 * 0.03 * (1-0.03)) ≈ 16.93\n\nNow we can use the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability of having fewer than 300 failures:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor X = 299.5 (we use 299.5 instead of 300 to account for continuity correction):\n\nZ = (299.5 - 300) / 16.93 ≈ -0.03\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the probability for Z = -0.03:\n\nP(Z = -0.03) ≈ 0.488\n\nNow we can find the probability of having at least 300 failures:\n\nP(X ≥ 300) = 1 - P(X < 300) = 1 - 0.488 ≈ 0.512\n\nSo, the probability that at least 300 smartphones will have battery failure is approximately 0.512 or 51.2%."
