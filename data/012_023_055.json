    "message_2": "A complete subgraph is a subgraph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In other words, it is a clique. The maximum size of a complete subgraph is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph G, we can observe the following cliques:\n\n1. Triangle formed by vertices A, B, and C.\n2. Triangle formed by vertices D, E, and F.\n\nThere are no larger cliques in the graph. Therefore, the maximum size of a complete subgraph of G is 3, which corresponds to the two triangles mentioned above."
