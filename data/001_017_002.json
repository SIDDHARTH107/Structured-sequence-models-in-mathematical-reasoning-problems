    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 5) - log(2x - 1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog((x + 5)/(2x - 1)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form. Since the logarithm is base 10 by default, we can write:\n\n10^2 = (x + 5)/(2x - 1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n100 = (x + 5)/(2x - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (2x - 1):\n\n100(2x - 1) = x + 5\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n200x - 100 = x + 5\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n199x - 100 = 5\n\nAdding 100 to both sides, we get:\n\n199x = 105\n\nFinally, dividing by 199, we get:\n\nx = 105/199\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = 105/199"
