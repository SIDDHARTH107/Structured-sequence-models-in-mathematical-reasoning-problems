    "message_2": "Kuratowski's theorem states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is homeomorphic to either the complete graph K5 or the complete bipartite graph K3,3.\n\nFirst, let's use Euler's formula for planar graphs to check if the graph could potentially be planar. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have V = 10 and E = 18. We want to find the maximum number of faces F that a planar graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges can have.\n\nAccording to the theorem, in a planar graph, E ≤ 3V - 6. Let's check if our graph satisfies this condition:\n\n18 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n18 ≤ 30 - 6\n18 ≤ 24\n\nSince 18 ≤ 24, our graph could potentially be planar. However, we still need to check if it contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3.\n\nFor a graph to have a subgraph homeomorphic to K5, it must have at least 5 vertices with a degree of 4 or more. In our case, the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph can be calculated using the Handshaking lemma:\n\n2E = Σ(deg(v))\n\nwhere deg(v) is the degree of vertex v. For our graph:\n\n2 * 18 = Σ(deg(v))\n\nSince the sum of all vertex degrees is 36, it is impossible for the graph to have 5 vertices with a degree of 4 or more, as that would require the sum of degrees to be at least 5 * 4 = 20. Therefore, our graph cannot contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5.\n\nNow let's check for K3,3. A graph with a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3 must have at least 6 vertices with a degree of 3 or more. In our case, the maximum number of vertices with a degree of 3 or more is:\n\n36 / 3 = 12\n\nSince our graph has only 10 vertices, it is impossible for it to contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3.\n\nSince our graph does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3, and it satisfies Euler's formula for planar graphs, we can conclude that the graph G with 10 vertices and 18 edges is planar."
