    "message_1": "A 2 kg mass is attached to a spring with a stiffness of 50 N/m. Initially, the mass is at rest at its equilibrium position. Suddenly, the mass is given an initial displacement of 0.3 m from the equilibrium position and is released from rest. Assume there is no damping present. \n\nDetermine the position function of the mass in meters as a function of time in seconds. Also, find the period of oscillation and its frequency.",
    "message_2": "To determine the position function of the mass, we will use the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the position of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nGiven the initial conditions, the mass is at rest at its equilibrium position, so the initial displacement is A = 0.3 m. Since the mass is released from rest, the initial velocity is 0, and the phase angle φ = 0. \n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency ω. The equation for angular frequency in a spring-mass system is:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring stiffness (50 N/m) and m is the mass (2 kg). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(50/2) = sqrt(25) = 5 rad/s\n\nNow we can write the position function as:\n\nx(t) = 0.3 * cos(5t)\n\nTo find the period of oscillation (T), we use the equation:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value of ω, we get:\n\nT = 2π/5 ≈ 1.2566 s\n\nFinally, to find the frequency (f) of oscillation, we use the equation:\n\nf = 1/T\n\nPlugging in the value of T, we get:\n\nf ≈ 1/1.2566 ≈ 0.7958 Hz\n\nIn summary, the position function of the mass is x(t) = 0.3 * cos(5t) meters, the period of oscillation is approximately 1.2566 seconds, and the frequency is approximately 0.7958 Hz."
