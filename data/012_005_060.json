    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum number of edges that a connected graph with 8 vertices can have. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has n - 1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. So, a tree with 8 vertices has 8 - 1 = 7 edges.\n\nSince our graph G has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges for a connected graph with 8 vertices, we can assume that G is connected. If G is not connected, the diameter would be infinite.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum and minimum possible diameters for a connected graph with 8 vertices:\n\n1. Maximum diameter: This occurs when the graph is a tree with a \"chain\" structure, where each vertex is connected to at most two other vertices, and the vertices are arranged in a line. In this case, the diameter is 7, as there are 7 edges between the two farthest vertices.\n\n2. Minimum diameter: This occurs when the graph is a complete graph, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the diameter is 1, as there is always a direct edge between any two vertices.\n\nSince our graph G has 10 edges, it is not a complete graph (a complete graph with 8 vertices would have 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28 edges). Therefore, the diameter of G must be greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the diameter is 2. This means that for any two vertices, there is either a direct edge between them or there is a common neighbor vertex connected to both of them. In this case, we can construct a graph with 8 vertices and a diameter of 2 using fewer than 10 edges. For example, consider a graph where one central vertex is connected to all other 7 vertices, and there are no other edges. This graph has 7 edges and a diameter of 2.\n\nHowever, our graph G has 10 edges, which means that there must be additional edges between the other vertices. Adding these edges will only decrease the diameter, so the diameter of G must be 2 or less.\n\nSince we already established that the diameter of G is greater than 1, we can conclude that the diameter of the graph G is 2."
