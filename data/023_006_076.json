    "message_2": "To determine the frequency spectrum of the given signal x(t) = 5cos(2πt) + 8sin(4πt) using Fourier analysis, we can express the signal as a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nThe given signal can be represented in the frequency domain as:\n\nX(f) = A1 * δ(f - f1) + A2 * δ(f - f2)\n\nwhere A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of the sinusoids, f1 and f2 are their respective frequencies, and δ(f) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nIn this case, the signal x(t) has two sinusoids:\n\n1. A cosine function with amplitude A1 = 5 and frequency f1 = 1 Hz (since 2πt has a frequency of 1 Hz)\n2. A sine function with amplitude A2 = 8 and frequency f2 = 2 Hz (since 4πt has a frequency of 2 Hz)\n\nSo, the frequency spectrum of the signal x(t) can be represented as:\n\nX(f) = 5 * δ(f - 1) + 8 * δ(f - 2)\n\nThis means that the signal has two frequency components: one at 1 Hz with an amplitude of 5, and another at 2 Hz with an amplitude of 8."
