    "message_2": "To find the median of the given data set, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order: 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20\n2. Determine the number of data points (n): There are 10 data points in this set.\n3. Since there is an even number of data points, the median will be the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe two middle values are the 5th and 6th values in the ordered data set, which are 12 and 13.\n\nMedian = (12 + 13) / 2 = 25 / 2 = 12.5\n\nThe median of the given data set is 12.5."
