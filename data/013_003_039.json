    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $100 and must propose a division of the money with Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the proposal, the money is divided accordingly. If Player 2 rejects the proposal, both players receive $0. What is the smallest percentage that Player 1 can offer to Player 2 in order for Player 2 to accept the proposal?",
    "message_2": "In an Ultimatum Game, the smallest percentage that Player 1 can offer to Player 2 in order for Player 2 to accept the proposal depends on the rationality and preferences of Player 2. \n\nIn a purely rational scenario, Player 2 should accept any offer greater than $0, as receiving any amount of money is better than receiving nothing. In this case, the smallest percentage Player 1 can offer is just above 0% (e.g., 0.01%), which would result in Player 2 receiving a very small amount of money but still more than $0.\n\nHowever, in real-life situations, people may have different preferences and may reject offers that they perceive as unfair. In such cases, the smallest percentage that Player 1 can offer to Player 2 would depend on Player 2's individual preferences and their tolerance for perceived unfairness."
