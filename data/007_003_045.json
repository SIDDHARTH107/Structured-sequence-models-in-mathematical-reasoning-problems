    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 37^75 is divided by 13, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. First, let's find the remainder when 37 is divided by 13:\n\n37 ≡ 11 (mod 13)\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when 11^75 is divided by 13. To do this, we can use the property of modular exponentiation, which states that (a^m)^n ≡ a^(m*n) (mod p). We can rewrite 11^75 as (11^3)^25. So, let's find the remainder when 11^3 is divided by 13:\n\n11^3 = 1331\n\n1331 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n\nNow we have (11^3)^25 ≡ 3^25 (mod 13). We can rewrite 3^25 as (3^5)^5. So, let's find the remainder when 3^5 is divided by 13:\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n243 ≡ 5 (mod 13)\n\nNow we have (3^5)^5 ≡ 5^5 (mod 13). Let's find the remainder when 5^5 is divided by 13:\n\n5^5 = 3125\n\n3125 ≡ 8 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 37^75 is divided by 13 is 8."
