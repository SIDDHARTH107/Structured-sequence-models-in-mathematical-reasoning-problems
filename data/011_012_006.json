    "message_1": "There are 30 students in a class. 18 students take music lessons, 12 students take dance lessons and 8 students take both music and dance lessons. What is the total number of students who do not take either music or dance lessons?",
    "message_2": "We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal number of students = Number of students taking music lessons + Number of students taking dance lessons - Number of students taking both music and dance lessons\n\nTotal number of students = 18 (music) + 12 (dance) - 8 (both)\n\nTotal number of students = 30\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students who do not take either music or dance lessons.\n\nNumber of students who do not take either music or dance lessons = Total number of students - Total number of students taking music or dance lessons\n\nNumber of students who do not take either music or dance lessons = 30 - (18 + 12 - 8)\n\nNumber of students who do not take either music or dance lessons = 30 - 22\n\nNumber of students who do not take either music or dance lessons = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 students who do not take either music or dance lessons."
