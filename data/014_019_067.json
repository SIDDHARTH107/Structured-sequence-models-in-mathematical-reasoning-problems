    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 6x6 matrix that has been filled with the English letters in a row-wise fashion, except for two cells which are left empty. If this matrix is used to encode a message using a transposition cipher, how many possible ways are there to fill the two empty cells such that the resulting message is still decodable?",
    "message_2": "In a 6x6 matrix, there are a total of 36 cells. Since two cells are left empty, there are 34 cells filled with English letters. There are 26 English letters, so 8 of them will be repeated twice in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's consider the two empty cells. We have two cases:\n\n1. The two empty cells are in the same row or column.\n2. The two empty cells are not in the same row or column.\n\nCase 1: The two empty cells are in the same row or column.\nThere are 6 rows and 6 columns, so there are 12 possible ways for the two empty cells to be in the same row or column. In this case, we can fill the two empty cells with any of the 8 letters that are repeated twice in the matrix. So, there are 12 * 8 = 96 ways for this case.\n\nCase 2: The two empty cells are not in the same row or column.\nThere are a total of C(36, 2) = 630 ways to choose 2 cells out of 36. We have already considered 12 ways in Case 1, so there are 630 - 12 = 618 ways for the two empty cells to not be in the same row or column. In this case, we can fill the two empty cells with any of the 8 letters that are repeated twice in the matrix, but we need to make sure that we don't use the same letter for both empty cells (otherwise, the message would not be decodable). So, there are 8 * 7 = 56 ways to fill the two empty cells for each of the 618 possibilities. Hence, there are 618 * 56 = 34,608 ways for this case.\n\nAdding the number of ways from both cases, we get a total of 96 + 34,608 = 34,704 possible ways to fill the two empty cells such that the resulting message is still decodable."
