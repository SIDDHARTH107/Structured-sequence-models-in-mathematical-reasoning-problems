    "message_2": "To solve Laplace's equation for the electric potential in a 2-dimensional rectangular region, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let the dimensions of the rectangle be 6 units along the x-axis and 8 units along the y-axis. Let the electric potential be V(x, y).\n\nLaplace's equation in 2D is given by:\n\n∇²V(x, y) = ∂²V/∂x² + ∂²V/∂y² = 0\n\nWe assume a solution of the form V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Substituting this into Laplace's equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = k²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - k²Y(y) = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get the general solutions:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. V(0, y) = 10: X(0)Y(y) = 10 => A*C*cosh(ky) = 10\n2. V(6, y) = 0: X(6)Y(y) = 0 => (A*cos(6k) + B*sin(6k))(C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)) = 0\n3. ∂V/∂x(0, y) = 2: X'(0)Y(y) = 2 => B*C*cosh(ky) = 2\n4. ∂V/∂x(6, y) = 2: X'(6)Y(y) = 2 => (-6A*sin(6k) + 6B*cos(6k))(C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)) = 2\n\nFrom boundary condition 1, we have A*C = 10. From boundary condition 3, we have B*C = 2. Thus, A = 5B.\n\nNow, we need to satisfy boundary conditions 2 and 4. Since the product of the X and Y functions is zero, one of them must be zero. The only way to satisfy this is by having B*sin(6k) = 0. This implies that k = n*pi/6, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, we can write the solution as a sum of solutions for each value of n:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ[(5B_n*cos(n*pi*x/6) + B_n*sin(n*pi*x/6))*(C_n*cosh(n*pi*y/6) + D_n*sinh(n*pi*y/6))]\n\nWe can determine the coefficients B_n, C_n, and D_n by using the boundary conditions and orthogonality relations. However, this process is quite involved and requires advanced techniques in Fourier analysis.\n\nIn summary, the solution to Laplace's equation for the given boundary conditions can be expressed as an infinite series involving trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The coefficients in the series can be determined using Fourier analysis techniques."
