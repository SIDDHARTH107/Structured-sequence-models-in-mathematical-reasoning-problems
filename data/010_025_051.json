    "message_2": "To determine the Euler characteristic of the closed surface S obtained by identifying opposite edges of a regular octagon, we first need to understand how the surface is formed.\n\nWhen we identify opposite edges of a regular octagon, we are essentially \"gluing\" them together. Let's label the edges of the octagon as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with A being opposite to E, B opposite to F, C opposite to G, and D opposite to H.\n\nWhen we glue the edges together, we get the following identifications:\n\n1. A and E are glued together, forming a single edge AE.\n2. B and F are glued together, forming a single edge BF.\n3. C and G are glued together, forming a single edge CG.\n4. D and H are glued together, forming a single edge DH.\n\nNow, let's analyze the vertices. When we glue the edges together, some vertices will also be identified:\n\n1. Vertex 1 (where A and B meet) will be identified with vertex 5 (where E and F meet).\n2. Vertex 2 (where B and C meet) will be identified with vertex 6 (where F and G meet).\n3. Vertex 3 (where C and D meet) will be identified with vertex 7 (where G and H meet).\n4. Vertex 4 (where D and A meet) will be identified with vertex 8 (where H and E meet).\n\nSo, we have 4 vertices, 4 edges, and 1 face (the octagon itself).\n\nThe Euler characteristic χ is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 4, E = 4, and F = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = 4 - 4 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the closed surface S obtained by identifying opposite edges of a regular octagon is 1."
