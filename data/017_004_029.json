    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can apply the Sylow theorems. Let n_5 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, we have that n_5 divides the order of G and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. \n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of G. By the second Sylow theorem, H is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is cyclic. Thus, G has a normal cyclic subgroup of order 5. \n\nNow, let g be an element of G that is not in H. Then, the order of g must divide the order of G, which is 25. Since g is not in H, the order of g cannot be 5. The only other possibility is that the order of g is 25. In this case, G is cyclic, generated by g.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nIn this case, there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Each of these subgroups has order 5 and has 4 non-identity elements. Since the total number of non-identity elements in all Sylow 5-subgroups is 25 * 4 = 100, and there are only 24 non-identity elements in G, there must be some overlap between these subgroups. \n\nLet H and K be two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of G with non-empty intersection. Since both H and K are cyclic of order 5, their intersection must be a subgroup of order 1 or 5. If their intersection has order 5, then H = K, which contradicts our assumption that H and K are distinct. Therefore, their intersection must have order 1, which means that H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the set HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Since H and K are both cyclic of order 5, |HK| = |H| * |K| = 5 * 5 = 25. Moreover, since H ∩ K = {e}, the elements of HK are distinct, and thus HK = G. \n\nDefine a map φ: H × K → G by φ(h, k) = hk. This map is clearly surjective since HK = G. To show that φ is injective, suppose that φ(h1, k1) = φ(h2, k2), i.e., h1k1 = h2k2. Then, h1 = h2(k2k1^(-1)). Since h1 and h2 are in H and k2k1^(-1) is in K, this implies that h1 = h2 and k1 = k2, as H ∩ K = {e}. Therefore, φ is injective.\n\nSince φ is a bijective map, G is isomorphic to H × K, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
