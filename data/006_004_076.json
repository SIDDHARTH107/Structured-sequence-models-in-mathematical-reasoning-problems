    "message_1": "If a spinner has 8 sections, where 3 are red, 2 are blue, and 3 are green, what is the probability of landing on a blue section?",
    "message_2": "The probability of landing on a blue section can be calculated by dividing the number of blue sections by the total number of sections. In this case, there are 2 blue sections and 8 total sections. So, the probability is:\n\n2 (blue sections) / 8 (total sections) = 1/4 or 0.25\n\nTherefore, the probability of landing on a blue section is 1/4 or 25%."
