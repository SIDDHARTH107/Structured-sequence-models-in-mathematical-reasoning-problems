    "message_1": "A crate is being pulled along a straight line by a force given by F(x) = 5x^2, where x is the distance in meters. The crate starts from rest at position x = 0 and moves to x = 2 meters. Find the work done by the force.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to integrate the force function F(x) with respect to x over the interval [0, 2]. The work done is given by the formula:\n\nW = ∫(F(x) dx) from 0 to 2\n\nIn this case, F(x) = 5x^2. So we need to integrate 5x^2 with respect to x:\n\nW = ∫(5x^2 dx) from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate 5x^2, we use the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1). Applying this rule, we get:\n\nW = (5x^3)/3 + C\n\nNow we need to evaluate this integral from 0 to 2:\n\nW = [(5(2)^3)/3] - [(5(0)^3)/3]\n\nW = [(5(8))/3] - [0]\n\nW = 40/3\n\nSo the work done by the force to move the crate from x = 0 to x = 2 meters is 40/3 Joules."
