    "message_2": "Let's first recall some definitions and facts:\n\n1. A smooth projective algebraic curve X is a one-dimensional smooth projective variety.\n2. The genus g of a curve X is a topological invariant, which can be computed as g = (d-1)(d-2)/2, where d is the degree of the curve.\n3. A pencil of rational curves on X is a linear system of divisors of the form |D + tE|, where D and E are divisors on X, and t is a parameter.\n4. The base locus of a pencil F is the set of points in X where all the divisors in F have a common component.\n5. The compactified base locus is the closure of the base locus in the projective space containing X.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem:\n\nGiven that X is a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus 5, we can compute the degree d of the curve using the formula g = (d-1)(d-2)/2:\n\n5 = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n10 = (d-1)(d-2)\n\nBy solving this quadratic equation, we find that d = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the pencil F of rational curves on X. Since the curves in F are rational, they have genus 0. The intersection of a curve in F with X imposes (d-1) = 3 conditions on the curve. Therefore, the dimension of the space of rational curves meeting X in 3 points is 3.\n\nThe base locus of F consists of the points where all the divisors in F have a common component. Since the dimension of the space of rational curves meeting X in 3 points is 3, the base locus of F is a 0-dimensional subscheme of X.\n\nTo compute the number of irreducible components of the compactified base locus of F, we need to find the number of points in this 0-dimensional subscheme. This can be done using the intersection number of X with a general curve in F.\n\nLet C be a general curve in F. Since C is rational, it has degree 1. The intersection number of X and C is given by the product of their degrees: I(X, C) = 4 * 1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the compactified base locus of F has 4 irreducible components."
