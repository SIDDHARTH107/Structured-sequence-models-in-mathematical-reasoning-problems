    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\n\nz = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\n\nz = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, we know that the solutions will be complex numbers. We can rewrite the square root of -36 as:\n\n√(-36) = √(36 * -1) = 6√(-1) = 6i\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the formula:\n\nz = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nz = (-2 ± 3i)\n\nSo, the two complex solutions for the equation z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0 are:\n\nz = -2 + 3i and z = -2 - 3i"
