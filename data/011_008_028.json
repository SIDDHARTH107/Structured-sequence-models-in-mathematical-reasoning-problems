    "message_2": "In a sports tournament with 10 teams, where each team plays against every other team exactly once, we can use the formula for combinations to find the total number of matches played. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams, k is the number of teams in each match (which is 2 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 2. So, we have:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9 × 8!)/(2 × 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9)/(2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 90/2\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there will be a total of 45 matches played in the tournament."
