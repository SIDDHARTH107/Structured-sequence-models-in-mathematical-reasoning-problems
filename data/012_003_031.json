Find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected such that no two selected vertices are adjacent (i.e form an edge).\n\n[Graph G is a simple graph with six vertices and seven edges: Vertex set= {A, B, C, D, E, F}. Edge set= {(A, B), (A, D), (B, C), (C, D), (C, F), (D, E), (E, F)}.]",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected such that no two selected vertices are adjacent, we can use the greedy coloring algorithm. We will color the vertices with different colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The minimum number of colors required to color the graph is the chromatic number. The maximum number of vertices that can be selected without having adjacent vertices will be equal to the number of vertices with the least frequent color.\n\nLet's color the vertices of graph G:\n\n1. Color A with color 1.\n2. Color B with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A).\n3. Color C with color 1 (since it's adjacent to B but not A).\n4. Color D with color 2 (since it's adjacent to A and C).\n5. Color E with color 1 (since it's adjacent to D but not C).\n6. Color F with color 2 (since it's adjacent to C and E).\n\nNow we have colored the graph with two colors: color 1 (A, C, E) and color 2 (B, D, F). The least frequent color appears 3 times, so the maximum number of vertices that can be selected without having adjacent vertices is 3."
