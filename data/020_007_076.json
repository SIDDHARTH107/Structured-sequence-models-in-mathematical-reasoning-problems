    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company needs to transport 120 boxes from location A to location B. Each box weighs either 50 kg or 75 kg. The company can only transport 3000 kg of boxes in one trip. How many trips are required to transport all the boxes, assuming that the company wants to minimize the number of trips?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of trips, the company should try to transport as many 50 kg boxes as possible in each trip, since they are lighter.\n\nLet's denote the number of 50 kg boxes as x and the number of 75 kg boxes as y. We know that x + y = 120.\n\nIn one trip, the company can transport a maximum of 3000 kg. So, the total weight of the boxes in one trip should be less than or equal to 3000 kg. This can be represented as 50x + 75y â‰¤ 3000.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of 50 kg boxes (x) that can be transported in one trip. We can start by assuming all boxes are 50 kg and then adjust the number of 75 kg boxes (y) accordingly.\n\nIf all boxes are 50 kg, the total weight would be 50 * 120 = 6000 kg. This is more than the 3000 kg limit, so we need to replace some 50 kg boxes with 75 kg boxes.\n\nFor every 50 kg box replaced with a 75 kg box, we save 25 kg. To reduce the total weight from 6000 kg to 3000 kg, we need to save 6000 - 3000 = 3000 kg. \n\nDividing the weight to be saved by the weight saved per box replacement, we get 3000 / 25 = 120 boxes. However, this would mean replacing all 120 boxes with 75 kg boxes, which is not possible since we know there are both 50 kg and 75 kg boxes.\n\nInstead, let's try to find the maximum number of 50 kg boxes that can be transported in one trip. We can do this by iteratively replacing 50 kg boxes with 75 kg boxes and checking if the total weight is within the 3000 kg limit.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that the maximum number of 50 kg boxes that can be transported in one trip is 20, with the remaining 20 boxes being 75 kg boxes. This gives a total weight of 20 * 50 + 20 * 75 = 2500 kg, which is within the 3000 kg limit.\n\nSince we can transport 40 boxes in one trip, we will need 120 / 40 = 3 trips to transport all the boxes."
