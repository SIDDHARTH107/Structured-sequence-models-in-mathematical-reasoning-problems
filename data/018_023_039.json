    "message_2": "First, let's compute the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's compute (A △ B) △ {2}:\n\n(A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 3} △ {2}\n\nThe symmetric difference of {1, 3} and {2} is the set of elements that are in either {1, 3} or {2}, but not in both:\n\n(A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNext, let's compute B △ {2}:\n\nB △ {2} = {2, 3} △ {2}\n\nThe symmetric difference of {2, 3} and {2} is the set of elements that are in either {2, 3} or {2}, but not in both:\n\nB △ {2} = {3}\n\nNow, let's compute A △ (B △ {2}):\n\nA △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2} △ {3}\n\nThe symmetric difference of {1, 2} and {3} is the set of elements that are in either {1, 2} or {3}, but not in both:\n\nA △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2, 3}\n\nComparing the two results:\n\n(A △ B) △ {2} = {1, 2, 3}\nA △ (B △ {2}) = {1, 2, 3}\n\nThe two results are equal, which means that the symmetric difference is associative with respect to the Cartesian product in this case. However, it is important to note that this does not prove that the symmetric difference is always associative with respect to the Cartesian product. This is just a specific example where it happens to be associative."
