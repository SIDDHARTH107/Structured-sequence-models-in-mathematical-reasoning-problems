    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of edges in a knot with 9 crossings, we can use the concept of \"alternating knots\" and the \"crossing number\" of a knot. An alternating knot is a knot that can be represented by a diagram in which the crossings alternate between over and under as we traverse the knot. The crossing number of a knot is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram representing the knot.\n\nFor alternating knots, there is a relationship between the number of crossings and the number of edges, given by the formula:\n\nE = 3C + 2\n\nwhere E is the number of edges and C is the number of crossings.\n\nSince we are given a knot with 9 crossings, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nE = 3(9) + 2\nE = 27 + 2\nE = 29\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges in a knot with 9 crossings is 29."
