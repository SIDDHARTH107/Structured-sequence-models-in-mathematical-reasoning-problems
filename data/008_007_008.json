    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[-2 - λ, 1], [4, 3 - λ]]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (-2 - λ)(3 - λ) - (1)(4) = λ^2 - λ - 6\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - λ - 6 = 0\n\nThis equation factors as (λ - 3)(λ + 2) = 0, so the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = -2.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - 3I)v1 = 0\n[[-5, 1], [4, 0]]v1 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get -5x + y = 0, which implies y = 5x. Let x = 1, then y = 5. So, the eigenvector v1 = [1, 5].\n\nFor λ2 = -2:\n\n(A + 2I)v2 = 0\n[[0, 1], [4, 5]]v2 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we get y = 0. Substituting this into the second row, we get 4x = 0, which implies x = 0. However, the eigenvector cannot be the zero vector, so there is an inconsistency in this case. The matrix A is not diagonalizable.\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = -2, with eigenvector v1 = [1, 5] corresponding to λ1 = 3. However, the matrix A cannot be diagonalized as there is no eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = -2."
