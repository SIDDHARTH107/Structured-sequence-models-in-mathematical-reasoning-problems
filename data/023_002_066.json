    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x in the interval [-π, π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0.\n\nThe Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity, and\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = (1/(2π)) * [x^2/2](-π, π) = 0\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sin(nx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = -(1/n) * cos(nx).\n\n∫ x * sin(nx) dx = -x * (1/n) * cos(nx) - ∫ -(1/n) * cos(nx) dx\n= -x * (1/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-x * (1/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)](-π, π)\n= (1/π) * [2 * (1/n) * cos(nπ) - 0]\n= (1/π) * [2 * (1/n) * (-1)^n]\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = x in the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(1/π) * [2 * (1/n) * (-1)^n] * sin(nx)]\n\nThe series converges pointwise for all x in the interval [-π, π] because f(x) is a piecewise smooth function. However, the convergence is not uniform due to the discontinuity of the function at the endpoints of the interval."
