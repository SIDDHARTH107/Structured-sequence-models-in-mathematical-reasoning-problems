    "message_2": "(a) The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Similarly, B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(b) The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set.\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n(c) The Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union because the order of the elements in the ordered pairs matters. In this case, (A x B) ∪ (B x A) and (B x A) ∪ (A x B) have the same elements, but the order of the elements in the ordered pairs is different. This shows that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union, as the order of the sets being multiplied matters."
