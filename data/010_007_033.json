    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the space Y, we first need to understand the topology of Y. The space X is obtained by gluing the edges of a unit square together in the usual way, which means identifying the opposite edges. This results in a torus, which is the quotient space of the unit square under this identification.\n\nNow, let's consider the subspace Y. It consists of the interior of the square with the boundary identified to a point. This means that we are collapsing the entire boundary of the square to a single point. In other words, we are pinching the boundary of the torus to a single point. This results in a space that is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles, often denoted as S^1 ∨ S^1.\n\nNow we can compute the fundamental group of Y. Since Y is homotopy equivalent to S^1 ∨ S^1, their fundamental groups are isomorphic. The fundamental group of a wedge sum of two spaces is the free product of their fundamental groups. The fundamental group of a circle S^1 is isomorphic to the integers Z, so the fundamental group of Y is the free product of Z with itself:\n\nπ1(Y) ≅ π1(S^1 ∨ S^1) ≅ Z * Z\n\nHere, Z * Z denotes the free product of Z with itself, which is the free group on two generators. This is the fundamental group of the space Y."
