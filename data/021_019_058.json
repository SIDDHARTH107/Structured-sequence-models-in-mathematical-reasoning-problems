    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) optimization method is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. Here, we will use the HS algorithm to find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory, e.g., HMS = 10.\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory, e.g., HMCR = 0.8.\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting the pitch of a selected value, e.g., PAR = 0.3.\n- Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will be repeated, e.g., NI = 1000.\n- Define the search space for the variable x, e.g., x âˆˆ [-10, 10].\n\nStep 2: Initialize the harmony memory\nRandomly generate HMS solution vectors within the search space and evaluate their fitness (i.e., the function value f(x)). Store these vectors in the harmony memory.\n\nStep 3: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each variable (in this case, only x), generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory for that variable. Otherwise, generate a new random value within the search space. If the selected value is from the harmony memory and another random number is less than PAR, adjust the pitch of the selected value by adding or subtracting a small random number.\n\nStep 4: Update the harmony memory\nEvaluate the fitness of the new harmony. If it is better than the worst harmony in the memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 5: Check the stopping criterion\nIf the number of iterations reaches NI, stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go back to Step 3.\n\nStep 6: Return the best solution\nReturn the harmony with the best fitness value (i.e., the minimum f(x)) as the global minimum.\n\nBy applying the Harmony Search optimization method with the given parameters, the algorithm will eventually converge to the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2. Note that the actual minimum value and the corresponding x value will depend on the specific parameter settings and the random nature of the algorithm."
