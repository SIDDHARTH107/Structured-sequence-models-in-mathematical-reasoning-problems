    "message_2": "To find the complement of set $A$, we look for the elements in the universal set $U$ that are not in set $A$. The complement of set $A$, denoted as $A'$, is:\n\n$A' = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$\n\nNow, we find the union of set $A$ and its complement $A'$. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either of the two sets. The union of $A$ and $A'$, denoted as $A \\cup A'$, is:\n\n$A \\cup A' = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n\nTo prove that the resulting set is equal to the universal set $U$, we can compare the elements in both sets. Since both sets contain the same elements, we can conclude that:\n\n$A \\cup A' = U$\n\nThus, the union of set $A$ and its complement $A'$ is equal to the universal set $U$."
