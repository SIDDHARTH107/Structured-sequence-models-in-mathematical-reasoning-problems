    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to semi-definite programming:\n\nA factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit for each unit of A is $20 and for each unit of B is $30. The factory has a budget of $10,000 to spend on producing these products. In order to produce one unit of A and one unit of B, the factory needs two units of labor and one unit of raw material. The factory can employ up to 800 units of labor and can use up to 400 units of raw material. Also, the factory can only store up to 300 units of finished products in its inventory.\n\nWrite a semi-definite programming model to maximize the total profit for the factory, subject to the given constraints. What is the optimal number of units of each product that the factory should produce? What is the maximum profit that the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Budget constraint: 2x + 2y <= 10,000 (since it costs 2 units of labor to produce one unit of A and one unit of B)\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 2y <= 800 (since the factory can employ up to 800 units of labor)\n3. Raw material constraint: x + y <= 400 (since the factory can use up to 400 units of raw material)\n4. Inventory constraint: x + y <= 300 (since the factory can store up to 300 units of finished products)\n5. Non-negativity constraint: x, y >= 0\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy these constraints and maximize the profit.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the budget and labor constraints since they are essentially the same:\n\nx + y <= 5000\n\nNext, we can analyze the feasible region formed by the constraints. The inventory constraint (x + y <= 300) is more restrictive than the raw material constraint (x + y <= 400), so we can focus on the inventory constraint.\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (300, 0), and (0, 300). We can evaluate the objective function at these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = 0\n2. P(300, 0) = 20(300) + 30(0) = 6000\n3. P(0, 300) = 20(0) + 30(300) = 9000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 300), where the factory produces 0 units of product A and 300 units of product B. The maximum profit is $9,000."
