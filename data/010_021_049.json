    "message_1": "Suppose you have a symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$ with $b_2(M) = 3$ and $[\\omega] \\in H^2(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ with a corresponding integral symplectic form $\\omega$. Let $X, Y$ and $Z$ be symplectic forms on $M$ such that $[\\omega] = [X] + [Y] + [Z]$. If $X$ and $Y$ are non-degenerate and $Z$ is degenerate, what is the maximum value of $\\dim_\\mathbb{R}(\\mathrm{ker}\\, Z)$?",
    "message_2": "Since $X$ and $Y$ are non-degenerate symplectic forms, they have full rank, which means their kernels are trivial. Now, we know that $[\\omega] = [X] + [Y] + [Z]$, and since $X$ and $Y$ are non-degenerate, we can write $\\omega = X + Y + Z$.\n\nRecall that the dimension of a symplectic manifold is even, say $2n$. The rank of a symplectic form is also even, so the dimension of the kernel of a degenerate symplectic form must be even as well. Let $k = \\dim_\\mathbb{R}(\\mathrm{ker}\\, Z)$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq 2n$.\n\nNow, consider the restriction of $\\omega$ to the kernel of $Z$. Since $Z$ is degenerate, we have $\\omega|_{\\mathrm{ker}\\, Z} = X|_{\\mathrm{ker}\\, Z} + Y|_{\\mathrm{ker}\\, Z}$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are non-degenerate, their restrictions to the kernel of $Z$ are also non-degenerate. Therefore, the restriction of $\\omega$ to the kernel of $Z$ is non-degenerate as well.\n\nHowever, the restriction of $\\omega$ to the kernel of $Z$ is a symplectic form on a subspace of dimension $k$. Since the dimension of a symplectic manifold must be even, we have that $k$ must be even. The maximum value of $k$ is achieved when the kernel of $Z$ is as large as possible, subject to the constraint that the restriction of $\\omega$ to the kernel of $Z$ is non-degenerate.\n\nIn this case, the maximum value of $k$ is $2n - 2$, which corresponds to the case where the kernel of $Z$ is a co-dimension 2 subspace of $M$. This is because if the kernel of $Z$ were any larger, the restriction of $\\omega$ to the kernel of $Z$ would be degenerate, which contradicts the fact that $\\omega$ is a symplectic form.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $\\dim_\\mathbb{R}(\\mathrm{ker}\\, Z)$ is $2n - 2$."
