    "message_1": "A spring with a mass of 0.5 kg is attached to a rigid support. The spring constant is 10 N/m. The mass is initially stretched 2 cm from its equilibrium position and then released. Determine the vibrations of the system using an oscillation equation.",
    "message_2": "To determine the vibrations of the system, we can use the simple harmonic motion equation. For a spring-mass system, the equation is:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position at time t, A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω). This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (10 N/m) and m is the mass (0.5 kg).\n\nω = sqrt(10/0.5) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.47 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to determine the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). Since the mass is initially stretched 2 cm (0.02 m) from its equilibrium position and then released, the amplitude is equal to the initial displacement:\n\nA = 0.02 m\n\nSince the mass is released from its maximum displacement, the phase angle (φ) is 0.\n\nNow, we can write the oscillation equation for the system:\n\nx(t) = 0.02 * cos(4.47 * t)\n\nThis equation describes the vibrations of the system as a function of time. The mass will oscillate back and forth with an amplitude of 0.02 m and an angular frequency of 4.47 rad/s."
