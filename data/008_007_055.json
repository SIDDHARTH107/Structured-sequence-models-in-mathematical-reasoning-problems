Find the eigenvalues of A:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, 2], [2, 6 - λ]]\n\nThe determinant of (A - λI) is:\n\n(3 - λ)(6 - λ) - (2)(2) = λ^2 - 9λ + 14\n\nSetting the determinant to 0 and solving for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 9λ + 14 = 0\n(λ - 2)(λ - 7) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 7.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors of A:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n(A - λ1I)v1 = (A - 2I)v1 = [[1, 2], [2, 4]]v1 = 0\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n\n[1, 2 | 0]\n[0, 0 | 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we have v1 = [-2, 1]. This is the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 2.\n\nFor λ2 = 7:\n(A - λ2I)v2 = (A - 7I)v2 = [[-4, 2], [2, -1]]v2 = 0\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n\n[-4, 2 | 0]\n[ 0, 0 | 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we have v2 = [1, 2]. This is the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 7.\n\n3. Form the matrix P and D:\nThe matrix P is formed by placing the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [[-2, 1], [1, 2]]\n\nThe diagonal matrix D has the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = [[2, 0], [0, 7]]\n\nNow we have found the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that P^(-1)AP = D."
