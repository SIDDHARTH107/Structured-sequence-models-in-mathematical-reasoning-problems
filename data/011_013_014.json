    "message_1": "A student is organizing a gift bag for a party. They have 5 types of candy and want to include 8 pieces of candy in each bag. However, they want to make sure that each bag has at least 2 different types of candy. How many different combinations of candy can the student put in each bag? (Hint: Use Polya's enumeration theorem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we will first find the total number of combinations without any restrictions and then subtract the number of combinations with only one type of candy.\n\nLet's represent the 8 pieces of candy as 8 slots, and the 5 types of candy as A, B, C, D, and E. We can use stars and bars method to find the total number of combinations without any restrictions.\n\nWe have 8 stars (candies) and need to divide them into 5 groups (candy types). To do this, we will use 4 bars to separate the groups. So, we have a total of 12 symbols (8 stars and 4 bars). We need to choose 4 positions for the bars among the 12 symbols, which can be done in C(12, 4) ways.\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!) = 495\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of combinations with only one type of candy. There are 5 types of candy, and each bag can have only one type, so there are 5 such combinations.\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations with at least 2 different types of candy is:\n\n495 (total combinations) - 5 (combinations with only one type of candy) = 490\n\nSo, the student can create 490 different combinations of candy with at least 2 different types of candy in each bag."
