    "message_2": "Let's denote the order of the group G as |G| = n, and the order of the subgroup H as |H| = 4. Since H is a subgroup of G, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G, so n is a multiple of 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible generators of H. Since H has order 4, the elements of H are {e, h, h^2, h^3}, where e is the identity element and h is a generator of H. We know that h^4 = e, as the order of h is 4.\n\nSince G is a cyclic group generated by a, every element in G can be written as a power of a. Therefore, we can write h = a^k for some integer k. Then, h^4 = (a^k)^4 = a^(4k) = e. This means that the order of a^k is 4, so 4 is the smallest positive integer m such that 4k is a multiple of n (the order of G).\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the order of an element in a cyclic group divides the order of the group. Thus, the possible generators of H are the elements of G with order 4. These elements will be of the form a^k, where k is a divisor of n such that 4k is a multiple of n.\n\nIn summary, the possible generators of H are the elements a^k, where k is a divisor of n/4."
