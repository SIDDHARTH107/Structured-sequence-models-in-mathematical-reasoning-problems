    "message_2": "(i) To determine if the graph has an Eulerian path or Eulerian circuit, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. A graph has an Eulerian circuit if all vertices have even degrees, and it has an Eulerian path if exactly two vertices have odd degrees.\n\nIn this graph, the degrees of the vertices are:\nA: 3\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 3\nE: 3\n\nSince there are four vertices with odd degrees (A, B, D, and E), the graph does not have an Eulerian circuit. However, since there are exactly two vertices with odd degrees (A and E), the graph has an Eulerian path.\n\nOne possible Eulerian path is: A-B-C-D-E-C-B-D-A-E.\n\n(ii) To determine if the graph has a Hamiltonian path or Hamiltonian circuit, we need to find a path or circuit that visits each vertex exactly once.\n\nIn this graph, there is a Hamiltonian path: A-B-C-D-E.\n\nHowever, there is no Hamiltonian circuit, as there is no way to return to the starting vertex (A) without visiting another vertex more than once."
