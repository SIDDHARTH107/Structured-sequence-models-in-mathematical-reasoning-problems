    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k is the highest power of p that divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k, called a Sylow p-subgroup.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, divides the order of G, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let's apply these theorems to the group G of order 35.\n\nSince 35 = 5 * 7, we have two prime factors, 5 and 7. Let's find the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G.\n\nFor the Sylow 5-subgroups, we have p = 5 and k = 1, so we are looking for subgroups of order 5. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides the order of G (35), and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 7. \n\nSimilarly, for the Sylow 7-subgroups, we have p = 7 and k = 1, so we are looking for subgroups of order 7. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides the order of G (35), and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The possible values for n_7 are 1 and 5.\n\nNow, we have four cases to consider:\n\n1. n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, and a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, say K. Since both H and K are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of H and K are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element. By the product formula, we have |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 5 * 7 = 35. Thus, G = HK, and G is isomorphic to the direct product H x K, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\n2. n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 5: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, and 5 Sylow 7-subgroups. Since H is unique, it is normal in G. Let K be any Sylow 7-subgroup. Since the orders of H and K are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}. By the product formula, we have |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 5 * 7 = 35. Thus, G = HK, and G is isomorphic to the direct product H x K, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\n3. n_5 = 7 and n_7 = 1: This case is symmetric to case 2, and the conclusion is the same: G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\n4. n_5 = 7 and n_7 = 5: In this case, there are 7 Sylow 5-subgroups and 5 Sylow 7-subgroups. However, this case is not possible, because it would imply that there are at least 7 * 4 + 5 * 6 = 52 distinct non-identity elements in G, which contradicts the fact that G has only 34 non-identity elements.\n\nIn conclusion, in all possible cases, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
