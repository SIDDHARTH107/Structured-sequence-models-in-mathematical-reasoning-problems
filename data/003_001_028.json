    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the other leg as \"a\". We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the length of the other leg. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm and one leg (b) is 6 cm. We can plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\n10^2 = a^2 + 6^2\n\n100 = a^2 + 36\n\nNow, we can subtract 36 from both sides of the equation to isolate a^2:\n\n100 - 36 = a^2\n\n64 = a^2\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (a), we can take the square root of both sides:\n\n√64 = √a^2\n\n8 = a\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
