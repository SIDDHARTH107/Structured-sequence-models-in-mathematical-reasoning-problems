    "message_1": "A group of students were asked to complete a Latin square of size 5, using the numbers 1 to 5. A Latin square is a square grid of numbers, where each row and column contains each number exactly once. What is the total number of possible Latin squares that the students could have completed?",
    "message_2": "The total number of possible Latin squares of size 5 (5x5 grid) is 161,280. This number is derived from a well-known sequence of counting Latin squares, which is not trivial to compute. The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 12, 576, 161280, ... for grid sizes 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, ... respectively."
