Then evaluate the solution at t=3. Round the answer to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), then we have:\n\n(ω^2 + 2iω + 5)Y(ω) = 6[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]/2\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function. Now we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = 6[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] / (ω^2 + 2iω + 5)\n\nNext, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫[6[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] / (ω^2 + 2iω + 5)] e^(iωt) dω\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use the properties of the Dirac delta function:\n\ny(t) = (1/(2π)) [6 ∫[δ(ω - 3) / (ω^2 + 2iω + 5)] e^(iωt) dω + 6 ∫[δ(ω + 3) / (ω^2 + 2iω + 5)] e^(iωt) dω]\n\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/(2π)) [6 e^(3it) / (9 - 6i + 5) + 6 e^(-3it) / (9 + 6i + 5)]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\ny(t) = (1/(2π)) [6 e^(3it) / (14 - 6i) + 6 e^(-3it) / (14 + 6i)]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the solution at t = 3:\n\ny(3) = (1/(2π)) [6 e^(9i) / (14 - 6i) + 6 e^(-9i) / (14 + 6i)]\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the complex exponentials as trigonometric functions:\n\ny(3) = (1/(2π)) [6 (cos(9) + i sin(9)) / (14 - 6i) + 6 (cos(-9) + i sin(-9)) / (14 + 6i)]\n\ny(3) = (1/(2π)) [6 (cos(9) + i sin(9)) / (14 - 6i) + 6 (cos(9) - i sin(9)) / (14 + 6i)]\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of each term by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\ny(3) = (1/(2π)) [6 (cos(9) + i sin(9))(14 + 6i) / (14^2 + 6^2) + 6 (cos(9) - i sin(9))(14 - 6i) / (14^2 + 6^2)]\n\ny(3) = (1/(2π)) [6 (14cos(9) + 6i sin(9) + 6i cos(9) - 6 sin(9)) / 232 + 6 (14cos(9) - 6i sin(9) - 6i cos(9) + 6 sin(9)) / 232]\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\ny(3) = (1/(2π)) [12 (14cos(9) + 6 sin(9)) / 232]\n\ny(3) ≈ 0.362\n\nSo, the solution y(t) evaluated at t = 3 is approximately 0.362, rounded to 3 decimal places."
