    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of group actions and Burnside's Lemma.\n\nBurnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct arrangements (up to rotation and reflection) is equal to the average number of fixed points of all the group actions.\n\nThere are 7! ways to arrange the beads without considering rotations and reflections. We have two types of group actions: rotations and reflections.\n\n1. Rotations: There are 7 possible rotations (including the identity rotation).\n- Identity rotation: All 7! arrangements are fixed.\n- Rotation by 1/7: No arrangements are fixed.\n- Rotation by 2/7: No arrangements are fixed.\n- Rotation by 3/7: No arrangements are fixed.\n- Rotation by 4/7: No arrangements are fixed.\n- Rotation by 5/7: No arrangements are fixed.\n- Rotation by 6/7: No arrangements are fixed.\n\n2. Reflections: There are 7 possible reflections (one for each axis of symmetry).\n- Each reflection has 7! / 7 = 6! fixed arrangements.\n\nNow, we apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = (Sum of fixed points) / (Number of group actions)\n= (7! + 7 * 6!) / (7 + 7)\n= (7! + 7 * 6!) / 14\n= (5040 + 7 * 720) / 14\n= (5040 + 5040) / 14\n= 10080 / 14\n= 720\n\nSo, there are 720 distinct ways to arrange the 7 different beads on a necklace when rotations and reflections are considered identical."
