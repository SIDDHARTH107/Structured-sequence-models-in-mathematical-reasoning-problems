    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 chapters out of 10 and the number of ways to choose 3 chapters with a total number of pages less than 100.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 3 chapters out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of chapters and k is the number of chapters to be chosen. In this case, n = 10 and k = 3.\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 3) = 720 / 6\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose 3 chapters out of 10.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose 3 chapters with a total number of pages less than 100. We can do this by listing all the possible combinations of chapters that meet the criteria:\n\n1. (1, 4, 9) = 25 + 20 + 10 = 55\n2. (1, 2, 9) = 25 + 30 + 10 = 65\n3. (1, 2, 4) = 25 + 30 + 20 = 75\n4. (1, 6, 9) = 25 + 35 + 10 = 70\n5. (1, 6, 4) = 25 + 35 + 20 = 80\n6. (1, 8, 9) = 25 + 30 + 10 = 65\n7. (1, 8, 4) = 25 + 30 + 20 = 75\n8. (2, 4, 9) = 30 + 20 + 10 = 60\n9. (2, 6, 9) = 30 + 35 + 10 = 75\n10. (2, 8, 9) = 30 + 30 + 10 = 70\n11. (2, 6, 4) = 30 + 35 + 20 = 85\n12. (2, 8, 4) = 30 + 30 + 20 = 80\n13. (4, 6, 9) = 20 + 35 + 10 = 65\n14. (4, 8, 9) = 20 + 30 + 10 = 60\n15. (6, 8, 9) = 35 + 30 + 10 = 75\n\nThere are 15 combinations of chapters with a total number of pages less than 100.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (combinations with a total number of pages less than 100) by the total number of possible outcomes (total ways to choose 3 chapters out of 10).\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 15 / 120\nProbability = 1 / 8\n\nSo, the probability that the total number of pages selected is less than 100 is 1/8 or 0.125."
