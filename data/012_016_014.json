    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a polynomial associated with a graph that encodes various properties of the graph. It is defined as:\n\nT_G(x, y) = ∑(r,s)∈R×S μ(r, s) x^(|E|-|s|) y^(|V|-|r|-|s|)\n\nwhere R and S are the set of all subsets of vertices (V) and edges (E) of the graph G, respectively, and μ(r, s) is the rank-nullity polynomial.\n\nFor the given graph G, we have the following vertices and edges:\n\nV = {A, B, C, D}\nE = {AB, AC, BC, BD, CD}\n\nNow, we will compute the Tutte polynomial by considering all possible subgraphs of G:\n\n1. The empty subgraph:\n   T_G(x, y) = x^5 y^0 = x^5\n\n2. Subgraphs with one edge:\n   - AB: T_G(x, y) = x^4 y^1 = x^4 y\n   - AC: T_G(x, y) = x^4 y^1 = x^4 y\n   - BC: T_G(x, y) = x^4 y^1 = x^4 y\n   - BD: T_G(x, y) = x^4 y^1 = x^4 y\n   - CD: T_G(x, y) = x^4 y^1 = x^4 y\n\n3. Subgraphs with two edges:\n   - AB, AC: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - AB, BC: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - AB, BD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - AB, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - AC, BC: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - AC, BD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - AC, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - BC, BD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - BC, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n   - BD, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^3 y^1 = x^3 y\n\n4. Subgraphs with three edges:\n   - AB, AC, BC: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AB, AC, BD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AB, AC, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AB, BC, BD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AB, BC, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AB, BD, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AC, BC, BD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AC, BC, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - AC, BD, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n   - BC, BD, CD: T_G(x, y) = x^2 y^1 = x^2 y\n\n5. The complete graph G:\n   T_G(x, y) = x^0 y^1 = y\n\nNow, we sum up the Tutte polynomials for all subgraphs:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x^5 + 5x^4 y + 10x^3 y + 10x^2 y + y\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G is:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x^5 + 5x^4 y + 10x^3 y + 10x^2 y + y"
