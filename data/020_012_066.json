    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The cost to make each unit of product A is $3 and the cost to make each unit of product B is $5. The selling price for each unit of product A is $8 and for B it is $10. The company wants to maximize their profit. How many units of each product should they produce?",
    "message_2": "To determine how many units of each product the company should produce to maximize their profit, we need to calculate the profit per unit for each product and compare them.\n\nProfit per unit of product A:\nSelling price - Cost = Profit\n$8 - $3 = $5\n\nProfit per unit of product B:\nSelling price - Cost = Profit\n$10 - $5 = $5\n\nThe profit per unit for both products A and B is the same, which is $5. Therefore, the company can produce any combination of product A and product B to maximize their profit, as long as they continue to produce and sell the products. The optimal production quantity for each product will depend on factors such as market demand, production capacity, and resource availability."
