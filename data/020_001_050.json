    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs, A and B. Each chair A requires 3 units of wood and 2 units of leather, while each chair B requires 2 units of wood and 1 unit of leather. If the manufacturer has 600 units of wood and 400 units of leather available, what is the maximum number of chairs of each type that can be produced assuming that all produced chairs must be sold?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs of type A and y be the number of chairs of type B.\n\nThe constraints for the available resources can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 600 (wood constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 400 (leather constraint)\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of chairs of each type that can be produced, so we need to find the maximum values of x and y that satisfy these inequalities.\n\nFirst, let's solve the inequalities for y:\n\n2y ≤ 600 - 3x\ny ≤ (600 - 3x)/2\n\ny ≤ 400 - 2x\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\ny ≤ (600 - 3x)/2\ny ≤ 400 - 2x\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (you can't produce a negative number of chairs), we also have:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all these inequalities are satisfied. To find the maximum number of chairs of each type that can be produced, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region and check the values of x and y at those points.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are the points where the inequalities intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (600 - 3x)/2 and y = 400 - 2x:\n(600 - 3x)/2 = 400 - 2x\n600 - 3x = 800 - 4x\nx = 200\n\ny = 400 - 2(200) = 0\n\nSo, one vertex is (200, 0).\n\n2. Intersection of y = (600 - 3x)/2 and x = 0:\ny = (600 - 3(0))/2 = 300\n\nSo, another vertex is (0, 300).\n\n3. Intersection of y = 400 - 2x and x = 0:\ny = 400 - 2(0) = 400\n\nSo, another vertex is (0, 400), but this point is not in the feasible region because it doesn't satisfy the wood constraint.\n\nNow, we need to check the values of x and y at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. At point (200, 0): 200 chairs of type A and 0 chairs of type B can be produced.\n2. At point (0, 300): 0 chairs of type A and 300 chairs of type B can be produced.\n\nComparing these two options, producing 200 chairs of type A and 0 chairs of type B uses all the available wood and leather, while producing 0 chairs of type A and 300 chairs of type B leaves some wood unused. Therefore, the maximum number of chairs of each type that can be produced is 200 chairs of type A and 0 chairs of type B."
