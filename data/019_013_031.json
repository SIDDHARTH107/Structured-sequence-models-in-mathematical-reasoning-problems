    "message_2": "The maximum number of distinct subsets that can be formed from a set containing n elements is not dependent on the use of second-order logic. The number of subsets is determined by the power set of the set, which is the set of all possible subsets, including the empty set and the set itself.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct subsets for a set with n elements is 2^n. This is because each element can either be included or not included in a subset, resulting in 2 possibilities for each element. Since there are n elements, there are 2^n possible combinations of subsets."
