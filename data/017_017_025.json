    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. We want to determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, so we have three prime factors to consider: 2, 3, and 5.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, all three subgroups are normal in G. Let P_2, P_3, and P_5 be the Sylow 2, 3, and 5-subgroups, respectively. Then, G has a subgroup of order 2, a subgroup of order 3, and a subgroup of order 5. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, G has an element of order 30, which generates a cyclic group of order 30. Thus, G is isomorphic to C30.\n\nCase 2: G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, but not unique Sylow 2 and 3-subgroups. In this case, G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say P_5, of order 5. The group G/P_5 has order 6, which is isomorphic to either C6 or S3 (the symmetric group on 3 elements). If G/P_5 is isomorphic to C6, then G has an element of order 6, which together with the element of order 5 in P_5, generates a cyclic group of order 30. Thus, G is isomorphic to C30. If G/P_5 is isomorphic to S3, then G is a semidirect product of P_5 and a Sylow 3-subgroup, which is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nCase 3: G does not have unique Sylow 2, 3, and 5-subgroups. In this case, G has a presentation of the form <a, b | a^5 = b^6 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^r>, where r is an integer relatively prime to 5. This is the presentation of the dihedral group D15, so G is isomorphic to D15.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 30 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, depending on the properties of its Sylow subgroups."
