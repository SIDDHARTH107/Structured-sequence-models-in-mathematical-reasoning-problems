    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 3^2 + (-4)^2) = √(4 + 9 + 16) = √29\n|B| = √((-5)^2 + 6^2 + 2^2) = √(25 + 36 + 4) = √65\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A||B|cos(θ)\n\n2(-5) + 3(6) - 4(2) = √29√65cos(θ)\n\n-10 + 18 - 8 = √29√65cos(θ)\n\n0 = √29√65cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 0\n\nθ = 90° or π/2 radians\n\nSince the angle between the two vectors is 90°, the vectors are perpendicular, and the sine of the angle is 1:\n\nsin(θ) = sin(90°) = 1\n\nNow, let's find the cross product using the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nA x B = (√29)(√65)(1)n\n\nA x B = √(29)(65)n\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the right-hand rule. Point your right-hand fingers in the direction of vector A (2i + 3j - 4k) and curl them towards vector B (-5i + 6j + 2k). Your thumb will point in the direction of the unit vector n.\n\nn = i(3*2 - (-4)*6) - j(2*(-5) - (-4)*(-5)) + k(2*6 - 3*(-5))\n\nn = i(6 + 24) - j(-10 + 20) + k(12 + 15)\n\nn = 30i + 10j + 27k\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = √(29)(65)(30i + 10j + 27k)\n\nA x B = (30√1885)i + (10√1885)j + (27√1885)k"
