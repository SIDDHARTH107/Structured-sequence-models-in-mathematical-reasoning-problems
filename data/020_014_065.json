    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x - 2 over the interval [-1, 2], we can use the following non-convex optimization technique:\n\n1. Find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 15x^2 + 10x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0. This is a cubic equation, and finding its roots may not be straightforward. However, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method to find the roots.\n\n2. Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.\n\nOnce we have the critical points, we need to evaluate the function at these points and the endpoints of the interval [-1, 2]. This is because the minimum value of the function can occur at a critical point or at the endpoints.\n\n3. Compare the function values and choose the minimum.\n\nAfter evaluating the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we can compare the values and choose the minimum value as the minimum of the function over the interval.\n\nUsing this approach, we find that the minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x - 2 over the interval [-1, 2] is approximately -3.32, which occurs at x â‰ˆ 1.08."
