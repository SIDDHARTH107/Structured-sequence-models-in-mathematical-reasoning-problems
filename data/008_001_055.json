    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the inverse matrix method. First, we write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | -8  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse of A, denoted as A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -3 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                   | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = |  5/22  3/22 |\n         |  4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) by B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/22  3/22 | * |  7  |\n    |  4/22 -2/22 |   | -8  |\n\nX = | (5/22)*7 + (3/22)*(-8) |\n    | (4/22)*7 + (-2/22)*(-8) |\n\nX = | 35/22 - 24/22 |\n    | 28/22 + 16/22 |\n\nX = | 11/22 |\n    | 44/22 |\n\nX = | 1/2 |\n    | 2   |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1/2 and y = 2."
