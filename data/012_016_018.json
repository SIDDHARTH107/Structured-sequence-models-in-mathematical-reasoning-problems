    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. The graph has 4 vertices (1, 2, 3, and 4) and 6 edges (e1: 1-2, e2: 1-3, e3: 1-4, e4: 2-3, e5: 2-4, and e6: 3-4). The Tutte polynomial is a two-variable polynomial T(x, y) that encodes various properties of the graph.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial can be defined recursively as follows:\n\n1. T(G) = T(G - e) + T(G / e) if e is not a loop or a bridge (where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e).\n2. T(G) = x * T(G - e) if e is a bridge.\n3. T(G) = y * T(G - e) if e is a loop.\n\nIn our case, there are no loops or bridges, so we will use the first rule. We can start by choosing an edge, say e1 (1-2), and apply the rule:\n\nT(G) = T(G - e1) + T(G / e1)\n\nNow, we need to compute the Tutte polynomial for both G - e1 and G / e1.\n\nG - e1:\n\n```\n    1\n    |\\   /|\\\n2.5 | \\ / | 1.5\n    |  0  | \n1.5 | / \\ | 2.5\n    |/   \\|\n    3-----4\n       3\n```\n\nG / e1:\n\n```\n    1,2\n    |\\  |\\\n2.5 | \\ | 1.5\n    |  0  | \n1.5 | / \\ | 2.5\n    |/   \\|\n    3-----4\n       3\n```\n\nNow, we need to compute the Tutte polynomial for both of these graphs. We can continue applying the first rule until we reach graphs with only one edge or no edges at all. After doing this, we will get:\n\nT(G) = (x - 1)(y - 1)(x + y - 1)\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is T(x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)(x + y - 1)."
