    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent values of a 60-degree angle using the unit circle, we can use the following relationships:\n\n1. Sine (sin) is the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n2. Cosine (cos) is the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n3. Tangent (tan) is the ratio of the sine to the cosine (sin/cos).\n\nFor a 60-degree angle (which is equivalent to π/3 radians), the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are:\n\nx = 1/2\ny = √3/2\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent values are:\n\nsin(60°) = y = √3/2\ncos(60°) = x = 1/2\ntan(60°) = sin(60°)/cos(60°) = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3\n\nTherefore, the sine, cosine, and tangent values of a 60-degree angle are sin(60°) = √3/2, cos(60°) = 1/2, and tan(60°) = √3."
