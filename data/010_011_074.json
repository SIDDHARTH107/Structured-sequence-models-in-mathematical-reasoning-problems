    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the closed orientable surface formed by gluing together two Möbius strips along their common boundary, we can use the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = vertices (V) - edges (E) + faces (F)\n\nFirst, let's analyze the Möbius strip. A Möbius strip has one boundary, one face, and no vertices. When we glue two Möbius strips together along their common boundary, we form a closed surface called the Klein bottle.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Klein bottle. The Klein bottle has no vertices, as it is a smooth surface. It has three edges: the two original edges of the Möbius strips and the new edge formed by gluing them together. Finally, it has two faces: the two original faces of the Möbius strips.\n\nUsing the Euler characteristic formula for the Klein bottle:\n\nχ = V - E + F\nχ = 0 - 3 + 2\nχ = -1\n\nHowever, the question asks for the Euler characteristic of the closed orientable surface formed by gluing together two Möbius strips. The Klein bottle is a non-orientable surface. To obtain an orientable surface, we need to take two copies of the Klein bottle and glue them together along their boundaries. This new surface is called the connected sum of two Klein bottles.\n\nFor the connected sum of two Klein bottles, we have:\n\nVertices (V) = 0 (still no vertices)\nEdges (E) = 6 (each Klein bottle has 3 edges, so 3 + 3 = 6)\nFaces (F) = 4 (each Klein bottle has 2 faces, so 2 + 2 = 4)\n\nNow, we can find the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of two Klein bottles:\n\nχ = V - E + F\nχ = 0 - 6 + 4\nχ = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the closed orientable surface formed by gluing together two Möbius strips along their common boundary is -2."
