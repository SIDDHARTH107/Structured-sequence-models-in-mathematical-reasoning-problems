    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x) * (4x - 1) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = 3x^2 + 5x\nv(x) = 4x - 1\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(3x^2 + 5x)/dx = 6x + 5\nv'(x) = d(4x - 1)/dx = 4\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (6x + 5)(4x - 1) + (3x^2 + 5x)(4)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (24x^2 - 6x + 20x - 5) + (12x^3 + 20x^2)\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 44x^2 + 14x - 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + 5x) * (4x - 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 44x^2 + 14x - 5"
