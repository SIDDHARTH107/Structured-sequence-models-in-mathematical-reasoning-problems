    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following kinematic equations:\n\n1) v = u + at\n2) s = ut + (1/2)at^2\n3) v^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\n- v is the final velocity\n- u is the initial velocity\n- a is the acceleration (in this case, due to gravity, which is -9.81 m/s^2)\n- t is the time\n- s is the displacement\n\nFirst, we need to find the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height. At the maximum height, the final velocity (v) will be 0 m/s. We can use equation 1 to find the time:\n\n0 = 30 + (-9.81)t\n9.81t = 30\nt = 30 / 9.81\nt ≈ 3.06 seconds\n\nNow that we have the time, we can find the height it reaches above the 20-meter building using equation 2:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at^2\ns = (30)(3.06) + (1/2)(-9.81)(3.06)^2\ns ≈ 45.9 meters\n\nSince the ball was thrown from the top of a 20-meter building, the maximum height above the ground is:\n\nMaximum height = height above the building + height of the building\nMaximum height = 45.9 + 20\nMaximum height ≈ 65.9 meters\n\nSo, the ball reaches a maximum height of approximately 65.9 meters above the ground, and it takes about 3.06 seconds to reach that height."
