    "message_2": "To find the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we first note that the prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of these groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, so their product, P_2P_3, is also normal in G. Since |P_2P_3| = |P_2| * |P_3| = 36, we have G = P_2P_3, and G is a direct product of P_2 and P_3. This case gives us the abelian group Z_4 × Z_9, which we are not interested in since we are looking for non-abelian groups.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is normal in G. P_3 is either isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4. P_2 is either isomorphic to Z_4 or Z_2 × Z_2. We have the following subcases:\n\n  a) P_3 ≅ Z_9 and P_2 ≅ Z_4: In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, denoted as G = P_3 ⋊ P_2. There are two possible actions of P_2 on P_3, corresponding to the two non-trivial automorphisms of P_3. These actions give us two non-abelian groups of order 36, which are not isomorphic.\n\n  b) P_3 ≅ Z_9 and P_2 ≅ Z_2 × Z_2: In this case, G = P_3 ⋊ P_2. There are six non-trivial automorphisms of P_3, so there are six possible actions of P_2 on P_3. However, two of these actions are equivalent to the actions in case 2a, so we have four new non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\n  c) P_3 ≅ Z_3 × Z_3 and P_2 ≅ Z_4: In this case, G = P_3 ⋊ P_2. There are 52 automorphisms of P_3, and since P_2 has order 4, there are 13 possible actions of P_2 on P_3. However, only three of these actions result in non-abelian groups, giving us three new non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\n  d) P_3 ≅ Z_3 × Z_3 and P_2 ≅ Z_2 × Z_2: In this case, G = P_3 ⋊ P_2. There are 52 automorphisms of P_3, and since P_2 has order 4, there are 13 possible actions of P_2 on P_3. However, all of these actions result in abelian groups, so this case does not give us any new non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, we have found 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nTo determine which of these groups are isomorphic to a given group of order 36, we would need to analyze the group structure and properties of the given group. This would involve comparing the group's properties, such as its center, derived subgroup, and Sylow subgroups, to those of the nine non-abelian groups we found. If the given group shares the same properties and structure as one of these nine groups, then it is isomorphic to that group."
