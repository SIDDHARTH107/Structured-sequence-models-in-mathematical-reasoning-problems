    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of each product requires two types of resources, X and Y. Each unit of product A requires 3 units of resource X and 2 units of resource Y, while each unit of product B requires 2 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y. The company has 130 units of resource X and 120 units of resource Y available to use. Product A generates a profit of $10 per unit, while product B generates a profit of $15 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?\n\nThe math student will have to set up a linear programming model, determine the objective function and constraints, and use a solver to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will set up a linear programming model with an objective function and constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints (resource limitations):\n3x + 2y ≤ 130 (resource X constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 120 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nNow we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 130\n   y = (130 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 4y = 120\n   y = (120 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 20), and (43.33, 0). We will now evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 30) = 10(0) + 15(30) = $450\n3. P(20, 20) = 10(20) + 15(20) = $500\n4. P(43.33, 0) = 10(43.33) + 15(0) = $433.30\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (20, 20), where the company produces 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B. This results in a total profit of $500."
