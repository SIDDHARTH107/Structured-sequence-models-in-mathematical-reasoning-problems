    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 marbles, 4 of which are red, and 6 of which are blue. In how many ways can the marbles be arranged such that no two red marbles are next to each other? Use Stirling numbers to compute the answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Stirling numbers, we will first consider the arrangement of the blue marbles and then place the red marbles in the gaps between them.\n\nThere are 6 blue marbles, which can be arranged in 6! (6 factorial) ways. Now, we need to place the 4 red marbles in the gaps between the blue marbles such that no two red marbles are next to each other.\n\nThere are 7 gaps between the blue marbles (including the gaps at the beginning and end). We need to choose 4 of these gaps to place the red marbles. This can be done in C(7, 4) ways, where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k items from n items.\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!) = 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to place the red marbles in the gaps between the blue marbles such that no two red marbles are next to each other.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the blue marbles (6!) with the number of ways to place the red marbles (35) to get the total number of arrangements.\n\nTotal arrangements = 6! * 35 = 720 * 35 = 25,200\n\nTherefore, there are 25,200 ways to arrange the 10 marbles such that no two red marbles are next to each other."
