    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 * 12) / 2\nArea = 96 / 2\nArea = 48 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters."
