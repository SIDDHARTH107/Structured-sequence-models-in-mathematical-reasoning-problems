    "message_2": "We will use the Schwarz Lemma to solve this problem. The Schwarz Lemma states that if g is an analytic function in the open unit disk {z: |z| < 1} such that |g(z)| < 1 for all |z| < 1 and g(0) = 0, then |g(z)| ≤ |z| for all |z| < 1.\n\nFirst, we define a new function h(z) = (f(z) - 1)/(2 - f(z)). Notice that h(0) = (f(0) - 1)/(2 - f(0)) = 0. Also, for |z| = 1, we have |f(z)| ≤ 2, so |2 - f(z)| ≥ 0. Therefore, |h(z)| = |(f(z) - 1)/(2 - f(z))| ≤ 1 for all |z| = 1.\n\nNow, we can apply the Schwarz Lemma to the function h(z). We get |h(z)| ≤ |z| for all |z| < 1. In particular, for z = 1/2, we have |h(1/2)| ≤ 1/2.\n\nNow, we will solve for |f(1/2)| in terms of |h(1/2)|. We have:\n\n|h(1/2)| = |(f(1/2) - 1)/(2 - f(1/2))|.\n\nSince |h(1/2)| ≤ 1/2, we get:\n\n|(f(1/2) - 1)/(2 - f(1/2))| ≤ 1/2.\n\nNow, we will solve for |f(1/2)|:\n\n|f(1/2) - 1| ≤ |2 - f(1/2)|/2.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2|f(1/2) - 1| ≤ |2 - f(1/2)|.\n\nNow, we use the reverse triangle inequality:\n\n|2 - f(1/2)| - |f(1/2) - 1| ≤ |f(1/2)|.\n\nCombining the inequalities, we get:\n\n2|f(1/2) - 1| ≤ |f(1/2)|.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n|f(1/2) - 1| ≤ |f(1/2)|/2.\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we get:\n\n|f(1/2)| ≤ 3/2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible value of |f(1/2)| is 3/2."
