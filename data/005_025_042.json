    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students who scored between 60 and 90, we can use the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) for normal distributions. This rule states that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nIn this case, the mean score is 75, and the standard deviation is 10. We want to find the percentage of students who scored between 60 and 90, which is one standard deviation below and above the mean, respectively.\n\n60 = 75 - 10(1)\n90 = 75 + 10(1)\n\nSince 60 and 90 are one standard deviation below and above the mean, respectively, we can use the empirical rule to estimate that approximately 68% of the students scored between 60 and 90."
