    "message_2": "To use Lagrange interpolation, we need at least two data points. Since we know the car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, we can assume it starts from a standstill, so we have the following two data points:\n\n1. (0 hours, 0 miles)\n2. (3 hours, 150 miles)\n\nNow, we can use the Lagrange interpolation formula to estimate the distance the car would travel in 5 hours. The formula is:\n\nP(x) = L0(x) * f(x0) + L1(x) * f(x1)\n\nwhere\nP(x) is the estimated distance at time x,\nL0(x) and L1(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials,\nf(x0) and f(x1) are the known distances at times x0 and x1.\n\nFirst, let's find the Lagrange basis polynomials L0(x) and L1(x):\n\nL0(x) = (x - x1) / (x0 - x1) = (x - 3) / (0 - 3) = (x - 3) / -3\nL1(x) = (x - x0) / (x1 - x0) = (x - 0) / (3 - 0) = x / 3\n\nNow, we can plug in the known distances f(x0) = 0 and f(x1) = 150:\n\nP(x) = L0(x) * 0 + L1(x) * 150\nP(x) = (x - 3) / -3 * 0 + x / 3 * 150\nP(x) = 0 + 50x\n\nNow, we can estimate the distance the car would travel in 5 hours by plugging in x = 5:\n\nP(5) = 50 * 5\nP(5) = 250\n\nSo, using Lagrange interpolation, we estimate that the car would travel 250 miles in 5 hours assuming a constant speed."
