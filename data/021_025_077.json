    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, which means it can be applied to a wide range of optimization problems. In this case, we will use the WOA to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = x^4 - 5x^3 + 7x^2 - 3x + 2.\n\nHere is a simplified version of the WOA algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales with random positions in the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale (in this case, the value of the function f(x) at the whale's position).\n3. Determine the best whale (the one with the lowest fitness value).\n4. Update the position of each whale based on the best whale's position and the hunting behavior equations.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nNow, let's apply the WOA algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales with random positions in the search space (e.g., 50 whales with random x values between -10 and 10).\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale using the function f(x).\n3. Determine the best whale (the one with the lowest fitness value).\n4. Update the position of each whale based on the best whale's position and the hunting behavior equations.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a certain number of iterations (e.g., 1000 iterations) or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the change in the best whale's fitness value is smaller than a predefined threshold).\n\nAfter running the WOA algorithm, we will obtain the position of the best whale, which corresponds to the minimum value of the function f(x). Note that the WOA algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution might not be the exact global minimum. However, it can provide a good approximation of the minimum value for complex optimization problems.\n\nIn this specific case, it's important to note that the given function is a polynomial, and there are more efficient and exact methods to find its minimum value, such as using calculus to find the critical points and analyzing their nature. The WOA algorithm is more suitable for complex optimization problems where exact methods are not available or computationally expensive."
