    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees, we will use the inverse sine function, also known as arcsin or sin^(-1):\n\nx = arcsin(0.7)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x in degrees. Most calculators have an arcsin function that will give the result in radians. To convert radians to degrees, we use the following formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / π)\n\nFirst, find the value of x in radians:\n\nx = arcsin(0.7) ≈ 0.7754 radians\n\nNow, convert radians to degrees:\n\nx ≈ 0.7754 * (180 / π) ≈ 44.42 degrees\n\nSo, the value of x is approximately 44.42 degrees."
