    "message_2": "To find the number of possible spanning trees for a complete graph K_n (in this case, K_6), we can use the formula:\n\nT(K_n) = n^(n-2)\n\nwhere T(K_n) represents the number of spanning trees for a complete graph with n vertices.\n\nFor K_6, we have n = 6, so the formula becomes:\n\nT(K_6) = 6^(6-2) = 6^4 = 1296\n\nTherefore, there are 1296 possible spanning trees that can be formed for a complete graph K_6."
