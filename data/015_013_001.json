    "message_2": "The equilibrium points of the logistic equation x = rx(1-x) are found by setting x = rx(1-x) and solving for x. There are two equilibrium points: x = 0 and x = (r-1)/r.\n\nUsing the given value of r = 3.4, we can find the second equilibrium point:\n\nx = (r-1)/r\nx = (3.4-1)/3.4\nx = 2.4/3.4\nx ≈ 0.71\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are x = 0 and x ≈ 0.71 (rounded to two decimal places)."
