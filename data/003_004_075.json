    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(2x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π), we first isolate sin(2x):\n\n2sin(2x) = 1\nsin(2x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we find the angles whose sine is 1/2. Since the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants, we can find the principal angles in those quadrants:\n\nsin(π/6) = 1/2\nsin(5π/6) = 1/2\n\nSince sin(2x) = 1/2, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x = π/6\nx = π/12\n\nCase 2: 2x = 5π/6\nx = 5π/12\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the periodicity of the sine function. The sine function has a period of 2π, so we can add 2πn to the angles, where n is an integer, and still get the same sine value. For our equation, we have:\n\n2x = π/6 + 2πn\nx = π/12 + πn\n\nand\n\n2x = 5π/6 + 2πn\nx = 5π/12 + πn\n\nNow, we need to find the values of n that give us solutions in the interval [0, 2π):\n\nFor x = π/12 + πn:\n\nn = 0: x = π/12\nn = 1: x = 13π/12\nn = 2: x = 25π/12 (not in the interval [0, 2π))\n\nFor x = 5π/12 + πn:\n\nn = 0: x = 5π/12\nn = 1: x = 17π/12\nn = 2: x = 29π/12 (not in the interval [0, 2π))\n\nSo, the solutions in the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx = π/12, 5π/12, 13π/12, and 17π/12"
