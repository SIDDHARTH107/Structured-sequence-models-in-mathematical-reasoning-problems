    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax² + bx + c, we can use the formula h = -b/(2a) to find the x-coordinate of the vertex, and then plug h back into the equation to find the y-coordinate (k).\n\nIn this case, the quadratic equation is y = 2x² - 4x + 1, so a = 2, b = -4, and c = 1.\n\nFirst, let's find h:\nh = -b/(2a) = -(-4)/(2*2) = 4/4 = 1\n\nNow that we have h, let's find k by plugging h back into the equation:\nk = 2(1)² - 4(1) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1\n\nSo the vertex of the graph is (h, k) = (1, -1)."
