The product is sold for $20 per unit. The company can produce a maximum of 1000 units. The company's objective is to maximize profit. Assuming that the demand for the product follows a normal distribution with a mean of 800 units and a standard deviation of 100 units, determine:\n\n1. The optimal production quantity that maximizes the expected profit.\n2. The expected value of profit given the optimal production quantity.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal production quantity (Q) that maximizes the expected profit. The profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue = (Price per unit) * (Minimum of Q and Demand)\nCost = (Cost per unit) * Q\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\n\nPrice per unit = $20\nMean cost per unit = $10\nStandard deviation of cost per unit = $2\nMean demand = 800 units\nStandard deviation of demand = 100 units\n\nFirst, we need to find the optimal production quantity (Q) that maximizes the expected profit. To do this, we can use the newsvendor model, which is a widely used model in operations research for inventory management under uncertainty. The newsvendor model aims to find the optimal order quantity that minimizes the expected cost of overstock and understock.\n\nIn this problem, the overstock cost (Co) is the cost of producing one unit and not selling it, which is equal to the cost per unit. The understock cost (Cu) is the cost of not producing one unit and losing a sale, which is equal to the profit margin per unit (Price per unit - Mean cost per unit).\n\nCo = Mean cost per unit = $10\nCu = Price per unit - Mean cost per unit = $20 - $10 = $10\n\nNext, we need to find the critical fractile (F), which is the probability of demand being less than or equal to the optimal production quantity (Q). The critical fractile can be calculated as:\n\nF = Cu / (Cu + Co) = $10 / ($10 + $10) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can find the optimal production quantity (Q) by using the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with a mean of 800 units and a standard deviation of 100 units:\n\nQ = InverseCDF(0.5, mean = 800, standard deviation = 100) ≈ 800 units\n\nTherefore, the optimal production quantity that maximizes the expected profit is 800 units.\n\nNext, we need to find the expected value of profit given the optimal production quantity. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nExpected Profit = (Price per unit - Mean cost per unit) * E[Minimum of Q and Demand] - (Standard deviation of cost per unit)^2 * Q\n\nSince the demand follows a normal distribution with a mean of 800 units and a standard deviation of 100 units, we can calculate the expected value of the minimum of Q and Demand as:\n\nE[Minimum of Q and Demand] = Mean demand - Standard deviation of demand * PDF(Q, mean = 800, standard deviation = 100) / CDF(Q, mean = 800, standard deviation = 100)\n= 800 - 100 * PDF(800, mean = 800, standard deviation = 100) / CDF(800, mean = 800, standard deviation = 100)\n≈ 800 - 100 * (1 / √(2 * π * 100^2)) * exp(-(800 - 800)^2 / (2 * 100^2)) / 0.5\n≈ 800 - 100 * (1 / √(2 * π * 10000)) * exp(0) / 0.5\n≈ 800 - 100 * (1 / √(20000 * π)) / 0.5\n≈ 800 - 100 * 0.0113 / 0.5\n≈ 800 - 2.26\n≈ 797.74 units\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected profit:\n\nExpected Profit = (Price per unit - Mean cost per unit) * E[Minimum of Q and Demand] - (Standard deviation of cost per unit)^2 * Q\n= ($20 - $10) * 797.74 - ($2)^2 * 800\n= $10 * 797.74 - $4 * 800\n= $7977.4 - $3200\n= $4777.4\n\nTherefore, the expected value of profit given the optimal production quantity is $4777.4."
