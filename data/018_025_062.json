The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nSymmetric Difference of A and B (A Δ B) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3}\n\nSo, A Δ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {3}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nSymmetric Difference of B and A (B Δ A) = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ A = {3}\n\nSo, B Δ A = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is commutative with respect to intersection.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) = {1, 2, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ (B ∩ A) = {3} Δ {3} = {}\n\nSince (A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) ≠ (A ∩ B) Δ (B ∩ A), the symmetric difference is not commutative with respect to intersection."
