    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this case, we are given three starting circles with radii 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTo find the total number of circles in the Apollonian gasket, we first need to find the radius of the next circle that will be tangent to the three given circles. We can use Descartes' Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures (k) of four mutually tangent circles:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = (k1 + k2 + k3 - k4)^2 / 2\n\nHere, k1, k2, and k3 are the curvatures of the given circles, and k4 is the curvature of the new circle. The curvature of a circle is the reciprocal of its radius (k = 1/r).\n\nFor the given circles, we have:\nk1 = 1 (radius 1)\nk2 = 1/2 (radius 2)\nk3 = 1/3 (radius 3)\n\nPlugging these values into Descartes' Circle Theorem, we get:\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + k4 = (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 - k4)^2 / 2\n\nSolving for k4, we find that there are two possible solutions: k4 = 1/6 and k4 = 6. The smaller curvature corresponds to the larger circle that encloses the three given circles, while the larger curvature corresponds to the smaller circle that fits inside the triangle formed by the three given circles. Since we are interested in the smallest possible radius, we will use k4 = 6, which corresponds to a radius of 1/6.\n\nNow, we have four circles: radii 1, 2, 3, and 1/6. However, the Apollonian gasket is a fractal, and the process of adding tangent circles continues infinitely. Therefore, there is an infinite number of circles in the Apollonian gasket."
