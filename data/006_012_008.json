    "message_1": "What is the probability that a burglary occurs in a particular neighborhood within the next 7 days, given that the historical data show that, on average, there have been 2 burglaries per month in this neighborhood?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, burglaries) in a fixed interval of time (7 days). The formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events, λ is the average rate of events, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of burglaries per 7 days. Since there are 2 burglaries per month on average, and there are approximately 30 days in a month, the average rate of burglaries per day is:\n\n2 burglaries/month * (1 month/30 days) = 2/30 burglaries/day\n\nNow, we can find the average rate of burglaries per 7 days:\n\n(2/30 burglaries/day) * 7 days = 14/30 burglaries\n\nSo, λ = 14/30.\n\nNext, we want to find the probability that at least one burglary occurs within the next 7 days. To do this, we can find the probability that no burglaries occur and then subtract that from 1:\n\nP(at least 1 burglary) = 1 - P(no burglaries)\n\nTo find the probability of no burglaries, we can use the Poisson distribution formula with k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-λ) * λ^0) / 0! = e^(-λ)\n\nNow, we can plug in our value for λ:\n\nP(X = 0) = e^(-14/30) ≈ 0.53526\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least one burglary:\n\nP(at least 1 burglary) = 1 - P(no burglaries) = 1 - 0.53526 ≈ 0.46474\n\nSo, the probability that a burglary occurs in the neighborhood within the next 7 days is approximately 46.47%."
