    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply add up the lengths of all four sides.\n\nPerimeter = (first parallel side) + (second parallel side) + (first non-parallel side) + (second non-parallel side)\n\nPerimeter = (7 cm) + (13 cm) + (5 cm) + (5 cm)\n\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 30 cm."
