Also, if the message \"23\" is to be encrypted, what is the ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To generate the RSA encryption keys, we first need to calculate n, φ(n), and then find suitable values for e and d.\n\n1. Calculate n:\nn = p * q\nn = 7 * 11\nn = 77\n\n2. Calculate φ(n) (Euler's totient function):\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nφ(n) = (7 - 1) * (11 - 1)\nφ(n) = 6 * 10\nφ(n) = 60\n\n3. Choose a value for e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 (e and φ(n) are coprime):\nWe can choose e = 13, as gcd(13, 60) = 1.\n\n4. Calculate d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1:\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)). In this case, d = 37, as (13 * 37) % 60 = 1.\n\nNow we have the public key (e, n) and private key (d, n):\nPublic key (e, n) = (13, 77)\nPrivate key (d, n) = (37, 77)\n\nTo encrypt the message \"23\", we use the public key (e, n) and the following formula:\nCiphertext = (Message ^ e) % n\nCiphertext = (23 ^ 13) % 77\nCiphertext = 62\n\nSo, the encrypted message (ciphertext) is 62."
