    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid is a fractal structure that is formed by recursively removing triangles from an equilateral triangle. In this case, we have a 9-layered pyramid with a base of 729 triangles. \n\nTo find the total number of triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = (base triangles) * (1 - (1/4)^n) / (1 - 1/4)\n\nwhere n is the number of layers in the pyramid.\n\nIn this case, n = 9 and the base has 729 triangles.\n\nTotal number of triangles = (729) * (1 - (1/4)^9) / (1 - 1/4)\nTotal number of triangles = (729) * (1 - 1/262144) / (3/4)\nTotal number of triangles = (729) * (262143/262144) / (3/4)\nTotal number of triangles = (729) * (262143/262144) * (4/3)\nTotal number of triangles = (972) * (262143/262144)\nTotal number of triangles ≈ 972 * 0.999996\nTotal number of triangles ≈ 971.996\n\nSince the number of triangles must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nTotal number of triangles ≈ 972\n\nSo, there are approximately 972 triangles in a 9-layered Sierpinski pyramid with a base of 729 triangles."
