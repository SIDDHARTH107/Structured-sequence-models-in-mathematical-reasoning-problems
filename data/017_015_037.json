    "message_2": "There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, which are:\n\n1. S_4 (Symmetric group on 4 elements)\n2. D_12 (Dihedral group of order 12)\n3. Z_2 × S_3 (Direct product of Z_2 and S_3)\n4. Z_2 × D_6 (Direct product of Z_2 and D_6)\n5. Q_8 × Z_3 (Direct product of the Quaternion group Q_8 and Z_3)\n\nLet's describe their structures and prove that they are non-isomorphic to each other as well as the cyclic group C24 and the alternating group A5.\n\n1. S_4: The symmetric group on 4 elements has order 4! = 24. It consists of all possible permutations of 4 elements. It is non-abelian, as there exist permutations that do not commute.\n\n2. D_12: The dihedral group of order 12 has order 2 * 12 = 24. It consists of the symmetries of a regular 12-gon, including rotations and reflections. It is non-abelian, as the rotations and reflections do not commute.\n\n3. Z_2 × S_3: The direct product of Z_2 and S_3 has order 2 * 6 = 24. It consists of pairs (a, b), where a is an element of Z_2 and b is an element of S_3. It is non-abelian, as S_3 is non-abelian.\n\n4. Z_2 × D_6: The direct product of Z_2 and D_6 has order 2 * 12 = 24. It consists of pairs (a, b), where a is an element of Z_2 and b is an element of D_6. It is non-abelian, as D_6 is non-abelian.\n\n5. Q_8 × Z_3: The direct product of the Quaternion group Q_8 and Z_3 has order 8 * 3 = 24. It consists of pairs (a, b), where a is an element of Q_8 and b is an element of Z_3. It is non-abelian, as Q_8 is non-abelian.\n\nNow, let's prove that these groups are non-isomorphic to each other, C24, and A5:\n\n- C24 is a cyclic group of order 24, which is abelian, so it cannot be isomorphic to any of the non-abelian groups listed above.\n- A5 is an alternating group on 5 elements with order 5! / 2 = 60, so it cannot be isomorphic to any of the groups of order 24.\n\nTo show that the five non-abelian groups are non-isomorphic to each other, we can use the following invariants:\n\n1. Center: The center of a group is the set of elements that commute with all other elements in the group. Non-isomorphic groups have different centers.\n2. Commutator subgroup: The commutator subgroup is generated by all commutators [a, b] = aba^(-1)b^(-1). Non-isomorphic groups have different commutator subgroups.\n\nUsing these invariants, we can show that the five non-abelian groups are non-isomorphic:\n\n- S_4 has a trivial center and its commutator subgroup is A_4.\n- D_12 has a center of order 2 and its commutator subgroup is Z_6.\n- Z_2 × S_3 has a center of order 2 and its commutator subgroup is Z_3.\n- Z_2 × D_6 has a center of order 4 and its commutator subgroup is Z_6.\n- Q_8 × Z_3 has a center of order 4 and its commutator subgroup is Z_2 × Z_3.\n\nSince these groups have different centers and commutator subgroups, they are non-isomorphic to each other."
