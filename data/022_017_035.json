    "message_2": "This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form $y(x) = e^{rx}$, where $r$ is a constant to be determined. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$(r^2 + 1)e^{rx} = 0$\n\nSince $e^{rx}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\n$r^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get two complex roots: $r_1 = i$ and $r_2 = -i$. Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 e^{ix} + C_2 e^{-ix}$\n\nNow we need to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the initial conditions. For $y(0) = 1$, we have:\n\n$1 = C_1 e^{0} + C_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow 1 = C_1 + C_2$\n\nFor $y'(0) = i$, we first find the derivative of $y(x)$:\n\n$y'(x) = iC_1 e^{ix} - iC_2 e^{-ix}$\n\nNow we apply the initial condition:\n\n$i = iC_1 e^{0} - iC_2 e^{0} \\Rightarrow i = i(C_1 - C_2)$\n\nDividing both sides by $i$, we get:\n\n$1 = C_1 - C_2$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n\n$C_1 + C_2 = 1$\n\n$C_1 - C_2 = 1$\n\nSolving this system, we find $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 0$. Therefore, the solution to the differential equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$y(x) = e^{ix}$"
