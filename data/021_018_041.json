    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, the given problem is a continuous optimization problem. Therefore, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve it.\n\nLet's rewrite the problem as follows:\n\nMinimize f(x, y) = -x^2 - y^2 + 4x + 4y\nSubject to g(x, y) = x + y - 4 = 0 and x, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will form the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = -x^2 - y^2 + 4x + 4y + λ(x + y - 4)\n\nNow, we will find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ:\n\n∂L/∂x = -2x + 4 + λ\n∂L/∂y = -2y + 4 + λ\n∂L/∂λ = x + y - 4\n\nNow, we will set the partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x, y, and λ:\n\n-2x + 4 + λ = 0\n-2y + 4 + λ = 0\nx + y - 4 = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nx = 2 - λ/2\ny = 2 - λ/2\n\nSubstituting x and y into the constraint equation:\n\n(2 - λ/2) + (2 - λ/2) - 4 = 0\n4 - λ = 4\nλ = 0\n\nNow, substituting λ back into the equations for x and y:\n\nx = 2 - 0/2 = 2\ny = 2 - 0/2 = 2\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function occurs at the point (x, y) = (2, 2). Now, we will find the minimum value of the function:\n\nf(2, 2) = -(2^2) - (2^2) + 4(2) + 4(2) = -4 - 4 + 8 + 8 = 8\n\nThus, the minimum value of the function f(x, y) = -x^2 - y^2 + 4x + 4y subject to the constraints x + y ≤ 4 and x, y ≥ 0 is 8."
