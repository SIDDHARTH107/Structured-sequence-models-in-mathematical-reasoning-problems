    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve process to a closed loop. In this case, we will consider the Koch island as being formed from an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1 unit.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length. The perimeter of the Koch island after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial number of segments) * (number of segments after nth iteration) * (length of each segment after nth iteration)\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nInitial number of segments = 3 (since we start with an equilateral triangle)\nNumber of segments after 5th iteration = 4^5 = 1024\nLength of each segment after 5th iteration = (1/3)^5 = 1/243\n\nPerimeter = 3 * 1024 * (1/243) = 3072/243 â‰ˆ 12.63 units"
