    "message_2": "To identify the automorphism group of the graph, we need to know the structure of the graph. Since there are multiple possible graphs with 6 vertices and 7 edges, we cannot determine the automorphism group without more information.\n\nPlease provide more information about the graph, such as adjacency matrix, adjacency list, or a description of the graph's structure."
