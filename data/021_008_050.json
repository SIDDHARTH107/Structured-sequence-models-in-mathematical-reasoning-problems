    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nwhere f1(x, y) = x - y - 1 and f2(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 5.\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 1\n∂f1/∂y = -1\n∂f2/∂x = 2x\n∂f2/∂y = 2y\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = |  1  -1 |\n          | 2x  2y |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial point (1, 2). The iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x, y) - J(x, y)^(-1) * F(x, y)\n\nwhere F(x, y) is the vector of the functions [f1(x, y), f2(x, y)].\n\nFor the initial point (1, 2), we have:\n\nJ(1, 2) = |  1  -1 |\n          |  2   4 |\n\nF(1, 2) = [1 - 2 - 1, 1^2 + 2^2 - 5] = [-2, 0]\n\nTo find J(1, 2)^(-1), we compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ(1, 2)^(-1) = (1 / det(J(1, 2))) * |  4   1 |\n                                       | -2   1 |\n\nwhere det(J(1, 2)) = 1 * 4 - (-1) * 2 = 6.\n\nSo, J(1, 2)^(-1) = (1/6) * |  4   1 |\n                           | -2   1 |\n\nNow, we compute the next iteration:\n\n(x, y) = (1, 2) - J(1, 2)^(-1) * F(1, 2)\n\n(x, y) = (1, 2) - (1/6) * |  4   1 | * |-2|\n                           | -2   1 |   | 0|\n\n(x, y) = (1, 2) - (1/6) * |-8|\n                           | 4|\n\n(x, y) = (1, 2) + (4/3, -2/3)\n\n(x, y) ≈ (2.333, 1.667)\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the approximate solution after one iteration of Newton's method is (2.333, 1.667)."
