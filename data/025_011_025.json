    "message_2": "Let A be an Abelian variety over a field k of characteristic 0, and let L be a polarization of degree d on A. We want to show that the function f(x) = degree(x) - d is bounded on A(k).\n\nFirst, recall that a polarization L on A is an ample line bundle on A, and the degree of a point x in A(k) is the degree of the divisor [x] associated to x. Since L is ample, there exists a positive integer n such that L^n is very ample. This means that there exists an embedding φ: A → P^N given by the complete linear system |L^n| for some N.\n\nNow, consider the image of A(k) under this embedding, which is a set of points in P^N(k). Since A is an Abelian variety, it is a projective variety, and its image under φ is a closed subvariety of P^N. Moreover, the degree of a point x in A(k) is equal to the degree of the point φ(x) in P^N(k) with respect to the hyperplane divisor class.\n\nLet H be a hyperplane in P^N. Then the intersection of A with H is a divisor D on A, and we have:\n\ndegree(x) = degree([x]) = degree(D)\n\nNow, we have the following relation between the degrees of divisors on A and their intersection with the polarization L:\n\ndegree(D) = D · L^{dim(A) - 1}\n\nSince L is a polarization of degree d, we have:\n\ndegree(x) = D · L^{dim(A) - 1} = d · (D · L^{dim(A) - 2})\n\nNow, consider the function f(x) = degree(x) - d. We have:\n\nf(x) = d · (D · L^{dim(A) - 2}) - d\n\nSince A is a projective variety, the intersection numbers (D · L^{dim(A) - 2}) are integers. Therefore, f(x) takes integer values. Moreover, the intersection numbers are bounded because A is a closed subvariety of P^N, and the intersection of A with hyperplanes in P^N can only produce a finite number of distinct divisors on A.\n\nThus, the function f(x) = degree(x) - d is bounded on A(k), as desired."
