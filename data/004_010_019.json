    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x² + 4x - 7, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x² + 4x - 7) dx\n\nNow, we will integrate each term separately:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x²) dx + ∫(4x) dx - ∫(7) dx\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, which states that ∫(x^n) dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration, we get:\n\nF(x) = (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) + (4x^(1+1))/(1+1) - (7x^(0+1))/(0+1) + C\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nF(x) = (3x^3)/3 + (4x^2)/2 - 7x + C\n\nF(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x² + 4x - 7 is F(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
