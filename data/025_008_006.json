    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of H³(X, ℤ), we can use the cohomology ring structure of X and the blow-up formula. Let's first recall some basic facts about the cohomology of algebraic curves and blow-ups.\n\nFor a smooth projective algebraic curve C of genus g, we have the following Betti numbers:\n\nb₀(C) = 1 (since C is connected),\nb₁(C) = 2g (by the Hodge decomposition),\nb₂(C) = 1 (since C is a compact Riemann surface of genus g).\n\nNow, let X be the blow-up of C at a single point P. The blow-up replaces the point P with a new curve E, which is a projective line (or a rational curve). The cohomology of X can be computed using the blow-up formula:\n\nH^k(X, ℤ) = H^k(C, ℤ) ⊕ H^{k-2}(C, ℤ) ⊕ ... ⊕ H^{k-2r}(C, ℤ),\n\nwhere r is the codimension of the point P in C (in this case, r = 1).\n\nUsing this formula, we can compute the cohomology groups of X:\n\nH^0(X, ℤ) = H^0(C, ℤ) = ℤ (since X is connected),\nH^1(X, ℤ) = H^1(C, ℤ) = ℤ^{2g} (by the Hodge decomposition),\nH^2(X, ℤ) = H^2(C, ℤ) ⊕ H^0(C, ℤ) = ℤ ⊕ ℤ = ℤ^2 (by the blow-up formula),\nH^3(X, ℤ) = H^1(C, ℤ) = ℤ^{2g} (by the blow-up formula).\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of H³(X, ℤ):\n\ndim H³(X, ℤ) = 2g = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nSo, the dimension of the vector space H³(X, ℤ) of integer cohomology classes of degree 3 on X is 6."
