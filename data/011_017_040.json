    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n × n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3 × 3 Latin square using the digits 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's consider the first row and first column. We can place any of the three digits in the top-left cell. Without loss of generality, let's fix the top-left cell to be 1. Now, there are two remaining options for the top-middle cell (2 or 3) and two remaining options for the middle-left cell (also 2 or 3).\n\nCase 1: Top-middle cell is 2 and middle-left cell is 3.\nThe remaining cells in the first column and first row must be filled with 3 and 2, respectively. This leaves only one option for the bottom-left and top-right cells (1 and 1). The remaining cells can be filled in only one way to satisfy the Latin square conditions:\n\n1 2 3\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\nCase 2: Top-middle cell is 3 and middle-left cell is 2.\nSimilar to Case 1, the remaining cells in the first column and first row must be filled with 2 and 3, respectively. This leaves only one option for the bottom-left and top-right cells (1 and 1). The remaining cells can be filled in only one way to satisfy the Latin square conditions:\n\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 1\n\nThus, there are 2 different 3 × 3 Latin squares that can be made using the digits 1, 2, and 3."
