    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we need to eliminate one of the variables by adding or subtracting the equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y the same:\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n6x + 8y = 44\n\nSecond equation * 3:\n6x - 9y = 3\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(6x + 8y) - (6x - 9y) = 44 - 3\n6x + 8y - 6x + 9y = 41\n17y = 41\n\nNow, divide by 17 to find the value of y:\n\ny = 41 / 17\ny = 2.41176470588 (approximately)\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find the value of x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 22\n3x + 4(2.41176470588) = 22\n3x + 9.64705882352 = 22\n\nSubtract 9.64705882352 from both sides:\n\n3x = 12.3529411765\n\nNow, divide by 3 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 12.3529411765 / 3\nx = 4.11764705882 (approximately)\n\nSo, the approximate values of x and y are:\n\nx ≈ 4.118\ny ≈ 2.412"
