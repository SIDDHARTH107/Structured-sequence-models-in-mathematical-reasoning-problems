    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space of global sections of the sheaf Intersection Cohomology complex of X with coefficients in the sheaf of rational functions on C, we will use the following formula:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(X, IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C) = \\chi(X, IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C)$$\n\nwhere $\\chi$ denotes the Euler characteristic. We can compute the Euler characteristic using the Riemann-Roch theorem for the tensor product of two sheaves:\n\n$$\\chi(X, IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C) = \\deg(IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C) + \\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the degree of the tensor product of the sheaves $IC_X$ and $\\mathcal{O}_C$. Since $X$ and $C$ intersect transversely at $n$ distinct points, we have:\n\n$$\\deg(IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C) = \\deg(IC_X) + \\deg(\\mathcal{O}_C) = n$$\n\nNext, we need to compute the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_X$. This can be done using the genus formula:\n\n$$\\chi(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1 - g$$\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus of the curve $X$. Now, we can plug these values back into the Riemann-Roch formula:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(X, IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C) = n + (1 - g) = n - g + 1$$\n\nSo the dimension of the vector space of global sections of the sheaf Intersection Cohomology complex of $X$ with coefficients in the sheaf of rational functions on $C$ is given by:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(X, IC_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_C) = n - g + 1$$"
