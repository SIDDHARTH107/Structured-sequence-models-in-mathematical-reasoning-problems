The winner is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the chosen numbers. \n\n---> What number should a player choose to have the highest chance of winning the game, assuming there are 10 players and they are not allowed to communicate with each other?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game, a player should try to predict the average number chosen by the other players and then choose 2/3 of that number. This is because the winning number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and know that the other players are also rational. In this case, each player will think about the following:\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be around 50.\n2. Since all players are rational, they will think that the other players will also choose 2/3 of the average, which is 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n3. Now, if all players think that the other players will choose around 33.33, they will choose 2/3 of 33.33, which is 22.22.\n4. This process can be repeated, and the chosen numbers will keep getting smaller.\n\nHowever, since there are only 10 players and they cannot communicate with each other, it is difficult to predict how many iterations of this thought process each player will go through. Therefore, it is challenging to determine the exact number a player should choose to maximize their chances of winning.\n\nIn practice, a player can choose a number between 20 and 30, as this range is likely to be close to 2/3 of the average of the chosen numbers after a few iterations of the thought process. However, there is no guarantee that this strategy will always result in a win, as the outcome depends on the choices made by the other players."
