    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4 on the interval [0, 5], we'll first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero.\n\nf(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 4\nf'(x) = 4x + 3\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n4x + 3 = 0\n4x = -3\nx = -3/4\n\nSince the critical point x = -3/4 is not in the interval [0, 5], we need to check the endpoints of the interval to find the maximum value of f(x).\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^2 + 3(0) - 4 = -4\nf(5) = 2(5)^2 + 3(5) - 4 = 50 + 15 - 4 = 61\n\nSince f(5) > f(0), the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [0, 5] is 61, which occurs at x = 5."
