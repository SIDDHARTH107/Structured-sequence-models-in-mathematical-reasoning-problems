    "message_1": "Consider the set of first-order sentences over the language {(0), +}, where (0) is a constant for the additive identity and + is a binary function for addition. Determine whether the sentence \"forall x exists y (x+y=0)\" is valid in the group of integers under addition.",
    "message_2": "Yes, the sentence \"forall x exists y (x+y=0)\" is valid in the group of integers under addition. \n\nTo show this, we need to prove that for every integer x, there exists an integer y such that x + y = 0. In the group of integers under addition, the additive inverse of an integer x is its negation, denoted as -x. \n\nFor any integer x, we have x + (-x) = 0, which means that the additive inverse of x exists and is equal to -x. Therefore, the sentence \"forall x exists y (x+y=0)\" holds true for the group of integers under addition."
