The treewidth is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the graph G:\n\n```\n  1---2---6\n  |\\  |\\\n  | \\ | \\\n  |  \\|  \\\n  3---4---5\n   \\  | /\n    \\ |/\n      8\n```\n\nNow, let's find a tree decomposition of G. One possible tree decomposition is:\n\n```\n  T1 = {1, 2, 4}\n  T2 = {1, 3, 4}\n  T3 = {1, 4, 5}\n  T4 = {2, 4, 5}\n  T5 = {2, 4, 6}\n  T6 = {4, 5, 8}\n  T7 = {4, 7, 8}\n\nEdges in the tree decomposition:\n  (T1, T2), (T1, T3), (T1, T4), (T1, T5), (T3, T6), (T6, T7)\n```\n\nThe width of this tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, all bags have 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSince we have found a tree decomposition with width 2, the treewidth of the graph G is at most 2. It is also easy to see that the treewidth cannot be smaller than 2, as there are vertices with degree 3 in the graph. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph G is 2."
