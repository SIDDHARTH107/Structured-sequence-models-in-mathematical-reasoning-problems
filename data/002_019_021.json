    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 5 cm and l = 12 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 12)\nSurface Area = π(5)(17)\nSurface Area = 85π\n\nNow, we will approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 85 * 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 267.1 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 267.1 cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth."
