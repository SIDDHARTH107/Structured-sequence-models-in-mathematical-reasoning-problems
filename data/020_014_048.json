    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit from selling each unit of product A is $10 and each unit of product B is $15. The production process for product A requires 2 units of labor and 1 unit of material, while the production process for product B requires 1 unit of labor and 3 units of material. The company has 10 units of labor and 18 units of material available. Determine the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce in order to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nThe constraints for labor and material are:\n\n2x + y ≤ 10 (labor constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 18 (material constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y ≤ 10 - 2x\n2. Material constraint: y ≤ (18 - x) / 3\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these constraints. Now, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis: (5, 0)\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and material constraint: (4, 2)\n3. Intersection of material constraint and y-axis: (0, 6)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Profit at (5, 0): 10(5) + 15(0) = $50\n2. Profit at (4, 2): 10(4) + 15(2) = $70\n3. Profit at (0, 6): 10(0) + 15(6) = $90\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 6), where the company produces 0 units of product A and 6 units of product B. The maximum profit is $90."
