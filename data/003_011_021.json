    "message_1": "A lighthouse is located on a cliff that is 100 meters above the sea level. From the top of the lighthouse, the angle of depression to a boat is 30 degrees. How far is the boat from the base of the cliff, to the nearest meter? (Assume that the lighthouse is situated perpendicular to the sea level.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We will use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the cliff (100 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance from the base of the cliff to the boat, which we will call x.\n\nWe know that the angle of depression from the top of the lighthouse to the boat is 30 degrees. Since the lighthouse is perpendicular to the sea level, the angle between the sea level and the line of sight from the top of the lighthouse to the boat is also 30 degrees.\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(30°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30°) = 100 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 100 / tan(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 100 / 0.57735\nx ≈ 173.21\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the boat is approximately 173 meters away from the base of the cliff."
