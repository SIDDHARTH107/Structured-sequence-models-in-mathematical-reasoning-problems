    "message_2": "To use the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to find a function that represents the velocity of the car as a function of time. Let v(t) be the velocity of the car at time t. We know that the initial velocity is 20 m/s and after 10 seconds, its velocity is 60 m/s. We can assume that the car has a constant acceleration, so its velocity function will be linear.\n\nv(t) = at + v0\n\nwhere a is the acceleration and v0 is the initial velocity. We know that v(0) = 20 m/s and v(10) = 60 m/s. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nv(0) = a(0) + 20\n20 = 20\n\nv(10) = a(10) + 20\n60 = 10a + 20\n\nSolving for a, we get:\n\n40 = 10a\na = 4 m/s^2\n\nNow we know the acceleration is constant and equal to 4 m/s^2. The velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = 4t + 20\n\nNow we can apply the Mean Value Theorem. The theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn our case, the function v(t) is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 10]. The average rate of change of the velocity function over this interval is:\n\n(v(10) - v(0)) / (10 - 0) = (60 - 20) / 10 = 40 / 10 = 4 m/s^2\n\nNow we need to find a point c in the interval (0, 10) such that the derivative of the velocity function at c is equal to 4 m/s^2. Since the acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function, we have:\n\na(t) = dv/dt = 4\n\nSince the acceleration is constant and equal to 4 m/s^2 for all t in the interval (0, 10), the Mean Value Theorem is satisfied for any point c in this interval. Therefore, there exists a point on the road where the acceleration of the car is exactly 4 m/s^2, and this is true for any point in the interval (0, 10)."
