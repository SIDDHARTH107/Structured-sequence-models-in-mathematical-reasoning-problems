    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 2 > 8x - 10, we'll first isolate x on one side of the inequality.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality.\n3x + 2 - 3x > 8x - 10 - 3x\n2 > 5x - 10\n\nStep 2: Add 10 to both sides of the inequality.\n2 + 10 > 5x - 10 + 10\n12 > 5x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 5.\n12/5 > 5x/5\n12/5 > x\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < 12/5."
