    "message_2": "To find all non-abelian groups of order 96 up to isomorphism, we will use the Sylow theorems and the fact that a group of order 96 can be written as a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3. Since both are normal, the group G is the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is abelian. So, this case does not give any non-abelian groups.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, which is normal. The Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 is not normal, but we can still form a semi-direct product. P_2 is a group of order 32, which has three possibilities up to isomorphism: Z_32, Z_2 x Z_16, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_8. P_3 is a group of order 3, which has only one possibility up to isomorphism: Z_3.\n\nNow we consider the semi-direct products:\n\n1. Z_32 ⋊ Z_3: There are two non-trivial automorphisms of Z_32, given by x ↦ x^3 and x ↦ x^9. This gives two non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 96: Z_32 ⋊_1 Z_3 and Z_32 ⋊_9 Z_3.\n\n2. (Z_2 x Z_16) ⋊ Z_3: There are four non-trivial automorphisms of Z_2 x Z_16, given by (x, y) ↦ (x, y^3), (x, y) ↦ (x, y^5), (x, y) ↦ (x, y^9), and (x, y) ↦ (x, y^15). This gives four non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\n3. (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_8) ⋊ Z_3: There are two non-trivial automorphisms of Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_8, given by (x, y, z) ↦ (x, y, z^3) and (x, y, z) ↦ (x, y, z^5). This gives two non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, which is normal. The Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 is not normal, but we can still form a semi-direct product. P_2 is a group of order 32, which has three possibilities up to isomorphism: Z_32, Z_2 x Z_16, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_8. P_3 is a group of order 3, which has only one possibility up to isomorphism: Z_3.\n\nHowever, since P_2 is normal and P_3 is not, the semi-direct product will be a direct product, which is abelian. So, this case does not give any non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, we have found 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 96."
