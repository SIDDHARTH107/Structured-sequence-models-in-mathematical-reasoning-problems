    "message_2": "Let's denote the generator of G as g = 5. Since G is a cyclic group, every element in G can be expressed as a power of g, i.e., g^k for some integer k.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H of G with order 3. This means that H has 3 elements, including the identity element. Let's denote the generator of H as h. Since H is a subgroup of G, h must also be an element of G. Therefore, h can be expressed as a power of g, i.e., h = g^k for some integer k.\n\nThe order of h in H is 3, which means that h^3 = 1 (the identity element in G). So, we have (g^k)^3 = g^(3k) = 1. We need to find the smallest positive integer k such that g^(3k) = 1.\n\nSince G is generated by 5, we know that the order of G is a divisor of 5. The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5. If the order of G is 1, then G is the trivial group, which is not cyclic. Therefore, the order of G must be 5.\n\nNow, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). In our case, p = 5 and a = g = 5. So, we have 5^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5). This means that the smallest positive integer k such that g^(3k) = 1 is k = 4/3.\n\nHowever, k must be an integer, so we need to find the smallest multiple of 4/3 that is an integer. The smallest such multiple is 4, which is obtained by multiplying 4/3 by 3. Therefore, the generator of H is h = g^4 = 5^4 = 625."
