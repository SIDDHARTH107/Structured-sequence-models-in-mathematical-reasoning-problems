    "message_1": "Suppose $f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 2$ is a complex valued function defined on the complex plane. Find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the circle $|z| = 2$.",
    "message_2": "Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, we can rewrite $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = (x + yi)^2 + 2(x + yi) + 2 = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2) + (2xy + 2y)i$.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the circle $|z| = 2$. We can rewrite the equation for the circle as $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. \n\nThe modulus of $f(z)$ is given by:\n\n$|f(z)| = \\sqrt{(x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)^2 + (2xy + 2y)^2}$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function $g(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)^2 + (2xy + 2y)^2$, and the constraint function $h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4$. Then, we want to find the maximum value of $g(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $h(x, y) = 0$.\n\nThe gradient of $g(x, y)$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla g(x, y) = \\left(4(x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)(2x + 2) + 4(2xy + 2y)(2y), -4(x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)(2y) + 4(2xy + 2y)(2x)\\right)$.\n\nThe gradient of $h(x, y)$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla h(x, y) = (2x, 2y)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the values of $x$ and $y$ such that $\\nabla g(x, y) = \\lambda \\nabla h(x, y)$ for some real number $\\lambda$. This gives us the system of equations:\n\n$4(x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)(2x + 2) + 4(2xy + 2y)(2y) = 2x\\lambda$,\n$-4(x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 2)(2y) + 4(2xy + 2y)(2x) = 2y\\lambda$.\n\nWe also have the constraint equation $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. Solving this system of equations, we find that there are two critical points: $(x, y) = (1, \\pm\\sqrt{3})$. \n\nNow, we can compute the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ at these critical points:\n\n$|f(1 + \\sqrt{3}i)| = \\sqrt{(1 - 3 + 2 + 2)^2 + (2 + 2\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 8^2} = 2\\sqrt{17}$.\n\nSince both critical points give the same value of $|f(z)|$, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the circle $|z| = 2$ is $2\\sqrt{17}$."
