    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees, we need to take the inverse sine (also known as arcsin) of 0.6. \n\nx = arcsin(0.6)\n\nNow, we need to convert this value from radians to degrees. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180/π)\n\nFirst, let's find the value of x in radians:\n\nx ≈ 0.6435 radians (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nNow, let's convert this to degrees:\n\nx ≈ 0.6435 * (180/π)\nx ≈ 36.9 degrees (rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree)\n\nSo, if sin(x) = 0.6, the value of x is approximately 36.9 degrees."
