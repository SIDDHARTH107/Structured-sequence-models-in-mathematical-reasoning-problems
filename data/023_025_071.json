    "message_1": "A metal bar is heated so that its temperature varies with time. The temperature can be represented as a function of time, where t is measured in seconds and T is measured in degrees Celsius, given by the equation T(t) = 50 + 25sin(4πt) + 10cos(8πt) + 5sin(12πt).\n\nUsing Fourier analysis, determine the amplitude, frequency, and phase angle of the first three terms of this temperature function.",
    "message_2": "The given temperature function is T(t) = 50 + 25sin(4πt) + 10cos(8πt) + 5sin(12πt).\n\nWe can rewrite each term in the form A*cos(ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\n1st term: 50\nThis is a constant term, so we can rewrite it as:\n50*cos(0) = 50*cos(0t + 0)\nAmplitude (A1) = 50\nAngular frequency (ω1) = 0\nPhase angle (φ1) = 0\n\n2nd term: 25sin(4πt)\nWe can rewrite this term using the sine-to-cosine identity: sin(x) = cos(x - π/2)\n25sin(4πt) = 25*cos(4πt - π/2)\nAmplitude (A2) = 25\nAngular frequency (ω2) = 4π\nPhase angle (φ2) = -π/2\n\n3rd term: 10cos(8πt)\nThis term is already in the desired form:\nAmplitude (A3) = 10\nAngular frequency (ω3) = 8π\nPhase angle (φ3) = 0\n\nSo, the amplitude, frequency, and phase angle of the first three terms are:\n\n1st term: A1 = 50, ω1 = 0, φ1 = 0\n2nd term: A2 = 25, ω2 = 4π, φ2 = -π/2\n3rd term: A3 = 10, ω3 = 8π, φ3 = 0"
