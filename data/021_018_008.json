    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of solving optimization problems using tabu search:\n\nA company has to assign 10 employees to 5 different tasks in a way that maximizes productivity. Each employee has a different skill set that makes them more suitable for certain tasks. Each task needs a specific number of employees to be completed optimally; Task 1 needs 2 employees, Task 2 needs 3, Task 3 needs 1, Task 4 needs 2, and Task 5 needs 2. Each employee can only work on one task. The productivity score for each assignment of employees to tasks is given in the table below:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Employee ID</th><th>Task 1</th><th>Task 2</th><th>Task 3</th><th>Task 4</th><th>Task 5</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>60</td><td>70</td><td>80</td><td>90</td><td>95</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>70</td><td>80</td><td>75</td><td>85</td><td>90</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>75</td><td>55</td><td>80</td><td>85</td><td>95</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>85</td><td>80</td><td>70</td><td>90</td><td>75</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>90</td><td>60</td><td>75</td><td>80</td><td>85</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>95</td><td>75</td><td>85</td><td>70</td><td>90</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7</td><td>80</td><td>90</td><td>75</td><td>95</td><td>70</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8</td><td>70</td><td>75</td><td>70</td><td>60</td><td>95</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9</td><td>75</td><td>85</td><td>65</td><td>85</td><td>70</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10</td><td>85</td><td>75</td><td>70</td><td>90</td><td>85</td></tr>\n</table>\n\nUse tabu search to find the assignment of employees to tasks that maximizes productivity while meeting the constraints.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate an initial solution.\n2. Define a neighborhood structure.\n3. Perform a local search in the neighborhood.\n4. Update the tabu list.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Generate an initial solution\nLet's assign employees to tasks randomly while respecting the constraints:\n\n- Task 1: Employees 1 and 2\n- Task 2: Employees 3, 4, and 5\n- Task 3: Employee 6\n- Task 4: Employees 7 and 8\n- Task 5: Employees 9 and 10\n\nStep 2: Define a neighborhood structure\nA neighborhood can be defined as swapping the tasks assigned to two employees.\n\nStep 3: Perform a local search in the neighborhood\nWe will evaluate all possible swaps between employees and choose the one that results in the highest increase in productivity. If a swap results in an infeasible solution (violates the constraints), we will discard it.\n\nStep 4: Update the tabu list\nWe will maintain a tabu list of the last few swaps to prevent cycling back to previous solutions. The tabu tenure (number of iterations a move remains tabu) can be set to a fixed value, e.g., 5.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met\nWe can set a stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of iterations or a maximum allowed time.\n\nAfter performing the tabu search, we will obtain an optimized assignment of employees to tasks that maximizes productivity while meeting the constraints. Note that the tabu search is a heuristic algorithm, and the solution obtained may not be the global optimum. However, it is generally effective in finding good solutions for complex combinatorial optimization problems like this one."
