    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 72 and consider the possible ways to construct groups using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2 (p = 2), the Sylow theorems state that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide the index 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\nFor the prime factor 3 (p = 3), the Sylow theorems state that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide the index 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we have the following cases to consider:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal, and their intersection is trivial. Therefore, the group is a direct product of these subgroups, which gives us one group: Z_8 x Z_9.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. However, there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, which are not necessarily normal. We can have two possible groups in this case: Z_8 x (Z_3 x Z_3) and Z_8 x S_3 (where S_3 is the symmetric group of degree 3).\n\n3. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. However, there are nine Sylow 2-subgroups, which are not necessarily normal. We can have two possible groups in this case: (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) x Z_9 and Q_8 x Z_9 (where Q_8 is the quaternion group of order 8).\n\n4. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4: In this case, both the Sylow 2-subgroups and the Sylow 3-subgroups are not necessarily normal. However, there are no non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
