    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces batteries with a defect rate of 7%. If a customer purchases 50 batteries, what is the probability that at least 2 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective batteries, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of choosing x defective batteries from n total batteries, p is the probability of a battery being defective (0.07 in this case), and n is the total number of batteries (50 in this case).\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 2 defective batteries, which means we need to find the probability of having 2, 3, 4, ..., 50 defective batteries and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of having 0 or 1 defective battery and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we need to find P(0) and P(1):\n\nP(0) = C(50, 0) * (0.07)^0 * (1-0.07)^(50-0)\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * (0.93)^50\nP(0) ≈ 0.000045\n\nP(1) = C(50, 1) * (0.07)^1 * (1-0.07)^(50-1)\nP(1) = 50 * 0.07 * (0.93)^49\nP(1) ≈ 0.000315\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 2 defective batteries:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.000045 - 0.000315\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.99964\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 2 defective batteries is approximately 0.99964 or 99.964%."
