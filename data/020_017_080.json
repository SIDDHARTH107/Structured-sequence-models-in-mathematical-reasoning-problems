    "message_2": "To find the optimal value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 12 within the range [0, 5], we can first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 8x + 12)\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 8\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x - 8\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nNow we have a critical point at x = 4. We need to check the endpoints of the range [0, 5] as well to make sure we find the minimum value within the given range.\n\nf(0) = (0)^2 - 8(0) + 12 = 12\nf(4) = (4)^2 - 8(4) + 12 = 4\nf(5) = (5)^2 - 8(5) + 12 = 1\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical point and the endpoints, we find that the optimal value of x that minimizes the function within the range [0, 5] is x = 5, with a minimum value of f(5) = 1."
