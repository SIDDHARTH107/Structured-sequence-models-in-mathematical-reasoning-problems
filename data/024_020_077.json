    "message_2": "Given a point p = (x, y, z, w) on the 3-dimensional unit sphere S³ in R⁴, we have the constraint x² + y² + z² + w² = 1, since the radius of the unit sphere is 1.\n\nNow, we want to find the Hopf map h(p) = (u, v, t) ∈ S², where h: S³ -> S² is defined by h(p) = (x² + y², xz + yw, xw - yz)/(x² + y² + z² + w²).\n\nSince x² + y² + z² + w² = 1, we can simplify the Hopf map as follows:\n\nh(p) = (x² + y², xz + yw, xw - yz)\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates (u, v, t) of the Hopf map:\n\nu = x² + y²\nv = xz + yw\nt = xw - yz\n\nSo, the Hopf map h(p) = (u, v, t) is given by:\n\nh(p) = (x² + y², xz + yw, xw - yz)\n\nThis is the Hopf map of the manifold at point p on the 3-dimensional unit sphere S³ in R⁴."
