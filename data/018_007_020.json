    "message_1": "Let S = {1, 2, 3}. Determine the size of the power set of S, and compare this to the size of S itself. Does this support the statement that the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself?",
    "message_2": "The power set of a set S is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. In this case, S = {1, 2, 3}. To find the power set of S, we list all possible subsets:\n\n1. {}\n2. {1}\n3. {2}\n4. {3}\n5. {1, 2}\n6. {1, 3}\n7. {2, 3}\n8. {1, 2, 3}\n\nThere are 8 elements in the power set of S.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of S to the size of S itself. The size of S is 3 (since it has 3 elements: 1, 2, and 3), and the size of the power set of S is 8. Since 8 > 3, this supports the statement that the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself. In general, for a set with n elements, its power set will have 2^n elements, which is always greater than n for any non-negative integer n."
