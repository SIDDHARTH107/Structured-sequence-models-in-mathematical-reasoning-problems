    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person in the group. This person can either know or not know each of the other 5 people in the group. So, there are 2 possibilities for each of the 5 relationships, which means there are 2^5 = 32 possible combinations of relationships for this person.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the cases where there are at least 3 people who know each other or 3 people who are strangers to each other. If this person knows at least 3 people, then either these 3 people all know each other (forming a group of 3 who all know each other) or they are all strangers to each other (forming a group of 3 who are all strangers). The same applies if this person does not know at least 3 people.\n\nSo, we can rephrase the problem as: \"What is the minimum number of people this person must know (or not know) to ensure that there exists a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other?\"\n\nUsing the Pigeonhole Principle, we can divide the 5 other people into 2 \"pigeonholes\" (people this person knows and people this person does not know). To ensure that at least one of these pigeonholes contains 3 people, we can use the formula:\n\n(number of pigeonholes - 1) * (number of people per pigeonhole) + 1 = minimum number of people\n\n(2 - 1) * (3 - 1) + 1 = 3\n\nSo, this person must know (or not know) at least 3 people to ensure that there exists a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, where this person knows exactly 3 people and does not know the other 2. In this case, there are 3 pairs of people among the 3 people this person knows and 1 pair among the 2 people this person does not know. So, there are a total of 3 + 1 = 4 pairs of people.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pairs of people that must know each other in order to ensure that there exists a group of 3 people who all know each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other is 4."
