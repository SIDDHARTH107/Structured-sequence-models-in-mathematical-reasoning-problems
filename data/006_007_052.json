    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the stock price, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding change in price and then add the results.\n\nExpected change = (Probability of increase * Increase in price) + (Probability of decrease * Decrease in price)\n\nExpected change = (0.4 * $10) + (0.3 * -$5)\n\nExpected change = ($4) + (-$1.5)\n\nExpected change = $2.5\n\nThe expected change in the stock price is $2.5."
