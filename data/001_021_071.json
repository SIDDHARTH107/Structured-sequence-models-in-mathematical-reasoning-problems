    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 6x = 0, we can first factor out the common factor of x:\n\nx(3x^2 - 9x + 6) = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation inside the parentheses. We can try to factor it further:\n\n3x^2 - 9x + 6 = 3(x^2 - 3x + 2)\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic equation inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial equation is:\n\nx * 3(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the solutions by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n1) x = 0\n2) x - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n3) x - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nSo, the solutions to the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 6x = 0 are x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2."
