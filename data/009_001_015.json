    "message_1": "A certain city has a population of 1 million people, and it is growing at a rate proportional to the number of people present. If the current growth rate is 2% per year, what will the population of the city be in 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the population of the city in 10 years, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nP(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, P0 = 1,000,000, r = 0.02 (2% as a decimal), and t = 10.\n\nP(10) = 1,000,000 * (1 + 0.02)^10\nP(10) = 1,000,000 * (1.02)^10\nP(10) ≈ 1,000,000 * 1.218994\nP(10) ≈ 1,218,994\n\nSo, the population of the city in 10 years will be approximately 1,218,994 people."
