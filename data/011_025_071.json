    "message_1": "A game has 10 rounds, each round consists of rolling an 8-sided die. What is the probability of getting at least one 8 in all 10 rounds?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least one 8 in all 10 rounds, we can first find the probability of not getting an 8 in any of the rounds and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not getting an 8 in a single round is 7/8 (since there are 7 other outcomes). Since each round is independent, the probability of not getting an 8 in all 10 rounds is (7/8)^10.\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting at least one 8 in all 10 rounds, we subtract the probability of not getting an 8 in any round from 1:\n\n1 - (7/8)^10 â‰ˆ 0.7368\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one 8 in all 10 rounds is approximately 73.68%."
