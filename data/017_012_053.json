    "message_2": "Since there exists an element in G of order 16, let's denote this element as a. Then, by definition, a^16 = e (the identity element), and a^k ≠ e for any k < 16. \n\nNow, we know that G has 16 elements, and since a has order 16, the elements {e, a, a^2, a^3, ..., a^15} are all distinct elements in G. Therefore, G is generated by the element a, and G = ⟨a⟩.\n\nSince G is generated by a single element, it is a cyclic group. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16. The dihedral group D8 and the non-abelian group of order 16 are not cyclic, so G cannot be isomorphic to them."
