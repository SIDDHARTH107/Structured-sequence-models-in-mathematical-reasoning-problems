    "message_1": "A company's website has an average of 1500 unique visitors per day. What is the probability that there will be at least 1900 unique visitors on a particular day? Use a Poisson distribution, assuming that visitors arrive randomly and independently throughout the day.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k unique visitors\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of unique visitors (1500 in this case)\n- k is the number of unique visitors we want to find the probability for (1900 in this case)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nHowever, since we want to find the probability of having at least 1900 unique visitors, we need to find the complement of the probability of having fewer than 1900 visitors. In other words:\n\nP(X ≥ 1900) = 1 - P(X < 1900)\n\nTo find P(X < 1900), we need to sum the probabilities of having 0 to 1899 unique visitors:\n\nP(X < 1900) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 1899)\n\nCalculating this sum directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Poisson distribution, which gives the probability of having a value less than or equal to a given value:\n\nP(X ≤ k) = Σ (e^(-λ) * λ^i) / i! for i = 0 to k\n\nIn our case, we want P(X < 1900), so we need to find P(X ≤ 1899):\n\nP(X < 1900) = P(X ≤ 1899) = Σ (e^(-1500) * 1500^i) / i! for i = 0 to 1899\n\nNow we can find the probability of having at least 1900 unique visitors:\n\nP(X ≥ 1900) = 1 - P(X < 1900) = 1 - P(X ≤ 1899)\n\nCalculating this probability directly is still computationally intensive. Instead, we can use statistical software or online calculators to find the Poisson CDF value for λ = 1500 and k = 1899.\n\nUsing a Poisson CDF calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X ≤ 1899) ≈ 0.9834\n\nNow we can find the probability of having at least 1900 unique visitors:\n\nP(X ≥ 1900) = 1 - P(X ≤ 1899) = 1 - 0.9834 ≈ 0.0166\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 1900 unique visitors on a particular day is approximately 1.66%."
