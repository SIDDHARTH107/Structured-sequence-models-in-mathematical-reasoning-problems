    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 5x - 12 > 3x + 8, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality.\n5x - 3x - 12 > 3x - 3x + 8\n2x - 12 > 8\n\nStep 2: Add 12 to both sides of the inequality.\n2x - 12 + 12 > 8 + 12\n2x > 20\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 2.\n2x / 2 > 20 / 2\nx > 10\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x > 10."
