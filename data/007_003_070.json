    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 4832 is divided by 9 using modular arithmetic, we can break down the number into its digits and apply the rule that the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9.\n\n4832 ≡ 4 * 10^3 + 8 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1 + 2 * 10^0 (mod 9)\n\nNow, we can apply the property that a^k ≡ 1 (mod 9) for any integer a not divisible by 9 and k = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, 10^3 ≡ 1 (mod 9), 10^2 ≡ 1 (mod 9), 10^1 ≡ 1 (mod 9), and 10^0 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into our original equation:\n\n4832 ≡ 4 * 1 + 8 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 2 * 1 (mod 9)\n4832 ≡ 4 + 8 + 3 + 2 (mod 9)\n4832 ≡ 17 (mod 9)\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when 17 is divided by 9:\n\n17 ≡ 8 (mod 9)\n\nSo, the remainder when 4832 is divided by 9 is 8."
