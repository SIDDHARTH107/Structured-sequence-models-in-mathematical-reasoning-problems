    "message_2": "To find the order of the group of points on $E$ generated by $P$, we need to compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$. We can do this by repeatedly applying the point addition operation on $E$.\n\nFirst, let's find the point $2P$. To do this, we need to compute the slope of the tangent line to $E$ at the point $P$. Using the equation of the elliptic curve, we have:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7$\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 5$\n\nNow, we can plug in the coordinates of $P = (2, -3)$:\n\n$-6\\frac{dy}{dx} = 7$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{7}{6}$\n\nNow, we can use the slope to find the coordinates of $2P$. The tangent line equation is:\n\n$y - (-3) = -\\frac{7}{6}(x - 2)$\n\nNow, we can plug this equation back into the equation of the elliptic curve to find the $x$-coordinate of $2P$:\n\n$(-\\frac{7}{6}(x - 2) - 3)^2 = (x^3 - 5x + 7)$\n\nSolving this equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{41}{16}$\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the tangent line equation to find the $y$-coordinate of $2P$:\n\n$y = -\\frac{7}{6}(\\frac{41}{16} - 2) - 3$\n\n$y = -\\frac{15}{8}$\n\nSo, $2P = (\\frac{41}{16}, -\\frac{15}{8})$.\n\nNow, let's find $3P = P + 2P$. To do this, we need to compute the slope of the line passing through $P$ and $2P$. The slope is given by:\n\n$m = \\frac{-\\frac{15}{8} - (-3)}{\\frac{41}{16} - 2}$\n\n$m = \\frac{9}{8}$\n\nNow, we can use the slope to find the coordinates of $3P$. The line equation is:\n\n$y - (-3) = \\frac{9}{8}(x - 2)$\n\nNow, we can plug this equation back into the equation of the elliptic curve to find the $x$-coordinate of $3P$:\n\n$(\\frac{9}{8}(x - 2) - 3)^2 = (x^3 - 5x + 7)$\n\nSolving this equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = -\\frac{71}{64}$\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the line equation to find the $y$-coordinate of $3P$:\n\n$y = \\frac{9}{8}(-\\frac{71}{64} - 2) - 3$\n\n$y = \\frac{99}{64}$\n\nSo, $3P = (-\\frac{71}{64}, \\frac{99}{64})$.\n\nNow, let's find $4P = 2P + 2P$. To do this, we need to compute the slope of the tangent line to $E$ at the point $2P$. Using the equation of the elliptic curve and the derivative we found earlier, we have:\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 5$\n\nNow, we can plug in the coordinates of $2P = (\\frac{41}{16}, -\\frac{15}{8})$:\n\n$-3\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1681}{256} - 5$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{41}{48}$\n\nNow, we can use the slope to find the coordinates of $4P$. The tangent line equation is:\n\n$y - (-\\frac{15}{8}) = -\\frac{41}{48}(x - \\frac{41}{16})$\n\nNow, we can plug this equation back into the equation of the elliptic curve to find the $x$-coordinate of $4P$:\n\n$(-\\frac{41}{48}(x - \\frac{41}{16}) - \\frac{15}{8})^2 = (x^3 - 5x + 7)$\n\nSolving this equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = 2$\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the tangent line equation to find the $y$-coordinate of $4P$:\n\n$y = -\\frac{41}{48}(2 - \\frac{41}{16}) - \\frac{15}{8}$\n\n$y = 3$\n\nSo, $4P = (2, 3)$.\n\nNow, let's find $5P = P + 4P$. Since $4P$ is the reflection of $P$ across the x-axis, the line passing through $P$ and $4P$ is vertical. In this case, the point $5P$ is the identity element $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nTherefore, the order of the group of points on $E$ generated by $P$ is $5$."
