    "message_2": "To find the encryption matrix for the Hill cipher, we need to first convert the message and ciphertext into numerical form using the given letter-to-number correspondence.\n\nMessage \"HELLO\":\nH = 7, E = 4, L = 11, L = 11, O = 14\n\nCiphertext \"DPMXV\":\nD = 3, P = 15, M = 12, X = 23, V = 21\n\nNow, we need to choose a matrix size for the Hill cipher. Since we have 5 letters in the message and ciphertext, we can choose a 2x2 matrix and use pairs of letters.\n\nMessage pairs: (7, 4), (11, 11), (14, -)\nCiphertext pairs: (3, 15), (12, 23), (21, -)\n\nWe can ignore the last letters (O and V) since they don't form a complete pair. Now, we have two pairs of message and ciphertext:\n\n(7, 4) -> (3, 15)\n(11, 11) -> (12, 23)\n\nLet the encryption matrix be:\n[a, b]\n[c, d]\n\nWe can write the Hill cipher equations as follows:\n\n7a + 4c ≡ 3 (mod 26)\n7b + 4d ≡ 15 (mod 26)\n11a + 11c ≡ 12 (mod 26)\n11b + 11d ≡ 23 (mod 26)\n\nWe can simplify the equations:\n\n7a + 4c ≡ 3 (mod 26)\n7b + 4d ≡ 15 (mod 26)\na + c ≡ 12 (mod 26)\nb + d ≡ 23 (mod 26)\n\nNow, we can solve the simplified equations:\n\nFrom the third equation, we get c ≡ 12 - a (mod 26).\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\n7a + 4(12 - a) ≡ 3 (mod 26)\n7a + 48 - 4a ≡ 3 (mod 26)\n3a ≡ -45 (mod 26)\n3a ≡ 7 (mod 26)\na ≡ 9 (mod 26)\n\nNow, we can find c:\nc ≡ 12 - 9 (mod 26)\nc ≡ 3 (mod 26)\n\nFrom the fourth equation, we get d ≡ 23 - b (mod 26).\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n7b + 4(23 - b) ≡ 15 (mod 26)\n7b + 92 - 4b ≡ 15 (mod 26)\n3b ≡ -77 (mod 26)\n3b ≡ 1 (mod 26)\nb ≡ 17 (mod 26)\n\nNow, we can find d:\nd ≡ 23 - 17 (mod 26)\nd ≡ 6 (mod 26)\n\nSo, the encryption matrix is:\n[9, 17]\n[3, 6]"
