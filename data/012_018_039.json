    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. In a complete graph Kₙ, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, with a total of n(n-1)/2 edges.\n\nFor K₅, there are 5 vertices, so there are 5(5-1)/2 = 10 edges in total. To disconnect the graph, we need to remove enough edges so that at least one vertex becomes isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n\nIn K₅, each vertex has a degree of 4 (connected to 4 other vertices). To disconnect the graph, we need to remove all 4 edges connected to a single vertex. Therefore, the edge connectivity of K₅ is 4."
