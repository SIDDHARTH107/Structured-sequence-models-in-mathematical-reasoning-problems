    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student on the topic of Fractal geometry and the self-similarity of the Lévy C curve:\n\nFind the length of the Lévy C curve after the $n^{th}$ iteration, where the original curve has a length of 1 and each iteration increases the curve's length by a factor of 4. \n\nFor instance, if we start with a Lévy C curve of length 1, after the first iteration its length would be 4, after the second iteration its length would be 16, and so on. The student will need to use knowledge of how the Lévy C curve is constructed, as well as iteration and scaling properties of fractals, to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the Lévy C curve after the $n^{th}$ iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength after $n^{th}$ iteration = (Original length) × (Scaling factor)$^n$\n\nIn this case, the original length is 1 and the scaling factor is 4. So the formula becomes:\n\nLength after $n^{th}$ iteration = $1 × 4^n$\n\nNow, we can plug in any value of n to find the length of the Lévy C curve after that iteration. For example:\n\n- After the first iteration ($n=1$): Length = $1 × 4^1 = 4$\n- After the second iteration ($n=2$): Length = $1 × 4^2 = 16$\n- After the third iteration ($n=3$): Length = $1 × 4^3 = 64$\n\nAnd so on."
