    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n|  3   1  -1 |  1  |\n|  2  -2   4 | -2  |\n| -1  1.5 -2.5|  0  |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n- R2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\n- R3 = R3 + R1\n\n```\n|  3    1   -1  |  1   |\n|  0   -4/3  10/3| -4/3 |\n|  0    2.5  -3.5|  1   |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n- R3 = R3 - (2.5/(-4/3))R2\n\n```\n|  3    1    -1  |  1   |\n|  0  -4/3  10/3 | -4/3 |\n|  0    0   -1/3 |  1/3 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Back substitution\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n-1/3 * z = 1/3\nz = -1\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n-4/3 * y + 10/3 * (-1) = -4/3\n-4/3 * y - 10/3 = -4/3\ny = 1\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n3x + 1 - (-1) = 1\n3x = -1\nx = -1/3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1/3, y = 1, and z = -1."
