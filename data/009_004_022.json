Find the solution of the differential equation describing the motion of the mass and determine the amplitude, frequency, and period of the resulting oscillations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the equation of motion for a mass-spring system, which is given by Hooke's Law:\n\nm * x''(t) + k * x(t) = 0\n\nwhere m is the mass, x(t) is the displacement of the mass as a function of time, x''(t) is the second derivative of x(t) with respect to time (i.e., the acceleration), and k is the spring constant.\n\nGiven the values in the problem, we have:\n\n2 * x''(t) + 5 * x(t) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The general solution for this type of equation is:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t) + B * sin(ω * t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and ω is the angular frequency, which is related to the spring constant and mass by:\n\nω = sqrt(k / m)\n\nIn our case, ω = sqrt(5 / 2) = sqrt(2.5).\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions. At t = 0, the mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position, so:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) = A\n\nSince x(0) = 0.1 m, we have A = 0.1.\n\nNext, we need to find the initial velocity, which is the first derivative of x(t):\n\nx'(t) = -A * ω * sin(ω * t) + B * ω * cos(ω * t)\n\nAt t = 0, the initial velocity is 0.2 m/s, so:\n\nx'(0) = -0.1 * sqrt(2.5) * sin(0) + B * sqrt(2.5) * cos(0) = B * sqrt(2.5)\n\nSince x'(0) = 0.2 m/s, we have B = 0.2 / sqrt(2.5).\n\nNow we have the complete solution for the displacement as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = 0.1 * cos(sqrt(2.5) * t) + (0.2 / sqrt(2.5)) * sin(sqrt(2.5) * t)\n\nTo find the amplitude, frequency, and period of the oscillations, we can rewrite the solution in the form:\n\nx(t) = C * cos(sqrt(2.5) * t + φ)\n\nwhere C is the amplitude and φ is the phase angle. Using the trigonometric identity:\n\ncos(a + b) = cos(a) * cos(b) - sin(a) * sin(b)\n\nwe can rewrite the solution as:\n\nx(t) = C * (cos(φ) * cos(sqrt(2.5) * t) - sin(φ) * sin(sqrt(2.5) * t))\n\nComparing this with the original solution, we have:\n\nC * cos(φ) = 0.1\nC * sin(φ) = 0.2 / sqrt(2.5)\n\nSquaring and adding these equations, we get:\n\nC^2 = (0.1)^2 + (0.2 / sqrt(2.5))^2\nC = sqrt((0.1)^2 + (0.2 / sqrt(2.5))^2)\n\nC ≈ 0.2236 m\n\nSo, the amplitude of the oscillations is approximately 0.2236 m.\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f and period T by:\n\nω = 2 * π * f\nT = 1 / f\n\nIn our case, ω = sqrt(2.5), so:\n\nf = sqrt(2.5) / (2 * π)\nT = 1 / f\n\nf ≈ 0.2821 Hz\nT ≈ 3.543 s\n\nSo, the frequency of the oscillations is approximately 0.2821 Hz, and the period is approximately 3.543 seconds."
