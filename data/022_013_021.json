    "message_2": "To find the value of f(i), we simply substitute i for z in the function f(z) = z^2 + 2iz:\n\nf(i) = i^2 + 2i(i)\n\nRecall that i^2 = -1, so we can substitute -1 for i^2:\n\nf(i) = -1 + 2i(i)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf(i) = -1 + 2i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1:\n\nf(i) = -1 + 2(-1)\n\nf(i) = -1 - 2\n\nf(i) = -3\n\nSo, the value of f(i) is -3."
