    "message_2": "A torus is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis coplanar with the circle. In this case, the radius of the small circle (minor radius) is 2, and the radius of the large circle (major radius) is 4.\n\nThe symmetries of a torus can be described in terms of its geometric transformations. There are four main types of symmetries for a torus:\n\n1. Rotational symmetry: The torus can be rotated around its central axis (the axis of the large circle) by any angle, and it will still look the same. This is because the shape is invariant under rotations around this axis. There is also rotational symmetry around the axis of the small circle, but only for rotations of 360Â°/n, where n is an integer.\n\n2. Translational symmetry: If we \"slide\" the torus along the axis of the large circle, it will still look the same. This is because the shape is invariant under translations along this axis. However, there is no translational symmetry along the axis of the small circle.\n\n3. Reflection symmetry: The torus has reflection symmetry with respect to any plane that contains the axis of the large circle. This means that if we reflect the torus across such a plane, it will still look the same. However, there is no reflection symmetry with respect to planes containing the axis of the small circle.\n\n4. Glide reflection symmetry: The torus has glide reflection symmetry with respect to any plane that contains the axis of the large circle and is parallel to the axis of the small circle. This means that if we reflect the torus across such a plane and then translate it along the axis of the large circle, it will still look the same.\n\nIn summary, the symmetries of a torus with a small circle radius of 2 and a large circle radius of 4 include rotational symmetry around both axes, translational symmetry along the large circle axis, reflection symmetry with respect to planes containing the large circle axis, and glide reflection symmetry with respect to planes containing the large circle axis and parallel to the small circle axis."
