    "message_1": "Unfortunately, Epistemic logic is not the kind of topic where we can create a precise numerical problem for a student to solve. Epistemic logic is concerned with the study of knowledge and belief, and it deals with concepts that are not easily quantifiable. \n\nHowever, we can provide an example of a question related to epistemic logic that a math student might be asked to solve. \n\nHere it is: \n\n\"Suppose there are three colored boxes in front of you, and you know that one of them contains a prize. You do not know which box has the prize, but your friend who is standing beside you does. Your friend says that the prize is not in the red box. You update your belief accordingly. What is the probability now that the prize is in the green box?\" \n\nThis question involves reasoning about knowledge and belief and is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using epistemic logic.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Initially, there are three boxes: red, green, and blue. The probability of the prize being in each box is equal, so the initial probability for each box is 1/3.\n\nWhen your friend tells you that the prize is not in the red box, you can update your belief accordingly. Now, there are only two remaining possibilities: the green box and the blue box. Since the prize must be in one of these two boxes, the probability of the prize being in the green box is now 1/2, or 50%. Similarly, the probability of the prize being in the blue box is also 1/2, or 50%."
