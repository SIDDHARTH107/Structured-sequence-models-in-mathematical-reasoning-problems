    "message_2": "To find the equation for Z on a genus g=2 surface in terms of Z on a genus g=0 surface, we can use the cutting and gluing technique. This technique involves cutting the genus g=2 surface into simpler pieces (in this case, genus g=0 surfaces) and then gluing them back together. The TQFT invariants are multiplicative under this operation, which means that the invariant of the glued surface is the product of the invariants of the individual pieces.\n\nFirst, we cut the genus g=2 surface into two genus g=1 surfaces by cutting along two non-intersecting loops. Each genus g=1 surface can be further cut into two genus g=0 surfaces by cutting along a single loop. Now we have four genus g=0 surfaces.\n\nLet Z_0 be the TQFT invariant for a knot on a genus g=0 surface. Since we have four genus g=0 surfaces, the TQFT invariant for the genus g=2 surface can be expressed as a product of the invariants of these four surfaces. However, we need to take into account the gluing process, which introduces additional factors.\n\nWhen we glue the two genus g=1 surfaces back together, we need to sum over all possible ways of gluing, which introduces a factor of the sum over all representations R. This factor can be denoted as S(R), where S is the modular S-matrix that encodes the fusion rules of the TQFT. Similarly, when we glue the two genus g=0 surfaces to form a genus g=1 surface, we need to sum over all possible ways of gluing, introducing another factor of S(R).\n\nThus, the equation for Z on a genus g=2 surface in terms of Z on a genus g=0 surface is given by:\n\nZ_g2 = Z_0^4 * S(R)^2\n\nHere, Z_g2 is the TQFT invariant for a knot on a genus g=2 surface, Z_0 is the TQFT invariant for a knot on a genus g=0 surface, and S(R) is the sum over all representations R."
