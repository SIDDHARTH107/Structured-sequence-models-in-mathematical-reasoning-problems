    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or any of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, we can apply the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p.\n\nFor p = 2, the Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 * 5 = 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nFor p = 3, the Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 * 5 = 20 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n\nFor p = 5, the Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^2 * 3 = 12 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has unique Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p, which implies that G is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. In this case, G would be isomorphic to C4 × C3 × C5, which is isomorphic to C60 (the cyclic group of order 60).\n\n2. If n_5 = 6, then G has six Sylow 5-subgroups, which implies that G has 24 elements of order 5. If n_3 = 10, then G has 20 elements of order 3. This leaves only 15 elements unaccounted for, which is not enough to accommodate the remaining Sylow 2-subgroups if n_2 = 3. Thus, in this case, n_2 must be 1, and G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. Since G is not abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to A5 × C2. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nWithout more information about G, we cannot determine which specific group it is isomorphic to or provide the isomorphism. However, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either C60 or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
