The Euclidean distance between each pair of data points is shown in the table below. Use the k-means clustering algorithm to determine which 3 data points should be the initial centroids, and then assign each of the remaining data points to one of the 3 clusters.\n\n|      | Data point 1 | Data point 2 | Data point 3 | ... | Data point 20 |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --- | ------------ |\n| Data point 1 | 0 | 5 | 8 | ... | 11 |\n| Data point 2 | 5 | 0 | 3 | ... | 6 |\n| Data point 3 | 8 | 3 | 0 | ... | 9 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Data point 20 | 11 | 6 | 9 | ... | 0 |",
    "message_2": "To perform k-means clustering, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids by selecting 3 random data points.\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all data points in each cluster.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nSince the problem does not provide any initial centroids, we will randomly select 3 data points as the initial centroids. Let's choose Data point 1, Data point 2, and Data point 3 as the initial centroids.\n\nNow, we will assign each of the remaining data points to one of the 3 clusters based on the minimum Euclidean distance.\n\n| Data Point | Cluster |\n|------------|---------|\n| 1          | 1       |\n| 2          | 2       |\n| 3          | 3       |\n| 4          | ...     |\n| ...        | ...     |\n| 20         | 3       |\n\nAfter assigning the data points to the clusters, we will update the centroids by calculating the mean of all data points in each cluster. Since we don't have the actual data points' values, we cannot calculate the new centroids.\n\nHowever, the general approach to k-means clustering has been outlined above. In a real-world scenario, you would have the actual data points' values and could calculate the new centroids and iterate until convergence."
