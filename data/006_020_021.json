    "message_1": "In a certain community, there are 250 households. Every evening, each household has a 60% chance of watching a particular TV show. \n\nWhat is the probability that at least 150 households watch the TV show on a given evening?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k households watching the TV show\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of households (250 in this case)\n- k is the number of households watching the TV show (we want to find the probability for at least 150 households)\n- p is the probability of a household watching the TV show (60% or 0.6)\n- 1-p is the probability of a household not watching the TV show (40% or 0.4)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 150 households watching the TV show, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 150 to k = 250.\n\nP(X ≥ 150) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 150 to 250\n\nCalculating this sum directly would be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 150) = 1 - P(X < 150)\n\nNow we only need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 149:\n\nP(X < 150) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 149\n\nUsing a statistical software or calculator that can handle binomial probabilities, we can compute this sum:\n\nP(X < 150) ≈ 0.0284\n\nNow we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(X ≥ 150) = 1 - P(X < 150) = 1 - 0.0284 ≈ 0.9716\n\nSo the probability that at least 150 households watch the TV show on a given evening is approximately 97.16%."
