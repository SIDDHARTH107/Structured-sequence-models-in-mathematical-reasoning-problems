    "message_1": "A student is selecting 3 ice cream flavors out of 8 available flavors. In how many ways can the student select his/her 3 favorite flavors?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 8 ice cream flavors), k is the number of items to be chosen (in this case, 3 flavors), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, let's plug the factorials back into the formula:\n\nC(8, 3) = 40,320 / (6 × 120)\n\nC(8, 3) = 40,320 / 720\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, the student can select 3 ice cream flavors out of 8 available flavors in 56 different ways."
