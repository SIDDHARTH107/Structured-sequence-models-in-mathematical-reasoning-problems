    "message_2": "An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of one side, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nPerimeter = 36 cm\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of one side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 36 cm / 3 = 12 cm\n\nThe length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 12 cm."
