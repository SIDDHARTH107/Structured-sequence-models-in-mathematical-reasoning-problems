    "message_2": "In the context of Mori Theory, we can use Kontsevich's formula to find the number of rational curves passing through a given number of general points in the projective plane. Kontsevich's formula states that the number of rational curves of degree d passing through 3d - 1 general points in the projective plane is given by:\n\nN_d = (d-1)(d-2)(3d-1)(3d-2)(3d-3)/12\n\nIn this problem, we are asked to find the number of rational curves passing through exactly 6 general points in the projective plane. To do this, we need to find the degree d for which 3d - 1 = 6. Solving for d, we get:\n\n3d - 1 = 6\n3d = 7\nd = 7/3\n\nSince d must be an integer, there is no degree d for which the number of general points is exactly 6. Therefore, there are 0 rational curves passing through exactly 6 general points in the projective plane."
