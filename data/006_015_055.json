    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, DDoS attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one month) when the events occur independently and at an average rate of 位 (lambda).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-位) * (位^k)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events in the given time interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- 位 is the average rate of events (in this case, 8 DDoS attacks per month)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3 DDoS attacks)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-8) * (8^3)) / 3!\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(X = 3) = (0.000335 * 512) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) = 0.171\n\nTherefore, the probability that the company will experience exactly 3 DDoS attacks in the next month is approximately 0.171, or 17.1% when rounded to 3 decimal places."
