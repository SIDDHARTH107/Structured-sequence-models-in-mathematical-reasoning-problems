    "message_2": "To find the least amount of money the company can spend to manufacture the 1000 meters of cable, we need to minimize the cost function C(x). \n\nC(x) = 1000 + 12x + 0.01x^2\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of C(x) with respect to x:\n\nC'(x) = dC(x)/dx = 12 + 0.02x\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 12 + 0.02x\n-12 = 0.02x\nx = -12 / 0.02\nx = -600\n\nHowever, this value of x doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we cannot have a negative amount of cable. Since the cost function is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient (0.01), it opens upwards, meaning that the minimum cost occurs at the endpoints of the interval. In this case, the interval is [0, 1000].\n\nSo, we need to evaluate the cost function at the endpoints:\n\nC(0) = 1000 + 12(0) + 0.01(0)^2 = 1000\nC(1000) = 1000 + 12(1000) + 0.01(1000)^2 = 1000 + 12000 + 10000 = 23000\n\nSince C(0) represents the cost of manufacturing 0 meters of cable, which is not what we want, we consider the cost of manufacturing 1000 meters of cable, which is C(1000) = 23000 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the least amount of money the company can spend to manufacture the 1000 meters of cable is $23,000."
