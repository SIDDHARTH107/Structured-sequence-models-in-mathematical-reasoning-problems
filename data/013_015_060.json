    "message_1": "Consider a principal who hires an agent to perform a task. The agent can either perform this task diligently or shirk, and the probability of diligent work is \"p\". The principal can either monitor the agent's work or not monitor. \n\nIf the agent performs the task diligently, the principal will earn a profit of $20. But if the agent shirks, the principal earns nothing. If the principal monitors the agent, it will cost them $5 to do so. If they do not monitor the agent, they must pay the agent a fixed wage of $10.\n\nAssume that the agent seeks to maximize their wage, and the principal seeks to maximize their profit. What is the optimal probability of diligent work, \"p,\" for the agent to choose?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal probability of diligent work, \"p,\" for the agent to choose, we need to consider the expected profits for the principal in both scenarios (monitoring and not monitoring) and find the value of \"p\" that makes the principal indifferent between the two options.\n\n1. If the principal monitors the agent:\nExpected profit = p * ($20 - $5 - $10) + (1 - p) * (-$5)\nExpected profit = p * $5 - $5\n\n2. If the principal does not monitor the agent:\nExpected profit = p * ($20 - $10)\nExpected profit = p * $10\n\nTo make the principal indifferent between monitoring and not monitoring, we need to set the expected profits equal to each other:\n\np * $5 - $5 = p * $10\n\nNow, we solve for \"p\":\n\np * $5 = $5\np = 1\n\nHowever, since the probability cannot be greater than 1, the optimal probability of diligent work \"p\" for the agent to choose is 1, meaning the agent should always work diligently. This way, the principal will not have an incentive to monitor the agent, and the agent will receive the fixed wage of $10."
