    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 25, we know that |G| = 25 = 5^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the 5-Sylow subgroup in G, which is |G|/5^2 = 1.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only positive integer that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup in G, which we will denote by H. Since H is the unique 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of G. Since |G| = 25, there are 24 non-identity elements in G. The order of any element in G must divide the order of G, so the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 5, and 25. The identity element has order 1, and there are 24 elements left to consider.\n\nSince H is a 5-Sylow subgroup, it has order 5, and it must contain 4 elements of order 5. Let's denote these elements by a, b, c, and d. Now, we have 20 elements left to consider.\n\nIf G is cyclic, then there must be an element of order 25 in G. Let's assume that there is such an element, which we will denote by x. Then, x^5 has order 5, and since H is the unique subgroup of order 5, x^5 must be in H. Without loss of generality, let's assume that x^5 = a. Then, x^10 = a^2, x^15 = a^3, and x^20 = a^4 are also in H. But this means that x^25 = a^5 = e, the identity element, which is a contradiction since x was assumed to have order 25.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be cyclic. This means that G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. To see this, let K be a subgroup of G generated by an element of order 5 that is not in H, say e. Since |H| = 5 and |K| = 5, and H and K are both normal in G, their intersection is trivial (i.e., H âˆ© K = {e}). Furthermore, since there are no elements of order 25 in G, every element in G can be written as a product of elements from H and K. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic groups of order 5."
