    "message_1": "Suppose a company claims that their new product can reduce monthly energy bills by an average of $50 with a standard deviation of $10. A sample of 25 customers were randomly selected and their monthly energy bills were analyzed. The sample mean was found to be $48.50. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean reduction in monthly energy bills due to the new product.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean reduction in monthly energy bills, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\nSample Mean = $48.50\nStandard Deviation = $10\nSample Size = 25\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = $10 / √(25) = $10 / 5 = $2\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * $2 = $3.92\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = $48.50 ± $3.92\n\nLower Limit = $48.50 - $3.92 = $44.58\nUpper Limit = $48.50 + $3.92 = $52.42\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean reduction in monthly energy bills due to the new product is ($44.58, $52.42)."
