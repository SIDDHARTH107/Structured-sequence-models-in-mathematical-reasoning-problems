    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of G, which is a subgroup of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, n_3 must divide the order of G, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then P is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 27, P is the entire group G. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either a cyclic group of order 27 or the direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 and 9. If G is cyclic, we are done. If G is the direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 and 9, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let P, Q, and R be distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1. Now, consider the product PQ. Since |P| = |Q| = 27, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 27 * 27 / 1 = 729. However, this is impossible, as |PQ| must divide the order of G, which is 27. This contradiction means that there cannot be three Sylow 3-subgroups, so n_3 cannot be equal to 3.\n\nTherefore, G must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
