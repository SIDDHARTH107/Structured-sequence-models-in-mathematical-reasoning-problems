    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that its car tire brand has an average lifespan of 60,000 miles. A random sample of 50 tires of this brand showed a mean lifespan of 58,000 miles and a standard deviation of 3,000 miles. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of this tire brand.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of this tire brand, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean = 58,000 miles\nt = t-score for a 95% confidence interval with (n-1) degrees of freedom\ns = sample standard deviation = 3,000 miles\nn = sample size = 50 tires\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score. Since we have a sample size of 50, we have 49 degrees of freedom (n-1). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom is approximately 2.0096.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 58,000 ± (2.0096 * (3,000 / √50))\n\nConfidence Interval = 58,000 ± (2.0096 * (3,000 / 7.071))\n\nConfidence Interval = 58,000 ± (2.0096 * 424.26)\n\nConfidence Interval = 58,000 ± 852.98\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of this tire brand is (57,147.02 miles, 58,852.98 miles)."
