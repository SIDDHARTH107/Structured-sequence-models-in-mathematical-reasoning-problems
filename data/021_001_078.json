    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n```\n[ 5   8  -4 |  12 ]\n[ 2  -3   5 |  -7 ]\n[ 4   1   2 |   1 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can replace the second row with (-2/5) times the first row plus the second row.\n\n```\n[ 5   8  -4 |  12 ]\n[ 0  -13  22 | -19 ]\n[ 4   1   2 |   1 ]\n```\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can replace the third row with (-4/5) times the first row plus the third row.\n\n```\n[ 5   8  -4 |  12 ]\n[ 0  -13  22 | -19 ]\n[ 0  -15  10 | -23 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can replace the third row with (-15/-13) times the second row plus the third row.\n\n```\n[ 5   8  -4 |  12 ]\n[ 0  -13  22 | -19 ]\n[ 0   0  -10 |  10 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow we have a triangular matrix, and we can solve for z by dividing the third row by -10.\n\n```\n[ 5   8  -4 |  12 ]\n[ 0  -13  22 | -19 ]\n[ 0   0   1 |  -1 ]\n```\n\nSo, z = -1.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it into the second row and solve for y.\n\n-13y + 22(-1) = -19\n-13y - 22 = -19\n-13y = 3\ny = -3/13\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of y and z into the first row and solve for x.\n\n5x + 8(-3/13) - 4(-1) = 12\n5x - 24/13 + 4 = 12\n5x = 12 - 4 + 24/13\n5x = 8 + 24/13\n5x = 104/13\nx = 104/65\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 104/65, y = -3/13, and z = -1."
