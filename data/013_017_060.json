    "message_1": "Suppose there's a used car market with two types of cars: high quality (worth $10,000) and low quality (worth $5,000). The proportion of high-quality cars is 50/50, and buyers have a willingness to pay of $7,500 for high-quality cars and $2,500 for low-quality cars. The sellers know the quality of their cars, but the buyers don't. If the buyers offer a price of $6,000, what is the expected value for the sellers to sell their cars knowing that they have a high-quality car?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation. If the buyers offer a price of $6,000, the sellers with low-quality cars will be willing to sell their cars since the offered price is higher than their car's worth ($5,000). However, the sellers with high-quality cars will not be willing to sell their cars at this price since it is lower than their car's worth ($10,000).\n\nIn this scenario, the buyers will only end up buying low-quality cars, as the high-quality car sellers will not sell at the offered price. Therefore, the expected value for the sellers to sell their cars knowing that they have a high-quality car is $0, as they will not sell their cars at the offered price of $6,000."
