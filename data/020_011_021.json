The garden will be surrounded by a fence on three sides, with the fourth side being the wall of a building. The student has 100 meters of fencing material to use, and wants to maximize the area of the garden that can be enclosed. \n\nWhat dimensions should the student use for the rectangular garden to maximize the enclosed area, and what is the maximum area that can be enclosed?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L meters and the width be W meters. Since the garden is enclosed by a fence on three sides, we have the following equation for the perimeter:\n\nL + 2W = 100\n\nWe can solve for L:\n\nL = 100 - 2W\n\nThe area A of the rectangle is given by:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for L from the perimeter equation:\n\nA = (100 - 2W) * W\nA = 100W - 2W^2\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to W and setting it to 0:\n\ndA/dW = 100 - 4W = 0\n\nSolve for W:\n\n4W = 100\nW = 25\n\nNow, substitute the value of W back into the equation for L:\n\nL = 100 - 2(25)\nL = 100 - 50\nL = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular garden that will maximize the enclosed area are 50 meters in length and 25 meters in width. The maximum area that can be enclosed is:\n\nA = L * W\nA = 50 * 25\nA = 1250 square meters"
