    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated through a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (√7).\n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (√7)^Iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations. So, we plug in the values:\n\nLength = 1 * (√7)^5\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 168.094874\n\nLength ≈ 168.094874 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations is approximately 168.094874 units."
