    "message_2": "If we create a copy of the Lévy C curve that is 1/3 the length of the original curve, the length of the copied curve will be:\n\n(1/3) * 100 = 100/3 ≈ 33.33 units\n\nNow, if we scale this copied curve to fit within the original curve, the length of the resulting curve will still be 33.33 units, as the scaling process does not change the length of the curve."
