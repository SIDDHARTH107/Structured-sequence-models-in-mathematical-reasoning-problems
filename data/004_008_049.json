    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 2x^3 - 4 at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is y = 2x^3 - 4. \n\nFirst, find the derivative dy/dx:\ndy/dx = d(2x^3 - 4)/dx = 6x^2 (using the power rule)\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\ndy/dx (x=2) = 6(2)^2 = 6(4) = 24\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = 2x^3 - 4 at the point where x = 2 is 24."
