    "message_1": "Consider the following transposition cipher: \"DHWEOTIDDRYFENOHTH\" in which an encryption key was used to reorder the letters. If the encryption key was to take every odd letter and move it to the front of the message, and take every even letter and move it to the end of the message, what is the decrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to reverse the process of the encryption key. We know that the odd letters were moved to the front and the even letters were moved to the end. So, we need to take the first half of the message and place it in the odd positions and take the second half of the message and place it in the even positions.\n\nThe given message is: DHWEOTIDDRYFENOHTH\n\nFirst, let's split the message into two halves:\n\n1. First half (odd letters): DHWEOTID\n2. Second half (even letters): DRYFENOHTH\n\nNow, let's place the first half in the odd positions and the second half in the even positions:\n\n1. D (1st letter of the first half)\n2. D (1st letter of the second half)\n3. H (2nd letter of the first half)\n4. R (2nd letter of the second half)\n5. W (3rd letter of the first half)\n6. Y (3rd letter of the second half)\n7. E (4th letter of the first half)\n8. F (4th letter of the second half)\n9. O (5th letter of the first half)\n10. E (5th letter of the second half)\n11. T (6th letter of the first half)\n12. N (6th letter of the second half)\n13. I (7th letter of the first half)\n14. O (7th letter of the second half)\n15. D (8th letter of the first half)\n16. H (8th letter of the second half)\n17. T (9th letter of the second half)\n18. H (10th letter of the second half)\n\nThe decrypted message is: \"DIDYOUNOTICETHEREDH\""
