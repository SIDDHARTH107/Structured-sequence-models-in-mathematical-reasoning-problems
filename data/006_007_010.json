    "message_1": "Assume the probability of a certain stock price increase is 0.45 and the probability of its decrease is 0.25. If the stock has a probability of neither increasing nor decreasing of 0.3, what is the chance that the stock will either increase or decrease in price?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock will either increase or decrease in price, we simply add the probabilities of each event occurring:\n\nP(increase) + P(decrease) = 0.45 + 0.25 = 0.7\n\nSo, the chance that the stock will either increase or decrease in price is 0.7 or 70%."
