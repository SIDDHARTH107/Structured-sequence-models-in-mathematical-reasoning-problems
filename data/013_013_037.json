    "message_1": "Consider an auction in which there are 4 bidders and the item on auction is a rare painting. The bids of the bidders are 500, 750, 1000 and 1200 dollars respectively. The auctioneer runs the auction using a second-price sealed-bid format. What is the winning bid and the amount the winner has to pay for the painting?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but only pays the amount of the second-highest bid. In this case, the bids are 500, 750, 1000, and 1200 dollars. The highest bid is 1200 dollars, and the second-highest bid is 1000 dollars. Therefore, the winner of the auction is the bidder who bid 1200 dollars, and they will have to pay 1000 dollars for the painting."
