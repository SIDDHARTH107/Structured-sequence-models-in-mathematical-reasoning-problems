    "message_2": "To prove the first part, we need to show that there exists a continuous map F: X -> Y such that F(x) = f(x) for all x in A.\n\nSince A is a closed subset of the compact space X, A is also compact. Now, we have a continuous map f: A -> Y, where Y is a Hausdorff space. By the continuous image of compactness theorem, f(A) is compact in Y.\n\nNow, consider the set X \\ A, which is open in X. We can define a function g: X \\ A -> Y such that g(x) is an arbitrary point in Y. Now, we can define a function F: X -> Y as follows:\n\nF(x) = f(x) for x in A\nF(x) = g(x) for x in X \\ A\n\nTo show that F is continuous, we need to show that the preimage of every open set in Y is open in X. Let V be an open set in Y. Then, F^(-1)(V) = (f^(-1)(V) ∩ A) ∪ (g^(-1)(V) ∩ (X \\ A)). Since f and g are continuous, f^(-1)(V) and g^(-1)(V) are open in A and X \\ A, respectively. Therefore, F^(-1)(V) is open in X, and F is continuous.\n\nNow, let's prove the second part. Let X be the closed interval [0,1] and Y be the closed unit ball in R^2 with Euclidean topology. Let h: X -> Y be a continuous map. We need to show that the continuous image of X in Y, h(X), is compact.\n\nSince X is compact and h is continuous, by the continuous image of compactness theorem, h(X) is compact in Y. Thus, the continuous image of X in Y is compact."
