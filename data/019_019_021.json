    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can tell you that there isn't a specific smallest number that cannot be calculated using any algorithm or computer program. The concept you might be referring to is related to the idea of uncomputable numbers.\n\nUncomputable numbers are real numbers that cannot be computed by any algorithm or computer program. These numbers exist due to the limitations of algorithms and the nature of real numbers. However, uncomputable numbers are not well-defined, and there isn't a specific smallest uncomputable number.\n\nOne famous example of an uncomputable number is the Chaitin's constant, which is a number that represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt. But even this constant is not a specific number, as it depends on the choice of programming language and encoding used."
