    "message_2": "To avoid a cycle of length 4, we can construct a bipartite graph, which is a graph where the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.\n\nLet's divide the 12 vertices into two sets, U and V. Let |U| = n and |V| = 12 - n. The maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph is the product of the sizes of the two sets, which is n * (12 - n).\n\nTo find the maximum number of edges without a cycle of length 4, we need to maximize the value of n * (12 - n). This is a quadratic function, and its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola in the form of y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by x = -b / 2a. In this case, a = -1 and b = 12, so the vertex occurs at x = -12 / (2 * -1) = 6.\n\nSo, we should choose |U| = 6 and |V| = 6. This gives us a maximum of 6 * 6 = 36 edges without containing a cycle of length 4. However, the given graph has only 30 edges, which is less than the maximum possible number of edges without a cycle of length 4. Therefore, the graph can have 30 edges without containing a cycle of length 4."
