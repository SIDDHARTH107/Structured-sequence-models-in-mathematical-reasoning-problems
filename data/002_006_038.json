    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle (or wheel) can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius of the wheel is 7 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(7 cm)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 7 cm\nC ≈ 43.9823 cm\n\nThe circumference of the wheel is approximately 43.98 cm."
