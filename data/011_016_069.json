    "message_2": "To select 3 items from a set of 8 distinct items such that no two items are the same, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 and k = 3. So, we have:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 different ways to select 3 items from a set of 8 distinct items such that no two items are the same."
