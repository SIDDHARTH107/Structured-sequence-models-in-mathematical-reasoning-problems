    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\n1. Parametrization of the surface:\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nr(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\n2. First fundamental form:\nWe need to find the tangent vectors of the surface with respect to u and v:\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = <ru, ru> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <ru, rv> = 4uv\nG = <rv, rv> = 1 + 4v^2\n\n3. Second fundamental form:\nWe need to find the normal vector of the surface:\nN = ru Ã— rv = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize the normal vector:\n|N| = sqrt((-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\nn = N/|N| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNext, we find the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = <ruu, n> = (2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\nM = <ruv, n> = 0\nN = <rvv, n> = (2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\n4. Sectional curvature:\nThe sectional curvature K is given by the following formula:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. So, we can find the values of E, F, G, L, M, and N at this point:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = 2/sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = 2/sqrt(9) = 2/3\nM = 0\nN = 2/sqrt(4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2 + 1) = 2/sqrt(9) = 2/3\n\nNow, we can find the sectional curvature K:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = ((2/3)(2/3) - 0^2) / (5*5 - 4^2) = (4/9) / (25 - 16) = (4/9) / 9 = 4/81\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is 4/81."
