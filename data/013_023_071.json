Whatever amount they give is tripled by the experimenter and Player B then decides how much money they want to return to Player A. If Player B returns all the money they received, Player A's final payout is $50 - Amount given + 3(Amount given) and Player B's final payout is $20 + 3(Amount given). \n\nIf Player A gives $20 to Player B, how much money does each player receive at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "If Player A gives $20 to Player B, the experimenter will triple the amount, so Player B receives 3 * $20 = $60.\n\nIf Player B returns all the money they received, Player A's final payout will be:\n$50 - $20 + 3($20) = $50 - $20 + $60 = $90.\n\nPlayer B's final payout will be:\n$20 + 3($20) = $20 + $60 = $80.\n\nSo, at the end of the game, Player A receives $90 and Player B receives $80."
