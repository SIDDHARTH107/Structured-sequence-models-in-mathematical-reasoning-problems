    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the initial structure. In this case, we have a 3x3x3 cube structure (27 cubes) with sides of length 1.\n\nIn the first iteration (order 1), we remove the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure. This results in the removal of 7 cubes (6 from the faces and 1 from the center). So, we are left with 27 - 7 = 20 cubes.\n\nIn the second iteration (order 2), we apply the same process to each of the remaining 20 cubes. Each of these cubes will have 1/3 of the side length of the original cube, which is 1/3. We remove 7 smaller cubes from each of the 20 cubes, so we remove 7 * 20 = 140 smaller cubes. However, each of these smaller cubes has a volume of (1/3)^3 = 1/27, so the total volume removed is 140 * (1/27) = 140/27. The remaining volume after the second iteration is 20 - 140/27.\n\nIn the third iteration (order 3), we apply the same process to each of the remaining 20 * 20 = 400 even smaller cubes. Each of these cubes will have a side length of (1/3)^2 = 1/9. We remove 7 smaller cubes from each of the 400 cubes, so we remove 7 * 400 = 2800 smallest cubes. Each of these smallest cubes has a volume of (1/9)^3 = 1/729, so the total volume removed is 2800 * (1/729) = 2800/729. The remaining volume after the third iteration is (20 - 140/27) - 2800/729.\n\nTo find the volume of the Menger sponge of order 3, we can calculate this expression:\n\nVolume = (20 - 140/27) - 2800/729\nVolume = (540 - 140)/27 - 2800/729\nVolume = 400/27 - 2800/729\nVolume = (400 * 27 - 2800 * 3) / (27 * 27)\nVolume = (10800 - 8400) / 729\nVolume = 2400 / 729\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3 with initial cubes of side length 1 is 2400/729."
