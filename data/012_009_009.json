    "message_2": "To determine if this is a valid degree sequence, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph. In other words, the sum of the degree sequence must be an even number.\n\nLet's check the given degree sequence: 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.\n\nSum of degrees = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15\n\nSince the sum of the degrees is an odd number (15), it violates the Handshaking Lemma, and therefore, this is not a valid degree sequence."
