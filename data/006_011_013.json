    "message_1": "In a factory, the probability of an accident at the welding station is 0.15. If there are 100 welding stations in the factory, what is the probability that at least one welding station will experience an accident on a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one welding station will experience an accident on a given day, we can first find the probability that none of the welding stations will experience an accident and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident at a single welding station is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nSince there are 100 welding stations, the probability that none of them will experience an accident is (0.85)^100 ≈ 0.000006.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one welding station will experience an accident by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\n1 - 0.000006 ≈ 0.999994.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one welding station will experience an accident on a given day is approximately 0.999994 or 99.9994%."
