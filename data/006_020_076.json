What is the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is a teenager who participates in after-school sports programs? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find out how many teenagers participate in after-school sports programs. \n\n60% of 150 teenagers = 0.60 * 150 = 90 teenagers\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is a teenager who participates in after-school sports programs.\n\nProbability = (Number of teenagers who participate in after-school sports programs) / (Total number of people in the community)\n\nProbability = 90 / 500 = 0.18\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the probability is 0.18 or 18%."
