    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set consisting of the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. If Set A contains the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}, find the complement of set A, then calculate the union of set A and its complement. Show that the resulting set is the same as the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nUniversal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', contains the elements {5, 6, 7} since these are the elements in U that are not in set A.\n\nNow, we will find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets. In this case:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nAs we can see, the resulting set after taking the union of set A and its complement A' is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which is the same as the universal set U.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
