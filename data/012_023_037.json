    "message_1": "Consider a simple graph with 6 vertices labeled V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. The edges in the graph are as follows:\n\nV1-V2, V1-V3, V1-V4, V2-V3, V2-V4, V3-V4, V4-V5, and V5-V6.\n\nWhat is the clique number of this graph?",
    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that there is a complete subgraph formed by vertices V1, V2, V3, and V4, as all pairs of these vertices are connected by edges:\n\nV1-V2, V1-V3, V1-V4, V2-V3, V2-V4, and V3-V4.\n\nThere is no larger complete subgraph in this graph. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 4."
