    "message_2": "To find the vertex and the axis of symmetry of the absolute value equation y = |3x - 4| + 2, we first need to rewrite the equation in the vertex form of an absolute value function, which is y = a| x - h | + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the graph.\n\nIn our given equation, y = |3x - 4| + 2, we can see that a = 1 (since there is no coefficient in front of the absolute value). Now, we need to rewrite the expression inside the absolute value in the form x - h.\n\nTo do this, we can factor out the coefficient of x inside the absolute value:\n\ny = |3(x - 4/3)| + 2\n\nNow, we can see that h = 4/3 and k = 2. Therefore, the vertex of the absolute value equation is (4/3, 2).\n\nThe axis of symmetry of an absolute value function is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. In this case, the axis of symmetry is x = 4/3."
