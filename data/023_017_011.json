    "message_2": "To determine the Fourier transform of the velocity profile, we first need to find the velocity profile itself. For this problem, we can use the Blasius solution for the boundary layer over a flat plate.\n\nThe Blasius solution is given by the following equation:\n\nu(y) = U * F'(η)\n\nwhere u(y) is the velocity at a distance y from the plate, U is the free-stream velocity (3 m/s in this case), and F'(η) is the derivative of the Blasius function with respect to η. η is a dimensionless parameter defined as:\n\nη = y * (U / (2 * ν * x))^0.5\n\nwhere y is the distance from the plate, x is the distance along the plate, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (ν = μ / ρ, where μ is the dynamic viscosity and ρ is the density).\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the velocity profile. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-i * k * x)] dx\n\nIn our case, f(x) = u(y) = U * F'(η). So, the Fourier transform of the velocity profile is:\n\nF(k) = ∫[U * F'(η) * e^(-i * k * x)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we need to change the variable from x to η. Using the chain rule, we can find dx/dη:\n\ndx/dη = d(η^2 * ν / U) / dη = 2 * η * ν / U\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the integral and change the limits of integration:\n\nF(k) = ∫[U * F'(η) * e^(-i * k * η^2 * ν / U) * (2 * η * ν / U)] dη\n\nThe limits of integration for η are from 0 to infinity. Now, we can plug in the given values for U, ν, and ρ:\n\nF(k) = ∫[3 * F'(η) * e^(-i * k * η^2 * 0.1 / 3) * (2 * η * 0.1 / 3)] dη\n\nUnfortunately, the Blasius function and its derivative do not have a closed-form expression, so this integral cannot be solved analytically. However, you can solve it numerically using computational methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, to find the Fourier transform of the velocity profile for specific values of k."
