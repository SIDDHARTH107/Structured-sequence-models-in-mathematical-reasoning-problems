    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph. We can divide it into two separate subgraphs:\n\nSubgraph 1: Vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges {(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4)}\nSubgraph 2: Vertices {5, 6, 7, 8} and edges {(5,6), (5,7), (6,8), (7,8)}\n\nNotice that both subgraphs are isomorphic, meaning they have the same structure. We can determine the chromatic number for one of them and apply the result to the other.\n\nLet's focus on Subgraph 1. We can color the vertices as follows:\n- Color 1: Vertex 1\n- Color 2: Vertices 2 and 3 (since they are not connected by an edge)\n- Color 3: Vertex 4 (since it is connected to both vertices 2 and 3)\n\nThus, the chromatic number for Subgraph 1 is 3. Since Subgraph 2 is isomorphic to Subgraph 1, its chromatic number is also 3.\n\nNow, we need to consider the entire graph with 8 vertices. Since there are no edges connecting vertices from Subgraph 1 to Subgraph 2, we can use the same 3 colors for both subgraphs without violating the chromatic number condition.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of the given graph is 3."
