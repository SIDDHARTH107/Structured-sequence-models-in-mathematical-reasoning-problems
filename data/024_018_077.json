    "message_2": "To compute the sectional curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let the surface be parametrized by the function F(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2). Then, we can compute the partial derivatives of F with respect to u and v:\n\nFu = (1, 0, 2u)\nFv = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [[<Fu, Fu>, <Fu, Fv>],\n     [<Fv, Fu>, <Fv, Fv>]]\n\nI = [[1 + 4u^2, -4uv],\n     [-4uv, 1 + 4v^2]]\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), the first fundamental form becomes:\n\nI(1,1) = [[5, -4],\n          [-4, 5]]\n\nNext, we need to compute the second fundamental form. To do this, we first find the normal vector N to the surface at the point (1,1,0). We can compute N by taking the cross product of Fu and Fv:\n\nN = Fu x Fv = (2u, 2v, 1)\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), the normal vector is N(1,1) = (2, 2, 1).\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [[<N, Fuu>, <N, Fuv>],\n      [<N, Fuv>, <N, Fvv>]]\n\nTo compute the entries of II, we first need to find the second partial derivatives of F:\n\nFuu = (0, 0, 2)\nFuv = (0, 0, -2)\nFvv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = [[<N, Fuu>, <N, Fuv>],\n      [<N, Fuv>, <N, Fvv>]]\n\nII = [[2, -2],\n      [-2, -2]]\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), the second fundamental form is:\n\nII(1,1) = [[2, -2],\n           [-2, -2]]\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature K in the direction of the vectors (1,0,2) and (0,1,2). Let these vectors be denoted by A and B, respectively. Then, the sectional curvature is given by:\n\nK = (II(A, B)^2) / (I(A, A) * I(B, B) - I(A, B)^2)\n\nFirst, we compute the entries of the matrices I and II at the point (1,1,0) in the direction of the vectors A and B:\n\nI(A, A) = 5\nI(A, B) = -4\nI(B, B) = 5\n\nII(A, B) = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature:\n\nK = (2^2) / (5 * 5 - (-4)^2)\nK = 4 / (25 - 16)\nK = 4 / 9\n\nThus, the sectional curvature at the point (1,1,0) in the direction of the vectors (1,0,2) and (0,1,2) is 4/9."
