    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 20 elements, and let U be the universal set containing all the elements. Find the intersection of set A and its complement, A'.",
    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. By definition, the intersection of a set and its complement contains the elements that are both in the set and its complement. However, since A and A' have no elements in common (A' has all the elements not in A), their intersection is an empty set.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement, A', is an empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
