    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the given function f(x) = e^(-x^2)cos(4x), we will use the definition of the Fourier Transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = e^(-x^2)cos(4x), so we need to compute the following integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2)cos(4x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2) * e^(-2πikx) * cos(4x)] dx, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2 - 2πikx) * cos(4x)] dx, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let's set:\n\nu = e^(-x^2 - 2πikx)\ndv = cos(4x) dx\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (-2x - 2πik) * e^(-x^2 - 2πikx) dx\nv = ∫cos(4x) dx = 1/4 * sin(4x)\n\nNow, using integration by parts formula:\n\nF(k) = uv - ∫v du, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nF(k) = [1/4 * e^(-x^2 - 2πikx) * sin(4x)] - ∫[1/4 * (-2x - 2πik) * e^(-x^2 - 2πikx) * sin(4x)] dx, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, you can use numerical methods or special functions (like the error function) to approximate the Fourier Transform F(k) for specific values of k."
