The sample mean salary was found to be $50,000 with a sample standard deviation of $5,000. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average salary of employees using the bootstrapping method.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average salary of employees using the bootstrapping method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the data with replacement: Since we don't have the actual data, we will assume that the sample mean and standard deviation are representative of the population. We will create a synthetic dataset of 100 employees with a mean salary of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $5,000.\n\n2. Calculate the mean of the resampled data: For each resampled dataset, we will calculate the mean salary.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 multiple times (e.g., 1000 times) to create a distribution of resampled means.\n\n4. Calculate the 95% confidence interval: To do this, we will find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of resampled means.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we cannot perform the bootstrapping method directly. However, we can approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution method, which is similar to the bootstrapping method.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval using the t-distribution method is:\n\nCI = mean ± (t * (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)))\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval and a sample size of 100, the t-value is approximately 1.96 (you can find this value in a t-distribution table or use a calculator).\n\nCI = $50,000 ± (1.96 * ($5,000 / sqrt(100)))\nCI = $50,000 ± (1.96 * ($5,000 / 10))\nCI = $50,000 ± (1.96 * $500)\nCI = $50,000 ± $980\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true average salary of employees is approximately $49,020 to $50,980."
