    "message_2": "To determine the next number in the sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, we can use inductive reasoning by analyzing the pattern of the given numbers. \n\nFirst, let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence:\n\n4 - 1 = 3\n9 - 4 = 5\n16 - 9 = 7\n25 - 16 = 9\n\nThe differences between consecutive numbers are increasing by 2 each time (3, 5, 7, 9). This suggests that the next difference should be 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nNow, to find the next number in the sequence, we can add this difference to the last given number:\n\n25 + 11 = 36\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 36. This sequence represents the perfect squares of consecutive integers (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...), and 36 is the square of 6 (6^2)."
