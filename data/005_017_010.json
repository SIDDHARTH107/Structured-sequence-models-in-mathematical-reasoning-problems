    "message_2": "Let's create a hypothetical data set for this problem:\n\nSales Data (in thousands of dollars):\n\n| Year | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 | Product 4 | Product 5 |\n|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1    | 50        | 60        | 55        | 70        | 65        |\n| 2    | 55        | 65        | 60        | 75        | 70        |\n| 3    | 60        | 70        | 65        | 80        | 75        |\n| 4    | 65        | 75        | 70        | 85        | 80        |\n| 5    | 70        | 80        | 75        | 90        | 85        |\n| 6    | 75        | 85        | 80        | 95        | 90        |\n| 7    | 80        | 90        | 85        | 100       | 95        |\n| 8    | 85        | 95        | 90        | 105       | 100       |\n| 9    | 90        | 100       | 95        | 110       | 105       |\n| 10   | 95        | 105       | 100       | 115       | 110       |\n\nTo perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data.\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix.\n3. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n4. Choose the first two principal components based on the largest eigenvalues.\n\nStep 1: Standardize the data\n\nWe will standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each product.\n\nStandardized Data:\n\n| Year | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 | Product 4 | Product 5 |\n|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1    | -1.5667   | -1.5667   | -1.5667   | -1.5667   | -1.5667   |\n| 2    | -1.1761   | -1.1761   | -1.1761   | -1.1761   | -1.1761   |\n| 3    | -0.7854   | -0.7854   | -0.7854   | -0.7854   | -0.7854   |\n| 4    | -0.3948   | -0.3948   | -0.3948   | -0.3948   | -0.3948   |\n| 5    | 0         | 0         | 0         | 0         | 0         |\n| 6    | 0.3948    | 0.3948    | 0.3948    | 0.3948    | 0.3948    |\n| 7    | 0.7854    | 0.7854    | 0.7854    | 0.7854    | 0.7854    |\n| 8    | 1.1761    | 1.1761    | 1.1761    | 1.1761    | 1.1761    |\n| 9    | 1.5667    | 1.5667    | 1.5667    | 1.5667    | 1.5667    |\n| 10   | 1.9573    | 1.9573    | 1.9573    | 1.9573    | 1.9573    |\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance matrix\n\nCovariance Matrix:\n\n|           | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 | Product 4 | Product 5 |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product 1 | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         |\n| Product 2 | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         |\n| Product 3 | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         |\n| Product 4 | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         |\n| Product 5 | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix\n\nEigenvalues: λ1 = 5, λ2 = 0, λ3 = 0, λ4 = 0, λ5 = 0\n\nEigenvectors: v1 = (0.4472, 0.4472, 0.4472, 0.4472, 0.4472), v2, v3, v4, and v5 are orthogonal to v1.\n\nStep 4: Choose the first two principal components based on the largest eigenvalues\n\nThe first principal component (PC1) is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, which is v1 = (0.4472, 0.4472, 0.4472, 0.4472, 0.4472).\n\nThe second principal component (PC2) is the eigenvector corresponding to the second-largest eigenvalue. However, in this case, all other eigenvalues are 0, so we cannot determine a unique second principal component.\n\nThe first principal component (PC1) captures the common variance among all products. In this case, it shows that all products have a similar sales trend over the years. Since all other eigenvalues are 0, there is no additional information captured by the other principal components. This means that the sales trends of the products are highly correlated, and there is no significant variation in the data that is not captured by the first principal component."
