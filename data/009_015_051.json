    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive substance has an initial mass of 100 grams and a half-life of 5 days. How much of the substance will remain after 20 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 100 grams, the half-life is 5 days, and the time elapsed is 20 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^(20 / 5)\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/16)\n\nFinal mass = 100 * 0.0625\n\nFinal mass = 6.25 grams\n\nSo, after 20 days, 6.25 grams of the radioactive substance will remain."
