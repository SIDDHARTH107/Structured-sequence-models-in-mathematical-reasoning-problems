    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(3x) with respect to x, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(cos(u))/du = -sin(u)\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = d(cos(u))/du * d(3x)/dx = -sin(u) * 3 = -3sin(u)\n\nSince u = 3x, we can substitute it back into the expression:\ndy/dx = -3sin(3x)\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at x = π/4:\ndy/dx(π/4) = -3sin(3(π/4)) = -3sin(3π/4)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of y = cos(3x) at x = π/4 is -3sin(3π/4)."
