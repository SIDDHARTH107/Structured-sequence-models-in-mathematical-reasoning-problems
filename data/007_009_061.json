    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, ϕ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To compute ϕ(n) for a given n, we can use the formula:\n\nϕ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 21, we first find the prime factors of 21. The prime factors are 3 and 7, as 21 = 3 * 7.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nϕ(21) = 21 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/7)\nϕ(21) = 21 * (2/3) * (6/7)\nϕ(21) = (21 * 2 * 6) / (3 * 7)\nϕ(21) = 252 / 21\nϕ(21) = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function ϕ(21) is 12."
