    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of f(z), we need to compute the sum of the second partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts of f(z) with respect to x and y. That is, ∇²f(z) = ∇²u(x,y) + i∇²v(x,y).\n\nFirst, let's find the second partial derivatives of u(x,y) and v(x,y):\n\nu(x,y) = x^2 - 3y^2\n∂u/∂x = 2x\n∂²u/∂x² = 2\n∂u/∂y = -6y\n∂²u/∂y² = -6\n\nv(x,y) = 2xy\n∂v/∂x = 2y\n∂²v/∂x² = 0\n∂v/∂y = 2x\n∂²v/∂y² = 0\n\nNow, we can find the Laplacian of f(z):\n\n∇²f(z) = ∇²u(x,y) + i∇²v(x,y) = (2 - 6) + i(0 + 0) = -4\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Laplacian at the point z = 1 + i:\n\n∇²f(1 + i) = -4\n\nSo, the Laplacian of f(z) at the point z = 1 + i is -4."
