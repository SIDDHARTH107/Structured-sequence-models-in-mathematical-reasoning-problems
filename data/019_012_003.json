    "message_1": "Use paraconsistent logic to determine if the following mathematical statement is true or false: \n\n2 + 2 = 5 \n\n(Note: paraconsistent logic allows for the existence of contradictions within a system.)",
    "message_2": "In classical logic, the statement \"2 + 2 = 5\" is considered false, as the correct sum is \"2 + 2 = 4.\" However, paraconsistent logic allows for the existence of contradictions within a system, which means that a statement can be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn paraconsistent logic, we can consider the statement \"2 + 2 = 5\" as both true and false. This is because paraconsistent logic does not follow the principle of explosion, which states that from a contradiction, any statement can be derived. In other words, paraconsistent logic allows us to accept contradictions without the system collapsing into triviality.\n\nSo, using paraconsistent logic, the statement \"2 + 2 = 5\" can be considered both true and false simultaneously. However, it is essential to note that this does not mean the statement is valid in the classical sense, but rather that paraconsistent logic allows for the coexistence of contradictory statements."
