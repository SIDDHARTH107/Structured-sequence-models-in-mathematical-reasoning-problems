    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSince the top row is [1, 2, 3], we need to find the possible values for the middle and bottom rows such that each number appears only once in each row and column.\n\nThere are two possible solutions for this 3x3 Latin square:\n\n1. Middle row: [2, 3, 1] and Bottom row: [3, 1, 2]\n\n   1  2  3\n   2  3  1\n   3  1  2\n\n2. Middle row: [3, 1, 2] and Bottom row: [2, 3, 1]\n\n   1  2  3\n   3  1  2\n   2  3  1\n\nThese are the only two possible combinations that satisfy the conditions of a 3x3 Latin square with the given top row."
