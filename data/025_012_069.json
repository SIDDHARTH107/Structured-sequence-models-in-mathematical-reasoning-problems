    "message_2": "To find all rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$, we will use the method of descent, which is based on the group law for elliptic curves.\n\nFirst, we find an initial rational point on the curve. By inspection, we can see that $(x, y) = (-1, 1)$ is a rational point on the curve, since $1^2 = (-1)^3 + 5(-1) + 7$.\n\nNow, we will use the group law for elliptic curves to find other rational points. Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, the sum $R = P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is also a point on the curve, and its coordinates can be computed as follows:\n\n1. If $P = O$ (the point at infinity), then $P + Q = Q$.\n2. If $Q = O$, then $P + Q = P$.\n3. If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $P + Q = O$.\n4. If $P = Q$, then $x_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}$ and $y_3 = \\frac{-(2x_1^3 + ax_1 + b) + x_1^2}{2y_1}$, where $a = 5$ and $b = 7$ in our case.\n5. If $P \\neq Q$, then $x_3 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ and $y_3 = \\frac{-(x_2^3 + ax_2 + b) + x_1(x_2 - x_1)}{y_2 - y_1}$.\n\nWe will use these formulas to find other rational points on the curve, starting with the point $(-1, 1)$.\n\n1. Doubling the point $(-1, 1)$, we get $2(-1, 1) = (0, -2)$.\n2. Adding the points $(-1, 1)$ and $(0, -2)$, we get $(-1, 1) + (0, -2) = (3, 5)$.\n3. Doubling the point $(3, 5)$, we get $2(3, 5) = (20/9, -161/27)$.\n4. Adding the points $(-1, 1)$ and $(20/9, -161/27)$, we get $(-1, 1) + (20/9, -161/27) = (36/25, 587/125)$.\n\nWe can continue this process to find more rational points on the curve. However, there is no general formula to find all rational points on an elliptic curve, and the method of descent can be quite involved. In practice, computer algorithms are used to find rational points on elliptic curves.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found several rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$, including $(-1, 1)$, $(0, -2)$, $(3, 5)$, $(20/9, -161/27)$, and $(36/25, 587/125)$. There are likely many more rational points on the curve, but finding them all is beyond the scope of this answer."
