    "message_2": "To decode the message, we need to reverse the process of the transposition cipher. Since every fourth letter is grouped together, we can divide the encoded message into four groups and rearrange the letters accordingly.\n\nEncoded message: M AF ERMEEHSSETLTOO\n\n1. Divide the message into four groups:\n   Group 1: M\n   Group 2: AF\n   Group 3: ERMEE\n   Group 4: HSSETLTOO\n\n2. Rearrange the letters by taking one letter from each group in order:\n   M -> E -> H -> S\n   A -> R -> S -> S\n   F -> M -> E -> E\n   - -> E -> T -> L\n   - -> - -> - -> T\n   - -> - -> - -> O\n   - -> - -> - -> O\n\n3. Combine the rearranged letters to form the original message:\n   Original message: MEET ME AFTER SCHOOL"
