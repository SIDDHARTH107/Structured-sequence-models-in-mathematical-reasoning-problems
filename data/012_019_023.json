    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. This graph is a simple cycle with 7 vertices, which is an odd number.\n\nFor odd cycles, the chromatic index is equal to the maximum degree of the graph (which is 2 in this case). Therefore, the chromatic index of G is 2."
