Your truck can hold a maximum of 10 packages per trip, and you want to complete the delivery in the least number of trips. The number of packages to be delivered to each house is given in the following table:\n\n| House | Packages |\n|-------|----------|\n| 1     | 3        |\n| 2     | 4        |\n| 3     | 1        |\n| 4     | 2        |\n| 5     | 5        |\n\nWhat is the minimum number of trips you need to make to deliver all the packages and how would you distribute the packages in each trip to achieve this goal?",
    "message_2": "The minimum number of trips needed to deliver all the packages is 2. To achieve this, you can distribute the packages in the following way:\n\nTrip 1:\n- House 1: 3 packages\n- House 2: 4 packages\n- House 3: 1 package\n- House 4: 2 packages\nTotal packages in Trip 1: 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 10 packages\n\nTrip 2:\n- House 5: 5 packages\nTotal packages in Trip 2: 5 packages\n\nIn this way, you can deliver all the packages in just 2 trips."
