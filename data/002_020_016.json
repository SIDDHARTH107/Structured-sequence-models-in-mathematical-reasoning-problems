    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a radius of 8 cm and a central angle of 60 degrees. What is the perimeter of this sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (θ/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (60/360) * 2 * 3.14159 * 8\ns = (1/6) * 2 * 3.14159 * 8\ns ≈ 8.37758 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the length of the arc to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = s + 2r\nPerimeter = 8.37758 + 2 * 8\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 24.37758 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.38 cm."
