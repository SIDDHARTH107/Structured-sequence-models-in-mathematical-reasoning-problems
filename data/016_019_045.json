    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of the Koch island after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of segments per side) * (number of sides)\n\nThe number of segments per side after n iterations is given by:\n\nSegments per side = 4^n\n\nFor the 6th iteration, the number of segments per side is:\n\nSegments per side = 4^6 = 4096\n\nSince the original equilateral triangle has a side length of 4 cm, the length of each segment after the 6th iteration is:\n\nSegment length = (initial side length) / (3^6) = 4 / (3^6) = 4 / 729\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the 6th iteration of the Koch island:\n\nPerimeter = (segment length) * (segments per side) * (number of sides)\nPerimeter = (4 / 729) * 4096 * 3\nPerimeter = 48 * 4096 / 729 â‰ˆ 271.703\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 6th iteration of the Koch island is approximately 271.703 cm."
