This involves finding the Fourier transform of the exponential and the Fourier cosine transform of the sine, and then evaluating the resulting complex integration using residues, Cauchy's theorem, and other tools of complex variable theory. The final answer should be a complex function of the complex variable s, possibly involving complex conjugates, singularities, poles, and branch cuts.",
    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform F(s) of the function f(t) = e^(3t) * sin(4t), we will use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nF(s) = L[f(t)] = ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) * f(t) * dt\n\nFirst, let's substitute f(t) into the integral:\n\nF(s) = ∫_0^∞ e^(-st) * e^(3t) * sin(4t) * dt\n\nNow, combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = ∫_0^∞ e^((3-s)t) * sin(4t) * dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let u = e^((3-s)t) and dv = sin(4t) * dt. Then, du = (3-s)e^((3-s)t) * dt and v = -1/4 * cos(4t).\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = [-1/4 * e^((3-s)t) * cos(4t)]_0^∞ + 1/4 ∫_0^∞ (3-s)e^((3-s)t) * cos(4t) * dt\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the first term at the limits:\n\nAs t approaches ∞, e^((3-s)t) approaches 0 if s > 3. Therefore, the first term becomes 0.\n\nAt t = 0, e^((3-s)t) = 1 and cos(4t) = 1. So, the first term becomes -1/4.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nF(s) = -1/4 + 1/4 ∫_0^∞ (3-s)e^((3-s)t) * cos(4t) * dt\n\nTo solve the remaining integral, we will use integration by parts again. Let u = (3-s)e^((3-s)t) and dv = cos(4t) * dt. Then, du = -se^((3-s)t) * dt and v = 1/4 * sin(4t).\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = -1/4 + 1/4 * [(3-s)e^((3-s)t) * 1/4 * sin(4t)]_0^∞ - 1/4 * 1/4 ∫_0^∞ -se^((3-s)t) * sin(4t) * dt\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the first term at the limits:\n\nAs t approaches ∞, (3-s)e^((3-s)t) approaches 0 if s > 3. Therefore, the first term becomes 0.\n\nAt t = 0, (3-s)e^((3-s)t) = 3-s and sin(4t) = 0. So, the first term becomes 0.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nF(s) = -1/4 - 1/16 ∫_0^∞ -se^((3-s)t) * sin(4t) * dt\n\nF(s) = -1/4 + s/16 ∫_0^∞ e^((3-s)t) * sin(4t) * dt\n\nNow, we have the same integral as before but multiplied by s/16. We can rewrite F(s) as:\n\nF(s) = -1/4 + s/16 * F(s)\n\nNow, solve for F(s):\n\nF(s) * (1 - s/16) = -1/4\n\nF(s) = -1/4 * 1/(1 - s/16)\n\nF(s) = -1/4 * 16/(16 - s)\n\nF(s) = -4/(16 - s)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = e^(3t) * sin(4t) is F(s) = -4/(16 - s) for s > 3."
