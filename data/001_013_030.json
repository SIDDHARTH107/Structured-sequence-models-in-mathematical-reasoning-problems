    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(5x-1) + 3 = 6, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nSubtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n√(5x-1) = 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(5x-1))^2 = 3^2\n\n5x - 1 = 9\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\n5x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation √(5x-1) + 3 = 6 is x = 2."
