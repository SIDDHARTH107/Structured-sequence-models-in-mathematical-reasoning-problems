    "message_1": "A group has exactly 60 elements. Identify this group based on the following information:\n\n- The group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3.\n- The Sylow 5-subgroup of the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5.\n- The group is not isomorphic to the cyclic group C60 or the alternating group A5 × C2.",
    "message_2": "Let G be the group with 60 elements. Since G has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, by the Sylow Theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P2 of order 2^2 = 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of order 3. Also, the Sylow 5-subgroup of G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5, which means G has a Sylow 5-subgroup P5 of order 5.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of Sylow subgroups in G. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\n1. For Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2 divides 60/4 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15. Since G is not isomorphic to C60, n_2 ≠ 1. \n\n2. For Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3 divides 60/3 = 20, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. Since G is not isomorphic to C60, n_3 ≠ 1.\n\n3. For Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5 divides 60/5 = 12, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. Since G is not isomorphic to C60, n_5 ≠ 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 6, then G would have at least 1 + 2(3) + 2(4) + 4(6) = 31 distinct elements (including the identity), which is not possible since G has only 60 elements.\n\n2. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 6, then G would have at least 1 + 3(5) + 2(4) + 4(6) = 41 distinct elements (including the identity), which is not possible since G has only 60 elements.\n\n3. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 6, then G would have at least 1 + 3(15) + 2(4) + 4(6) = 61 distinct elements (including the identity), which is not possible since G has only 60 elements.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6, then G would have at least 1 + 2(3) + 2(10) + 4(6) = 49 distinct elements (including the identity), which is not possible since G has only 60 elements.\n\n5. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6, then G would have at least 1 + 3(5) + 2(10) + 4(6) = 59 distinct elements (including the identity). In this case, G has a unique element that is not in any Sylow subgroup, and this element must have order lcm(2, 3, 5) = 30. Thus, G has an element of order 30.\n\nSince G has an element of order 30 and is not isomorphic to C60, G must be isomorphic to a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. The only possibility left is that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product P2 × P3 × P5, where P2 ≅ C4, P3 ≅ C3, and P5 ≅ C5. This group has 60 elements and is not isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2."
