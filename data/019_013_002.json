    "message_2": "In second-order logic, there are two types of variables: individual variables (first-order) and predicate variables (second-order). However, the question seems to be asking about propositional variables, which are used in propositional logic, not second-order logic. I will assume you meant propositional variables.\n\nIf there are three propositional variables, and each can take on one of two truth values (true or false), then the number of possible combinations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of combinations = 2^n\n\nwhere n is the number of variables.\n\nIn this case, n = 3, so:\n\nNumber of combinations = 2^3 = 8"
