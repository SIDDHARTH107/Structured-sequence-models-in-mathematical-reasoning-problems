    "message_2": "Since a major earthquake occurs every 10 years on average, the probability of a major earthquake occurring in a given year can be calculated as the reciprocal of the average interval between earthquakes.\n\nProbability = 1 / (Average interval between earthquakes)\n\nIn this case, the average interval between earthquakes is 10 years.\n\nProbability = 1 / 10 = 0.1\n\nSo, the probability of this region being hit by a major earthquake in a given year is 0.1 or 10%."
