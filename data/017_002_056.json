    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we can use the fact that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since the order of G is 12, the possible orders of subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will find the subgroups of each order and determine if they are cyclic.\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e} where e is the identity element. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n2. Order 2: The elements of order 2 are a^6. So, the subgroup of order 2 is {e, a^6}. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n3. Order 3: The elements of order 3 are a^4 and a^8. So, the subgroups of order 3 are {e, a^4, a^8}. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n4. Order 4: The elements of order 4 are a^3, a^6, a^9, and a^12. So, the subgroups of order 4 are {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n5. Order 6: The elements of order 6 are a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10. So, the subgroups of order 6 are {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n6. Order 12: The entire group G is a subgroup of order 12, and it is cyclic since it is generated by a.\n\nIn summary, all the subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, a^6}\n3. {e, a^4, a^8}\n4. {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\n6. G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}\n\nAll of these subgroups are cyclic."
