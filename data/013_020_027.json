    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where 50 players choose a number between 0 and 100. The player who chooses the number closest to 2/3 of the average guess wins. If two or more players have equally closest guesses, they share the prize. What number should a player choose to maximize their chances of winning and what is the expected value of the prize?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, a player should try to guess what the other players are likely to choose and then select 2/3 of that average. This is because the winning number is based on 2/3 of the average guess.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and know that everyone else is rational as well. In this case, no player would choose a number above 66.67 (2/3 of 100) because it's impossible for the average to be higher than 100. So, the highest possible winning number is 2/3 * 66.67 ≈ 44.44.\n\nNow, if all players know that no one will choose a number above 66.67, they should also realize that the new highest possible winning number is 2/3 * 44.44 ≈ 29.63. This process of iterated elimination of dominated strategies continues until the players converge to choosing 0 as their number.\n\nHowever, in reality, not all players may be perfectly rational or aware of the iterated elimination process. So, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact number that a player should choose to maximize their chances of winning. A good strategy would be to choose a number slightly below the expected 2/3 of the average guess, considering the potential irrationality of some players.\n\nAs for the expected value of the prize, it's difficult to calculate without knowing the distribution of the players' guesses and the prize amount. If the prize is shared equally among the winners, the expected value would depend on the probability of winning and the number of winners. In a game with rational players, the expected value would be low, as many players would choose numbers close to the optimal strategy, increasing the likelihood of sharing the prize."
