    "message_2": "Let's represent the occurrence of event A at time t=5 as A(5) and the occurrence of event B at time t=10 as B(10). We want to create a logical formula that returns \"true\" if B(10) happened after A(5) and \"false\" otherwise.\n\nThe logical formula can be represented as:\n\nB(t2) ∧ A(t1) → (t2 > t1)\n\nIn this formula, B(t2) represents the occurrence of event B at time t2, A(t1) represents the occurrence of event A at time t1, and (t2 > t1) checks if event B happened after event A.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of t1 = 5 and t2 = 10:\n\nB(10) ∧ A(5) → (10 > 5)\n\nSince 10 > 5, the formula evaluates to \"true\", indicating that event B happened after event A."
