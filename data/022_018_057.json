    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given complex partial differential equation, we can first try to solve it using an integrating factor. Let's consider the following substitution:\n\n$$ g(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}} $$\n\nNow, the given equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} - 3g = 2 $$\n\nWe can solve this first-order linear partial differential equation for $g(z, \\bar{z})$ using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\n$$ \\mu(z) = e^{\\int -3 dz} = e^{-3z} $$\n\nMultiplying the equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\n$$ e^{-3z} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} - 3 e^{-3z} g = 2 e^{-3z} $$\n\nNow, the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of the product of $g$ and the integrating factor:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (e^{-3z} g) = 2 e^{-3z} $$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$$ e^{-3z} g = -\\frac{2}{3} e^{-3z} + h(\\bar{z}) $$\n\nwhere $h(\\bar{z})$ is an arbitrary function of $\\bar{z}$. Now, we can solve for $g(z, \\bar{z})$:\n\n$$ g(z, \\bar{z}) = -\\frac{2}{3} + h(\\bar{z}) e^{3z} $$\n\nRecall that $g(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}}$. Therefore, we can find $f(z, \\bar{z})$ by integrating $g(z, \\bar{z})$ with respect to $\\bar{z}$:\n\n$$ f(z, \\bar{z}) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{2}{3} + h(\\bar{z}) e^{3z}\\right) d\\bar{z} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\bar{z} + e^{3z} \\int h(\\bar{z}) d\\bar{z} + k(z) $$\n\nwhere $k(z)$ is an arbitrary function of $z$. Thus, the general solution of the given complex partial differential equation is:\n\n$$ f(z, \\bar{z}) = -\\frac{2}{3} \\bar{z} + e^{3z} \\int h(\\bar{z}) d\\bar{z} + k(z) $$"
