    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of y = 3x^2 + 4x + 2 over the interval [1, 4], we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 1 to 4.\n\nThe integral of y = 3x^2 + 4x + 2 with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(3x^2 + 4x + 2) dx = (x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\nF(4) = (4^3 + 2(4^2) + 2(4)) = (64 + 32 + 8) = 104\nF(1) = (1^3 + 2(1^2) + 2(1)) = (1 + 2 + 2) = 5\n\nNow, subtract F(1) from F(4) to find the area under the curve:\n\nArea = F(4) - F(1) = 104 - 5 = 99\n\nSo, the area under the curve of y = 3x^2 + 4x + 2 over the interval [1, 4] is 99 square units."
