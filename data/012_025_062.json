    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, we can try to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, corresponding to the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix.\n\nWe can start by listing the adjacent vertices for each vertex:\n\nA: B, D\nB: A, C\nC: B, D, E\nD: A, C, F, G\nE: C, F\nF: D, E, G\nG: D, F\n\nNow, let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1. Start at vertex A: A\n2. Move to vertex B (A is adjacent to B): A -> B\n3. Move to vertex C (B is adjacent to C): A -> B -> C\n4. Move to vertex D (C is adjacent to D): A -> B -> C -> D\n5. Move to vertex F (D is adjacent to F): A -> B -> C -> D -> F\n6. Move to vertex G (F is adjacent to G): A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> G\n7. Move to vertex E (G is adjacent to E): A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> G -> E\n\nNow, we have visited all vertices exactly once. To complete the cycle, we need to return to vertex A. Since E is adjacent to C, and C is adjacent to A, we can return to A:\n\n8. Move to vertex C (E is adjacent to C): A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> G -> E -> C\n9.
