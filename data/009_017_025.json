    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 10 meters from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (5 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (10 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 10 m)\n\nThe π terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\nB = (2 × 10^(-6) T * 5) / 20\n\nB = 10^(-6) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a distance of 10 meters from the wire is 1 μT (microtesla)."
