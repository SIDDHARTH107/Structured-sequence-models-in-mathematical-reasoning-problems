    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a compact 2-dimensional manifold can be related to its genus (g) using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nIn this case, the Euler characteristic is given as 3. We can solve for the genus:\n\n3 = 2 - 2g\n2g = -1\ng = -1/2\n\nHowever, the genus of a compact 2-dimensional manifold must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, there is no compact 2-dimensional manifold with an Euler characteristic of 3."
