    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. It costs $5 to produce one unit of product A and $7 to produce one unit of product B. The company can sell product A for $10 per unit and product B for $15 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit. The company has a production constraint that they produce a total of 100 units of both products combined. Using the cuckoo search algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of product A and B that the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function.\n2. Initialize the population of cuckoos.\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo.\n4. Perform the search and update the population.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function\nThe objective function represents the profit the company makes. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function is:\n\nProfit(x, y) = (10 - 5) * x + (15 - 7) * y = 5x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\nx + y = 100 (production constraint)\nx, y â‰¥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nStep 2: Initialize the population of cuckoos\nLet's assume we have a population of 10 cuckoos. We randomly generate 10 pairs of (x, y) values that satisfy the constraints.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo\nCalculate the profit for each cuckoo using the objective function and store the results.\n\nStep 4: Perform the search and update the population\nFor each cuckoo, perform a random walk to generate a new solution. If the new solution is better (i.e., has a higher profit) and satisfies the constraints, replace the old solution with the new one. If a cuckoo has the best solution, it becomes the global best solution.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met\nContinue iterating through the algorithm until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a minimum improvement threshold.\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we will find the optimal number of units of product A and B that the company should produce to maximize its profit. In this case, since the profit per unit of product B is higher than product A, the optimal solution will likely involve producing more units of product B than product A, while still satisfying the production constraint."
