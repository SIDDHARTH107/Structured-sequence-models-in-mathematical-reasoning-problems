    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 2x_1 - 3x_2 = -1.5 \\\\ 4x_1 - 6.9x_2 = -3.45 \\end{cases}.$$\n\nTo use the elimination method, we want to eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. In this case, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x_1$ the same in both equations:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 4x_1 - 6x_2 = -3 \\\\ 4x_1 - 6.9x_2 = -3.45 \\end{cases}.$$\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $x_1$:\n\n$$(4x_1 - 6.9x_2) - (4x_1 - 6x_2) = -3.45 - (-3)$$\n$$-0.9x_2 = -0.45$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by -0.9 to solve for $x_2$:\n\n$$x_2 = \\frac{-0.45}{-0.9} = 0.5$$\n\nNow that we have the value of $x_2$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for $x_1$. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$$2x_1 - 3x_2 = -1.5$$\n$$2x_1 - 3(0.5) = -1.5$$\n$$2x_1 - 1.5 = -1.5$$\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n$$2x_1 = 0$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\n$$x_1 = 0$$\n\nSo, the solution of the system of linear equations is $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 0.5)$."
