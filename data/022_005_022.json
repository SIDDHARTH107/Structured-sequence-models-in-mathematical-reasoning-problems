    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) at z = 0, we first need to simplify the function and then find the coefficient of the (z - 0)^{-1} term in the Laurent series expansion of the simplified function around z = 0.\n\nLet's simplify the function f(z) first:\n\nf(z) = cos(z) / (z^3 - 2z^2 + z)\n\nFactor out z from the denominator:\n\nf(z) = cos(z) / (z(z^2 - 2z + 1))\n\nNow, we notice that the denominator has a factor of (z - 1)^2:\n\nf(z) = cos(z) / (z(z - 1)^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 0. We can do this by finding the Taylor series expansion of cos(z) and then dividing it by the factors in the denominator.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion of cos(z) around z = 0 is:\n\ncos(z) = 1 - (z^2)/2! + (z^4)/4! - ... \n\nNow, we need to divide this series by z(z - 1)^2. We can do this term by term:\n\n(1/z) - (z/2!) + (z^3/4!) - ...\n\nand\n\n(1/(z - 1)^2) - (z/(z - 1)^2 * 2!) + (z^3/(z - 1)^2 * 4!) - ...\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of the (z - 0)^{-1} term in the Laurent series expansion of f(z). This term comes from the first term in each of the series above:\n\n(1/z) + (1/(z - 1)^2)\n\nTo find the residue, we need to evaluate this expression at z = 0:\n\nResidue = (1/0) + (1/(-1)^2) = 1\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at z = 0 is 1."
