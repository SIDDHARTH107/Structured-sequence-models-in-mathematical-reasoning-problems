The goal is to find the optimal value of u that maximizes the concentration of the product at t = 5, given that u can vary from 0 to 5. \n\nWhat is the optimal value of u that maximizes the concentration of the product at t = 5? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation. The given differential equation is a first-order linear differential equation:\n\ndy/dt - 2y = -3u\n\nLet's solve it using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫-2 dt) = e^(-2t). Multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-2t) dy/dt - 2e^(-2t) y = -3ue^(-2t)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (ye^(-2t)) = -3ue^(-2t)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫ d(ye^(-2t)) = ∫ -3ue^(-2t) dt\n\nye^(-2t) = (-3/2) ∫ ue^(-2t) dt + C\n\nTo find the integral on the right side, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet v = u, then dv = du\nLet dw = e^(-2t) dt, then w = (-1/2)e^(-2t)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udw = uv - ∫vdu\n\n(-3/2) ∫ ue^(-2t) dt = (-3/2) [(-1/2)ue^(-2t) - ∫ (-1/2)e^(-2t) du]\n\n(-3/2) ∫ ue^(-2t) dt = (3/4)ue^(-2t) + (3/4) ∫ e^(-2t) du\n\nNow, integrate e^(-2t) with respect to u:\n\n(3/4) ∫ e^(-2t) du = (3/4)e^(-2t)u\n\nSo, the right side of the equation becomes:\n\nye^(-2t) = (3/4)ue^(-2t) + (3/4)e^(-2t)u + C\n\nNow, multiply both sides by e^(2t) to get y:\n\ny = (3/4)u + (3/4)u + Ce^(2t)\n\nSince we want to maximize the concentration of the product at t = 5, we can take the derivative of y with respect to u and set it to zero:\n\ndy/du = 3/4 + 3/4 = 3/2\n\nSince the derivative of y with respect to u is a constant and does not depend on u, the concentration of the product does not have a maximum value in the given range of u (0 to 5). Therefore, the optimal value of u that maximizes the concentration of the product at t = 5 does not exist."
