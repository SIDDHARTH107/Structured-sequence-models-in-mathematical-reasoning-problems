    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∪ {7}. This is the union of the Cartesian product A x B and the set {7}.\n\n(A x B) ∪ {7} = {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), 7}\n\nUsing set builder notation, we can write this as:\n\n(A x B) ∪ {7} = { (a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B } ∪ {7}\n\nNow, let's find ({A x B} ∪ {7}). This is not a valid operation since we cannot take the Cartesian product of a set of ordered pairs and a set containing a single element. The Cartesian product requires two sets as input, not a set and an element.\n\nTherefore, we cannot compute ({A x B} ∪ {7}) and this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
