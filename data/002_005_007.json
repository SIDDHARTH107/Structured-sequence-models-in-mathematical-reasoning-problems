    "message_1": "Given a rectangular prism with length = 8 cm, width = 5 cm, and height = 4 cm, determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism. Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a centimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length = 8 cm, width = 5 cm, and height = 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 5² + 4²) = √(64 + 25 + 16) = √105 ≈ 10.2 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 10.2 cm, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter."
