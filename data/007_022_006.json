    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve represented by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the finite field F11, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe will use the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize a counter variable to store the number of points on the curve.\n2. Iterate through all possible x and y values in the finite field F11 (0 to 10).\n3. For each (x, y) pair, check if the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 holds true in F11.\n4. If the equation holds true, increment the counter.\n5. After iterating through all possible (x, y) pairs, add 1 to the counter to account for the point at infinity.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the counter: points_on_curve = 0\n2. Iterate through all possible x and y values in F11:\n\n   for x in range(11):\n       for y in range(11):\n\n3. Check if the equation holds true in F11:\n\n   if (y * y) % 11 == (x * x * x + 2 * x + 2) % 11:\n       points_on_curve += 1\n\n4. Increment the counter if the equation holds true.\n5. Add 1 to the counter to account for the point at infinity: points_on_curve += 1\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that the order of the elliptic curve is 13."
