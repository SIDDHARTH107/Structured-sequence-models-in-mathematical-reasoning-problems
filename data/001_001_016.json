    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n   2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5\n   2x = 6\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n   2x / 2 = 6 / 2\n   x = 3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 3."
