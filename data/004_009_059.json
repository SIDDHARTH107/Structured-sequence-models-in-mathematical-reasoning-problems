    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 * cos(x) + 2 sin(x), we will use the product rule and the sum rule.\n\nThe sum rule states that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, so we can find the derivatives of each term separately and then add them together.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of the first term, x^2 * cos(x):\n\nd/dx(x^2 * cos(x)) = d/dx(x^2) * cos(x) + x^2 * d/dx(cos(x))\n\nThe derivative of x^2 is 2x, and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x):\n\nd/dx(x^2 * cos(x)) = 2x * cos(x) - x^2 * sin(x)\n\nNow let's find the derivative of the second term, 2 sin(x):\n\nd/dx(2 sin(x)) = 2 * d/dx(sin(x))\n\nThe derivative of sin(x) is cos(x):\n\nd/dx(2 sin(x)) = 2 * cos(x)\n\nNow we can add the derivatives of the two terms together:\n\nf'(x) = (2x * cos(x) - x^2 * sin(x)) + 2 * cos(x)\n\nNow we need to find the value of the derivative at x = pi/4:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (2(pi/4) * cos(pi/4) - (pi/4)^2 * sin(pi/4)) + 2 * cos(pi/4)\n\ncos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = √2/2\n\nf'(pi/4) = (2(pi/4) * (√2/2) - (pi/4)^2 * (√2/2)) + 2 * (√2/2)\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi * (√2/2) - (pi^2/16) * (√2/2)) + √2\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi√2/2 - pi^2√2/32) + √2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 * cos(x) + 2 sin(x) at x = pi/4 is:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi√2/2 - pi^2√2/32) + √2"
