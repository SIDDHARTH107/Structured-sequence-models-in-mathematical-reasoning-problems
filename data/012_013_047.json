    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G.\n\nLet's start by labeling the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E, corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The edges are then {A,B}, {A,C}, {A,D}, {A,E}, {B,C}, {B,D}, and {C,D}.\n\nNow, let's apply the deletion-contraction algorithm:\n\n1. Choose an edge, say {A,B}. \n2. Delete this edge to get a new graph G' with the edges {A,C}, {A,D}, {A,E}, {B,C}, {B,D}, and {C,D}.\n3. Contract this edge to get a new graph G'' with the vertices A', C, D, and E, and the edges {A',C}, {A',D}, {A',E}, {C,D}.\n\nNow we have two simpler graphs, G' and G'', and we can apply the deletion-contraction algorithm recursively:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\n\nFor G':\n\n1. Choose an edge, say {A,C}.\n2. Delete this edge to get a new graph G1 with the edges {A,D}, {A,E}, {B,C}, {B,D}, and {C,D}.\n3. Contract this edge to get a new graph G2 with the vertices A'', B, D, and E, and the edges {A'',B}, {A'',D}, {A'',E}, {B,D}.\n\nP(G', k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k)\n\nFor G1, we can see that it is a tree (acyclic graph), and the chromatic polynomial of a tree is k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n=5, so P(G1, k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nFor G2, it is a cycle with 4 vertices, and the chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an even number of vertices is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n=4, so P(G2, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1).\n\nNow, we can substitute these back into the equation for P(G', k):\n\nP(G', k) = k(k-1)^4 - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]\n\nFor G'':\n\nSince G'' is a cycle with 4 vertices, its chromatic polynomial is the same as G2:\n\nP(G'', k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)\n\nNow, we can substitute these back into the equation for P(G, k):\n\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)^4 - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]] - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)^4 - k + 1 - (k-1)^4 + k - 1\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - 2(k-1)^4 + 2\n\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^4(k - 2)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = (k-1)^4(k - 2)."
