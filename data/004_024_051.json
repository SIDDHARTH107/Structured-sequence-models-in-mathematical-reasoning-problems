    "message_2": "Yes, I can help you find the derivative of y = cos(3x + 2) using the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that if you have a composite function, say y = f(g(x)), then the derivative dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nIn this case, we have y = cos(u) where u = 3x + 2. We will first find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u, and then find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x.\n\nOuter function: y = cos(u)\nDerivative with respect to u: dy/du = -sin(u)\n\nInner function: u = 3x + 2\nDerivative with respect to x: du/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = dy/du * du/dx = -sin(u) * 3\n\nSince u = 3x + 2, we can substitute it back into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = -3sin(3x + 2)"
