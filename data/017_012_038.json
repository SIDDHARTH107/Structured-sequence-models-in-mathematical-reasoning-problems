    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we will analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems and group properties.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p, if p^k divides the order of a group G (|G| = p^k * m, where p does not divide m), then G has a subgroup of order p^k, called a Sylow p-subgroup.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted by n_p, divides m and is congruent to 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 16. Since 16 = 2^4, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 1 (since m = 1) and be congruent to 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 = 1, meaning that there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16, which must be G itself.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G:\n\n1. G is cyclic: If G is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to C16, the cyclic group of order 16. In this case, G has a single element of order 16, and all other non-identity elements have orders that divide 16.\n\n2. G is dihedral: If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8, then G has the structure of the symmetries of a regular octagon. In this case, G is non-abelian and has 8 elements of order 2 and 8 elements of order 4.\n\n3. G is a non-abelian group of order 16: If G is a non-abelian group of order 16, then it has a more complex structure than the dihedral group D8, but it is still non-abelian.\n\nTo determine which of these structures G has, we can analyze the possible orders of elements in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 16. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.\n\nIf G has an element of order 16, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C16. If G has no element of order 16 but has an element of order 8, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to D8. If G has no elements of order 8 or 16, then G is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nTo determine which of these cases applies to G, we can use the fact that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. Since G is the only Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal in G. If G has an element of order 16, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C16. If G has no element of order 16 but has an element of order 8, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to D8. If G has no elements of order 8 or 16, then G is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the specific group G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16. However, we have provided a method for determining the isomorphism type of G based on the orders of its elements and the properties of its Sylow 2-subgroups."
