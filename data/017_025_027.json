    "message_2": "To find the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 120, we will use the Sylow theorems and some combinatorial arguments. \n\nFirst, note that the prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 2^3 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of n_2, n_3, and n_5 and determine the cardinality of each isomorphism class.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one group, the cyclic group of order 120, Z_120.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 3 isomorphism classes of groups: Z_2 x Z_60, Z_4 x Z_30, and Z_8 x Z_15.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one isomorphism class of groups: Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_30.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 4 isomorphism classes of groups: Z_3 x Z_40, Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_20, Z_3 x Z_4 x Z_10, and Z_3 x Z_8 x Z_5.\n\nCase 5: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are 6 isomorphism classes of groups: Z_5 x Z_24, Z_5 x Z_2 x Z_12, Z_5 x Z_4 x Z_6, Z_5 x Z_8 x Z_3, Z_5 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_6, and Z_5 x Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_3.\n\nCase 6: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 12 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nCase 7: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are 18 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nCase 8: n_2 = 15, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 60 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nCase 9: n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are 90 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nCase 10: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are 24 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nCase 11: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are 72 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nCase 12: n_2 = 15, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, there are 180 isomorphism classes of groups.\n\nAdding up the number of isomorphism classes in each case, we get:\n\n1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 12 + 18 + 60 + 90 + 24 + 72 + 180 = 488\n\nThus, there are exactly 488 groups of order 120."
