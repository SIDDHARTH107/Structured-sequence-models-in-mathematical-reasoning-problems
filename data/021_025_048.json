    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for the given quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 10, we can find the maximum value using basic calculus.\n\nTo find the maximum value, we first need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 6\n\nSetting f'(x) = 0:\n\n2x - 6 = 0\nx = 3\n\nNow, we need to determine if this critical point is a maximum or minimum. We can do this by taking the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(x) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a minimum. However, since the function is a parabola that opens upwards, there is no maximum value for the function. The function will continue to increase as x goes to positive or negative infinity."
