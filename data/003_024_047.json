    "message_2": "To find the components of the ship's velocity directly eastward and northward, we can use the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. \n\nGiven that the ship is traveling at a speed of 15 km/h at an angle of 60° North of East, we can use the following formulas:\n\nEastward velocity component (V_east) = Speed × cos(angle)\nNorthward velocity component (V_north) = Speed × sin(angle)\n\nFirst, let's convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nangle (in radians) = (angle in degrees) × (π/180)\nangle (in radians) = 60° × (π/180) = π/3\n\nNow, we can find the eastward and northward components:\n\nV_east = 15 × cos(π/3)\nV_east = 15 × (1/2)\nV_east = 7.5 km/h\n\nV_north = 15 × sin(π/3)\nV_north = 15 × (√3/2)\nV_north ≈ 15 × 0.866\nV_north ≈ 12.99 km/h\n\nSo, the component of the ship's velocity directly eastward is approximately 7.5 km/h, and the component of its velocity directly northward is approximately 12.99 km/h."
