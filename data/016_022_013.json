    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangles required to construct the nth iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^n\n\nFor the fourth iteration (n = 4):\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, 256 triangles are required to construct the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid."
