    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the paraboloid at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u² + v²)\n\nNow, we need to find the first partial derivatives of S with respect to u and v:\n\nS_u = (∂S/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nS_v = (∂S/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we need to find the second partial derivatives of S with respect to u and v:\n\nS_uu = (∂²S/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (∂²S/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nS_vv = (∂²S/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <S_u, S_u> = 1² + 0² + (2u)² = 1 + 4u²\nF = <S_u, S_v> = 1*0 + 0*1 + (2u)*(2v) = 4uv\nG = <S_v, S_v> = 0² + 1² + (2v)² = 1 + 4v²\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <S_uu, N> = (0, 0, 2) * (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\nM = <S_uv, N> = (0, 0, 0) * (-2u, -2v, 1) = 0\nN = <S_vv, N> = (0, 0, 2) * (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface. Now, we can compute the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (EG - F²) * (LN + MN - 2LM) / 2(EG - F²)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. So, we can compute the coefficients:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)² = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)² = 5\n\nSince M = 0 and L = N = 2, the mean curvature H is:\n\nH = (5*5 - 4²) * (2*2 + 0 - 2*0) / 2(5*5 - 4²) = (25 - 16) * 4 / 2(9) = 9 * 2 / 18 = 1\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the paraboloid at the point (1, 1, 2) is 1."
