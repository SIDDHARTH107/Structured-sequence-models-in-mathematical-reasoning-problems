    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to write a numerical problem for Non-monotonic logic as it deals with reasoning under uncertain conditions and does not involve numerical calculations. However, I can provide a question related to Non-monotonic logic for a math student to ponder upon and understand:\n\nHow does Non-monotonic logic differ from classical logic and what are the applications of Non-monotonic logic in Artificial Intelligence?",
    "message_2": "Non-monotonic logic differs from classical logic in the way it handles uncertainty and incomplete information. In classical logic, a conclusion is either true or false, and adding new information does not change the truth value of previous conclusions. However, in non-monotonic logic, conclusions can be revised when new information is added, making it more suitable for reasoning under uncertainty.\n\nThe applications of non-monotonic logic in Artificial Intelligence (AI) include:\n\n1. Default reasoning: Non-monotonic logic allows AI systems to make assumptions based on typical situations when specific information is not available. For example, if an AI system knows that birds typically fly, it can assume that a newly encountered bird can fly unless it learns otherwise.\n\n2. Commonsense reasoning: Non-monotonic logic helps AI systems to reason with incomplete or uncertain information, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. It allows AI systems to draw conclusions based on general knowledge and update those conclusions when new information becomes available.\n\n3. Knowledge representation: Non-monotonic logic provides a way to represent and reason with incomplete or uncertain knowledge, which is essential for AI systems to understand and interact with the complex and dynamic world.\n\n4. Expert systems: Non-monotonic logic is used in expert systems to model the reasoning process of human experts who often make decisions based on incomplete information and revise their conclusions when new information is available.\n\n5. Planning and decision-making: Non-monotonic logic can be used in AI planning and decision-making systems to handle uncertainty and make decisions based on the best available information, updating plans as new information is obtained.\n\nIn summary, non-monotonic logic is a crucial tool in AI for handling uncertainty and reasoning with incomplete information, making it an essential component of many AI applications."
