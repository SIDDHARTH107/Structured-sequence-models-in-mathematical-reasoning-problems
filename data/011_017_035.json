    "message_2": "A Latin square of order n is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, such that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n\nFor a Latin square of order 4, there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the symbols in the first row. For the second row, there are 3! ways to arrange the remaining symbols, since the symbols in the first column are already fixed. For the third row, there are 2! ways to arrange the remaining symbols, and the last row is determined by the previous rows.\n\nSo, the total number of possible Latin squares of order 4 is:\n\n4! × 3! × 2! = 24 × 6 × 2 = 288\n\nThere are 288 possible Latin squares of order 4."
