    "message_1": "A student wants to find the height of a building. From a point on the ground, the student measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 60 degrees. The distance from the student to the base of the building is 50 meters. What is the height of the building (to the nearest meter) using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the base of the building (50 meters).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 50\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nheight = 50 * tan(60°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 60 degrees:\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 86.6\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 87 meters."
