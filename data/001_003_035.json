    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one of the variables. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n3x + 4y = 10\n\n3x = 10 - 4y\n\nx = (10 - 4y) / 3\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n7x - 2y = 8\n\n7((10 - 4y) / 3) - 2y = 8\n\nNow, we'll solve for y:\n\n(70 - 28y) / 3 - 2y = 8\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n70 - 28y - 6y = 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-34y = -46\n\nNow, divide by -34:\n\ny = 46 / 34\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\ny = 23 / 17\n\nNow that we have the value for y, we'll substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = (10 - 4y) / 3\n\nx = (10 - 4(23/17)) / 3\n\nx = (10 - 92/17) / 3\n\nTo subtract the fractions, find a common denominator (17):\n\nx = (170 - 92) / (17 * 3)\n\nx = 78 / 51\n\nNow, we have the solution for the system of linear equations:\n\nx = 78 / 51\ny = 23 / 17"
