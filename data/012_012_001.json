    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of graph G, we can use the inequality relating the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and the girth (g) of a graph:\n\nE ≤ (g - 2) * V / 2\n\nIn this case, we have V = 12 and E = 18. We want to find the smallest integer value of g that satisfies the inequality.\n\n18 ≤ (g - 2) * 12 / 2\n\nRearranging and simplifying the inequality:\n\n18 * 2 / 12 ≤ g - 2\n3 ≤ g - 2\n\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\ng ≥ 5\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest integer value of g, the girth of the graph G is 5."
