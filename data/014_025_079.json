    "message_1": "A cryptographic hash function produces a 160-bit output from any input message. If the input message is increased by one bit, by how many bits is the output hash value likely to change?",
    "message_2": "In a cryptographic hash function, even a small change in the input message, such as increasing it by one bit, can cause a significant change in the output hash value. This property is known as the \"avalanche effect.\" On average, half of the bits in the output hash value are expected to change when the input message is altered. \n\nIn this case, the output hash value is 160 bits long. Therefore, when the input message is increased by one bit, approximately 80 bits (half of 160) in the output hash value are likely to change."
