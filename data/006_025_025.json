    "message_1": "In a magic show, a magician performs 5 tricks: levitation, card tricks, disappearing act, fire-eating, and escape. The probability of the audience seeing the levitation trick is 1/4, the probability of seeing the card trick is 1/2, the probability of seeing the disappearing act is 1/3, the probability of seeing the fire-eating trick is 1/6, and the probability of seeing the escape act is 1/5. What is the probability that the audience will see at least two of the tricks?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the audience seeing at least two of the tricks, we can use the complementary probability rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the event we are interested in is the audience seeing at least two tricks, so the complementary event is the audience seeing at most one trick.\n\nLet's first find the probability of the audience not seeing each trick:\n- Not seeing levitation: 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n- Not seeing card tricks: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n- Not seeing disappearing act: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n- Not seeing fire-eating: 1 - 1/6 = 5/6\n- Not seeing escape act: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of the audience seeing at most one trick. This can happen in two ways: either the audience sees exactly one trick or they see no tricks at all.\n\n1. Probability of seeing exactly one trick:\nWe'll calculate the probability of seeing each trick individually and then sum them up.\n\n- Seeing only levitation: (1/4) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (5/6) * (4/5) = 1/12\n- Seeing only card tricks: (3/4) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (5/6) * (4/5) = 1/4\n- Seeing only disappearing act: (3/4) * (1/2) * (1/3) * (5/6) * (4/5) = 1/12\n- Seeing only fire-eating: (3/4) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/6) * (4/5) = 1/30\n- Seeing only escape act: (3/4) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (5/6) * (1/5) = 1/20\n\nSum of probabilities of seeing exactly one trick: 1/12 + 1/4 + 1/12 + 1/30 + 1/20 = 15/60 = 1/4\n\n2. Probability of seeing no tricks:\n(3/4) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (5/6) * (4/5) = 1/10\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of the audience seeing at most one trick by adding the probabilities of seeing exactly one trick and seeing no tricks: 1/4 + 1/10 = 7/20\n\nFinally, we'll use the complementary probability rule to find the probability of the audience seeing at least two tricks: 1 - 7/20 = 13/20\n\nSo, the probability that the audience will see at least two of the tricks is 13/20."
