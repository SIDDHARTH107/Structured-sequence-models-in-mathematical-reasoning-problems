    "message_1": "A spring with a mass of 0.5 kg and a spring constant of 5 N/m is attached to a block of 1 kg. The block is displaced by 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released from rest. Determine the amplitude, frequency, and period of the resulting oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the following formulas:\n\n1. Amplitude (A) is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, which is given as 0.1 m.\n2. Angular frequency (ω) is calculated using the formula: ω = √(k/m_total), where k is the spring constant and m_total is the total mass (mass of the spring + mass of the block).\n3. Frequency (f) is calculated using the formula: f = ω / (2π).\n4. Period (T) is the reciprocal of the frequency: T = 1/f.\n\nLet's calculate the amplitude, frequency, and period of the resulting oscillation.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nA = 0.1 m\n\n2. Angular frequency (ω):\nm_total = mass of spring + mass of block = 0.5 kg + 1 kg = 1.5 kg\nk = 5 N/m\nω = √(k/m_total) = √(5 N/m / 1.5 kg) = √(10/3) rad/s ≈ 1.826 rad/s\n\n3. Frequency (f):\nf = ω / (2π) = (1.826 rad/s) / (2π) ≈ 0.2906 Hz\n\n4. Period (T):\nT = 1/f = 1 / 0.2906 Hz ≈ 3.44 s\n\nSo, the amplitude of the resulting oscillation is 0.1 m, the frequency is approximately 0.2906 Hz, and the period is approximately 3.44 s."
