    "message_1": "Consider a single-item auction where there are 4 bidders. Each bidder has a private value for the item as follows: Bidder 1 values the item at $50, Bidder 2 values the item at $60, Bidder 3 values the item at $70, and Bidder 4 values the item at $80. Design a mechanism to determine a winner and allocate the item to the bidder with the highest value, while maximizing the auctioneer's revenue. Assume the auctioneer charges a fixed percentage of the winning bid as commission and that bids cannot be changed after they are submitted. What is the expected revenue of the auctioneer under your mechanism, assuming a 10% commission rate?",
    "message_2": "One mechanism to determine a winner and allocate the item to the bidder with the highest value, while maximizing the auctioneer's revenue, is the second-price (Vickrey) auction. In this auction, each bidder submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the item but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nIn this case, the bids are as follows:\nBidder 1: $50\nBidder 2: $60\nBidder 3: $70\nBidder 4: $80\n\nBidder 4 has the highest bid and wins the item. However, they pay the second-highest bid price, which is $70.\n\nThe auctioneer charges a 10% commission on the winning bid, so the commission is calculated as follows:\n\nCommission = 10% * $70 = $7\n\nTherefore, the expected revenue of the auctioneer under this mechanism, assuming a 10% commission rate, is $7."
