    "message_1": "Consider an auction for a painting where there are five bidders with valuations of $100, $200, $300, $400, and $500 for the painting. The auctioneer follows a second-price sealed-bid auction. What is the probability that the painting goes for more than $400?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. To find the probability that the painting goes for more than $400, we need to determine the scenarios in which the second-highest bid is greater than $400.\n\nSince the highest valuation is $500, the only way for the painting to go for more than $400 is if the $500 bidder wins and the second-highest bid is from the $400 bidder. In this case, the painting will go for exactly $400, not more than $400.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the painting goes for more than $400 is 0."
