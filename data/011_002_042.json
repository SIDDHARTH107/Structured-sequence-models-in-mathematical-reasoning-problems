    "message_1": "If a club with 12 members needs to elect a president and a vice-president, how many different combinations of officers can be chosen from the group of members?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different combinations of officers that can be chosen, we can use the counting principle. First, we need to choose a president, and there are 12 members to choose from. After the president is chosen, there are 11 remaining members to choose from for the vice-president position.\n\nSo, the number of different combinations of officers is:\n\n12 (choices for president) * 11 (choices for vice-president) = 132 different combinations."
