    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log(base 3) 9 + log(base 3) 27, we can use the logarithmic property that states:\n\nlog(a) + log(b) = log(a * b)\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n\nlog(base 3) 9 + log(base 3) 27 = log(base 3) (9 * 27)\n\nNow, we can multiply 9 and 27:\n\n9 * 27 = 243\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\nlog(base 3) (9 * 27) = log(base 3) 243\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which we need to raise 3 to get 243. In other words, we need to find x in the equation:\n\n3^x = 243\n\nWe can see that:\n\n3^5 = 243\n\nSo, x = 5. Therefore, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog(base 3) 9 + log(base 3) 27 = log(base 3) 243 = 5"
