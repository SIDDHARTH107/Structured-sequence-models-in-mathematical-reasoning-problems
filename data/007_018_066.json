    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime number with a gap of 30 to the next prime number, we can start by checking prime numbers and their gaps to the next prime. We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes or other prime-generating algorithms to generate a list of prime numbers and then check the gaps between consecutive primes.\n\nAfter checking prime numbers, we find that the smallest prime number with a gap of 30 to the next prime number is 127. The next prime number after 127 is 157, and the gap between them is 30 (157 - 127 = 30)."
