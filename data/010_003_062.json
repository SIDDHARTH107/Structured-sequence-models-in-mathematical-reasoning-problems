    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set. Let's examine the separation axioms for the set X = {1, 2, 3} with the discrete topology:\n\n1. T0 (Kolmogorov): For any two distinct points x and y in X, there exists an open set containing one of the points but not the other. Since every subset is open in the discrete topology, we can always find open sets containing only x or y, so the T0 axiom holds.\n\n2. T1 (Frechet): For any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V. Again, since every subset is open in the discrete topology, we can find such open sets for any pair of distinct points. Therefore, the T1 axiom holds.\n\n3. T2 (Hausdorff): For any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V. In the discrete topology, we can find open sets containing only x or y, and these sets will be disjoint. Thus, the T2 axiom holds.\n\n4. T3 (Regular): For any point x in X and any closed set F not containing x, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and F ⊆ V. In the discrete topology, closed sets are also all subsets of X. We can always find open sets containing only x or the elements of F, and these sets will be disjoint. Therefore, the T3 axiom holds.\n\n5. T3½ (Tychonoff): For any closed set F and any point x not in F, there exist open sets U and V such that F ⊆ U and x ∈ V, and the closure of V is disjoint from U. In the discrete topology, the closure of a set is the set itself. We can find open sets containing only x or the elements of F, and these sets will be disjoint. Thus, the T3½ axiom holds.\n\n6. T4 (Normal): For any two disjoint closed sets F and G, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that F ⊆ U and G ⊆ V. In the discrete topology, we can find open sets containing only the elements of F or G, and these sets will be disjoint. Therefore, the T4 axiom holds.\n\n7. T5 (Completely Normal): For any two separated sets A and B (i.e., A ∩ B = A ∩ cl(B) = cl(A) ∩ B = ∅), there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. In the discrete topology, the closure of a set is the set itself, so separated sets are disjoint. We can find open sets containing only the elements of A or B, and these sets will be disjoint. Thus, the T5 axiom holds.\n\nIn conclusion, the set X = {1, 2, 3} equipped with the discrete topology satisfies all separation axioms from T0 to T5."
