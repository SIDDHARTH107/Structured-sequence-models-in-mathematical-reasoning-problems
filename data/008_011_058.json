    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constant terms (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we will find the values of x, y, and z by dividing the respective determinants.\n\nGiven system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 10\nx - 3y + 2z = -1\n2x + y + 4z = 6\n\nCoefficient matrix (A):\n| 3  2 -1 |\n| 1 -3  2 |\n| 2  1  4 |\n\nD = |A| = | 3  2 -1 | = 3 * | -3  2 | - 2 * | 1  2 | - (-1) * | 1 -3 |\n        | 1 -3  2 |          | 2  4 |         | 2  4 |          | 2  1 |\n\nD = 3 * (-12 - 4) - 2 * (4 - 4) + 1 * (1 + 6) = -48 + 7 = -41\n\nNow, let's find Dx, Dy, and Dz.\n\nMatrix for Dx (replace the first column of A with the constant terms):\n| 10  2 -1 |\n| -1 -3  2 |\n|  6  1  4 |\n\nDx = | 10  2 -1 | = 10 * | -3  2 | - 2 * | -1  2 | - (-1) * | -1 -3 |\n         | -1 -3  2 |          |  1  4 |         |  6  4 |          |  6  1 |\n\nDx = 10 * (-12 - 2) - 2 * (4 - 12) + 1 * (-1 - 18) = -140 + 16 - 19 = -143\n\nMatrix for Dy (replace the second column of A with the constant terms):\n| 3 10 -1 |\n| 1 -1  2 |\n| 2  6  4 |\n\nDy = | 3 10 -1 | = 3 * | -1  2 | - 10 * | 1  2 | - (-1) * | 1 -1 |\n         | 1 -1  2 |          | 2  4 |         | 2  4 |          | 2  6 |\n\nDy = 3 * (-2 - 4) - 10 * (4 - 4) + 1 * (6 - 2) = -18 + 4 = -14\n\nMatrix for Dz (replace the third column of A with the constant terms):\n| 3  2 10 |\n| 1 -3 -1 |\n| 2  1  6 |\n\nDz = | 3  2 10 | = 3 * | -3 -1 | - 2 * | 1 -1 | - 10 * | 1  1 |\n         | 1 -3 -1 |          | 2  6 |         | 2  6 |          | 2  1 |\n\nDz = 3 * (18 - 2) - 2 * (-1 - 6) + 10 * (1 - 2) = 48 + 14 - 10 = 52\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = Dx / D = -143 / -41 = 3.4878 (rounded to four decimal places)\ny = Dy / D = -14 / -41 = 0.3415 (rounded to four decimal places)\nz = Dz / D = 52 / -41 = -1.2683 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 3.4878\ny ≈ 0.3415\nz ≈ -1.2683"
