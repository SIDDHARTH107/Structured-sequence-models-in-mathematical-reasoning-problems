    "message_2": "We will prove this using Cantor's theorem and second-order logic. Cantor's theorem states that there is no surjective function from a set A to its power set 2^A. Since an injective function from A to 2^A implies a surjective function from 2^A to A, we can use Cantor's theorem to prove that there is no injective function from A to 2^A.\n\nLet n be a natural number, and let A be a set of size n. We will use second-order logic to define the power set 2^A and the notion of an injective function.\n\n1. Define the power set 2^A as the set of all subsets of A:\n\n∀B(B ∈ 2^A ↔ ∀x(x ∈ B → x ∈ A))\n\n2. Define an injective function f from A to 2^A as a function that maps each element of A to a unique element of 2^A:\n\n∀x∀y((x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ A ∧ f(x) = f(y)) → x = y)\n\nNow, we will prove that there is no injective function from A to 2^A using Cantor's theorem. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an injective function f from A to 2^A:\n\n∃f(∀x∀y((x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ A ∧ f(x) = f(y)) → x = y))\n\nDefine a set B ⊆ A such that:\n\n∀x(x ∈ B ↔ (x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ f(x)))\n\nNow, we will show that B is not in the range of f, which contradicts the assumption that f is injective.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an element a ∈ A such that f(a) = B. Then, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: a ∈ B. By the definition of B, this means that a ∈ A and a ∉ f(a). But f(a) = B, so a ∉ B, which is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: a ∉ B. By the definition of B, this means that either a ∉ A or a ∈ f(a). Since a ∈ A, it must be the case that a ∈ f(a). But f(a) = B, so a ∈ B, which is again a contradiction.\n\nIn both cases, we reach a contradiction, so our assumption that there exists an injective function f from A to 2^A must be false. Therefore, for any natural number n, there exists a set A of size n such that there is no injective function from A to its power set 2^A."
