    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = A sin(kx), we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[ψ(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIn our case, ψ(x) = 2 sin(3π/4 * x). So, we need to calculate the following integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2 sin(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let's set:\n\nu = 2 sin(3π/4 * x)\ndv = e^(-iωx) dx\n\nNow, we need to find du and v:\n\ndu = (2 * 3π/4 * cos(3π/4 * x)) dx\nv = ∫e^(-iωx) dx = (-1/iω) * e^(-iωx)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nF(ω) = uv - ∫v du\nF(ω) = (-2/iω) * sin(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx) - ∫((-1/iω) * e^(-iωx)) * (2 * 3π/4 * cos(3π/4 * x)) dx\n\nLet's simplify the integral:\n\nF(ω) = (-2/iω) * sin(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx) - (6π/4iω) ∫cos(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral. We can use the Euler's formula to rewrite the cosine function:\n\ncos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = (-2/iω) * sin(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx) - (3π/2iω) ∫(e^(i(3π/4 * x - ωx)) + e^(-i(3π/4 * x + ωx))) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nF(ω) = (-2/iω) * sin(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx) - (3π/2iω) * [(-1/(i(3π/4 - ω))) * e^(i(3π/4 * x - ωx)) - (1/(i(3π/4 + ω))) * e^(-i(3π/4 * x + ωx))]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from -∞ to +∞. However, this integral does not converge in the usual sense. In the context of Fourier transforms, we often consider the limit as the integration bounds approach infinity, which leads to the concept of a distribution. In this case, the Fourier transform will be a distribution, not a regular function.\n\nThe result of the Fourier transform of the wave function ψ(x) = 2 sin(3π/4 * x) is:\n\nF(ω) = (-2/iω) * sin(3π/4 * x) * e^(-iωx) - (3π/2iω) * [(-1/(i(3π/4 - ω))) * e^(i(3π/4 * x - ωx)) - (1/(i(3π/4 + ω))) * e^(-i(3π/4 * x + ωx))]"
