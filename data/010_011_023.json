    "message_2": "To compute the homology group $H_1(M, M-p; \\mathbb{Z})$, we will use the long exact sequence of the pair $(M, M-p)$ and the excision theorem.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pair $(M, M-p)$. The space $M$ is the union of two circles, and $M-p$ is the same space with the point $p$ removed. Since $p$ is a point on one of the circles, $M-p$ is the union of a circle and an open arc (which is homotopy equivalent to a circle). Therefore, we can write $M-p$ as the union of two circles, say $A$ and $B$, where $A$ is the circle $S^1(1,0)$ with the point $p$ removed, and $B$ is the circle $S^1(0,1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection $A \\cap B$. This intersection is a single point, which we can denote by $q$. Thus, we have the following decomposition of $M-p$: $M-p = A \\cup B$, where $A \\cap B = \\{q\\}$.\n\nBy the excision theorem, we have the following isomorphism:\n\n$$H_1(M, M-p; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(A \\cup B, A \\cap B; \\mathbb{Z}).$$\n\nNow, we can use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the pair $(A, B)$:\n\n$$\\cdots \\rightarrow H_1(A \\cap B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\phi} H_1(A; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus H_1(B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\psi} H_1(A \\cup B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H_0(A \\cap B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\cdots$$\n\nSince $A \\cap B = \\{q\\}$ is a single point, we have $H_1(A \\cap B; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $H_0(A \\cap B; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Also, since $A$ and $B$ are homotopy equivalent to circles, we have $H_1(A; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_1(B; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence becomes:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\psi} H_1(A \\cup B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\cdots$$\n\nThe map $\\psi$ is given by $\\psi([a], [b]) = [a] - [b]$. Since the kernel of $\\psi$ is trivial, $\\psi$ is injective. Moreover, $\\psi$ is also surjective because the image of $\\psi$ generates $H_1(A \\cup B; \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $\\psi$ is an isomorphism.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$H_1(M, M-p; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(A \\cup B, A \\cap B; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.$$"
