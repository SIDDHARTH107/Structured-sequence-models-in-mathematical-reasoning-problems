    "message_2": "To use the mean value theorem, we first need to find the total distance the car needs to travel to have an average speed of 80 miles per hour for the entire trip.\n\nLet's denote the total distance as D, and the total time as T. We know that the car travels for 2 hours at 60 mph and then for 3 hours at an unknown speed, which we'll call x mph.\n\nThe total time for the trip is T = 2 + 3 = 5 hours.\n\nTo have an average speed of 80 mph for the entire trip, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\n80 = D / 5\n\nSolving for D, we get:\n\nD = 80 * 5 = 400 miles\n\nNow, we need to find the distance traveled during the first 2 hours at 60 mph:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nDistance = 60 * 2 = 120 miles\n\nSo, the car needs to travel 400 - 120 = 280 miles during the next 3 hours.\n\nNow we can use the mean value theorem to find the required speed for the next 3 hours. The mean value theorem states that there exists a value c in the interval (a, b) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)\n\nIn our case, f'(c) represents the required speed, f(b) - f(a) represents the distance to be covered (280 miles), and (b - a) represents the time interval (3 hours).\n\nLet's denote the required speed as x:\n\nx = 280 / 3\n\nx â‰ˆ 93.33 mph\n\nSo, the car must travel at approximately 93.33 miles per hour for the next 3 hours to have an average speed of 80 miles per hour for the entire trip."
