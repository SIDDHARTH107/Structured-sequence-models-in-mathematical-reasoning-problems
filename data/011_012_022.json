    "message_2": "To find out how many students are not studying either mathematics or physics, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students = students studying mathematics + students studying physics - students studying both + students not studying either\n\nLet's denote the number of students not studying either subject as N.\n\n50 = 30 + 25 - 15 + N\n\nNow, we can solve for N:\n\n50 = 40 + N\n\nN = 50 - 40\n\nN = 10\n\nSo, 10 students are not studying either mathematics or physics."
