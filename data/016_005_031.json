    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of a line segment. After each iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of 2/3 times the previous length. \n\nLet's calculate the length of the Cantor set after the first 4 iterations:\n\n1. Original length: 9 cm\n2. After 1st iteration: (2/3) * 9 = 6 cm\n3. After 2nd iteration: (2/3) * 6 = 4 cm\n4. After 3rd iteration: (2/3) * 4 = 8/3 cm ≈ 2.67 cm\n5. After 4th iteration: (2/3) * 8/3 = 16/9 cm ≈ 1.78 cm\n\nSo, the measure of the Cantor set after the removal of the first 4 iterations is approximately 1.78 cm."
