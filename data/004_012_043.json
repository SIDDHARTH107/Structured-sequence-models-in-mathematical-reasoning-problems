    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (4x + 1) / (2x - 3) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function (u) and the denominator function (v). In this case, u(x) = 4x + 1 and v(x) = 2x - 3.\n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(4x + 1)/dx = 4\nv'(x) = d(2x - 3)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (4 * (2x - 3) - (4x + 1) * 2) / ((2x - 3)^2)\n\nf'(x) = (8x - 12 - 8x - 2) / (4x^2 - 12x + 9)\n\nf'(x) = (-14) / (4x^2 - 12x + 9)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = (-14) / (4(2)^2 - 12(2) + 9)\n\nf'(2) = (-14) / (32 - 24 + 9)\n\nf'(2) = (-14) / 17\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (4x + 1) / (2x - 3) at x = 2 is -14/17."
