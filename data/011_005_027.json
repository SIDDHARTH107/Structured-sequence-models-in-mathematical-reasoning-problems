    "message_2": "To choose two items from a collection of ten distinct items, you can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the total number of items) and k = 2 (the number of items you want to choose). So the formula becomes:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/(2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo there are 45 different ways to choose two items from a collection of ten distinct items."
