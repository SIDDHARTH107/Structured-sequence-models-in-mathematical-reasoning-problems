    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. To find the largest clique in this graph, we can look for the largest set of vertices where each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n\nThe adjacency matrix represents the connections between vertices:\n```\n0 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nBy analyzing the adjacency matrix, we can see that there is a clique of size 3, which includes vertices 2, 3, and 4 (using 1-based indexing). The connections between these vertices are represented by the 1s in the adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\n```\n\nThere is no larger clique in this graph. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
