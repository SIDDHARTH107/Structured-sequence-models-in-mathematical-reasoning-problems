    "message_2": "To find the number of terms in the series, we can use the formula for the last term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nlast_term = first_term + (number_of_terms - 1) * common_difference\n\nIn this case, the first term is 2, the last term is 100, and the common difference is 2. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the number of terms:\n\nnumber_of_terms = (last_term - first_term) / common_difference + 1\n\nnumber_of_terms = (100 - 2) / 2 + 1\n\nnumber_of_terms = 98 / 2 + 1\n\nnumber_of_terms = 49 + 1\n\nnumber_of_terms = 50\n\nThere are 50 terms in the series."
