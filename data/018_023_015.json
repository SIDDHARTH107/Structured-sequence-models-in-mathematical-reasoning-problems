    "message_2": "First, let's find A△B (symmetric difference between A and B). The symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2}\nB = {2, 3}\n\nA△B = {1, 3} (since 2 is the common element in both sets, we exclude it)\n\nNow, let's perform the operations (A△B)△A and A△(B△A).\n\n1. (A△B)△A:\n\n(A△B) = {1, 3}\nA = {1, 2}\n\n(A△B)△A = {2, 3} (since 1 is the common element in both sets, we exclude it)\n\n2. A△(B△A):\n\nB△A = A△B = {1, 3} (symmetric difference is commutative)\nA = {1, 2}\n\nA△(B△A) = A△{1, 3} = {2, 3} (since 1 is the common element in both sets, we exclude it)\n\nNow, let's use the Cartesian product to show that the two results are not equal.\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\n(A△B)△A = {2, 3}\nA△(B△A) = {2, 3}\n\n(A△B)△A × A△(B△A) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can see that the results of (A△B)△A and A△(B△A) are actually equal, both being {2, 3}. Therefore, the Cartesian product of these two sets is also equal."
