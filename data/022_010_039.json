    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z^2 + 4z + 3) at z = -1, we first factor the denominator:\n\nf(z) = 1/((z + 1)(z + 3))\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/((z + 1)(z + 3)) = A/(z + 1) + B/(z + 3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z + 1)(z + 3) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 = A(z + 3) + B(z + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by setting z = -1 and z = -3:\n\nFor z = -1: 1 = A(-1 + 3) + B(-1 + 1) => 1 = 2A => A = 1/2\nFor z = -3: 1 = A(-3 + 3) + B(-3 + 1) => 1 = -2B => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nf(z) = (1/2)/(z + 1) - (1/2)/(z + 3)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\nFor the first term, we have:\n\n(1/2)/(z + 1) = (1/2) * 1/(1 + (z + 1)) = (1/2) * 1/(1 - (-z))\n\nUsing the geometric series formula, we get:\n\n(1/2) * Σ((-z)^n) = (1/2) * Σ((-1)^n * z^n)\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n-(1/2)/(z + 3) = -(1/2) * 1/(3 + (z + 1)) = -(1/2) * 1/(2 - (-(z + 1)))\n\nUsing the geometric series formula, we get:\n\n-(1/2) * Σ((-(z + 1)/2)^n) = -(1/2) * Σ((-1)^n * (z + 1)^n / 2^n)\n\nNow, we can combine the two series to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (1/2) * Σ((-1)^n * z^n) - (1/2) * Σ((-1)^n * (z + 1)^n / 2^n)\n\nThe convergence of the series in the annulus |z + 1| > 1 can be determined by looking at the radius of convergence for each term:\n\nFor the first term, the radius of convergence is |z + 1| > 1, since it converges for |z + 1| < 1.\n\nFor the second term, the radius of convergence is |(z + 1)/2| > 1, which simplifies to |z + 1| > 2.\n\nSince both terms converge in the annulus |z + 1| > 1, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) converges in the annulus |z + 1| > 1."
