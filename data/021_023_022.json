    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for the given function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 8, we can find the minimum value using calculus instead.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we can take the derivative and set it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 5\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n2x + 5 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = -5/2 = -2.5\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to check if it's a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, we have a minimum at x = -2.5. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging this value back into the original function:\n\nf(-2.5) = (-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) - 8 = 6.25 - 12.5 - 8 = -14.25\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 8 is -14.25."
