    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space of quartic Calabi-Yau threefolds with 65 nodes and no other singularities, we can use the following formula:\n\nDimension = (Degree of the polynomial - 1) * (Number of variables - 1) * (Number of variables - 2) / 6 - Number of nodes\n\nIn the case of quartic Calabi-Yau threefolds, the degree of the polynomial is 4, and the number of variables is 4 (x, y, z, w). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDimension = (4 - 1) * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) / 6 - 65\nDimension = 3 * 3 * 2 / 6 - 65\nDimension = 9 - 65\nDimension = -56\n\nHowever, the dimension of a moduli space cannot be negative. This means that there is no moduli space of quartic Calabi-Yau threefolds with 65 nodes and no other singularities. The problem is not well-posed, and the moduli space does not exist for the given conditions."
