    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(u) = (u^3 + 1)^4 and the inner function is g(x) = cos(x^3 + 1).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the outer function f(u) with respect to u:\nf'(u) = d( (u^3 + 1)^4 )/du = 4(u^3 + 1)^3 * d(u^3 + 1)/du = 4(u^3 + 1)^3 * 3u^2 = 12u^2(u^3 + 1)^3\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function g(x) with respect to x:\ng'(x) = d( cos(x^3 + 1) )/dx = -sin(x^3 + 1) * d(x^3 + 1)/dx = -sin(x^3 + 1) * 3x^2 = -3x^2sin(x^3 + 1)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)):\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = 12[g(x)]^2(g(x)^3 + 1)^3 * (-3x^2sin(x^3 + 1))\n\nSubstitute g(x) = cos(x^3 + 1) back into the equation:\n(f(g(x)))' = 12[cos(x^3 + 1)]^2(cos(x^3 + 1)^3 + 1)^3 * (-3x^2sin(x^3 + 1))\n\nThis is the derivative of the composite function f(g(x))."
