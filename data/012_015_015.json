    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 10 vertices and 12 edges. Determine whether G is a connected graph or not. If it is connected, find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.",
    "message_2": "To determine if G is connected, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges. In this case, G has 10 vertices, so it needs at least (10-1) = 9 edges to be connected. Since G has 12 edges, it is connected.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. A graph is disconnected if it has at least two components. To create a disconnected graph, we can try to split the vertices into two groups such that there are no edges between the groups.\n\nOne way to do this is to create two components, one with k vertices and the other with (10-k) vertices. The maximum number of edges within each component can be calculated using the formula for the maximum number of edges in a complete graph: m = (n*(n-1))/2, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nFor the first component with k vertices, the maximum number of edges is (k*(k-1))/2. For the second component with (10-k) vertices, the maximum number of edges is ((10-k)*(9-k))/2. The sum of these two values is the maximum number of edges that can exist without connecting the two components.\n\nTo minimize the number of edges to remove, we want to maximize the sum of edges within the two components. We can do this by trying different values of k and finding the maximum sum.\n\nFor k = 1, the sum is 0 + 36 = 36.\nFor k = 2, the sum is 1 + 28 = 29.\nFor k = 3, the sum is 3 + 21 = 24.\nFor k = 4, the sum is 6 + 15 = 21.\nFor k = 5, the sum is 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nThe maximum sum is 36 when k = 1, which means one component has 1 vertex and the other has 9 vertices. In this case, there are 36 edges within the two components, and since the graph has 12 edges, we need to remove 12 - 36 = -24 edges. However, since we cannot remove a negative number of edges, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 0. This means that the graph is already disconnected."
