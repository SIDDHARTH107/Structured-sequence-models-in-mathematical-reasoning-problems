    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √(48), we can first find the prime factorization of 48.\n\n48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2^4 × 3^1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n√(2^4 × 3^1)\n\nAccording to the properties of square roots, we can separate the factors:\n\n√(2^4) × √(3^1)\n\nSince the square root of a number squared is the number itself, we can simplify further:\n\n2^2 × √(3)\n\n4 × √(3)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 4√(3). If you want to round it to the nearest hundredth, you can calculate the approximate value:\n\n4 × 1.732 = 6.928\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the approximate value is 6.93."
