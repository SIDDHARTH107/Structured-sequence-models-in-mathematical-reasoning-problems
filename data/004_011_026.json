    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the ship is approaching the port, we need to find the derivative of the distance function D(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity function, which tells us the rate of change of the distance with respect to time.\n\nThe distance function is D(t) = 2t^2 + 4t + 10.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative dD/dt:\n\ndD/dt = d(2t^2 + 4t + 10)/dt\n      = 2(d(t^2)/dt) + 4(d(t)/dt) + 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)\n      = 2(2t) + 4(1)\n      = 4t + 4\n\nNow we have the velocity function: V(t) = 4t + 4.\n\nTo find the rate at which the ship is approaching the port when t = 3 hours, we plug t = 3 into the velocity function:\n\nV(3) = 4(3) + 4\n     = 12 + 4\n     = 16\n\nSo, at t = 3 hours, the ship is approaching the port at a rate of 16 kilometers per hour."
