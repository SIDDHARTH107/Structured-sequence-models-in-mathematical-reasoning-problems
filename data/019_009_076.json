    "message_1": "Let A and B be two intuitionistic logical statements such that A implies B. If A is false, then what can you say about the truth value of B?",
    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, if A implies B (A â†’ B) and A is false, we cannot make a definitive statement about the truth value of B. B could be either true or false. This is because intuitionistic logic does not adhere to the principle of the excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true only if there is a constructive proof for it. So, without further information, we cannot determine the truth value of B."
