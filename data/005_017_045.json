    "message_1": "A dataset containing measurements for four variables - height, weight, age, and income - was analyzed using principal component analysis. The principal components were calculated and their corresponding eigenvalues were:\n\nPC1: 3.2\nPC2: 1.8\nPC3: 0.9\nPC4: 0.1\n\nWhat percentage of the total variance in the dataset is explained by the first two principal components?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of the total variance explained by the first two principal components, we first need to calculate the total variance. The total variance is the sum of all eigenvalues:\n\nTotal Variance = PC1 + PC2 + PC3 + PC4\nTotal Variance = 3.2 + 1.8 + 0.9 + 0.1\nTotal Variance = 6\n\nNext, we need to find the variance explained by the first two principal components:\n\nVariance Explained by PC1 and PC2 = PC1 + PC2\nVariance Explained by PC1 and PC2 = 3.2 + 1.8\nVariance Explained by PC1 and PC2 = 5\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of the total variance explained by the first two principal components:\n\nPercentage = (Variance Explained by PC1 and PC2 / Total Variance) * 100\nPercentage = (5 / 6) * 100\nPercentage â‰ˆ 83.33%\n\nSo, approximately 83.33% of the total variance in the dataset is explained by the first two principal components."
