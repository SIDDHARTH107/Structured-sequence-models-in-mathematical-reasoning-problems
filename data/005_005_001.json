    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs that have a lifespan that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 800 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. What percentage of the bulbs have a lifespan between 600 and 1000 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of bulbs with a lifespan between 600 and 1000 hours, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the values and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probabilities.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-scores for 600 and 1000 hours:\n\nz1 = (600 - 800) / 100 = -2\nz2 = (1000 - 800) / 100 = 2\n\nNow, we'll use the z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The z-table gives the probability that a value is less than or equal to a given z-score.\n\nP(z ≤ -2) = 0.0228\nP(z ≤ 2) = 0.9772\n\nTo find the percentage of bulbs with a lifespan between 600 and 1000 hours, we need to find the probability that a bulb has a lifespan between these two values. We can do this by subtracting the probability of a bulb having a lifespan less than or equal to 600 hours from the probability of a bulb having a lifespan less than or equal to 1000 hours:\n\nP(600 ≤ X ≤ 1000) = P(z ≤ 2) - P(z ≤ -2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, approximately 95.44% of the bulbs have a lifespan between 600 and 1000 hours."
