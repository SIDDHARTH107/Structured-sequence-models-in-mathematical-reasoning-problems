    "message_2": "1. Determine the fundamental group of X.\n\nA compact, connected surface of genus 2 can be represented as a connected sum of two tori. The fundamental group of a torus is given by the free product of two infinite cyclic groups, i.e., Z × Z. Therefore, the fundamental group of X, denoted by π1(X), can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of the two tori:\n\nπ1(X) = (Z × Z) * (Z × Z)\n\nUsing the standard presentation of the fundamental group of a torus, we can write the fundamental group of X as:\n\nπ1(X) = ⟨a, b, c, d | aba⁻¹b⁻¹cdc⁻¹d⁻¹⟩\n\n2. Show that X has a universal covering space which is homeomorphic to the hyperbolic plane.\n\nThe universal covering space of a connected, compact surface of genus g > 1 is the hyperbolic plane, denoted by H². This is because the Euler characteristic of X is negative (χ(X) = 2 - 2g = -2 for genus 2), which implies that X has a hyperbolic geometry. The universal covering space of a hyperbolic surface is always the hyperbolic plane.\n\n3. Compute the action of the fundamental group of X on the universal covering space.\n\nThe action of the fundamental group π1(X) on the universal covering space H² can be described by a group of isometries, which preserve the hyperbolic metric. In this case, the group of isometries is the group generated by the elements a, b, c, and d, subject to the relation aba⁻¹b⁻¹cdc⁻¹d⁻¹.\n\nThe action of the fundamental group on H² can be visualized by considering the fundamental domain of X in the hyperbolic plane. The fundamental domain is a polygon with 8 sides, and the sides are identified by the action of the generators a, b, c, and d. Specifically, the action of a identifies the first and second sides, b identifies the third and fourth sides, c identifies the fifth and sixth sides, and d identifies the seventh and eighth sides. The relation aba⁻¹b⁻¹cdc⁻¹d⁻¹ ensures that the identifications are consistent and result in a surface of genus 2."
