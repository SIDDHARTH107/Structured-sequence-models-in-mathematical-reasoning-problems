    "message_2": "First, let's compute the Cartesian product of A and B (A x B) and B and A (B x A):\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compute the union of (A x B) and (B x A):\n\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAnd the union of (B x A) and (A x B):\n\n(B x A) U (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs you can see, both (A x B) U (B x A) and (B x A) U (A x B) result in the same set:\n\n{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. The Cartesian product itself is not commutative, as A x B â‰  B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThese two sets are different, so the Cartesian product is not commutative. The union operation is commutative, which is why (A x B) U (B x A) = (B x A) U (A x B). The fact that the union of the two Cartesian products is the same does not imply that the Cartesian product itself is commutative."
