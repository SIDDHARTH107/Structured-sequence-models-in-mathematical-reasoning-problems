    "message_2": "To find the number of bitangents to the curve, we will use the Plücker formula, which states that for a smooth curve of degree $d$ in the complex projective plane, the number of bitangents is given by:\n\n$$\nB = \\frac{1}{2}d(d-1)(d-2)\n$$\n\nIn our case, the curve is given by the equation $y^2z-x^3-az^3=0$. This is a cubic curve, so $d=3$. Plugging this into the Plücker formula, we get:\n\n$$\nB = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(3-1)(3-2) = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(2)(1) = 3\n$$\n\nSo, there are 3 bitangents to the given rational curve in the complex projective plane."
