    "message_2": "An isometry of a Riemannian manifold (M, d, g) is a diffeomorphism f: M → M that preserves the metric g, i.e., f* g = g, where f* is the pullback of f. In other words, an isometry is a smooth map that preserves distances between points.\n\nLet's consider the given metric g = dx^2 + dy^2. This is the standard Euclidean metric on the plane ℝ^2. So, we are looking for all isometries of the Euclidean plane.\n\nThere are four types of isometries in the Euclidean plane:\n\n1. Translations: f(x, y) = (x + a, y + b), where a and b are constants. Translations preserve distances because they simply shift points by a fixed vector.\n\n2. Rotations: f(x, y) = (x cos(θ) - y sin(θ), x sin(θ) + y cos(θ)), where θ is a constant angle. Rotations preserve distances because they rotate points around the origin by a fixed angle.\n\n3. Reflections: f(x, y) = (x cos(2θ) + y sin(2θ), x sin(2θ) - y cos(2θ)), where θ is a constant angle. Reflections preserve distances because they reflect points across a line through the origin with angle θ.\n\n4. Glide reflections: f(x, y) = (x cos(θ) + y sin(θ) + a, x sin(θ) - y cos(θ) + b), where θ is a constant angle and a and b are constants. Glide reflections preserve distances because they combine a reflection across a line through the origin with angle θ and a translation parallel to the line.\n\nThese four types of isometries form a group called the Euclidean group E(2). Any isometry of the Euclidean plane can be expressed as a composition of translations, rotations, and reflections. Therefore, the set of all isometries of the Riemannian manifold (M, d, g) with metric g = dx^2 + dy^2 is the Euclidean group E(2)."
