    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. \n\nLet G be a group of order 96.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups.\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 32 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. In this case, G is the semi-direct product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_2 is a 2-group, it has a normal subgroup of order 16. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 16, and G is a semi-direct product of this normal subgroup and a subgroup of order 6. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 6 (C6 and S3), and for each of them, there are two possible semi-direct products with a group of order 16 (C16 and Q16). This gives us 4 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 32 and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, G is the semi-direct product of P_2 and a subgroup of order 3. There are two possible semi-direct products with a group of order 32 (C32 and Q32). This gives us 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. In this case, G is the semi-direct product of a subgroup of order 32 and P_3. There are two possible semi-direct products with a group of order 32 (C32 and Q32). This gives us 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, G is the semi-direct product of a subgroup of order 32 and a subgroup of order 3. There are two possible semi-direct products with a group of order 32 (C32 and Q32). This gives us 2 non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 96. However, we have overcounted, as the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2 are counted in both cases 1 and 2. Thus, we need to subtract 2 from our total, giving us 10 - 2 = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
