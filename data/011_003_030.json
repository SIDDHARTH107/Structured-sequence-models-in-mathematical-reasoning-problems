    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value of a number in a specific row and column can be found using the combination formula: C(n-1, r-1), where n is the row number and r is the column number.\n\nFor the 6th row and 3rd column, we have:\n\nC(6-1, 3-1) = C(5, 2)\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, the value of the number in the 6th row and 3rd column of Pascal's triangle is 10."
