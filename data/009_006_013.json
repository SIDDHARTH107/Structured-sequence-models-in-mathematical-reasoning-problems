    "message_1": "Consider the chemical reaction A --> B. The rate of this reaction is given by the differential equation dy/dt = -k*y, where y is the concentration of A at time t and k is a positive constant. If the initial concentration of A is 5 moles/L and the rate constant k is 0.4/min, find the concentration of A after 10 minutes.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then use the initial condition and the given time to find the concentration of A after 10 minutes.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt = -k*y\n\nSeparate the variables:\n\ndy/y = -k*dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫(-k) dt\n\nln(y) = -k*t + C\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = e^(-k*t + C)\n\nUse the initial condition y(0) = 5 moles/L:\n\n5 = e^(0 + C)\n\nC = ln(5)\n\nSo, the equation for the concentration of A at time t is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-k*t + ln(5))\n\nNow, find the concentration of A after 10 minutes (t = 10):\n\ny(10) = e^(-0.4*10 + ln(5))\n\ny(10) = e^(-4 + ln(5))\n\ny(10) = e^(ln(5) - 4)\n\ny(10) = e^(ln(5)) * e^(-4)\n\ny(10) = 5 * e^(-4)\n\ny(10) ≈ 5 * 0.0183\n\ny(10) ≈ 0.0915 moles/L\n\nSo, the concentration of A after 10 minutes is approximately 0.0915 moles/L."
