    "message_1": "Suppose that a hospital is studying the survival time of patients after a heart transplant. The data shows that 80% of the patients survive for at least 1 year after the transplant. What is the probability that a patient who has survived for 1 year will survive for at least 3 more years after the transplant?",
    "message_2": "To answer this question, we need more information about the survival rates of patients beyond the first year. The given information only tells us that 80% of patients survive for at least 1 year after the transplant. We need to know the survival rates for the subsequent years in order to calculate the probability of a patient surviving for at least 3 more years after surviving the first year."
