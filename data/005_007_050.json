    "message_1": "If the correlation coefficient between the height and weight of students in a class is 0.75, and the average height of the class is 170 cm, what is the expected weight of a student in the class if the standard deviation of their height is 10 cm and the average weight of the class is 65 kg?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected weight of a student in the class, we need to use the formula for the regression line, which is:\n\ny = a + bx\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable (weight), x is the independent variable (height), a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope of the regression line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (b) using the correlation coefficient (r), the standard deviation of height (SD_x), and the standard deviation of weight (SD_y). The formula for the slope is:\n\nb = r * (SD_y / SD_x)\n\nHowever, we don't have the standard deviation of weight (SD_y) in the problem. We can't find the expected weight without this information. If you can provide the standard deviation of weight, we can continue to solve the problem."
