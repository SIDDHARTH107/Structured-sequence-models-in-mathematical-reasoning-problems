    "message_1": "A game is played on a 4x4 grid. Players take turns coloring in squares on the grid, with the first player coloring in red squares and the second player coloring in blue squares. A player wins the game if they can color in a line of four adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in their color. Assuming both players play optimally, what is the maximum number of squares that can be colored before a player wins the game?",
    "message_2": "In an optimal play, both players will try to prevent the other from forming a line of four adjacent squares. Let's analyze the grid and the optimal moves:\n\n1. The first player (red) colors a square. There are 16 possible squares, but without loss of generality, we can assume it's the top-left square.\n\n2. The second player (blue) must block the potential lines that the first player could form. The best move for the second player is to color the square diagonally adjacent to the first player's square (one square to the right and one square down). This blocks two potential lines (the diagonal and the vertical).\n\n3. The first player (red) must now block the second player's potential lines. The best move is to color the square two squares to the right of the first player's initial square. This blocks the horizontal line.\n\n4. The second player (blue) must block the first player's potential lines again. The best move is to color the square diagonally adjacent to the second player's initial square (one square to the right and one square down). This blocks two potential lines (the diagonal and the vertical).\n\nNow, the grid looks like this:\n\nR B _ _\n_ R B _\n_ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _\n\n5. The first player (red) must block the second player's potential horizontal line. The best move is to color the square immediately to the right of the second player's initial square.\n\n6. The second player (blue) must block the first player's potential diagonal line. The best move is to color the square diagonally adjacent to the first player's second square (one square to the right and one square down).\n\nThe grid now looks like this:\n\nR B _ _\n_ R B _\n_ _ R B\n_ _ _ _\n\nAt this point, the first player (red) has no choice but to color the last square in the diagonal, winning the game. So, the maximum number of squares that can be colored before a player wins the game is 7."
