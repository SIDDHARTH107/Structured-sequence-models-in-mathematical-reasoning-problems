    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z + 1)/(z^2 - 1) at z = 1+i, we first need to check if the point z = 1+i is a pole of the function. The denominator of the function is (z-1)(z+1). Since 1+i is neither 1 nor -1, the point z = 1+i is not a pole of the function.\n\nSince the point z = 1+i is not a pole, the residue of the function f(z) at z = 1+i is 0."
