    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3, we will use the power rule for differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to f(x) = 4x^3, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 4x^(3-1) = 12x^2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^2 = 12 * 4 = 48\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 at the point x = 2 is 48."
