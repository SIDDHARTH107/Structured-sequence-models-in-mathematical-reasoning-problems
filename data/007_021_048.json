    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding the smallest non-trivial factor of a composite number. Here's how we can apply it to find the smallest prime factor of 9563:\n\n1. Choose a polynomial function, usually f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factor (in this case, 9563).\n2. Choose two initial values for x, usually x1 = 2 and x2 = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for both x1 and x2, but apply the function twice for x2 in each step.\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x1 and x2 and the number n.\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to n, the algorithm failed. If the GCD is between 1 and n, we found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 9563\n2. x1 = 2, x2 = 2\n\nNow we start iterating:\n\n3.1. x1 = f(x1) = (2^2 + 1) mod 9563 = 5\n     x2 = f(f(x2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 9563 = 26\n\n4.1. GCD(|x1 - x2|, 9563) = GCD(|5 - 26|, 9563) = GCD(21, 9563) = 1\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we continue iterating:\n\n3.2. x1 = f(x1) = (5^2 + 1) mod 9563 = 26\n     x2 = f(f(x2)) = f(26) = (26^2 + 1) mod 9563 = 677\n\n4.2. GCD(|x1 - x2|, 9563) = GCD(|26 - 677|, 9563) = GCD(651, 9563) = 1\n\nAgain, the GCD is 1, so we continue iterating:\n\n3.3. x1 = f(x1) = (26^2 + 1) mod 9563 = 677\n     x2 = f(f(x2)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 9563 = 4291\n\n4.3. GCD(|x1 - x2|, 9563) = GCD(|677 - 4291|, 9563) = GCD(3614, 9563) = 13\n\nNow we have found a non-trivial factor, 13. Since 13 is a prime number, it is the smallest prime factor of 9563."
