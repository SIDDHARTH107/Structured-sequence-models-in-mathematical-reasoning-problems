    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of the sets A and B, denoted as A x B, and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow let's find the union of these Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNotice that (A x B) ∪ (B x A) and (B x A) ∪ (A x B) are equal, as they contain the same elements. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. \n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union, we need to show that A x B ≠ B x A.\n\nAs we have already found:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nA x B and B x A are not equal, as their elements are different. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
