    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to determine the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n⎡\n⎢−2−13\n⎣1−111\n⎤\n⎥\n\nFirst, we can swap the two rows:\n\n⎡\n⎢1−111\n⎣-2-13\n⎤\n⎥\n\nNext, we can add 2 times the first row to the second row:\n\n⎡\n⎢1−111\n⎣0-5\n⎤\n⎥\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are two non-zero rows, which means the rank of matrix A is 2."
