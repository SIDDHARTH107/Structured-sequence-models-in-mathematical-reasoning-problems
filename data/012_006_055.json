    "message_2": "To determine if G contains an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific connections between the vertices in G, we cannot determine the degrees of the vertices and thus cannot identify the Eulerian path.\n\nAs for the Hamiltonian path, determining whether a graph has a Hamiltonian path is an NP-complete problem, meaning there is no known efficient algorithm to solve it for all cases. Without more information about the specific connections between the vertices in G, we cannot determine if G contains a Hamiltonian path."
