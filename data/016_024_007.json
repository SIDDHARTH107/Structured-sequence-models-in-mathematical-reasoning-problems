    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that can be generated by recursively subdividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the central square at each step. The total number of squares at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the level number.\n\nGiven that the total number of squares in the 4th level is 65,025, we can use the formula to find the number of black squares at the 4th level:\n\n65,025 = (8^4 - 1) / 7\n65,025 = (4096 - 1) / 7\n65,025 = 4095 / 7\n65,025 = 585\n\nNow, to find the total number of black squares in the 5th level, we can use the same formula with n = 5:\n\nTotal squares = (8^5 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = (32768 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = 32767 / 7\nTotal squares = 4681\n\nSo, there are 4,681 black squares in the 5th level of the self-similar Sierpinski carpet."
