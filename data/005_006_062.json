    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected employee earns between $55,000 and $65,000, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the values and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-scores for $55,000 and $65,000.\n\nFor $55,000:\nz1 = ($55,000 - $60,000) / $8,000\nz1 = -$5,000 / $8,000\nz1 = -0.625\n\nFor $65,000:\nz2 = ($65,000 - $60,000) / $8,000\nz2 = $5,000 / $8,000\nz2 = 0.625\n\nNow, we'll use the z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than or equal to a given z-score.\n\nP(z1) = P(z ≤ -0.625) ≈ 0.2660\nP(z2) = P(z ≤ 0.625) ≈ 0.7340\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected employee earns between $55,000 and $65,000, we'll subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2:\n\nP($55,000 ≤ X ≤ $65,000) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP($55,000 ≤ X ≤ $65,000) = 0.7340 - 0.2660\nP($55,000 ≤ X ≤ $65,000) = 0.4680\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected employee earns between $55,000 and $65,000 is approximately 46.80%."
