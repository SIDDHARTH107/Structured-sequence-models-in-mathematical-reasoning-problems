    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C36, A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we will analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems and properties of groups of order 36.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of groups of order 36:\n\n1. The order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n2. By Sylow's first theorem, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, n_2 can be either 1 or 9.\n\n2. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, n_3 must divide 2^2 = 4, and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible cases for the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G since they are unique. Then, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to P × Q. Since P has order 4 and Q has order 9, G is isomorphic to C4 × C9, which is isomorphic to C36 (the cyclic group of order 36).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, |P ∩ Q| = 1, since the orders of P and Q are coprime. By the product formula, |PQ| = |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 4 * 9 / 1 = 36. Since PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have PQ = G. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as G = P ⋊ Q.\n\nThere are two possibilities for P: either P is isomorphic to C4 or P is isomorphic to V4 (the Klein four-group). If P is isomorphic to C4, there are two possible actions of Q on P, leading to two non-abelian groups of order 36. If P is isomorphic to V4, there are three possible actions of Q on P, leading to three non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. Let Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, |P ∩ Q| = 1, since the orders of P and Q are coprime. By the product formula, |PQ| = |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 4 * 9 / 1 = 36. Since PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have PQ = G. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as G = P ⋊ Q.\n\nThere are two possibilities for Q: either Q is isomorphic to C9 or Q is isomorphic to C3 × C3. If Q is isomorphic to C9, there is one possible action of P on Q, leading to one non-abelian group of order 36. If Q is isomorphic to C3 × C3, there is one possible action of P on Q, leading to one non-abelian group of order 36.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. However, we can still analyze the possible structures of G using the semidirect product. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup of G and Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, |P ∩ Q| = 1, since the orders of P and Q are coprime. By the product formula, |PQ| = |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 4 * 9 / 1 = 36. Since PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have PQ = G. Thus, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as G = P ⋊ Q.\n\nThere are two possibilities for P: either P is isomorphic to C4 or P is isomorphic to V4. There are two possibilities for Q: either Q is isomorphic to C9 or Q is isomorphic to C3 × C3. If P is isomorphic to C4 and Q is isomorphic to C9, there is one possible action of P on Q, leading to one non-abelian group of order 36. If P is isomorphic to C4 and Q is isomorphic to C3 × C3, there is one possible action of P on Q, leading to one non-abelian group of order 36.\n\nIn total, we have found the following possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to C36.\n2. G is isomorphic to A4 × C3 (which is one of the non-abelian groups in Case 3).\n3. G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, as described in Cases 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThus, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either C36, A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
