    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a hurricane hitting the town in the next five years, we can use the historical data as a basis for our estimation. \n\nFirst, we find the probability of a hurricane hitting the town in a single year. In the past 20 years, there have been 3 hurricanes, so the probability of a hurricane in one year is:\n\n3 hurricanes / 20 years = 0.15 (or 15%)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of a hurricane hitting the town at least once in the next five years. To do this, it's easier to first find the probability of a hurricane NOT hitting the town in the next five years and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane not hitting the town in a single year is:\n\n1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (or 85%)\n\nThe probability of a hurricane not hitting the town for five consecutive years is:\n\n0.85^5 ≈ 0.4437 (or 44.37%)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a hurricane hitting the town at least once in the next five years by subtracting the probability of no hurricanes from 1:\n\n1 - 0.4437 ≈ 0.5563 (or 55.63%)\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane hitting the specific coastal town in the next five years is approximately 55.63%."
