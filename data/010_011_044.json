    "message_2": "To specify the position of any point on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of a manifold. A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. In the case of a sphere, the surface is a 2-dimensional manifold, also known as a 2-manifold or a surface.\n\nThe reason it is a 2-manifold is that we can use two coordinates to specify any point on the surface of the sphere. These coordinates can be given in various forms, such as spherical coordinates (θ, φ) or latitude and longitude (latitude, longitude). In either case, only two coordinates are needed to uniquely identify a point on the surface of the sphere.\n\nSo, the minimum number of coordinates, or dimensions, needed to specify the position of any point on the surface of a sphere with a radius of 5cm is 2."
