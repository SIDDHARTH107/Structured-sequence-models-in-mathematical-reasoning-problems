    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the length of its diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nDiagonal = √(10² + 6² + 8²)\nDiagonal = √(100 + 36 + 64)\nDiagonal = √200\n\nThe length of the diagonal is √200 cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
