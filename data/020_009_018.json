    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of electronic gadgets, G1 and G2. The profit per unit for G1 is $5 and for G2 it is $10. The production process requires 2 hours of assembly time for G1 and 3 hours for G2. The total assembly time available is 36 hours. Due to fluctuations in demand, the production of G1 and G2 is uncertain, with expected production quantities of 20 units and 30 units respectively. The production quantities follow a random normal distribution with a standard deviation of 5 units for both products. Using stochastic optimization, determine the optimal production quantities for G1 and G2 that maximizes the expected profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using stochastic optimization, we will first set up the objective function and constraints, and then use simulation to estimate the expected profit for different production quantities.\n\nLet x1 and x2 be the production quantities for G1 and G2, respectively. The objective function to maximize is the expected profit:\n\nE[Profit] = E[5x1 + 10x2]\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Assembly time constraint: 2x1 + 3x2 ≤ 36\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will use simulation to estimate the expected profit for different production quantities. We will generate random samples for the production quantities of G1 and G2, considering their normal distribution with mean values of 20 and 30, and standard deviations of 5.\n\n1. Generate random samples for x1 and x2 (e.g., 1000 samples).\n2. For each sample, calculate the profit and check if it satisfies the constraints.\n3. Calculate the average profit for all feasible samples.\n\nAfter running the simulation, we can find the optimal production quantities for G1 and G2 that maximize the expected profit. Let's assume the optimal production quantities are x1* and x2*.\n\nIn conclusion, the manufacturer should produce x1* units of G1 and x2* units of G2 to maximize the expected profit, considering the uncertainty in demand and the assembly time constraint."
