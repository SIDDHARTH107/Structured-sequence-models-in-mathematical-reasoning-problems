    "message_2": "Proof: Since A is a closed subset of Y, its complement in Y, denoted as Y - A, is open in Y. By the definition of the subspace topology, there exists an open set U in X such that (Y - A) = U ∩ Y. Now consider the complement of U in X, denoted as X - U. This set is closed in X since U is open in X.\n\nLet B = X - U. We want to show that A = B ∩ Y. To prove this, we will show that A ⊆ B ∩ Y and B ∩ Y ⊆ A.\n\n1) A ⊆ B ∩ Y: Take any element a ∈ A. Since a ∈ Y and a ∉ Y - A, it follows that a ∉ U. Therefore, a ∈ X - U = B. Since a ∈ Y and a ∈ B, we have a ∈ B ∩ Y. Thus, A ⊆ B ∩ Y.\n\n2) B ∩ Y ⊆ A: Take any element b ∈ B ∩ Y. Since b ∈ B, we know that b ∉ U. Also, since b ∈ Y, we have b ∉ U ∩ Y = Y - A. Therefore, b ∈ A. Thus, B ∩ Y ⊆ A.\n\nSince A ⊆ B ∩ Y and B ∩ Y ⊆ A, we have A = B ∩ Y. Thus, there exists a closed subset B of X such that A = B ∩ Y.\n\nNow, let X = [0, 1] with the standard topology, Y = [0, 1/2] with the subspace topology, and A = {0, 1/2}. We want to find a closed subset B of X such that A = B ∩ Y.\n\nConsider the set B = {0, 1/2}. This set is closed in X since its complement, X - B = (0, 1/2) ∪ (1/2, 1], is open in the standard topology. Moreover, A = B ∩ Y since both A and B contain the same elements 0 and 1/2, and these elements are in Y. Thus, B = {0, 1/2} is a closed subset of X such that A = B ∩ Y."
