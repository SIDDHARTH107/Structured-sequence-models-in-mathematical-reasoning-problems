    "message_2": "To determine if X is a connected space, we need to check if there are any non-empty, proper subsets of X that are both open and closed. If there are, then X is not connected. If there are not, then X is connected.\n\nRecall that a set is closed if its complement is open. Let's examine the open sets in the given topology:\n\n1. ∅ is open, and its complement X = {a, b, c} is also open. However, since X is the whole space, it is not a proper subset of X.\n\n2. {a} is open, and its complement {b, c} is not open (it's not in the given topology). So, {a} is not both open and closed.\n\n3. {a, b} is open, and its complement {c} is not open (it's not in the given topology). So, {a, b} is not both open and closed.\n\n4. {a, b, c} is open, and its complement ∅ is also open. However, since {a, b, c} is the whole space, it is not a proper subset of X.\n\nSince there are no non-empty, proper subsets of X that are both open and closed, X is a connected space.\n\nNow, let's check if X is a path-connected space. A space is path-connected if for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nSince X has only three points, we can check all possible pairs of points:\n\n1. For a and b: Define f(t) = a for t in [0, 1/2) and f(t) = b for t in [1/2, 1]. This function is continuous in the subspace topology induced by the given topology on X, and f(0) = a, f(1) = b.\n\n2. For a and c: There is no continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = a and f(1) = c. This is because any continuous function would have to pass through the point b, but there is no open set containing b that also contains c.\n\n3. For b and c: There is no continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = b and f(1) = c. This is because any continuous function would have to pass through the point a, but there is no open set containing a that also contains c.\n\nSince there are pairs of points in X for which there is no continuous function connecting them, X is not a path-connected space.\n\nIn conclusion, X is a connected space but not a path-connected space."
