    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of f(x) = 3sin(2x) + 4cos(x) in the interval [0, π], we can use the properties of trigonometric functions and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite f(x) as a sum of two trigonometric functions with the same argument:\n\nf(x) = 3sin(2x) + 4cos(x) = 3(2sin(x)cos(x)) + 4cos(x) = 6sin(x)cos(x) + 4cos(x)\n\nNow, let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\n(a^2 + b^2)(x^2 + y^2) ≥ (ax + by)^2\n\nIn our case, let a = 6sin(x), b = 4, x = cos(x), and y = 1. Then:\n\n(36sin^2(x) + 16)(cos^2(x) + 1) ≥ (6sin(x)cos(x) + 4cos(x))^2\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n(36sin^2(x) + 16)(cos^2(x) + 1) = 36sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + 36sin^2(x) + 16cos^2(x) + 16\n\nNow, let's find the maximum value of the right side:\n\n(6sin(x)cos(x) + 4cos(x))^2 = (cos(x)(6sin(x) + 4))^2\n\nSince 0 ≤ cos^2(x) ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ sin^2(x) ≤ 1, the maximum value of the right side occurs when cos(x) = 1 and sin(x) = 1 (which is not possible in the interval [0, π], but we can approach it by taking the limit as x approaches π/2 from the left).\n\nIn that case, the maximum value of the right side is:\n\n(6(1) + 4)^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nSo, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:\n\n36sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + 36sin^2(x) + 16cos^2(x) + 16 ≥ 100\n\nSince the inequality holds for all x in the interval [0, π], the maximum value of f(x) = 3sin(2x) + 4cos(x) in the interval [0, π] is 10."
