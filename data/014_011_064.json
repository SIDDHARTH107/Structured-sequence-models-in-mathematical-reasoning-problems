    "message_1": "Consider the message \"HELLO WORLD\" to be encrypted using a rail fence transposition cipher with three levels. What is the encrypted message and how would you decrypt it back to the original message?",
    "message_2": "A rail fence transposition cipher with three levels arranges the letters of the message in a zigzag pattern along three horizontal lines. To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\", we arrange the letters as follows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the letters along the lines from left to right and top to bottom to get the encrypted message: HOR ELWLDO LLO\n\nTo decrypt the message back to the original message, we follow the same zigzag pattern and place the letters from the encrypted message back into the pattern:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nFinally, we read the letters along the zigzag pattern to get the original message: HELLO WORLD"
