    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square with the first row being {1,2,3}. We need to find the number of distinct Latin squares that can be formed with this condition.\n\nWe can solve this problem by considering the possible arrangements for the second and third rows. Since each number must appear exactly once in each row and column, we can deduce the possible arrangements for the second row:\n\n1. {2,3,1}\n2. {3,1,2}\n\nNow, let's consider the possible arrangements for the third row based on each of the second-row arrangements:\n\n1. If the second row is {2,3,1}, the third row must be {3,1,2} to satisfy the Latin square conditions.\n2. If the second row is {3,1,2}, the third row must be {2,3,1} to satisfy the Latin square conditions.\n\nThus, there are 2 distinct 3x3 Latin squares with the first row being {1,2,3}."
