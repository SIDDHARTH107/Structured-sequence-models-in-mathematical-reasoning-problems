    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3}, and C = {1, 3}. Evaluate ((A △ B) △ C) × (A × C) and (A × C) × (B △ C) △ (A × B), where △ denotes the symmetric difference and × denotes the Cartesian product. Show that the two results are not equal, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product.",
