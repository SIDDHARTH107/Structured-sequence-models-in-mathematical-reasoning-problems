    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the given functions about the y-axis, we will use the disk method. The disk method formula for volume is:\n\n$V = \\pi \\int_a^b [R(y)]^2 dy$\n\nwhere $R(y)$ is the radius of the disk at a given height $y$, and the integral is evaluated from $a$ to $b$, the bounds of the region in the y-axis.\n\nFirst, we need to find the bounds of the region in the y-axis. To do this, we find the x-intercepts of the parabola $y = 2x^2 - 4x$ by setting $y = 0$:\n\n$0 = 2x^2 - 4x$\n\n$x(2x - 4) = 0$\n\n$x = 0$ or $x = 2$\n\nSo, the region is bounded by $y = 0$ and the parabola from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$. To find the bounds in the y-axis, we plug these x-values into the equation for the parabola:\n\n$y = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) = 0$\n\n$y = 2(2)^2 - 4(2) = 4$\n\nThus, the bounds in the y-axis are $0$ and $4$.\n\nNext, we need to find the radius $R(y)$ as a function of $y$. Since we are rotating about the y-axis, the radius will be the horizontal distance from the y-axis to the curve $y = 2x^2 - 4x$. To find this, we need to solve the equation for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$y = 2x^2 - 4x$\n\n$x(2x - 4) = y$\n\n$x = \\frac{y}{2x - 4}$\n\nNow, we can set up the integral for the volume:\n\n$V = \\pi \\int_0^4 \\left(\\frac{y}{2x - 4}\\right)^2 dy$\n\nHowever, we need to express the integral in terms of $y$ only. We can do this by substituting $x$ with the expression we found earlier:\n\n$x = \\frac{y}{2x - 4}$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$2x^2 - 4x = y$\n\n$2x^2 - 4x - y = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(2)(-y)}}{2(2)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 8y}}{4}$\n\nSince we are considering the positive part of the parabola, we will take the positive square root:\n\n$x = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{16 + 8y}}{4}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $x$ into the integral:\n\n$V = \\pi \\int_0^4 \\left(\\frac{y}{4 + \\sqrt{16 + 8y} - 4}\\right)^2 dy$\n\n$V = \\pi \\int_0^4 \\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{16 + 8y}}\\right)^2 dy$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\n$V = \\pi \\int_0^4 \\frac{y^2}{16 + 8y} dy$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let $u = 16 + 8y$, so $du = 8 dy$. Also, when $y = 0$, $u = 16$, and when $y = 4$, $u = 48$. Thus, the integral becomes:\n\n$V = \\pi \\int_{16}^{48} \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{(u - 16)^2}{u} du$\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\int_{16}^{48} \\frac{(u - 16)^2}{u} du$\n\nNow, we can expand the numerator and split the integral into three separate integrals:\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\int_{16}^{48} \\frac{u^2 - 32u + 256}{u} du$\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\left(\\int_{16}^{48} u du - 32\\int_{16}^{48} du + 256\\int_{16}^{48} \\frac{1}{u} du\\right)$\n\nNow, we can evaluate each integral:\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\left[\\frac{1}{2}u^2 \\Big|_{16}^{48} - 32u \\Big|_{16}^{48} + 256\\ln|u| \\Big|_{16}^{48}\\right]$\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(48^2 - 16^2) - 32(48 - 16) + 256(\\ln(48) - \\ln(16))\\right]$\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\left[1152 - 1024 + 256(\\ln(3))\\right]$\n\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\left[128 + 256\\ln(3)\\right]$\n\n$V = 16\\pi + 32\\pi\\ln(3)$\n\nSo, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by $y = 2x^2 - 4x$ and $y = 0$ about the y-axis is $V = 16\\pi + 32\\pi\\ln(3)$."
