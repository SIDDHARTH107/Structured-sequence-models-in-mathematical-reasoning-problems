    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to arrange the weights in ascending order, which they already are: 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 40. Since there are an even number of data points, the median will be the average of the middle two values.\n\nMedian = (8 + 9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5\n\nNow, we need to find the median absolute deviation (MAD). First, we'll find the absolute deviations from the median:\n\n|5 - 8.5| = 3.5\n|6 - 8.5| = 2.5\n|8 - 8.5| = 0.5\n|9 - 8.5| = 0.5\n|15 - 8.5| = 6.5\n|40 - 8.5| = 31.5\n\nNow, we arrange the absolute deviations in ascending order: 0.5, 0.5, 2.5, 3.5, 6.5, 31.5. The median of these absolute deviations is:\n\nMAD = (2.5 + 3.5) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the median weight of the catfish is 8.5 pounds, and the median absolute deviation is 3 pounds."
