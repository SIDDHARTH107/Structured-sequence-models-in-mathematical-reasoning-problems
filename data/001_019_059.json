    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 1| = 8, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 1 = 8\nIn this case, we need to solve for x:\n3x - 1 = 8\n3x = 9\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 1 = -8\nIn this case, we also need to solve for x:\n3x - 1 = -8\n3x = -7\nx = -7/3\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation |3x - 1| = 8 are x = 3 and x = -7/3."
