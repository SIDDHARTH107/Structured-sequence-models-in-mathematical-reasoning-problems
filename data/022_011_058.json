    "message_2": "To find the zeros and poles of the function $f(z) = \\frac{z - 2}{(z-2)^2(z+1)}$, we first need to find the zeros of the numerator and the poles of the denominator.\n\nZeros:\nThe zeros of the function are the values of $z$ that make the numerator equal to zero. In this case, we have:\n\n$z - 2 = 0$\n\n$z = 2$\n\nNow, we need to check if this zero is inside the circle $|z| = 3$. Since $|2| = 2 < 3$, the zero $z = 2$ is inside the circle.\n\nPoles:\nThe poles of the function are the values of $z$ that make the denominator equal to zero. In this case, we have:\n\n$(z-2)^2(z+1) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions: $z = 2$ and $z = -1$. Now, we need to check if these poles are inside the circle $|z| = 3$. Since $|2| = 2 < 3$ and $|-1| = 1 < 3$, both poles are inside the circle.\n\nSo, the function $f(z) = \\frac{z - 2}{(z-2)^2(z+1)}$ has 1 zero and 2 poles inside the circle $|z| = 3$."
