    "message_2": "The forced van der Pol oscillator is described by the following differential equation:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} - \\mu(1 - x^2)\\dot{x} + x = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the displacement, $\\dot{x}$ is the velocity, $\\ddot{x}$ is the acceleration, $\\mu$ is the damping parameter, $\\omega$ is the forcing frequency, and $F_0$ is the forcing amplitude.\n\nTo find the limit cycle period of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we need to determine the period of the oscillation when the system reaches a stable, periodic state. In this case, the limit cycle period will be determined by the forcing frequency, as the forcing term is what drives the system into a periodic state.\n\nThe period of the forcing term is given by:\n\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$$\n\nGiven the forcing frequency $\\omega = 2$, we can calculate the period:\n\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{2} = \\pi$$\n\nSo, the limit cycle period of the forced van der Pol oscillator with parameters $\\mu=0.5$, $\\omega=2$, and a forcing amplitude of $F_0=1.2$ is $\\pi$."
