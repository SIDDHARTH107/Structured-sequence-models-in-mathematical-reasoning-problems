    "message_2": "Let's denote the complex projective plane by CP^2, and let's denote the blown-up complex projective plane at a point by Bl_p(CP^2). We want to compute the first Chern class of Bl_p(CP^2).\n\nRecall that the first Chern class is a cohomology class that measures the curvature of a complex manifold. In the case of the complex projective plane CP^2, its first Chern class is well-known to be 3 times the generator of H^2(CP^2, Z), denoted by c_1(CP^2) = 3H, where H is the hyperplane class.\n\nNow, let's consider the blow-up process. Blowing up CP^2 at a point p replaces the point p with a complex projective line CP^1, also known as the exceptional divisor E. The cohomology ring of Bl_p(CP^2) is generated by the classes H and E, subject to the relations:\n\n1. H^2 = 3 (since H is the pullback of the hyperplane class from CP^2)\n2. E^2 = -1 (since E is the exceptional divisor)\n3. H.E = 1 (since E is a section of the line bundle associated with H)\n\nNow, we want to compute the first Chern class of Bl_p(CP^2). To do this, we need to find the total Chern class of Bl_p(CP^2), which is given by the formula:\n\nc(Bl_p(CP^2)) = c(CP^2) * (1 + E)\n\nSince c(CP^2) = 1 + 3H + 3H^2, we have:\n\nc(Bl_p(CP^2)) = (1 + 3H + 3H^2) * (1 + E)\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\nc(Bl_p(CP^2)) = 1 + 3H + E + 3H^2 + 3HE\n\nNow, we can compute the first Chern class c_1(Bl_p(CP^2)) by taking the degree 2 part of the total Chern class:\n\nc_1(Bl_p(CP^2)) = 3H + E\n\nSo, the first Chern class of the blown-up complex projective plane at a point is given by 3H + E."
