    "message_1": "Sorry, I need to correct myself. Modal logic is a subfield of philosophy, not mathematics. \n\nHowever, here's a question related to modal logic that a student of philosophy may be able to solve:\n\nConsider the following sentence: \"Necessarily, if it rains, then the streets will be wet.\" Using the modal operator \"◊\" to represent possibility and \"◻\" to represent necessity, translate this sentence into modal logic.",
    "message_2": "To translate the sentence \"Necessarily, if it rains, then the streets will be wet\" into modal logic using the modal operators \"◊\" for possibility and \"◻\" for necessity, we can represent it as:\n\n◻(R → W)\n\nHere, R represents \"it rains\" and W represents \"the streets will be wet\". The arrow (→) represents the conditional \"if...then\" relationship between R and W. The necessity operator (◻) is placed before the entire conditional statement to indicate that the relationship between R and W is necessary."
