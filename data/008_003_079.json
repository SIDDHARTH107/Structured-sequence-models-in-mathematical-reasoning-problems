    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to get it in row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n[2, 1, 6]\n[3, 2, 9]\n[1, 1, 4]\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 3 to get a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n[1, 1, 4]\n[3, 2, 9]\n[2, 1, 6]\n\nStep 2: Subtract 3 times row 1 from row 2 and subtract 2 times row 1 from row 3:\n\n[1, 1, 4]\n[0, -1, -3]\n[0, -1, -2]\n\nStep 3: Multiply row 2 by -1 to get a leading 1:\n\n[1, 1, 4]\n[0, 1, 3]\n[0, -1, -2]\n\nStep 4: Add row 2 to row 3:\n\n[1, 1, 4]\n[0, 1, 3]\n[0, 0, 1]\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that all rows are non-zero, so the rank of matrix A is 3."
