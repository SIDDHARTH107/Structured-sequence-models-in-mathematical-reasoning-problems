    "message_2": "Let's call the three colors A, B, and C. There are 3 balls of each color, so we have:\n\nA A A\nB B B\nC C C\n\nWe want to choose 2 balls of each color. Let's consider each color separately.\n\nFor color A, we have 3 balls and we want to choose 2. This can be done in 3!/(2!1!) = 3 ways (using combinations formula n!/(r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose).\n\nSimilarly, for color B, we have 3 balls and we want to choose 2. This can also be done in 3 ways.\n\nAnd for color C, we have 3 balls and we want to choose 2. This can also be done in 3 ways.\n\nNow, since these are independent events, we can multiply the number of ways for each color to get the total number of ways to choose 2 balls of each color:\n\n3 (ways to choose 2 balls of color A) * 3 (ways to choose 2 balls of color B) * 3 (ways to choose 2 balls of color C) = 3^3 = 27 ways."
