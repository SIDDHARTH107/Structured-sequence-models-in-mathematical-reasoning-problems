    "message_1": "Suppose the value of Euler's totient function at a certain number n is equal to 36. If n is a multiple of 7 and has only one prime factor raised to an odd power, what is the value of n?",
    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. If n has the prime factorization n = p_1^a_1 * p_2^a_2 * ... * p_k^a_k, then the formula for the totient function is:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p_1) * (1 - 1/p_2) * ... * (1 - 1/p_k)\n\nWe are given that φ(n) = 36, and n is a multiple of 7. Also, n has only one prime factor raised to an odd power. Let's denote this prime factor as p and its exponent as b, where b is odd.\n\nSince n is a multiple of 7, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: p = 7\nIn this case, n = 7^b, and we have:\n\n36 = φ(n) = 7^b * (1 - 1/7) = 7^b * (6/7)\n\nSince 36 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that b = 1. Therefore, n = 7^1 = 7. However, this case does not satisfy the condition that n has only one prime factor raised to an odd power, as 7 is raised to an even power (0) in the prime factorization of 36. So, this case is not valid.\n\nCase 2: p ≠ 7\nIn this case, n = 7 * p^b, and we have:\n\n36 = φ(n) = 7 * p^b * (1 - 1/7) * (1 - 1/p) = 7 * p^b * (6/7) * (p - 1)/p\n\nCancelling out the 7's, we get:\n\n36 = p^b * (6) * (p - 1)/p\n\nSince p is a prime number and p ≠ 7, the smallest possible value for p is 2. However, if p = 2, then the exponent b must be even, as 2^b would be a factor of n, which contradicts the given condition that only one prime factor has an odd exponent. Therefore, p must be an odd prime number.\n\nLet's try p = 3:\n\n36 = 3^b * (6) * (3 - 1)/3\n\n36 = 3^b * (6) * (2/3)\n\n18 = 3^b\n\nSince 18 = 3^2 * 2, we have b = 2, which is even. This contradicts the given condition that only one prime factor has an odd exponent. So, p ≠ 3.\n\nLet's try p = 5:\n\n36 = 5^b * (6) * (5 - 1)/5\n\n36 = 5^b * (6) * (4/5)\n\n30 = 5^b\n\nSince 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, we have b = 1, which is odd. This satisfies the given condition that only one prime factor has an odd exponent. Therefore, n = 7 * 5^1 = 7 * 5 = 35.\n\nSo, the value of n is 35."
