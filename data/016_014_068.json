    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is 2. This fractal curve is formed by iteratively replacing a straight line segment with two segments, each half the length of the original, and connected at a right angle. The Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, N = 4 (each segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and s = 2 (each new segment is half the length of the original). Therefore:\n\nD = log(4) / log(2) = 2\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is 2."
