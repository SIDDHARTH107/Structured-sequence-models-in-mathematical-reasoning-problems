    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve related to the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility:\n\nAssume a stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion with a drift of 5% and an annual volatility of 30%. The current stock price is $100, and the risk-free interest rate is 3%. Suppose you wish to price a European call option with a strike price of $110 and a maturity date of 6 months. What is the Black-Scholes-Merton price of the call option?",
    "message_2": "To find the Black-Scholes-Merton price of the call option, we can use the following formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC is the call option price\nS is the current stock price\nX is the strike price\nr is the risk-free interest rate\nT is the time to maturity (in years)\nN(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\nd1 and d2 are given by:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nIn this case, we have:\nS = 100\nX = 110\nr = 0.03\nT = 0.5 (6 months = 0.5 years)\nσ = 0.3 (30% annual volatility)\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.03 + (0.3^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.3 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.4454\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.3 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ -0.7454\n\nNow, we can find N(d1) and N(d2) using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.3279\nN(d2) ≈ 0.2280\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option price:\n\nC = 100 * 0.3279 - 110 * e^(-0.03 * 0.5) * 0.2280\nC ≈ 32.79 - 108.39 * 0.2280\nC ≈ 32.79 - 24.71\nC ≈ 8.08\n\nSo, the Black-Scholes-Merton price of the call option is approximately $8.08."
