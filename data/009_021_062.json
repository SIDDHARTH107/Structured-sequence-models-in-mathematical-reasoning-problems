Use a finite difference method with a grid size of $0.1$ units in both directions and a time step size of $0.001$. Assume $k=1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given problem, we will use the finite difference method with the Forward Time Central Space (FTCS) scheme. The discretized form of the heat equation using the FTCS scheme is given by:\n\n$u_{i,j}^{n+1} = u_{i,j}^{n} + k\\Delta t \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^{n} - 2u_{i,j}^{n} + u_{i-1,j}^{n}}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^{n} - 2u_{i,j}^{n} + u_{i,j-1}^{n}}{\\Delta y^2} \\right)$\n\nwhere $u_{i,j}^{n}$ represents the temperature at grid point $(i, j)$ and time step $n$, and $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta t$ are the grid size and time step size, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's initialize the grid and set the initial and boundary conditions:\n\n1. Create a grid of size $(2\\pi / 0.1 + 1) \\times (2\\pi / 0.1 + 1)$.\n2. Set the initial condition: $u_{i,j}^{0} = \\sin(i\\Delta x)\\cos(j\\Delta y)$ for all $i, j$.\n3. Set the boundary conditions: $u_{0,j}^{n} = u_{2\\pi / 0.1,j}^{n} = u_{i,0}^{n} = u_{i,2\\pi / 0.1}^{n} = 0$ for all $i, j, n$.\n\nNow, we will perform the time-stepping using the FTCS scheme:\n\n1. Set $n = 0$.\n2. Update the temperature at each grid point $(i, j)$ using the discretized heat equation.\n3. Increment $n$ and repeat step 2 until $n\\Delta t = 1$.\n\nAfter completing the time-stepping, the temperature distribution at time $t=1$ will be stored in the grid. Note that this is an approximate solution, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the grid size and time step size."
