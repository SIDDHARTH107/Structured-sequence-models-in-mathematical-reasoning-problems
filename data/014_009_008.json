    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher with 4 rounds and 48-bit block size. The key used by each round is 40 bits long. If we encrypt a plaintext message of 64 bits, how many bits of the ciphertext will be identical to the plaintext after encryption?",
    "message_2": "A Feistel cipher with a 48-bit block size means that the input message is divided into two 24-bit halves (L0 and R0). During each round, one half is modified based on the other half and the round key. After 4 rounds, the two halves are combined to form the 48-bit ciphertext.\n\nHowever, the given plaintext message has a size of 64 bits, which is larger than the 48-bit block size of the Feistel cipher. This means that the plaintext message must be divided into two blocks, each with a size of 32 bits (not 48 bits). Let's call these two blocks P1 and P2.\n\nNow, since the Feistel cipher can only encrypt 48-bit blocks, we cannot directly apply it to the 32-bit blocks P1 and P2. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how many bits of the ciphertext will be identical to the plaintext after encryption using this Feistel cipher. The problem statement seems to have an inconsistency in the block size and the plaintext size."
