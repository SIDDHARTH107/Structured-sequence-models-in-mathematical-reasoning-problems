    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of A and B. Use these sets to show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {5}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is commutative with respect to intersection. Commutativity means that the order of the sets does not matter, i.e., (A ∆ B) ∩ C = A ∆ (B ∩ C) for any sets A, B, and C.\n\nLet C be any set. We need to show that (A ∆ B) ∩ C = A ∆ (B ∩ C).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = {1, 5} ∩ C\nA ∆ (B ∩ C) = A ∆ ({2, 3, 4} ∩ C)\n\nSince we don't know the elements of set C, we cannot determine if (A ∆ B) ∩ C = A ∆ (B ∩ C) for all cases. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to intersection."
