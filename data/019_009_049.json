    "message_2": "To find the truth value of the formula ((P → Q) ∧ P) → Q, we can use the probabilities of P and Q being true. In classical logic, P → Q is true if P is false or Q is true. We can calculate the probability of P → Q being true as follows:\n\nP(P → Q) = P(¬P) + P(Q) - P(¬P) * P(Q) = (1 - 0.3) + 0.8 - (1 - 0.3) * 0.8 = 0.7 + 0.8 - 0.7 * 0.8 = 1.5 - 0.56 = 0.94\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of (P → Q) ∧ P being true:\n\nP((P → Q) ∧ P) = P(P → Q) * P(P) = 0.94 * 0.3 = 0.282\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability of ((P → Q) ∧ P) → Q being true:\n\nP(((P → Q) ∧ P) → Q) = P(¬((P → Q) ∧ P)) + P(Q) - P(¬((P → Q) ∧ P)) * P(Q) = (1 - 0.282) + 0.8 - (1 - 0.282) * 0.8 = 0.718 + 0.8 - 0.718 * 0.8 ≈ 1.518 - 0.5744 ≈ 0.9436\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the truth value of the formula ((P → Q) ∧ P) → Q is approximately 0.94."
