    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider two cases: G has an element of order 4, or G does not have an element of order 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element of G with order 4. Then, the powers of a form a subgroup of G: {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. Since this subgroup has 4 elements and G has 4 elements, this subgroup must be equal to G. Therefore, G is cyclic and generated by a, so G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 4.\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. We already ruled out the case where G has an element of order 4, so the only remaining possibilities are orders 1 and 2. The identity element e has order 1, so there must be at least one element of order 2.\n\nLet a be an element of order 2 in G. Since G has 4 elements and we already have e and a, there are 2 remaining elements. Let b be one of these remaining elements. If b has order 2, then the product ab must be the last remaining element in G. Note that (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2 = e * e = e, so ab also has order 2. Thus, G = {e, a, b, ab} with all non-identity elements having order 2, which is the definition of the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
