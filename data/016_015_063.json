    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. With each level, the curve becomes more complex, and the total length of the curve increases. The total length of a Hilbert curve of level n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve, the number of segments at level n is given by:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^n\n\nFor a level 5 Hilbert curve, the number of segments is:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^5 = 1024\n\nGiven that each segment of the curve has a length of 0.25 units, the total length of the level 5 Hilbert curve is:\n\nLength = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\nLength = 1024 * 0.25\nLength = 256 units\n\nSo, the total length of a level 5 Hilbert curve with each segment having a length of 0.25 units is 256 units."
