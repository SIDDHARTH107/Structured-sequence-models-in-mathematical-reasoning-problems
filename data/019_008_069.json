    "message_1": "A hardware store has 600 light bulbs in stock. Each bulb is classified based on its brightness level from 0 to 10 using fuzzy logic. The store has 300 bulbs with a brightness level of at least 6, and 200 bulbs with a brightness level of at least 8. What is the percentage of bulbs with a brightness level between 6 and 8?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of bulbs with a brightness level between 6 and 8, we first need to determine the number of bulbs in this range. Since there are 300 bulbs with a brightness level of at least 6 and 200 bulbs with a brightness level of at least 8, there must be 300 - 200 = 100 bulbs with a brightness level between 6 and 8.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of these bulbs, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of bulbs with brightness level between 6 and 8 / Total number of bulbs) * 100\n\nPercentage = (100 / 600) * 100 = 16.67%\n\nSo, 16.67% of the bulbs have a brightness level between 6 and 8."
