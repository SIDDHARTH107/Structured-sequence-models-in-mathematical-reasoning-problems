    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees possible, we use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of candidates (10), k is the number of people in the committee (5), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 different committees possible."
