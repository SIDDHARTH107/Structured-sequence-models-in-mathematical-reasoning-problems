    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 27 = 3^3.\n\n1. By the First Sylow Theorem, G has a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3^3 = 27.\n2. By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 27, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Since P is a normal subgroup of G and has the same order as G, it follows that P = G. Thus, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic or a direct product of cyclic groups of order 3. If G is cyclic, we are done. If G is a direct product of cyclic groups, then G is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3 × C_3. However, this group has order 81, not 27, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let P, Q, and R be distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have P ∩ Q = P ∩ R = Q ∩ R = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nLet H = PQ. Since P and Q are both normal in G, H is a subgroup of G. By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have:\n\n|H| = |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 27 * 27 / 1 = 729.\n\nHowever, this is not possible since |H| must divide |G| = 27. So, there must be a non-trivial intersection between P and Q, say P ∩ Q = K, where K is a subgroup of order 3. Since K is normal in both P and Q, it is also normal in the subgroup generated by P and Q, which we will denote as H = ⟨P, Q⟩.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group H/K. Since |H| = 27 and |K| = 3, we have |H/K| = 9. Thus, H/K is a group of order 9, which is either cyclic or isomorphic to C_3 × C_3. If H/K is cyclic, then H is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 27, which means G is cyclic. If H/K is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, then H is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
