    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to break down the square roots into their prime factors.\n\n√(80) = √(2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5) = 2 × 2 × √(5) = 4√(5)\n\n√(45) = √(3 × 3 × 5) = 3√(5)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression:\n\n4√(5) - 3√(5)\n\nSince both terms have the same square root, we can combine them:\n\n(4 - 3)√(5) = 1√(5) = √(5)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n√(5)"
