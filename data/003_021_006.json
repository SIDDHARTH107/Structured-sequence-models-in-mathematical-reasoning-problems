    "message_2": "The dot product of two vectors A and B can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven that the magnitudes of A and B are 3 and 5, respectively, and the angle between them is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nA · B = 3 * 5 * cos(60°)\n\nTo find the cosine of 60 degrees, we can either use a calculator or recall that cos(60°) = 1/2 from the unit circle.\n\nA · B = 3 * 5 * (1/2)\n\nA · B = 15 * (1/2)\n\nA · B = 7.5\n\nThe dot product of vectors A and B is 7.5."
