    "message_1": "Let's say there are 1000 people in a community and 40% of them attend a music festival. If we randomly select 10 people from the community, what is the probability that at least 4 of them have attended the music festival?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 4 of the 10 randomly selected people attended the music festival, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as \"n choose k\"\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people selected)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people who attended the music festival)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a person attending the music festival)\n\nIn this problem, n = 10, p = 0.4 (since 40% of the community attended the music festival), and we want to find the probability of at least 4 successes (k ≥ 4). To find the probability of at least 4 successes, we can find the probability of 0, 1, 2, and 3 successes and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2) - P(X = 3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each of these cases using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(10, 0) * (0.4)^0 * (0.6)^10 = 1 * 1 * 0.6^10 ≈ 0.0060\nP(X = 1) = C(10, 1) * (0.4)^1 * (0.6)^9 = 10 * 0.4 * 0.6^9 ≈ 0.0403\nP(X = 2) = C(10, 2) * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^8 = 45 * 0.16 * 0.6^8 ≈ 0.1209\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * (0.4)^3 * (0.6)^7 = 120 * 0.064 * 0.6^7 ≈ 0.2149\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into our equation for P(X ≥ 4):\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - 0.0060 - 0.0403 - 0.1209 - 0.2149 ≈ 1 - 0.3821 ≈ 0.6179\n\nSo, the probability that at least 4 of the 10 randomly selected people attended the music festival is approximately 61.79%."
