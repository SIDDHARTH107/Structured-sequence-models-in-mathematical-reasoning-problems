    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (the major radius), and r is the radius of the tube (the minor radius).\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 5 cm, and the inner radius is 3 cm. To find the major radius R, we can take the average of the outer and inner radii:\n\nR = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4 cm\n\nThe minor radius r is the difference between the outer and inner radii divided by 2:\n\nr = (5 - 3) / 2 = 1 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 4 * 1^2\nVolume ≈ 2 * (3.14159)^2 * 4 * 1\nVolume ≈ 2 * 9.8696 * 4\nVolume ≈ 78.9568 cm³\n\nSo the volume of the torus is approximately 78.96 cubic centimeters."
