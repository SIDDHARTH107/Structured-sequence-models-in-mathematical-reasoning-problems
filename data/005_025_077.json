    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company claims that their cars have an average fuel efficiency of 20 km/L. A group of 50 cars is randomly selected and their fuel efficiency is measured. The mean fuel efficiency of the sample is 19 km/L, with a standard deviation of 2 km/L. \n\nIs there enough evidence to suggest that the true mean fuel efficiency of the company's cars is less than 20 km/L? Use a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To test this claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean fuel efficiency is 20 km/L, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean fuel efficiency is less than 20 km/L.\n\nH0: μ = 20 km/L\nH1: μ < 20 km/L\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 19 km/L\nSample standard deviation (s) = 2 km/L\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is greater than 30, we can use the t-distribution to perform the t-test. First, we need to calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (19 - 20) / (2 / √50)\nt = -1 / (2 / √50)\nt ≈ -1.41\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find:\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.677\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-1.41) is greater than the critical t-value (-1.677), we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level of significance.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is not enough evidence to suggest that the true mean fuel efficiency of the company's cars is less than 20 km/L at a 5% level of significance."
