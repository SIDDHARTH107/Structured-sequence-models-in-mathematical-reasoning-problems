    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 2, we first need to find its derivative f'(x). \n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to 0:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring doesn't seem to work, so we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(4))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 48)) / 6\n\nx = (6 ± √(-12)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. Therefore, there are no critical points for the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 2."
