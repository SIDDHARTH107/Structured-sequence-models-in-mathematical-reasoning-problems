Initially, the radius of the balloon is 10 centimeters. \nAt what rate is the radius of the balloon increasing when the volume of the balloon is 4000 cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use the formula for the volume of a sphere and the given information to find the rate at which the radius is increasing.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nWe are given that the volume is increasing at a rate of 50 cubic centimeters per second (dV/dt = 50 cm³/s) and we want to find the rate at which the radius is increasing (dr/dt) when the volume is 4000 cubic centimeters.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius when the volume is 4000 cubic centimeters:\n\n4000 = (4/3)πr^3\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr^3 = (3/4)(4000/π)\nr^3 ≈ 1007.920\nr ≈ 10.26 cm\n\nNow, we'll differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = d((4/3)πr^3)/dt\ndV/dt = (4πr^2)(dr/dt)\n\nWe know that dV/dt = 50 cm³/s and we just found that r ≈ 10.26 cm when V = 4000 cm³. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n50 = 4π(10.26)^2(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we'll solve for dr/dt:\n\ndr/dt = 50 / (4π(10.26)^2)\ndr/dt ≈ 0.038 cm/s\n\nSo, the radius of the balloon is increasing at a rate of approximately 0.038 centimeters per second when the volume of the balloon is 4000 cubic centimeters."
