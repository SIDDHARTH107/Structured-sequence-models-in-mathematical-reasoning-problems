    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the numbers in ascending order:\n\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28\n\nThere are 14 numbers in the set, which is an even number. To find the median, we need to take the average of the two middle numbers (the 7th and 8th numbers in this case).\n\nThe 7th number is 21 and the 8th number is 22. The average of these two numbers is:\n\n(21 + 22) / 2 = 43 / 2 = 21.5\n\nSo, the median of this set of numbers is 21.5."
