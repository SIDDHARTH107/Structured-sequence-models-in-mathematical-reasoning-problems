    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation and then solve for the Fourier transform of the solution. Finally, we will take the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the solution in the original domain.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ny''(x) + y(x) = 0\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides, we have:\n\n(F{y''})(k) + (F{y})(k) = 0\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we know that the Fourier transform of the second derivative is given by:\n\nF{y''}(k) = (ik)^2 * Y(k) = -k^2 * Y(k)\n\nwhere Y(k) is the Fourier transform of y(x). So, the transformed equation becomes:\n\n-k^2 * Y(k) + Y(k) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for Y(k):\n\nY(k) * (-k^2 + 1) = 0\n\nSince Y(k) cannot be zero for all k, we have:\n\n-k^2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = ±1\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for Y(k) as:\n\nY(k) = A * δ(k - 1) + B * δ(k + 1)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and δ(k) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform of Y(k), we get the solution y(x):\n\ny(x) = F^-1{Y(k)} = A * e^(ix) + B * e^(-ix)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A and B.\n\n1) y(0) = 0:\n\n0 = A * e^(i*0) + B * e^(-i*0) = A + B\n\n2) y(2π) + y'(2π) = 0:\n\ny(2π) = A * e^(i*2π) + B * e^(-i*2π) = A + B\ny'(x) = iA * e^(ix) - iB * e^(-ix)\ny'(2π) = iA * e^(i*2π) - iB * e^(-i*2π) = iA - iB\n\nAdding y(2π) and y'(2π), we get:\n\n0 = (A + B) + (iA - iB)\n\nSince A + B = 0 (from the first boundary condition), we have:\n\n0 = iA - iB\n\nDividing by i, we get:\n\n0 = A - B\n\nSo, A = B.\n\nNow, we can write the solution y(x) as:\n\ny(x) = A * (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))\n\nHowever, since the boundary conditions are not sufficient to determine the constant A uniquely, the solution is not unique. The given boundary value problem does not have a unique solution, but the general form of the solution is given by:\n\ny(x) = A * (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))"
