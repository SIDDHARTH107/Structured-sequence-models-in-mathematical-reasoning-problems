    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover for a given graph.\n\nIn this graph, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting the following vertices: {B, C, F}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Vertex B covers edges AB, BC, and BD.\n- Vertex C covers edges CE.\n- Vertex F covers edges EF and FG.\n\nNo smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges, so the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
