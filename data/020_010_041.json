    "message_1": "A corporation produces two kinds of products: chairs and tables. The profit for each chair sold is $10 while the profit for each table sold is $12. The production process that the corporation uses for both products is subject to errors. For chairs, the error in production can lead to a loss of up to $2 per chair sold, while for tables, the error can lead to a loss of up to $3 per table sold. The corporation wants to maximize its profit while taking into account the possibility of errors. If the corporation can sell up to 1000 chairs and up to 800 tables, how many of each should they produce to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs produced and y be the number of tables produced. The profit function for chairs is P_chair = 10x - 2x = 8x, and the profit function for tables is P_table = 12y - 3y = 9y. The total profit function is P_total = 8x + 9y.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n1. x ≤ 1000 (the corporation can sell up to 1000 chairs)\n2. y ≤ 800 (the corporation can sell up to 800 tables)\n\nTo maximize the profit, we will analyze the corner points of the feasible region defined by the constraints:\n\n1. (x, y) = (0, 0): P_total = 8(0) + 9(0) = 0\n2. (x, y) = (1000, 0): P_total = 8(1000) + 9(0) = 8000\n3. (x, y) = (0, 800): P_total = 8(0) + 9(800) = 7200\n4. (x, y) = (1000, 800): This point is not feasible since the corporation cannot produce and sell more than the maximum capacity of each product.\n\nComparing the profit values at the corner points, we find that the maximum profit occurs when the corporation produces 1000 chairs and no tables. The maximum expected profit is $8,000."
