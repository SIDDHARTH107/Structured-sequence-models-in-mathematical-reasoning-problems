    "message_1": "Suppose we have a group G of order 9. Let 'a' be an element of G such that a is not equal to the identity element. If the order of 'a' is 9, then G is isomorphic to which group: the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9? If the order of 'a' is not 9, then find another element 'b' in G such that b is not equal to the identity element and b is not a power of 'a'. Which group is G isomorphic to in this case?",
    "message_2": "Since G has order 9, and the order of 'a' is 9, this means that 'a' generates the entire group G. In other words, G = {e, a, a^2, ..., a^8}, where e is the identity element. This is the definition of a cyclic group, so G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nIf the order of 'a' is not 9, then the order of 'a' must be a divisor of 9. The only other possibility is that the order of 'a' is 3 (since the order cannot be 1, as 'a' is not the identity element). In this case, we have a subgroup H = {e, a, a^2} of order 3.\n\nNow, we need to find another element 'b' in G such that b is not equal to the identity element and b is not a power of 'a'. Since G has 9 elements and H has 3 elements, there must be an element 'b' in G that is not in H. Let's call this element 'b'.\n\nNow, consider the set K = {e, b, b^2, b^3, ..., b^8}. Since 'b' is not a power of 'a', it must have order 9 (otherwise, if it had order 3, then G would have at least 9 elements, which is a contradiction). Therefore, K is a cyclic subgroup of G generated by 'b', and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 in this case as well."
