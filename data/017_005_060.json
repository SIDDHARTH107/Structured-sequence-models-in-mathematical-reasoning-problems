    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 125 = 5^3. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25.\n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the order of P is 25, P is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. In either case, P has an element of order 25. Let x be an element in G but not in P. Then the order of x is 5, since the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. The subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, is a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, <x> must be a subgroup of P, which is a contradiction. Therefore, G must be cyclic in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nLet P be one of the Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Since the order of P is 25, P is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. In either case, P has an element of order 25. Let x be an element in G but not in P. Then the order of x is 5, since the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. The subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, is a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, there must be another Sylow 5-subgroup Q that is not equal to P or <x>. Let y be an element of order 5 in Q. Then the order of the element xy is 25, since the orders of x and y are coprime. Therefore, G has an element of order 25, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
