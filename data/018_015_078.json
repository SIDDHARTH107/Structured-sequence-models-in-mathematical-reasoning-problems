    "message_2": "a) A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nb) B × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nc) The intersection of A × B and B × A is the set of all ordered pairs that are in both A × B and B × A. So, (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = {(2, 2)}\n\nThe result in part (c) shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection because (A × B) ∩ (B × A) is not equal to A × B or B × A. In other words, the intersection of A × B and B × A is not the same as either A × B or B × A, which demonstrates that the Cartesian product is not commutative in this context."
