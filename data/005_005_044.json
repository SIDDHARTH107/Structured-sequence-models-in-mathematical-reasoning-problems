    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected bird weighs between 50 and 60 grams, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the values and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probabilities.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-scores for 50 grams and 60 grams.\n\nFor 50 grams:\nz1 = (50 - 55) / 3\nz1 = -5 / 3\nz1 ≈ -1.67\n\nFor 60 grams:\nz2 = (60 - 55) / 3\nz2 = 5 / 3\nz2 ≈ 1.67\n\nNow, we'll use the z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than or equal to a given z-score.\n\nP(Z ≤ -1.67) ≈ 0.0475\nP(Z ≤ 1.67) ≈ 0.9525\n\nTo find the probability that a bird weighs between 50 and 60 grams, we'll subtract the probability of the lower z-score from the probability of the higher z-score:\n\nP(50 < X < 60) = P(-1.67 < Z < 1.67) = P(Z ≤ 1.67) - P(Z ≤ -1.67)\nP(50 < X < 60) = 0.9525 - 0.0475\nP(50 < X < 60) = 0.9050\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected bird from this population weighs between 50 and 60 grams is approximately 0.905 or 90.5%."
