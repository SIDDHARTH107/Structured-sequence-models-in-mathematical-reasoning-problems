    "message_1": "Suppose you have a data set with the following values: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 100. Determine if there are any outliers using the interquartile range method.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), and the interquartile range (IQR).\n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 100\n\nStep 2: Find the first quartile (Q1), which is the median of the lower half of the data.\nSince there are 6 data points, the lower half consists of the first 3 values: 10, 15, 20.\nThe median of 10, 15, 20 is 15, so Q1 = 15.\n\nStep 3: Find the third quartile (Q3), which is the median of the upper half of the data.\nThe upper half consists of the last 3 values: 25, 30, 100.\nThe median of 25, 30, 100 is 30, so Q3 = 30.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the interquartile range (IQR).\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 30 - 15 = 15\n\nStep 5: Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers.\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 15 - 1.5 * 15 = 15 - 22.5 = -7.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 30 + 1.5 * 15 = 30 + 22.5 = 52.5\n\nStep 6: Identify any outliers.\nAny data point below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier. In this case, the value 100 is above the upper bound of 52.5, so it is an outlier.\n\nTherefore, there is one outlier in the data set, which is the value 100."
