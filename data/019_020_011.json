    "message_2": "The time complexity of finding the shortest path between two points in a graph with n vertices and m edges using Dijkstra's algorithm depends on the data structure used for the priority queue. \n\nIf you use a binary heap as the priority queue, the time complexity is O((n+m) * log n) because each vertex is dequeued and enqueued at most once, and each edge is processed once. The operations of enqueue and dequeue take O(log n) time.\n\nIf you use a Fibonacci heap as the priority queue, the time complexity is O(n * log n + m). This is because the decrease-key operation in a Fibonacci heap takes amortized O(1) time, and other operations take O(log n) time.\n\nIn general, the time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue can be represented as O(n * log n + m * T), where T is the time complexity of the decrease-key operation in the priority queue."
