    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected graph into two or more components, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between some pairs of vertices. \n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, a tree with 10 vertices would have 9 edges. Since our graph has 13 edges, it must have at least 4 cycles.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can focus on breaking these cycles. In the worst case, we can break each cycle by removing one edge from it. However, it is possible that removing an edge from one cycle also breaks another cycle. In the best case, we can disconnect the graph by removing one edge from each of the 4 cycles, but with the possibility that one edge removal affects two cycles.\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that must be removed from G to disconnect it into two or more components is 2."
