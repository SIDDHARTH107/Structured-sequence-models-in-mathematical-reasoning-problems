We will consider the three cases mentioned: C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, and the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\n1. C18: The cyclic group of order 18\nIf G is isomorphic to C18, then G must also be a cyclic group of order 18. In this case, there is only one possible isomorphism, as all cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic to each other. The isomorphism can be given by the mapping φ: G → C18, where φ(g) = g^k for some integer k relatively prime to 18.\n\n2. Non-abelian group of order 18\nThere is only one non-abelian group of order 18, which is the semidirect product of Z9 and Z2, denoted as Z9 ⋊ Z2. If G is isomorphic to this non-abelian group, then G must have a normal subgroup of order 9 and a subgroup of order 2. By the Sylow theorems, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which must be normal. Let N be this normal subgroup of order 9. Then G/N has order 2, and G can be expressed as a semidirect product of N and G/N. In this case, there is only one possible isomorphism, given by the mapping φ: G → Z9 ⋊ Z2, where φ preserves the group operation of the semidirect product.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6\nIf G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, then G must be isomorphic to C3 × C6 or C3 × S3 (since C6 and S3 are the only groups of order 6). In both cases, G must have a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which must be normal. Let N1 be this normal subgroup of order 3. Then G/N1 has order 6, and G can be expressed as a direct product of N1 and G/N1. If G/N1 is isomorphic to C6, then G is isomorphic to C3 × C6, and the isomorphism can be given by the mapping φ: G → C3 × C6, where φ preserves the group operation of the direct product. If G/N1 is isomorphic to S3, then G is isomorphic to C3 × S3, and the isomorphism can be given by the mapping φ: G → C3 × S3, where φ preserves the group operation of the direct product.\n\nIn conclusion, there are four possible isomorphisms for a group of order 18: one to the cyclic group C18, one to the non-abelian group of order 18 (Z9 ⋊ Z2), one to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 6 (C3 × C6), and one to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the symmetric group of order 6 (C3 × S3)."
