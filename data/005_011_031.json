    "message_1": "A researcher wants to study the effect of sunlight exposure on plant growth. The researcher randomly selects 20 plants and divides them into two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A was placed in a room with natural sunlight exposure, while Group B was placed in a room with artificial light exposure. After 4 weeks, the researcher recorded the height (in centimeters) of each plant. The data is given below:\n\nGroup A: 10, 15, 14, 13, 12, 19, 17, 16, 18, 20\nGroup B: 6, 8, 5, 9, 10, 7, 4, 7, 6, 8\n\nCalculate the mean, median, and mode of the plant heights for each group. Which group had the higher mean and median? Is the mode a useful measure of central tendency in this case? Why or why not?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the mean, median, and mode for each group.\n\nGroup A:\nMean: (10 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 19 + 17 + 16 + 18 + 20) / 10 = 154 / 10 = 15.4\nTo find the median, we first need to order the data: 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\nMedian: (15 + 16) / 2 = 31 / 2 = 15.5\nMode: There is no mode, as each value appears only once.\n\nGroup B:\nMean: (6 + 8 + 5 + 9 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 8) / 10 = 70 / 10 = 7\nTo find the median, we first need to order the data: 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10\nMedian: (7 + 7) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\nMode: 6, 7, and 8 (each appears twice)\n\nNow let's compare the mean and median of each group. Group A has a higher mean (15.4) and median (15.5) than Group B (mean: 7, median: 7).\n\nAs for the mode, it is not a useful measure of central tendency in this case. In Group A, there is no mode, and in Group B, there are three modes (6, 7, and 8), which doesn't provide a clear single value to represent the central tendency. The mean and median are more informative in this case."
