    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth, we can use the fact that a complete graph with n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges. \n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges a graph with 12 vertices can have without having a cycle of length 3. We can do this by considering a bipartite graph, which is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. A bipartite graph cannot have a cycle of odd length, so it cannot have a cycle of length 3.\n\nLet the two disjoint sets have a and b vertices, respectively. The maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph is a*b. Since a + b = 12, we want to maximize a*b subject to this constraint. The maximum value occurs when a = 6 and b = 6, in which case a*b = 6*6 = 36.\n\nHowever, our graph has only 21 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with 12 vertices. This means that our graph must have a cycle of length 3. Therefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
