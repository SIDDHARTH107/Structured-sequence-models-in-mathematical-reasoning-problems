    "message_1": "A party has 10 guests and you want to create different seating arrangements for them at a round table. How many distinct ways can you seat the guests if rotations are considered the same? (Hint: Use Bell numbers to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of circular permutations. In a circular permutation, we consider the arrangements of objects around a circle, where rotations are considered the same.\n\nFor a round table with n guests, there are (n-1)! distinct ways to seat the guests, since we can fix one guest and arrange the remaining (n-1) guests in a linear fashion.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 guests, so there are (10-1)! = 9! ways to seat the guests.\n\n9! = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880\n\nSo, there are 362,880 distinct ways to seat the 10 guests at a round table, considering rotations as the same."
