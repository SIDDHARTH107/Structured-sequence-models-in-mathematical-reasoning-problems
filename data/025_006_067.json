    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the first cohomology group $H^1(X, \\mathbb{F}_3)$, we can use the fact that for a smooth projective curve $X$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathbb{F}_q)$ is equal to the genus of the curve.\n\nFirst, we need to determine if the curve $X$ is smooth. The partial derivatives of the defining equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3z^2$\n\nThe curve is singular if and only if all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. However, since we are working over $\\mathbb{F}_3$, the only solutions to $3x^2 = 3y^2 = 3z^2 = 0$ are $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$, which is not a point in the projective plane. Therefore, the curve $X$ is smooth.\n\nNow, we need to compute the genus of the curve. The degree of the curve is $d = 3$, and since it is a plane curve, we can use the formula for the genus:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2} = \\frac{(3 - 1)(3 - 2)}{2} = 1$\n\nThus, the genus of the curve $X$ is $1$. Since the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathbb{F}_3)$ is equal to the genus, we have:\n\n$\\dim H^1(X, \\mathbb{F}_3) = 1$"
