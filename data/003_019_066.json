    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin^2(x)dx from 0 to π/2, we can use the power reduction formula:\n\nsin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n∫(1 - cos(2x))/2 dx from 0 to π/2\n\nLet's break this into two separate integrals:\n\n(1/2)∫(1 dx) - (1/2)∫(cos(2x) dx) from 0 to π/2\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n(1/2)[x] - (1/2)[(1/2)sin(2x)] from 0 to π/2\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\n(1/2)[(π/2) - 0] - (1/2)[(1/2)sin(π) - (1/2)sin(0)]\n\n(1/2)(π/2) - (1/2)(0 - 0)\n\n(π/4)\n\nSo, the integral of sin^2(x)dx from 0 to π/2 is π/4."
