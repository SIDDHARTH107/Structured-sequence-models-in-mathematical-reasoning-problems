    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 4| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 4 is positive or zero, so the equation becomes:\n3x - 4 = 7\n\nNow, solve for x:\n3x = 11\nx = 11/3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 4 is negative, so the equation becomes:\n-(3x - 4) = 7\n\nNow, solve for x:\n3x - 4 = -7\n3x = -3\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 11/3 and -1."
