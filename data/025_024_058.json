    "message_1": "Consider a projective variety $V$ given by the zero locus of the polynomials $f_1 = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $f_2 = xy$. Let $G = (\\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ act on $V$ by $(t,u)\\cdot[x:y:z] = [tx:uy:z]$. What is the dimension of the vector space $H^0(V/G, \\mathcal{O}_{V/G})$ of global regular functions on the quotient variety $V/G$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space $H^0(V/G, \\mathcal{O}_{V/G})$, we first need to understand the quotient variety $V/G$. Since $G = (\\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ acts on $V$ by $(t,u)\\cdot[x:y:z] = [tx:uy:z]$, the action is linear and the quotient variety can be described as the GIT quotient $V//G$.\n\nThe GIT quotient can be computed using the Hilbert-Mumford numerical criterion. For this, we need to find the semi-stable points of $V$ under the action of $G$. A point $[x:y:z] \\in V$ is semi-stable if and only if there exists a one-parameter subgroup $\\lambda: \\mathbb{C}^* \\to G$ such that the limit $\\lim_{t \\to 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot [x:y:z]$ exists in $V$.\n\nLet $\\lambda(t) = (t^a, t^b)$ be a one-parameter subgroup of $G$. Then the action of $\\lambda(t)$ on $[x:y:z]$ is given by $\\lambda(t) \\cdot [x:y:z] = [t^a x: t^b y: z]$. The limit $\\lim_{t \\to 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot [x:y:z]$ exists if and only if $a \\geq 0$ and $b \\geq 0$. Therefore, the semi-stable points of $V$ are those for which $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the GIT quotient $V//G$. Since $V$ is defined by the equations $f_1 = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ and $f_2 = xy$, the quotient variety $V//G$ is defined by the same equations, but with the condition that $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$. Thus, $V//G$ is isomorphic to the affine variety defined by the equations $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ and $xy \\neq 0$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the dimension of the vector space $H^0(V//G, \\mathcal{O}_{V//G})$. Since $V//G$ is an affine variety, the global regular functions on $V//G$ are just the regular functions on the coordinate ring of $V//G$. The coordinate ring of $V//G$ is the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(x^2 + y^2 - z^2)$, and the global regular functions are the elements of this ring that are invariant under the action of $G$.\n\nHowever, since $G$ acts on $V$ by scaling the coordinates $x$ and $y$, the only invariant polynomials are the constants. Therefore, the dimension of the vector space $H^0(V//G, \\mathcal{O}_{V//G})$ is 1."
