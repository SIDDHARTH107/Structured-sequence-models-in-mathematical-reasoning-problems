    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, and its perimeter increases with each iteration. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = P * (N ^ I)\n\nwhere P is the initial perimeter, N is the scaling factor, and I is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, the initial perimeter P is 4 (since it starts as a square with side length 1), and the scaling factor N is 3 (since each side is divided into 3 segments, with the middle segment replaced by two segments of equal length).\n\nSo, for the 5th iteration, we have:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (3 ^ 5)\nPerimeter = 4 * (243)\nPerimeter = 972\n\nThe perimeter of the 5th iteration of the Vicsek fractal with a side length of 1 is 972."
