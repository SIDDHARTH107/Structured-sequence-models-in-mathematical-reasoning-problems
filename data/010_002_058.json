    "message_2": "To find the limit of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ as $n$ approaches infinity, we need to analyze the behavior of the terms $a_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ for large values of $n$.\n\nNotice that the sequence alternates in sign due to the $(-1)^n$ term. However, as $n$ gets larger, the magnitude of the terms $\\frac{1}{n}$ gets smaller and approaches 0.\n\nFormally, we can use the definition of the limit:\n\nFor any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we need to find an $N$ such that for all $n > N$, we have $|a_n - L| < \\epsilon$, where $L$ is the limit.\n\nIn this case, we want to show that $L = 0$. So, we need to show that for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n > N$, we have $|a_n - 0| = \\left|\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\\right| < \\epsilon$.\n\nSince $\\left|\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\\right| = \\frac{1}{n}$, we can choose $N$ such that $\\frac{1}{N} < \\epsilon$. For example, we can choose $N = \\left\\lceil\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right\\rceil$, where $\\lceil x \\rceil$ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$. Then, for all $n > N$, we have $\\frac{1}{n} < \\frac{1}{N} < \\epsilon$, which implies that $\\left|\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\\right| < \\epsilon$.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ as $n$ approaches infinity is 0. In mathematical notation, we write:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n} = 0.$$"
