    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + ((3/2) * x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (9/4) * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du. The new limits of integration will be u(1) = 1 + (9/4)(1) = 13/4 and u(4) = 1 + (9/4)(4) = 10.\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nL = ∫[13/4, 10] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to u:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [13/4, 10]\n\nL = (8/27) * (u^(3/2)) | [13/4, 10]\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - (13/4)^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * (20√2 - 13√13/8)\n\nL ≈ 4.61 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 4.61."
