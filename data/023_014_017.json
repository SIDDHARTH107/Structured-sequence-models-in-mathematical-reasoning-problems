Given the wave function: \n\nψ(x) = (1/π)^(1/4) * e^(-x^2/2) \n\nwhere x is in meters and Planck's constant h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J s.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the wave function, we use the following formula:\n\nΦ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * ∫[ψ(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over all x from -∞ to +∞.\n\nGiven the wave function:\n\nψ(x) = (1/π)^(1/4) * e^(-x^2/2)\n\nWe plug this into the Fourier transform formula:\n\nΦ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * ∫[((1/π)^(1/4) * e^(-x^2/2)) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can simplify the integral by combining the exponentials:\n\nΦ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * (1/π)^(1/4) * ∫[e^(-x^2/2 - ikx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x^2/2 - ikx = -1/2 * (x^2 + 2ikx) = -1/2 * (x + ik)^2 + k^2/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nΦ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * (1/π)^(1/4) * e^(k^2/2) * ∫[e^(-1/2 * (x + ik)^2)] dx\n\nThis integral is a Gaussian integral, which has the solution:\n\n∫[e^(-ax^2)] dx = √(π/a)\n\nIn our case, a = 1/2, so the integral evaluates to:\n\n∫[e^(-1/2 * (x + ik)^2)] dx = √(π/(1/2)) = √(2π)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for Φ(k):\n\nΦ(k) = (1/√(2π)) * (1/π)^(1/4) * e^(k^2/2) * √(2π)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nΦ(k) = (1/π)^(1/4) * e^(k^2/2)\n\nNow, we can find the probability distribution of momentum in the system. The probability density function for momentum is given by the square of the absolute value of the Fourier transform of the wave function:\n\nP(k) = |Φ(k)|^2\n\nFor our Φ(k):\n\nP(k) = |(1/π)^(1/4) * e^(k^2/2)|^2 = ((1/π)^(1/4))^2 * |e^(k^2/2)|^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nP(k) = (1/π) * e^(k^2)\n\nTo find the momentum, we need to convert the wave number k to momentum p using the relation p = ħk, where ħ = h/(2π) is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nLet p = ħk, then k = p/ħ. Substituting this into the probability density function:\n\nP(p) = (1/π) * e^((p/ħ)^2)\n\nThis is the probability distribution of momentum in the system."
