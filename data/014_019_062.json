    "message_1": "Consider a plaintext message with 64 characters. The message is encrypted using a transposition cipher with a key of length 8. How many possible keys can be used to encrypt this message?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with a key of length 8 means that the plaintext message is divided into blocks of 8 characters each, and the characters within each block are rearranged according to the key. Since there are 8 characters in each block, there are 8! (8 factorial) ways to rearrange them.\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n\nSo, there are 40,320 possible keys that can be used to encrypt this message using a transposition cipher with a key of length 8."
