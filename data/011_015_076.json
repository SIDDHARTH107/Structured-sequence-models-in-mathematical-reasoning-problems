    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to find 3 people who are all friends with each other or 3 people who are all strangers to each other in a group of 6 people. This can be demonstrated using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nLet's label the people A, B, C, D, E, and F. We will start with person A. There are 5 other people in the group, so person A must either be friends with at least 3 of them or be strangers with at least 3 of them (due to the Pigeonhole Principle).\n\nCase 1: Person A is friends with at least 3 people.\nLet's assume person A is friends with B, C, and D. If any one of B, C, or D is friends with both of the other two, then we have a group of 3 friends (A, B, C, or D). If none of B, C, or D are friends with each other, then we have a group of 3 strangers (B, C, and D).\n\nCase 2: Person A is strangers with at least 3 people.\nLet's assume person A is strangers with B, C, and D. If any one of B, C, or D is strangers with both of the other two, then we have a group of 3 strangers (A, B, C, or D). If none of B, C, or D are strangers with each other, then we have a group of 3 friends (B, C, and D).\n\nIn both cases, we can find a group of 3 people who are either all friends or all strangers."
