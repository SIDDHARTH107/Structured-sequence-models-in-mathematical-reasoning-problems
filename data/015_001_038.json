    "message_2": "In the Lorenz system, the smallest value of the parameter 'r' (also known as the Rayleigh number) for which the system exhibits chaotic behavior is approximately r = 24.74. This value is known as the critical value, and when r exceeds this threshold, the system transitions from stable fixed points to chaotic behavior."
