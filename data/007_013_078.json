    "message_2": "Goldbach's conjecture, proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true in all tested cases. However, the conjecture has not been proven or disproven, so there is no known smallest even integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers according to Goldbach's conjecture."
