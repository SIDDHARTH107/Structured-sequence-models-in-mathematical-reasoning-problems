    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the space obtained by removing the origin from the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we can use the fact that this space is homeomorphic to the punctured plane, which is the plane with one point removed. Let's denote this space as $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{0\\}$.\n\nConsider the polar coordinate transformation $(r, \\theta) \\mapsto (r e^{i\\theta}, r)$, where $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. This transformation is a homeomorphism between $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{0\\}$ and the product space $(0, \\infty) \\times S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle.\n\nNow, we know that the fundamental group of the product space is the direct product of the fundamental groups of the individual spaces, i.e., $\\pi_1((0, \\infty) \\times S^1) = \\pi_1(0, \\infty) \\times \\pi_1(S^1)$.\n\nThe fundamental group of $(0, \\infty)$ is trivial, as it is contractible to a point. The fundamental group of $S^1$ is isomorphic to the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, as it is well-known that the loops around the circle can be classified by the number of times they wind around the circle (with positive and negative integers representing clockwise and counterclockwise windings, respectively).\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the punctured plane $\\mathbb{R}^2 - \\{0\\}$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the product space $(0, \\infty) \\times S^1$, which is $\\pi_1(0, \\infty) \\times \\pi_1(S^1) = \\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
