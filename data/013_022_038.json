    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 has $20 to decide how much to give to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, then they will each receive the agreed upon amounts. If Player 2 rejects the offer, then both players receive nothing. What is the optimal amount that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player 1 has full control over the division of the $20, and Player 2 has no power to reject the offer. Therefore, to maximize their own payoff, Player 1 can offer the smallest possible amount to Player 2 (e.g., $0.01) and keep the rest for themselves. In this case, Player 1 would keep $19.99, and Player 2 would receive $0.01. Since Player 2 cannot reject the offer, this would be the optimal amount for Player 1 to offer in order to maximize their own payoff."
