    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3), G is a p-group. In this case, p = 3.\n\nNow, let's use the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible values of n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, since n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3, the only possible value for n_3 is 1.\n\nThis means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in G, and by the Sylow theorems, this subgroup must be normal. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P is a normal subgroup of G and has order 9 (3^2), G/P is a group of order 3.\n\nNow, consider the group G/P. Since G/P has order 3, which is prime, G/P is a cyclic group. This means that G is an extension of the cyclic group of order 3 by the normal subgroup P.\n\nSince P is a normal subgroup of G with order 9, P is also a p-group with p = 3. By the same argument as before, P must have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Thus, P is an extension of the cyclic group of order 3 by the normal subgroup Q.\n\nNow, we have that G is an extension of a cyclic group of order 3 by a group P, which is itself an extension of a cyclic group of order 3 by a normal subgroup Q. This means that G can be constructed as a semidirect product of P and the cyclic group of order 3.\n\nHowever, since P is abelian (being a group of order 9, which is a prime power), the semidirect product is actually a direct product. This means that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and the cyclic group of order 3, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, and not the non-abelian group of order 27."
