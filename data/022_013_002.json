    "message_2": "To find the derivative of a complex function, we can treat the real and imaginary parts separately. The function f(z) can be written as:\n\nf(z) = 3z + 2i = 3(x + yi) + 2i = 3x + 3yi + 2i = (3x) + (3y + 2)i\n\nwhere z = x + yi, x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(z) with respect to z:\n\nf'(z) = d(3x)/dx + d(3y + 2)i/dx = 3 + 3i(dy/dx)\n\nSince f(z) is an analytic function, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nwhere u(x, y) = 3x is the real part and v(x, y) = 3y + 2 is the imaginary part of f(z).\n\nApplying the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = 3 = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = 0 = -∂v/∂x\n\nFrom the first equation, we have ∂v/∂y = 3, which implies that v(x, y) = 3y + 2 (as given). From the second equation, we have ∂v/∂x = 0, which implies that v(x, y) does not depend on x (which is also true).\n\nSince f(z) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we can conclude that f'(z) = 3 + 3i(dy/dx) = 3.\n\nNow, we can find the derivative f'(z) at z = 1 + i:\n\nf'(1 + i) = 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) at z = 1 + i is 3."
