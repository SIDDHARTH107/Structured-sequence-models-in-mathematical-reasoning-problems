    "message_1": "Given the following information, use non-monotonic logic to determine if the conclusion is true or false:\n\n- All birds can fly.\n- A penguin is a bird.\n- A penguin cannot fly.\n\nConclusion: A penguin can fly.\n\nIs the conclusion true or false? Provide an explanation for your answer.",
    "message_2": "The conclusion is false. Using non-monotonic logic, we can revise our initial assumption that \"all birds can fly\" when presented with new information. In this case, the new information is that \"a penguin cannot fly.\" Since a penguin is a bird and it cannot fly, it contradicts the initial assumption. Therefore, the conclusion that \"a penguin can fly\" is false."
