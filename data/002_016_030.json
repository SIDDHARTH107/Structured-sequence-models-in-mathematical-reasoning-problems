    "message_2": "In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are of equal length. To find the length of a side, simply divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nPerimeter = 15 cm\nNumber of sides = 3\n\nLength of a side = Perimeter / Number of sides = 15 cm / 3 = 5 cm\n\nThe length of a side in the equilateral triangle is 5 cm."
