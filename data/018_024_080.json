    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A, denoted as A'. The complement of A is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. Since the universal set is not specified, we can assume it to be the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nA' = {5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and A', denoted as (A Δ B) ∆ A'.\n\n(A Δ B) ∆ A' = {1}\n\nNow, let's try to distribute the symmetric difference over the complement and see if it holds true. We want to check if (A Δ B) ∆ A' = (A ∆ A') Δ (B ∆ A').\n\nFirst, let's find A ∆ A':\n\nA ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find B ∆ A':\n\nB ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ A') and (B ∆ A'):\n\n(A ∆ A') Δ (B ∆ A') = {5}\n\nSince (A Δ B) ∆ A' = {1} and (A ∆ A') Δ (B ∆ A') = {5}, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement using this example."
