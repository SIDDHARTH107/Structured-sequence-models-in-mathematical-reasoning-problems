    "message_1": "In a game of Nim, there are two players and a pile of 27 stones. On each turn, a player must remove at least one stone but no more than six stones from the pile. The player who takes the last stone wins. If the players start the game optimally, who will win the game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the winner, we can use the concept of Nim-values or Grundy numbers. The Nim-value of a position in a game is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set of Nim-values of its possible next positions. In this case, the possible next positions are determined by the number of stones a player can remove (1 to 6).\n\nLet's denote the Nim-value of a position with n stones as G(n). We have:\n\nG(0) = 0 (no stones left, no moves to make)\n\nFor n > 0, we can calculate G(n) as the smallest non-negative integer not in the set {G(n-1), G(n-2), ..., G(n-6)}.\n\nCalculating the Nim-values for the first few positions:\n\nG(1) = mex{G(0)} = mex{0} = 1\nG(2) = mex{G(1), G(0)} = mex{1, 0} = 2\nG(3) = mex{G(2), G(1), G(0)} = mex{2, 1, 0} = 3\nG(4) = mex{G(3), G(2), G(1), G(0)} = mex{3, 2, 1, 0} = 4\nG(5) = mex{G(4), G(3), G(2), G(1), G(0)} = mex{4, 3, 2, 1, 0} = 5\nG(6) = mex{G(5), G(4), G(3), G(2), G(1), G(0)} = mex{5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0} = 6\nG(7) = mex{G(6), G(5), G(4), G(3), G(2), G(1)} = mex{6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1} = 0\n\nNotice that G(7) = 0, which means that the position with 7 stones is a losing position for the player who is about to move. Since the Nim-values repeat every 7 positions (G(14) = 0, G(21) = 0, etc.), we can conclude that G(27) = 0 as well.\n\nTherefore, if both players play optimally, the first player will lose the game."
