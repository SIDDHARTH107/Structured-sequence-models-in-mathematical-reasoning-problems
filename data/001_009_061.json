In this expression, we have two types of like terms: terms with $x$ and terms with $x^2$.\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms with $x$:\n\n$3x + 4x = 7x$\n\nNext, let's combine the terms with $x^2$:\n\n$-2x^2 - 7x^2 = -9x^2$\n\nFinally, let's combine the constant terms:\n\n$5$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the simplified expression by combining the results:\n\n$7x - 9x^2 + 5$"
