    "message_1": "A town has a total population of 100,000 people, of whom 200 have contracted a virus. Assume that the rate of change of infected people is proportional to the product of the number of infected people and the number of healthy people. If the spread is not controlled, it is predicted that 25% of the population will be infected within the next 6 months. How many people will have been infected at that point, and what will be the total number of healthy and infected people?",
    "message_2": "If 25% of the population is infected within the next 6 months, that means:\n\n0.25 * 100,000 = 25,000 people will be infected.\n\nSince the total population is 100,000, the number of healthy people will be:\n\n100,000 - 25,000 = 75,000 people.\n\nSo, at that point, there will be 25,000 infected people and 75,000 healthy people in the town."
