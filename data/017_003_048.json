    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 17, which is a prime number, we know that G is a cyclic group. This means that there exists an element g in G such that the cyclic subgroup generated by g is equal to G.\n\nTo prove this, let's consider an arbitrary element g in G, where g is not the identity element e. We will show that the cyclic subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, is equal to G.\n\nFirst, let's recall Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of a subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. In our case, the order of G is 17, which is a prime number. Therefore, the order of any subgroup of G must be either 1 or 17.\n\nSince g is not the identity element e, the cyclic subgroup generated by g, <g>, must have an order greater than 1. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of <g> must be 17.\n\nNow, since the order of <g> is 17, and the order of G is also 17, we have |<g>| = |G|. This implies that <g> = G, as there can be no other elements in G that are not in <g>.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists an element g in G such that the cyclic subgroup generated by g is equal to G."
