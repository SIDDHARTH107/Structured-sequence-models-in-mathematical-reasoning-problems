    "message_1": "A researcher wants to investigate the effect of fertilizer on the growth of plants. The researcher decides to conduct an experiment with two types of fertilizer: type A and type B. The researcher randomly assigns 10 plants to each group (fertilizer type A and fertilizer type B) and measures the height of each plant after 4 weeks. The heights of the plants in each group are recorded in the table below:\n\nType A: 12.5, 13, 14, 12, 13.5, 12, 13.5, 14, 11, 12.5\nType B: 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 13, 14.5, 16, 15, 14, 13.5\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of the height of the plants in each group.",
    "message_2": "First, we will calculate the mean of each group:\n\nMean of Type A:\n(12.5 + 13 + 14 + 12 + 13.5 + 12 + 13.5 + 14 + 11 + 12.5) / 10 = 130 / 10 = 13\n\nMean of Type B:\n(14 + 14.5 + 15 + 15.5 + 13 + 14.5 + 16 + 15 + 14 + 13.5) / 10 = 145 / 10 = 14.5\n\nNext, we will calculate the standard deviation of each group:\n\nStandard Deviation of Type A:\n1. Calculate the squared difference between each value and the mean: \n[(12.5-13)^2, (13-13)^2, (14-13)^2, (12-13)^2, (13.5-13)^2, (12-13)^2, (13.5-13)^2, (14-13)^2, (11-13)^2, (12.5-13)^2] = [0.25, 0, 1, 1, 0.25, 1, 0.25, 1, 4, 0.25]\n\n2. Calculate the average of these squared differences: \n(0.25 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0.25 + 1 + 0.25 + 1 + 4 + 0.25) / 10 = 8 / 10 = 0.8\n\n3. Take the square root of the average: \n√0.8 ≈ 0.89\n\nStandard Deviation of Type A ≈ 0.89\n\nStandard Deviation of Type B:\n1. Calculate the squared difference between each value and the mean: \n[(14-14.5)^2, (14.5-14.5)^2, (15-14.5)^2, (15.5-14.5)^2, (13-14.5)^2, (14.5-14.5)^2, (16-14.5)^2, (15-14.5)^2, (14-14.5)^2, (13.5-14.5)^2] = [0.25, 0, 0.25, 1, 2.25, 0, 2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 1]\n\n2. Calculate the average of these squared differences: \n(0.25 + 0 + 0.25 + 1 + 2.25 + 0 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1) / 10 = 7.5 / 10 = 0.75\n\n3. Take the square root of the average: \n√0.75 ≈ 0.87\n\nStandard Deviation of Type B ≈ 0.87\n\nIn summary, the mean height of plants in Type A group is 13, with a standard deviation of approximately 0.89. The mean height of plants in Type B group is 14.5, with a standard deviation of approximately 0.87."
