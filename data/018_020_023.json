The symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference between A and {1, 5}:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nC = {1, 5}\n\nIntersection of A and C, A ∩ C = {1}\n\nA △ C = (A ∪ C) - (A ∩ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1} = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of the two symmetric differences we just found:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ (A △ C) = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSo, the values of (A △ B) ∪ (A △ {1, 5}) are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
