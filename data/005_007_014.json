The data collected is as follows:\n\n| Hours Studied | Grade Obtained |\n|-------|---------|\n| 3     | 70      |\n| 5     | 80      |\n| 2     | 60      |\n| 6     | 85      |\n| 4     | 75      |\n| 7     | 90      |\n| 9     | 95      |\n| 8     | 92      |\n| 1     | 50      |\n| 10    | 98      |\n\nUsing correlation analysis, calculate the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the grades obtained by the students.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between the number of hours studied and the grades obtained, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of x values, and ȳ is the mean of y values.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean of hours studied (x̄) and the mean of grades obtained (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (3 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 10) / 10 = 55 / 10 = 5.5\nȳ = (70 + 80 + 60 + 85 + 75 + 90 + 95 + 92 + 50 + 98) / 10 = 795 / 10 = 79.5\n\nNext, we will calculate the individual terms for the numerator and denominator:\n\n| xi | yi | xi - x̄ | yi - ȳ | (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) | (xi - x̄)² | (yi - ȳ)² |\n|----|----|---------|--------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 3  | 70 | -2.5    | -9.5   | 23.75           | 6.25      | 90.25     |\n| 5  | 80 | -0.5    | 0.5    | -0.25           | 0.25      | 0.25      |\n| 2  | 60 | -3.5    | -19.5  | 68.25           | 12.25     | 380.25    |\n| 6  | 85 | 0.5     | 5.5    | 2.75            | 0.25      | 30.25     |\n| 4  | 75 | -1.5    | -4.5   | 6.75            | 2.25      | 20.25     |\n| 7  | 90 | 1.5     | 10.5   | 15.75           | 2.25      | 110.25    |\n| 9  | 95 | 3.5     | 15.5   | 54.25           | 12.25     | 240.25    |\n| 8  | 92 | 2.5     | 12.5   | 31.25           | 6.25      | 156.25    |\n| 1  | 50 | -4.5    | -29.5  | 132.75          | 20.25     | 870.25    |\n| 10 | 98 | 4.5     | 18.5   | 83.25           | 20.25     | 342.25    |\n\nNow, we will sum up the last three columns:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) = 23.75 - 0.25 + 68.25 + 2.75 + 6.75 + 15.75 + 54.25 + 31.25 + 132.75 + 83.25 = 418.5\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = 6.25 + 0.25 + 12.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 + 12.25 + 6.25 + 20.25 + 20.25 = 82.5\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = 90.25 + 0.25 + 380.25 + 30.25 + 20.25 + 110.25 + 240.25 + 156.25 + 870.25 + 342.25 = 2240.5\n\nFinally, we will calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²] = 418.5 / √(82.5 * 2240.5) ≈ 0.976\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the grades obtained by the students is approximately 0.976, which indicates a strong positive correlation."
