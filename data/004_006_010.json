    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x, we first need to find its first derivative and set it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 36\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 24x + 36\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the entire equation by 3:\n\n0 = x^2 - 8x + 12\n\nNow, we factor the quadratic equation:\n\n0 = (x - 6)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 6.\n\nTo determine whether these critical points are minima or maxima, we need to analyze the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x)\n\nDifferentiating f'(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 36, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 24\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 24 = -12\nf''(6) = 6(6) - 24 = 12\n\nSince f''(2) < 0, the critical point x = 2 is a local maximum.\nSince f''(6) > 0, the critical point x = 6 is a local minimum.\n\nSo, the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x has a local maximum at x = 2 and a local minimum at x = 6."
