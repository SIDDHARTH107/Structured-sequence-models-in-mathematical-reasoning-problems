    "message_2": "Let's represent the given statement using propositional logic symbols:\n\nP: \"I will study mathematics today\"\nQ: \"I will run for 30 minutes today\"\n\nThe statement \"If I study mathematics today, then I will not run for 30 minutes\" can be represented as:\n\nP → ¬Q\n\nTo find the truth value of this statement, we need to know the truth values of P and Q. Since we don't have any information about whether you will study mathematics today or run for 30 minutes, we cannot determine the truth value of the statement P → ¬Q."
