    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. The profits per unit of A and B are $6 and $8, respectively. The company has a production capacity of 150 units per week. Product A requires 2 production hours per unit and product B requires 3 production hours per unit. The company aims to maximize its weekly profits. Using the cuckoo search algorithm, what is the maximum weekly profit the company can make?",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. However, this problem can be solved using linear programming without the need for a metaheuristic algorithm.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the weekly profit is:\n\nProfit = 6x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 150 (total units produced should not exceed 150)\n2. Production hours constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 300 (assuming 150 hours of production per week, as it's not mentioned in the problem)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 150 (boundary line for production capacity constraint)\n2. 2x + 3y = 300 (boundary line for production hours constraint)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 100), (75, 50), and (150, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 6(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 100) = 6(0) + 8(100) = $800\n3. Profit at (75, 50) = 6(75) + 8(50) = $750\n4. Profit at (150, 0) = 6(150) + 8(0) = $900\n\nThe maximum weekly profit is $900 when producing 150 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
