    "message_1": "Consider the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $C_1$ be the curve on this variety defined by the equations $x=0$ and $z=0$, and let $C_2$ be the curve on this variety defined by the equations $y=0$ and $z=0$.\n\nWhat is the intersection number $C_1 \\cdot C_2$ of $C_1$ and $C_2$ on this algebraic variety?",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$, we need to solve the system of equations given by the constraints of both curves and the algebraic variety:\n\n1. $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ (from the algebraic variety)\n2. $x = 0$ (from $C_1$)\n3. $z = 0$ (from $C_1$)\n4. $y = 0$ (from $C_2$)\n5. $z = 0$ (from $C_2$)\n\nSince both $C_1$ and $C_2$ have the constraint $z = 0$, we can focus on the other constraints. Plugging $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the equation of the algebraic variety, we get:\n\n$0^2 + 0^2 + z^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow z^2 = 1$\n\nThis gives us two solutions for $z$: $z = 1$ and $z = -1$. Therefore, there are two intersection points between $C_1$ and $C_2$ on the algebraic variety, and the intersection number $C_1 \\cdot C_2 = 2$."
