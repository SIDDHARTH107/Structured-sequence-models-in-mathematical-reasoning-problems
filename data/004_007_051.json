    "message_2": "To find the derivative of (f∘g)(x) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(x) and the inner function is g(x).\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - x^2) = 6x^2 - 2x\ng'(x) = d/dx (e^(2x+1)) = e^(2x+1) * 2 (using the chain rule)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of (f∘g)(x) with respect to x using the chain rule:\n\n(f∘g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression at x = 0:\n\nf'(g(0)) * g'(0) = f'(e^(2*0+1)) * (2 * e^(2*0+1))\n\nf'(e) * (2 * e)\n\nNow, we need to find f'(e):\n\nf'(e) = 6e^2 - 2e\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our expression for (f∘g)'(0):\n\n(6e^2 - 2e) * (2 * e) = 12e^3 - 4e^2\n\nSo, the derivative of (f∘g)(x) with respect to x at x = 0 is 12e^3 - 4e^2."
