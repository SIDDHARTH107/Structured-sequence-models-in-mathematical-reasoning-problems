    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation: \n\nz = x^2 + y^2\n\nFind the principal curvatures at the point (1, 1, 2).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the surface equation.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^2 + y^2, we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form matrix (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form matrix (L, M, N):\n\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 = 1 + (2 * 1)^2 = 5\nF = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y) = (2 * 1)(2 * 1) = 4\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2 = 1 + (2 * 1)^2 = 5\n\nL = ∂²z/∂x² = 2\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\nN = ∂²z/∂y² = 2\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by solving the characteristic equation of the shape operator matrix:\n\ndet(S - kI) = 0\n\nwhere S is the shape operator matrix and k is the principal curvature. The shape operator matrix is given by:\n\nS = (1 / sqrt(EG - F^2)) * [(LN - M^2), -(LM - FM), -(LN - M^2), (LL - M^2)]\n\nIn our case, EG - F^2 = 5 * 5 - 4 * 4 = 9, so the shape operator matrix is:\n\nS = (1 / 3) * [(2 * 2 - 0), -(0), -(2 * 2 - 0), (2 * 2 - 0)]\nS = (1 / 3) * [4, 0, 4, 4]\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(S - kI) = det([(4/3 - k), 0, 4/3, (4/3 - k)]) = (4/3 - k)^2 - (4/3)^2 = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get two principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = 4/3 + 2/3 = 2\nk2 = 4/3 - 2/3 = 2/3\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 1, 2) are k1 = 2 and k2 = 2/3."
