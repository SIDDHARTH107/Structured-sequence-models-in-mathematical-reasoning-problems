    "message_2": "To minimize the total amount of steel needed to build the cable bridge, we need to find the optimal shape that distributes the weight of the bridge efficiently. A catenary curve is the ideal shape for this purpose, as it is the natural shape formed by a hanging cable under its own weight.\n\nA catenary curve can be described by the equation:\n\ny = a * (cosh(x/a) - 1)\n\nwhere 'a' is a parameter that determines the shape of the curve, 'cosh' is the hyperbolic cosine function, and (x, y) are the coordinates of the points on the curve.\n\nTo find the optimal shape, we need to determine the value of 'a' that minimizes the total length of the cable. The length of the cable can be found by integrating the arc length of the curve over the width of the river:\n\nL = ∫[sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2)] dx from x = -w/2 to w/2\n\nwhere L is the total length of the cable, w is the width of the river (1000 meters), and dy/dx is the derivative of the catenary curve equation with respect to x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the catenary curve equation:\n\ndy/dx = a * sinh(x/a)\n\nNow, we can find the arc length of the curve:\n\nL = ∫[sqrt(1 + (a * sinh(x/a))^2)] dx from x = -w/2 to w/2\n\nTo minimize the total length of the cable, we need to find the value of 'a' that minimizes the integral. This can be done using calculus, specifically the Euler-Lagrange equation. However, this is a complex problem and is typically solved numerically.\n\nOnce the optimal value of 'a' is found, we can calculate the total length of the cable (L) and then multiply it by the maximum weight of steel per meter (5000 kg/m) to find the total amount of steel needed to build the bridge:\n\nTotal steel = L * 5000 kg/m\n\nBy finding the optimal shape of the cable as a catenary curve and minimizing the total length of the cable, we can minimize the total amount of steel needed to build the bridge."
