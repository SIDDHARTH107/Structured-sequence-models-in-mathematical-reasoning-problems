    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Hill cipher, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix K. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is given by (1/determinant) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]], where the determinant is (ad - bc).\n\nFor the given key matrix K = [[3, 4], [2, 5]], the determinant is (3*5 - 4*2) = 7.\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of K:\n\nK_inverse = (1/7) * [[5, -4], [-2, 3]]\n\nK_inverse = [[5/7, -4/7], [-2/7, 3/7]]\n\nNext, we need to convert the encrypted message \"tqjq\" into numerical values using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). \n\ntqjq = [19, 16, 9, 16]\n\nNow, we need to divide the encrypted message into blocks of size 2 (the size of the key matrix):\n\nBlock 1: [19, 16]\nBlock 2: [9, 16]\n\nNow, we will multiply each block by the inverse key matrix K_inverse:\n\nBlock 1: [19, 16] * K_inverse\n= [19*(5/7) + 16*(-4/7), 19*(-2/7) + 16*(3/7)]\n= [15, 4]\n\nBlock 2: [9, 16] * K_inverse\n= [9*(5/7) + 16*(-4/7), 9*(-2/7) + 16*(3/7)]\n= [1, 18]\n\nNow, we have the numerical values of the plaintext message:\n\n[15, 4, 1, 18]\n\nFinally, we convert these numerical values back to letters:\n\n[15, 4, 1, 18] = \"PEAS\"\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext message is \"PEAS\"."
