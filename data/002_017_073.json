    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of these triangles, then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe height of an equilateral triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call the height h and the side length s. In this case, s = 8 cm. We have a right triangle with one side being half of the side length (s/2) and the other side being the height (h).\n\n(s/2)^2 + h^2 = s^2\n(8/2)^2 + h^2 = 8^2\n16 + h^2 = 64\nh^2 = 48\nh = √48\n\nNow we can find the area of one equilateral triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\nArea = (8 * √48) / 2\nArea = 4√48\n\nSince there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon, we multiply the area of one triangle by 6:\n\nTotal area = 6 * 4√48\nTotal area = 24√48 ≈ 139.75 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is approximately 139.75 cm²."
