    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve regarding noncommutative algebraic geometry:\n\nLet R be the noncommutative algebra generated by x and y, subject to the relation xy−yx−x = 0. Let M be the R-module defined by M = R/(x). Determine the dimension dim_K Ext_R^1(M,M), where K is the base field.\n\n(Note: Ext_R^1(M,M), also known as the first Ext group, is a measure of the failure of M to be a projective R-module.)",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of Ext_R^1(M,M), we will use a projective resolution of M and apply the functor Hom_R(-,M). Let P be a projective R-module, and let P_0 and P_1 be the following R-modules:\n\nP_0 = R\nP_1 = R ⊕ R\n\nDefine the R-linear maps d_0: P_1 → P_0 and d_1: P_0 → M as follows:\n\nd_0(x, y) = x - y\nd_1(x) = x mod (x)\n\nWe can check that d_1(d_0(x, y)) = 0, so we have a chain complex:\n\n0 → M → P_0 → P_1 → 0\n\nNow, we apply the functor Hom_R(-,M) to this chain complex:\n\n0 → Hom_R(M,M) → Hom_R(P_0,M) → Hom_R(P_1,M) → 0\n\nSince P_0 and P_1 are projective, the sequence is exact. We can compute the dimensions of the Hom spaces:\n\ndim_K Hom_R(M,M) = 1 (the identity map)\ndim_K Hom_R(P_0,M) = 1 (the map sending x to 0)\ndim_K Hom_R(P_1,M) = 2 (the maps sending (x,0) to 0 and (0,y) to y mod (x))\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of Ext_R^1(M,M) using the long exact sequence in Ext:\n\nExt_R^1(M,M) = Ker(Hom_R(P_1,M) → Hom_R(P_0,M)) / Im(Hom_R(M,M) → Hom_R(P_1,M))\n\nThe kernel of the map Hom_R(P_1,M) → Hom_R(P_0,M) consists of the maps sending (x,0) to 0, which has dimension 1. The image of the map Hom_R(M,M) → Hom_R(P_1,M) is trivial since the identity map on M cannot be extended to a map from P_1 to M. Therefore, the dimension of Ext_R^1(M,M) is:\n\ndim_K Ext_R^1(M,M) = 1 - 0 = 1"
