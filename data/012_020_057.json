    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency structure of the graph. In other words, we need to find all the vertex permutations that, when applied to the adjacency matrix, result in the same adjacency matrix.\n\nLet's label the vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6. We can see that the graph has the following structure:\n\n- v1 is connected to v2, v5, and v6.\n- v2 is connected to v1, v3, and v4.\n- v3 is connected to v2, v4, and v5.\n- v4 is connected to v2, v3, and v6.\n- v5 is connected to v1, v3, and v6.\n- v6 is connected to v1, v4, and v5.\n\nNow, let's look for automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself, is always present. This corresponds to the permutation (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6).\n\n2. We can swap v1 and v2, and at the same time swap v5 and v6. This corresponds to the permutation (1 2)(3)(4)(5 6).\n\n3. We can swap v3 and v4, and at the same time swap v5 and v6. This corresponds to the permutation (1)(2)(3 4)(5 6).\n\n4. We can swap v1 and v2, and at the same time swap v3 and v4. This corresponds to the permutation (1 2)(3 4)(5)(6).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is the group generated by these permutations, which can be represented as:\n\nAut(G) = { (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), (1 2)(3)(4)(5 6), (1)(2)(3 4)(5 6), (1 2)(3 4)(5)(6) }"
