    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable vector, and b is the constant vector.\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |\n    | 1  3  2 |\n    | 1  2  5 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 10 |\n    | 20 |\n    | 30 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T.\n\nUsing Cholesky decomposition, we get:\n\nL = | sqrt(2)       0       0 |\n    | 1/sqrt(2)  sqrt(8/2)  0 |\n    | 1/sqrt(2)    1/2    sqrt(21/4) |\n\nL^T = | sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2) |\n      |   0     sqrt(8/2)    1/2      |\n      |   0       0        sqrt(21/4) |\n\nNow, we solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| sqrt(2)       0       0 | | y1 |   | 10 |\n| 1/sqrt(2)  sqrt(8/2)  0 | | y2 | = | 20 |\n| 1/sqrt(2)    1/2    sqrt(21/4) | | y3 |   | 30 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 10/sqrt(2) = 5sqrt(2)\ny2 = (20 - 5sqrt(2))/sqrt(8/2) = 5\ny3 = (30 - 5sqrt(2) - 5/2)/sqrt(21/4) = 2\n\nNow, we solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n| sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2) | | x |   | 5sqrt(2) |\n|   0     sqrt(8/2)    1/2      | | y | = |    5     |\n|   0       0        sqrt(21/4) | | z |   |    2     |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = (5sqrt(2) - 5/sqrt(2) - 2/sqrt(2))/sqrt(2) = 1\ny = (5 - 2/2)/sqrt(8/2) = 2\nz = 2/sqrt(21/4) = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
