    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a right circular cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe area of one circular base can be found using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA = π(3 cm)² = 9π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 9π cm² = 18π cm².\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula: A = 2πrh, where A is the lateral surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nA = 2π(3 cm)(10 cm) = 60π cm²\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the area of the bases and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 18π cm² + 60π cm² = 78π cm² ≈ 244.82 cm²"
