    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log(x + 5) - log(x - 3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the quotient rule for logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog((x + 5)/(x - 3)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log_b(x) = y, then b^y = x. Since the base of the logarithm is not specified, we assume it to be base 10. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n10^2 = (x + 5)/(x - 3)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n100 = (x + 5)/(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x - 3):\n\n100(x - 3) = x + 5\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n100x - 300 = x + 5\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n99x - 300 = 5\n\nAdd 300 to both sides:\n\n99x = 305\n\nNow, divide by 99:\n\nx = 305/99\n\nx ≈ 3.08\n\nSo, the solution to the logarithmic equation is x ≈ 3.08."
