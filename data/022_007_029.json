    "message_2": "To show that $f(z)$ must be a constant function, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function is constant.\n\nFirst, let's consider the function $g(z) = e^{-z}f(z)$. Since $f(z)$ is entire and $e^{-z}$ is entire, their product $g(z)$ is also entire.\n\nNow, we will show that $g(z)$ is bounded. For all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we have:\n\n$$|g(z)| = |e^{-z}f(z)| = |e^{-z}||f(z)| \\leq |e^{-z}|(5e^{\\Re(z)}) = 5|e^{-z}e^{\\Re(z)}| = 5|e^{\\Re(z)-z}|.$$\n\nSince $\\Re(z) - z = -\\Im(z)i$, we have:\n\n$$|e^{\\Re(z)-z}| = |e^{-\\Im(z)i}| = |e^{-yi}| = 1,$$\n\nwhere $y = \\Im(z)$. This is because the magnitude of a complex number on the unit circle is 1, and $e^{-yi}$ lies on the unit circle for any real $y$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$$|g(z)| \\leq 5|e^{\\Re(z)-z}| = 5.$$\n\nSo, $g(z)$ is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, $g(z)$ must be a constant function, i.e., $g(z) = c$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$$c = g(z) = e^{-z}f(z) \\Rightarrow f(z) = ce^{z}.$$\n\nSince $c$ is a constant, $f(z)$ is a constant times an exponential function. However, we are given that $|f(z)| \\leq 5e^{\\Re(z)}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This inequality implies that the exponential part of $f(z)$ must be \"absorbed\" by the constant part, meaning that $c$ must be zero. Therefore, $f(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and $f(z)$ is a constant function."
