    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products, A and B, with the following profits per unit sold:\n\n(Product A) Profit = $50 - $0.5(x + y)\n(Product B) Profit = $60 - $0.6(x + y)\n\nwhere x and y are the number of units of products A and B produced, respectively. However, the company also has the following constraints:\n\n- It can produce up to 200 units in total (x + y ≤ 200)\n- It must produce at least 30 units of product A (x ≥ 30)\n- It must produce at least 40 units of product B (y ≥ 40)\n\nWhat is the optimal production output for the two products that will maximize the profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of linear programming. First, let's rewrite the constraints in a standard form:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200\n2. x ≥ 30\n3. y ≥ 40\n\nNow, let's find the feasible region by graphing these constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 200 is a straight line with intercepts (200, 0) and (0, 200). The feasible region is below this line.\n2. x = 30 is a vertical line. The feasible region is to the right of this line.\n3. y = 40 is a horizontal line. The feasible region is above this line.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices A(30, 40), B(30, 160), C(120, 80), and D(170, 30).\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function P(x, y) and evaluate it at each vertex:\n\nP(x, y) = 50x - 0.5x^2 - 0.5xy + 60y - 0.6x^2 - 0.6xy\nP(x, y) = 50x + 60y - 1.1x^2 - 1.1xy\n\nNow, let's evaluate P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(30, 40) = 50(30) + 60(40) - 1.1(30)^2 - 1.1(30)(40) = 1500 + 2400 - 990 - 1320 = 1590\nP(30, 160) = 50(30) + 60(160) - 1.1(30)^2 - 1.1(30)(160) = 1500 + 9600 - 990 - 5280 = 4830\nP(120, 80) = 50(120) + 60(80) - 1.1(120)^2 - 1.1(120)(80) = 6000 + 4800 - 15840 - 10560 = -7600\nP(170, 30) = 50(170) + 60(30) - 1.1(170)^2 - 1.1(170)(30) = 8500 + 1800 - 31850 - 5610 = -23160\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B(30, 160) with a profit of $4,830. So, the company should produce 30 units of product A and 160 units of product B to maximize its profit."
