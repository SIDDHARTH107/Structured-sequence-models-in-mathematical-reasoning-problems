    "message_2": "To determine whether f is uniformly continuous on X, we need to show that for any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x, y in X, if |x - y| < δ, then |f(x) - f(y)| < ε.\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. We want to find a δ > 0 such that for all x, y in X, if |x - y| < δ, then |f(x) - f(y)| < ε. Since f(x) = x^2, we have:\n\n|f(x) - f(y)| = |x^2 - y^2| = |(x - y)(x + y)|.\n\nWe know that x, y are in the interval [0, 1], so x + y is in the interval [0, 2]. Therefore, |x + y| ≤ 2. Now, we can bound |f(x) - f(y)| as follows:\n\n|f(x) - f(y)| = |(x - y)(x + y)| ≤ |x - y| * 2.\n\nNow, we want to find a δ > 0 such that if |x - y| < δ, then |f(x) - f(y)| < ε. From the inequality above, we can choose δ = ε/2. Then, if |x - y| < δ, we have:\n\n|f(x) - f(y)| ≤ 2 * |x - y| < 2 * (ε/2) = ε.\n\nThus, for any ε > 0, we have found a δ > 0 (in this case, δ = ε/2) such that for all x, y in X, if |x - y| < δ, then |f(x) - f(y)| < ε. Therefore, f is uniformly continuous on X."
