Prove that Y is both connected and path-connected.\n\nQuestion: Let Y be a subset of R^2 defined by Y = {(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 ≤ 1}, is Y connected and path-connected?",
    "message_2": "Proof that Y is connected:\n\nAssume for contradiction that Y is not connected. Then there exist nonempty open sets A and B in the subspace topology of Y such that Y = A ∪ B and A ∩ B = ∅. Define a function f: Y → {0, 1} as follows:\n\nf(y) = 0 if y ∈ A\nf(y) = 1 if y ∈ B\n\nSince A and B are open in the subspace topology of Y, f is continuous. However, this contradicts the given condition that every continuous function from Y to the discrete space with two points is constant. Therefore, Y must be connected.\n\nProof that Y is path-connected:\n\nLet x, y ∈ Y. We will show that there exists a continuous function g: [0, 1] → Y such that g(0) = x and g(1) = y. Define g(t) = (1-t)x + ty. Since Y is convex, the line segment between x and y is contained in Y. Therefore, g(t) ∈ Y for all t ∈ [0, 1]. It is clear that g is continuous, g(0) = x, and g(1) = y. Thus, Y is path-connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific subset Y = {(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 ≤ 1} of R^2. This is the closed unit disk in R^2. Since every continuous function from Y to the discrete space with two points is constant, by the above proof, Y is connected and path-connected."
