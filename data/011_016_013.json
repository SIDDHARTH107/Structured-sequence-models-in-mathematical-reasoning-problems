    "message_1": "In a school, there are 20 students participating in a debate competition. The judges have to rank the students from first to fifth place. In how many ways can the judges rank the students if there must be a tie for the first place among 3 students?",
    "message_2": "If there must be a tie for the first place among 3 students, we first need to choose which 3 students will be tied for the first place. There are 20 students, so we can choose 3 students in C(20, 3) ways, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. \n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3! * (20-3)!) = 20! / (3! * 17!) = 1140 ways\n\nNow, we have 17 students left to rank from second to fifth place. We need to choose 4 students from the remaining 17 students to fill these positions. We can do this in C(17, 4) ways:\n\nC(17, 4) = 17! / (4! * (17-4)!) = 17! / (4! * 13!) = 2380 ways\n\nFinally, we need to arrange these 4 students in the 2nd to 5th positions. Since there are 4 positions and 4 students, we can arrange them in 4! ways:\n\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose the tied students, the number of ways to choose the remaining students, and the number of ways to arrange the remaining students:\n\nTotal ways = 1140 (ways to choose tied students) * 2380 (ways to choose remaining students) * 24 (ways to arrange remaining students) = 65,059,200 ways\n\nSo, the judges can rank the students in 65,059,200 ways if there must be a tie for the first place among 3 students."
