    "message_2": "Using abductive logic, we can infer the most likely conclusion based on the given premises. In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. All cats are animals.\n2. All animals have four legs.\n\nNow, let's consider a numerical example:\n\nSuppose we have 10 cats. Since all cats are animals (according to premise 1), we can say that these 10 cats are also 10 animals. According to premise 2, all animals have four legs. Therefore, these 10 animals (which are also 10 cats) must have four legs each.\n\nSo, based on the given premises and our numerical example, we can conclude that all cats have four legs."
