    "message_2": "A 2-dimensional simplex is a triangle formed by connecting three vertices with three edges. In a simplicial complex with 4 vertices and 4 edges, we need to determine the number of triangles that can be formed.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, and D. We can form triangles by selecting any three vertices and checking if the edges connecting them are present in the complex.\n\n1. Triangle ABC: This triangle can be formed if edges AB, BC, and AC are present in the complex.\n2. Triangle ABD: This triangle can be formed if edges AB, BD, and AD are present in the complex.\n3. Triangle ACD: This triangle can be formed if edges AC, CD, and AD are present in the complex.\n4. Triangle BCD: This triangle can be formed if edges BC, CD, and BD are present in the complex.\n\nSince there are only 4 edges in the complex, it is not possible to have all the required edges for more than one triangle. Therefore, the maximum number of 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) that can be formed in the complex is 1."
