    "message_1": "Sure, how about this one: \n\nSuppose you are a manufacturer of bicycles, and you are trying to determine the most cost-effective way to produce a certain model. You have three options for the frame material: aluminum, steel, and carbon fiber. You have two options for the wheel size: 26 inches and 29 inches. You have three options for the quality level: basic, intermediate, and advanced.\n\nThe costs for each option are as follows:\n\n| Frame Material | Wheel Size | Quality Level | Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aluminum | 26 in | Basic | $150 |\n| Aluminum | 26 in | Intermediate | $200 |\n| Aluminum | 26 in | Advanced | $250 |\n| Aluminum | 29 in | Basic | $170 |\n| Aluminum | 29 in | Intermediate | $220 |\n| Aluminum | 29 in | Advanced | $270 |\n| Steel | 26 in | Basic | $120 |\n| Steel | 26 in | Intermediate | $170 |\n| Steel | 26 in | Advanced | $220 |\n| Steel | 29 in | Basic | $140 |\n| Steel | 29 in | Intermediate | $190 |\n| Steel | 29 in | Advanced | $240 |\n| Carbon Fiber | 26 in | Basic | $300 |\n| Carbon Fiber | 26 in | Intermediate | $350 |\n| Carbon Fiber | 26 in | Advanced | $400 |\n| Carbon Fiber | 29 in | Basic | $320 |\n| Carbon Fiber | 29 in | Intermediate | $370 |\n| Carbon Fiber | 29 in | Advanced | $420 |\n\nAssuming you want to produce 1000 bicycles, how can you determine the combination of frame material, wheel size, and quality level that minimizes your costs using tabu search?",
    "message_2": "To determine the combination of frame material, wheel size, and quality level that minimizes your costs using tabu search, follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the problem: The goal is to find the combination of frame material, wheel size, and quality level that minimizes the cost of producing 1000 bicycles.\n\n2. Initialize the tabu search: Choose an initial solution (e.g., Aluminum, 26 in, Basic) and set the tabu list size (e.g., 5).\n\n3. Define the neighborhood: The neighborhood consists of all possible combinations of frame material, wheel size, and quality level that can be obtained by changing one element of the current solution.\n\n4. Evaluate the neighborhood: Calculate the cost of producing 1000 bicycles for each combination in the neighborhood.\n\n5. Choose the best non-tabu solution: Select the combination with the lowest cost that is not in the tabu list.\n\n6. Update the tabu list: Add the chosen solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the list exceeds its size limit.\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the best solution for a certain number of iterations).\n\n8. Return the best solution found.\n\nFor the given problem, you can start with an initial solution (e.g., Aluminum, 26 in, Basic) and follow the tabu search steps to find the combination that minimizes the cost of producing 1000 bicycles. The tabu search algorithm will explore different combinations of frame material, wheel size, and quality level while avoiding cycling back to recently visited solutions. This helps the search to escape local optima and potentially find a better global solution."
