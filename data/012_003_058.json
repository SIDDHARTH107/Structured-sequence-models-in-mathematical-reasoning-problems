    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the graph you are referring to. However, I can provide you with a general approach to find the maximum number of vertices that can be selected for an independent set in a graph.\n\nAn independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum independent set, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify all possible independent sets in the graph.\n2. Compare the sizes of these independent sets.\n3. The largest independent set is the maximum independent set.\n\nPlease provide the adjacency matrix or adjacency list of the graph, or describe the graph, and I will be able to help you find the maximum independent set."
