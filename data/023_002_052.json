    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the periodic function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. We will only need to compute the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of an even function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x) dx] from -π to π.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[|x| * cos(0 * x) dx] from -π to π\na_0 = (2/π) * ∫[|x| dx] from -π to π\n\nSince |x| is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_0 = (4/π) * ∫[x dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, integrate and evaluate:\n\na_0 = (4/π) * [x^2/2] from 0 to π\na_0 = (4/π) * (π^2/2 - 0)\na_0 = 2π\n\nNow, let's find the a_n coefficients for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[|x| * cos(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nAgain, since |x| is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_n = (4/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we need to integrate by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\na_n = (4/π) * [(uv) from 0 to π - ∫[v du] from 0 to π]\na_n = (4/π) * [(x * (1/n) * sin(n * x)) from 0 to π - (1/n) * ∫[sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to π]\n\nNow, integrate and evaluate:\n\na_n = (4/π) * [(π * (1/n) * sin(n * π) - 0) - (1/n) * [(-1/n) * cos(n * x)] from 0 to π]\na_n = (4/π) * [0 - (1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1)]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n:\n\na_n = (4/π) * (1/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |x|:\n\nf(x) = π + Σ[((4/π) * (1/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)) * cos(n * x)]\n\nNow, let's determine whether the Fourier series converges at x = 0:\n\nAt x = 0, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(0) = π + Σ[((4/π) * (1/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)) * cos(0)]\n\nSince cos(0) = 1:\n\nf(0) = π + Σ[((4/π) * (1/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n))]\n\nNotice that the series converges, as it is a conditionally convergent series. Therefore, the Fourier series converges at x = 0."
