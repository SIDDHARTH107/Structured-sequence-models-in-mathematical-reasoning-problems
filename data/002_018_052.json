    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 8 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume of a sphere = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3)π(4 cm)^3 = (4/3)π(64 cm^3) = (256/3)π cm^3 ≈ 268.08 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters."
