    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map equation f(x) = rx(1 - x) with the given initial condition x₀ = 0.5 and bifurcation parameter r = 3.57, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the logistic map function and its derivative.\n2. Iterate the logistic map function for a certain number of iterations (e.g., 1000) to allow the system to reach a stable state.\n3. Calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the sum of the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative of the logistic map function evaluated at each iteration.\n\nFirst, let's define the logistic map function and its derivative:\n\nf(x) = rx(1 - x)\nf'(x) = r - 2rx\n\nNow, let's iterate the logistic map function for 1000 iterations:\n\nx₀ = 0.5\nr = 3.57\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nAfter 1000 iterations, we can assume that the system has reached a stable state. Now, let's calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nlyapunov_exponent = 0\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n    lyapunov_exponent += math.log(abs(r - 2 * r * x))\n\nlyapunov_exponent /= 1000\n\nThe calculated Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map equation with the given initial condition and bifurcation parameter is the value of the lyapunov_exponent variable. If the Lyapunov exponent is positive, the system is chaotic, and if it's negative, the system is stable."
