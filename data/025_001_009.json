    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of points of intersection of two algebraic curves in a plane, we can use Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the maximum number of points of intersection of two algebraic curves of degrees m and n is the product of their degrees, i.e., m * n, assuming that the curves do not share any common components.\n\nIn this case, the degree of the first curve is 4, and the degree of the second curve is 3. Therefore, the maximum number of points of intersection is:\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, the maximum number of points of intersection of the two algebraic curves in a plane is 12. However, the actual number of intersection points may be less than 12 if the curves share common components or if some intersection points coincide."
