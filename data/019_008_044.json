    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership of the number 6 in the fuzzy set A, we need to evaluate the membership function μA(x) at x = 6.\n\nμA(6) = min(6, 10-6)\nμA(6) = min(6, 4)\n\nThe minimum value between 6 and 4 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the degree of membership of the number 6 in the fuzzy set A is 4."
