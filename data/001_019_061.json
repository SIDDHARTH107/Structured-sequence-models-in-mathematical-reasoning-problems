    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x - 5| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 5 = 10\nIn this case, we simply solve for x:\n2x = 15\nx = 15/2\nx = 7.5\n\nCase 2: 2x - 5 = -10\nIn this case, we also solve for x:\n2x = -5\nx = -5/2\nx = -2.5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 7.5 and x = -2.5."
