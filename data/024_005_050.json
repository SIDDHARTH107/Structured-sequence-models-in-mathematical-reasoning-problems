    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and their corresponding principal directions at the point (1,1,1), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^3 - 3xy^2, we can parametrize the surface as:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^3 - 3u*v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = ∂r/∂u = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v^2)\nr_v = ∂r/∂v = (0, 1, -6uv)\n\nAt the point (1,1,1), we have:\n\nr_u(1,1) = (1, 0, 0)\nr_v(1,1) = (0, 1, -6)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form (E, F, G):\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1\nF = r_u • r_v = 1*0 + 0*1 + 0*(-6) = 0\nG = r_v • r_v = 0^2 + 1^2 + (-6)^2 = 37\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = ∂²r/∂u² = (0, 0, 6u)\nr_uv = ∂²r/∂u∂v = (0, 0, -6v)\nr_vv = ∂²r/∂v² = (0, 0, -6u)\n\nAt the point (1,1,1), we have:\n\nr_uu(1,1) = (0, 0, 6)\nr_uv(1,1) = (0, 0, -6)\nr_vv(1,1) = (0, 0, -6)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form (L, M, N):\n\nL = r_uu • n = (0, 0, 6) • (1, 0, 0) = 0\nM = r_uv • n = (0, 0, -6) • (1, 0, 0) = 0\nN = r_vv • n = (0, 0, -6) • (1, 0, 0) = 0\n\nSince L, M, and N are all zero, the surface is flat at the point (1,1,1). Therefore, the principal curvatures are both zero, and the principal directions are undefined."
