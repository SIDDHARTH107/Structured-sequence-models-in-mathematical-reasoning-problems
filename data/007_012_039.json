    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Therefore, we are looking for the smallest prime number. The smallest prime number is 2. So, the smallest positive integer n such that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n according to Wilson's theorem is 2."
