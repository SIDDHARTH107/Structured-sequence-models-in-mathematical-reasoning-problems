    "message_2": "Let's consider the intersection of the closed oriented 2-manifold M with a plane P in 3-space. Since M intersects P transversely in 4 points, we can think of these 4 points as the vertices of a quadrilateral Q in P. \n\nNow, let's consider a small neighborhood around Q in P. We can think of this neighborhood as a small disk D containing Q. We can now consider the intersection of M with D, which will be a union of 4 small arcs connecting the 4 vertices of Q. Let's denote these arcs as a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary of the chain formed by these arcs, which is given by:\n\n∂(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) = (v_1 - v_2) + (v_2 - v_3) + (v_3 - v_4) + (v_4 - v_1)\n\nwhere v_i are the vertices of Q. Notice that the boundary is a cycle, which means that the sum of the arcs is a 2-chain in the homology group H_2(M; ℤ). Let's denote this 2-chain as [M'].\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of M with a small ball B centered at the barycenter of Q. Since M is a closed oriented 2-manifold, the intersection of M with B will be a union of two disks, say D_1 and D_2, such that their boundaries are equal to the sum of the arcs a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4. In other words, we have:\n\n∂D_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4\n∂D_2 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4\n\nNow, let's consider the homology class [M] - 2[M']. Since the boundaries of D_1 and D_2 are equal to the sum of the arcs, we have:\n\n[M] - 2[M'] = [M] - 2[D_1] - 2[D_2] = [M] - ∂(2D_1 + 2D_2)\n\nSince [M] - 2[M'] is the boundary of a 3-chain (2D_1 + 2D_2), it must be a torsion element in H_2(M; ℤ). \n\nTo find the order of the torsion, let's consider the smallest positive integer n such that n[M] is a boundary. We have:\n\nn[M] = n[M'] + ∂(nD_1 + nD_2)\n\nSince [M] - 2[M'] is a torsion element, there exists a positive integer k such that k([M] - 2[M']) = 0. This implies that:\n\nk[M] = 2k[M']\n\nNow, let's consider the smallest positive integer n such that n[M] is a boundary. Since k[M] is a boundary, we have:\n\nn | k\n\nSince 2k[M'] is a boundary, we also have:\n\nn | 2k\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer n that divides both k and 2k is n = 2. Therefore, the order of the torsion is 2, and [M] is a 2-torsion element in H_2(M; ℤ)."
