    "message_1": "Suppose a restaurant serves three different types of pizzas: vegetarian, meat-lover, and supreme. The probability of a customer ordering a vegetarian pizza is 0.4, for a meat-lover pizza it is 0.35, and for a supreme pizza it is 0.25. \n\nIf a group of 5 customers is randomly selected, what is the probability that all of them order a meat-lover pizza?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that all 5 customers order a meat-lover pizza, we simply multiply the probability of a single customer ordering a meat-lover pizza by itself 5 times, since each customer's choice is an independent event.\n\nProbability = (0.35)^5 = 0.35 * 0.35 * 0.35 * 0.35 * 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.00525\n\nSo, the probability that all 5 customers order a meat-lover pizza is approximately 0.00525 or 0.525%."
