    "message_1": "Suppose a message encrypted using a Caesar cipher was intercepted, and frequency analysis revealed that the letter 'E' appears most frequently in the message. If the message has a length of 100 characters, what is the likely value of the shift used in the Caesar cipher?",
    "message_2": "In a Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In English, the letter 'E' is the most common letter. Since frequency analysis revealed that 'E' appears most frequently in the encrypted message, it is likely that the original most common letter was shifted to 'E' in the ciphertext.\n\nTo find the likely value of the shift, we can compare the positions of 'E' and the most common letter in English, which is 'E' itself. The position of 'E' in the alphabet is 5. Since 'E' is already the most common letter in English, it is likely that no shift (or a shift of 0) was used in the Caesar cipher."
