    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5, we can use the method of completing the square or by finding the vertex of the parabola.\n\nCompleting the square:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5\n\n1. Divide the coefficient of the x term by 2: -4/2 = -2\n2. Square the result: (-2)^2 = 4\n3. Add and subtract the squared result inside the parentheses: (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4 + 5\n4. Factor the perfect square trinomial: (x - 2)^2 - 4 + 5\n5. Simplify: (x - 2)^2 + 1\n\nNow, the function is in the form f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 1.\n\nSince the parabola opens upwards (the coefficient of x^2 is positive), the minimum value occurs at the vertex. The vertex of the parabola is given by the point (h, k), where h is the value inside the parentheses and k is the constant term.\n\nIn this case, the vertex is (2, 1). Therefore, the minimum value of the function is 1.\n\nSince the parabola opens upwards, there is no maximum value for the function. The function will continue to increase as x moves away from the vertex.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 is 1, and there is no maximum value."
