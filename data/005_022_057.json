    "message_1": "A researcher wants to test the average weight of 10 mice. However, she suspects that there may be some outliers in the data that could skew the results. She decides to use a robust statistic method and chooses to use the median instead of the mean. Here are the weights of the mice in grams: \n\n18, 20, 23, 19, 22, 21, 550, 24, 17, 20 \n\nWhat is the median weight of the mice using robust statistics?",
    "message_2": "To find the median weight of the mice using robust statistics, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n17, 18, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 550\n\nSince there are 10 mice (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (20 and 21). \n\nMedian = (20 + 21) / 2 = 41 / 2 = 20.5\n\nThe median weight of the mice using robust statistics is 20.5 grams."
