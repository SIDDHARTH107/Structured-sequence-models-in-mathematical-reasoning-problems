    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(L² + W² + H²)\n\nwhere L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nIn this case, L = 8 cm, W = 5 cm, and H = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = √(8² + 5² + 12²)\nD = √(64 + 25 + 144)\nD = √(233)\n\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(233) cm, which is approximately 15.26 cm."
