    "message_1": "In a signaling game, the sender has two messages, M1 and M2, and the receiver has to guess the hidden state of the world, either A or B. Suppose the sender’s utility function is U(S, M, A) = 3 if S=A and M=M2, 2 if S=A and M=M1, and 0 otherwise. Also, suppose the receiver’s utility function is U(R, S, X) = 2 if R=B and S=A, 1 if R=A and S=A, and 0 otherwise. If the sender chooses M1 with probability p, find the optimal strategy for the receiver that maximizes his utility.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the receiver's utility function given the sender's strategy of choosing M1 with probability p.\n\nIf the receiver chooses action A, his expected utility is:\nE[U(R=A)] = p * U(R=A, S=A) + (1-p) * U(R=A, S=B) = p * 1 + (1-p) * 0 = p\n\nIf the receiver chooses action B, his expected utility is:\nE[U(R=B)] = p * U(R=B, S=A) + (1-p) * U(R=B, S=B) = p * 2 + (1-p) * 0 = 2p\n\nNow, we compare the expected utilities for actions A and B to find the optimal strategy for the receiver:\n\n1. If E[U(R=A)] > E[U(R=B)], the receiver should choose action A.\nThis occurs when p > 2p, which simplifies to p > 0. However, this inequality cannot hold since p is a probability and must be between 0 and 1.\n\n2. If E[U(R=A)] < E[U(R=B)], the receiver should choose action B.\nThis occurs when p < 2p, which simplifies to p < 0. Again, this inequality cannot hold since p is a probability and must be between 0 and 1.\n\n3. If E[U(R=A)] = E[U(R=B)], the receiver is indifferent between actions A and B.\nThis occurs when p = 2p, which simplifies to p = 0. In this case, the receiver can choose either action A or B, as both actions yield the same expected utility.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal strategy for the receiver is to choose action B if the sender chooses M1 with probability p = 0. If p > 0, the receiver's expected utility is the same for both actions, and there is no strictly optimal strategy."
