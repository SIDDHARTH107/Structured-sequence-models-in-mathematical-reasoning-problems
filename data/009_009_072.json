    "message_2": "To solve the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle with mass $m=1$ trapped in an infinite square potential well with width $L=2$, we first need to write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nSince the potential well is infinite, the potential $V(x)$ is given by:\n\n$$V(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } 0 < x < L \\\\ \\infty & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nInside the well ($0 < x < L$), the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nSince $m=1$, the equation becomes:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nTo solve this second-order differential equation, we can propose a solution of the form:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants, and $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}$. Since the wave function must be continuous and go to zero at the boundaries of the well ($x=0$ and $x=L$), we can apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. At $x=0$, $\\psi(0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) \\Rightarrow B = 0$$\n\n2. At $x=L$, $\\psi(L) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = A\\sin(kL)$$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This condition is satisfied when $kL = n\\pi$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Therefore, the allowed values of $k$ are:\n\n$$k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$$\n\nThe corresponding energy levels are given by:\n\n$$E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2k_n^2}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^2n^2\\pi^2}{2L^2}$$\n\nNow, we need to normalize the wave function. The normalization condition is:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} |\\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$$\n\nSubstituting the wave function and integrating, we get:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} A^2\\sin^2(k_nx) dx = 1$$\n\nSolving for $A$, we find:\n\n$$A = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$$\n\nFinally, the normalized wave functions and energy levels for a particle with mass $m=1$ trapped in an infinite square potential well with width $L=2$ are:\n\n$$\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\sqrt{1}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right)$$\n\n$$E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2n^2\\pi^2}{2L^2}$$\n\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer."
