    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products, P1 and P2. The profit per unit of P1 is $10 and profit per unit of P2 is $15. The company has a limited production capacity of 400 units per week. The production of P2 requires additional resources and cannot exceed 250 units per week. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. Develop a tabu search algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of each product.",
    "message_2": "To develop a tabu search algorithm for this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function represents the total profit, which we want to maximize. In this case, the objective function is:\n\n   Profit = 10 * P1 + 15 * P2\n\n2. Define the constraints: We have two constraints in this problem:\n   a. The total production capacity constraint: P1 + P2 <= 400\n   b. The production constraint for P2: P2 <= 250\n\n3. Initialize the tabu search parameters: Set the initial solution, tabu list size, and maximum number of iterations.\n\n4. Generate neighboring solutions: Create a set of neighboring solutions by slightly modifying the current solution.\n\n5. Evaluate the neighboring solutions: Calculate the objective function value for each neighboring solution and check if it satisfies the constraints.\n\n6. Update the current solution: Select the best neighboring solution that is not in the tabu list and update the current solution.\n\n7. Update the tabu list: Add the previous solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the list exceeds the specified size.\n\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the solution does not improve for a specified number of iterations.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the tabu search algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef objective_function(p1, p2):\n    return 10 * p1 + 15 * p2\n\ndef generate_neighbors(p1, p2, num_neighbors=10):\n    neighbors = []\n    for _ in range(num_neighbors):\n        new_p1 = random.randint(max(0, p1 - 10), min(400, p1 + 10))\n        new_p2 = random.randint(max(0, p2 - 10), min(250, p2 + 10))\n        neighbors.append((new_p1, new_p2))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_valid_solution(p1, p2):\n    return p1 + p2 <= 400 and p2 <= 250\n\ndef tabu_search(initial_solution, max_iterations, tabu_list_size):\n    current_solution = initial_solution\n    best_solution = current_solution\n    best_profit = objective_function(*best_solution)\n    tabu_list = []\n\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        neighbors = generate_neighbors(*current_solution)\n        valid_neighbors = [n for n in neighbors if is_valid_solution(*n) and n not in tabu_list]\n\n        if not valid_neighbors:\n            continue\n\n        next_solution = max(valid_neighbors, key=lambda x: objective_function(*x))\n        next_profit = objective_function(*next_solution)\n\n        if next_profit > best_profit:\n            best_solution = next_solution\n            best_profit = next_profit\n\n        current_solution = next_solution\n        tabu_list.append(current_solution)\n\n        if len(tabu_list) > tabu_list_size:\n            tabu_list.pop(0)\n\n    return best_solution, best_profit\n\ninitial_solution = (200, 200)\nmax_iterations = 1000\ntabu_list_size = 50\n\nbest_solution, best_profit = tabu_search(initial_solution, max_iterations, tabu_list_size)\nprint(f\"Optimal production quantities: P1 = {best_solution[0]}, P2 = {best_solution[1]}\")\nprint(f\"Maximum weekly profit: ${best_profit}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a simple random neighbor generation approach and a fixed tabu list size. You can further improve the algorithm by using more advanced neighborhood generation techniques and adaptive tabu list sizes."
