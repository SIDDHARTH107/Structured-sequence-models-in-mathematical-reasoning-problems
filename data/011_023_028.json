    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color a planar graph, we can use the Four Color Theorem. The Four Color Theorem states that any planar graph can be colored using at most four colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nTherefore, for a planar graph with 10 vertices, the minimum number of colors required is 4."
