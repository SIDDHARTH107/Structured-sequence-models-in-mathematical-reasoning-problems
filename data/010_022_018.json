    "message_2": "To find the length of the arc on the sphere, we first need to find the angle between the two points on the sphere. We can do this by finding the dot product of the vectors from the origin to the points and then using the cosine formula.\n\nLet A = (1, 2, -4) and B = (3, -4, 1). The vectors from the origin to these points are OA = A and OB = B.\n\nThe dot product of OA and OB is:\n\nOA · OB = (1)(3) + (2)(-4) + (-4)(1) = 3 - 8 - 4 = -9\n\nThe magnitudes of OA and OB are:\n\n|OA| = √(1^2 + 2^2 + (-4)^2) = √(1 + 4 + 16) = √21\n|OB| = √(3^2 + (-4)^2 + 1^2) = √(9 + 16 + 1) = √26\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ between OA and OB using the cosine formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (OA · OB) / (|OA| |OB|)\ncos(θ) = (-9) / (√21 * √26)\nθ = arccos((-9) / (√21 * √26))\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the length of the arc on the sphere. The formula for the arc length is:\n\nArc length = radius * θ\nArc length = 5 * arccos((-9) / (√21 * √26))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 2.245 radians\n\nSo, the arc length is:\n\nArc length ≈ 5 * 2.245 ≈ 11.225 cm"
