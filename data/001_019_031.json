    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x + 5| = 17, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x + 5 = 17\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n3x = 12\nDivide by 3:\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 3x + 5 = -17\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n3x = -22\nDivide by 3:\nx = -22/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 4 and -22/3."
