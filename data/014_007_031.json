    "message_1": "A stream cipher produces a keystream by generating a sequence of bits that changes constantly. Suppose a stream cipher generates a keystream by XOR-ing each bit of a plaintext message with each bit of a key, which is repeated throughout the message. If the length of the key is 8 bits and the length of the plaintext message is 64 bits, how many bits are in the resulting ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "The resulting ciphertext will have the same length as the plaintext message. Since the plaintext message is 64 bits long, the resulting ciphertext will also be 64 bits long."
