    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(125), we need to find the prime factors of 125 and look for any perfect squares.\n\n125 can be factored as 5 × 5 × 5 (or 5^3).\n\nSince there is a pair of 5's, we can take one 5 out of the square root:\n\n√(125) = √(5 × 5 × 5) = 5√(5)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 5√(5)."
