    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 5 balls out of 10 using Pascal's triangle, we can use the combination formula, which is derived from Pascal's triangle. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of balls (10 in this case) and k is the number of balls to choose (5 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nUsing the formula, we have:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo there are 252 ways to choose 5 balls out of 10 using the Pascal's triangle method."
