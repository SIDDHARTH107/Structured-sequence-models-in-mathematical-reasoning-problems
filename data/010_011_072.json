    "message_2": "It seems there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement. A two-dimensional sphere $S^2$ is actually a regular sphere in three-dimensional space. If we rotate a regular sphere about its diameter, we will still have the same sphere, as it is symmetric about all its diameters.\n\nSo, the problem is essentially asking for the volume of a sphere with radius $r = 3$. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$\n\nPlugging in the value of $r = 3$, we get:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (27) = 36\\pi$\n\nThus, the volume of the three-dimensional solid obtained by rotating the sphere about its diameter is $36\\pi$ cubic units."
