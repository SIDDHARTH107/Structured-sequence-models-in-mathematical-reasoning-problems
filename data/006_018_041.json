    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.08. If there are 200 companies in a particular city, what is the probability that at least 15 of them will experience this type of financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, financial fraud) in n trials (companies)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (financial fraud) in a single trial (company), which is 0.08\n- n is the number of trials (companies), which is 200\n- k is the number of successes (financial frauds) we are interested in, which is 15 or more\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 15 companies experiencing financial fraud, we need to find the probability of 15, 16, 17, ..., 200 companies experiencing financial fraud and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of 14 or fewer companies experiencing financial fraud and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we want to find:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 14)\n\nNow, we need to calculate P(X ≤ 14), which is the sum of the probabilities of 0 to 14 companies experiencing financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≤ 14) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 14\n\nP(X ≤ 14) = Σ [C(200, k) * 0.08^k * (1-0.08)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 14\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each k and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 14) ≈ 0.0386 (using a calculator or software to compute the sum)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 15 companies experiencing financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 14) = 1 - 0.0386 ≈ 0.9614\n\nSo, the probability that at least 15 of the 200 companies in the city will experience this type of financial fraud is approximately 0.9614 or 96.14%."
