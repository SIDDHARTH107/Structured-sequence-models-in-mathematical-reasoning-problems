    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes after the first iteration.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we can calculate the total number of cubes as follows:\n\n1. First iteration: 20 cubes\n2. Second iteration: 20^2 = 400 cubes\n3. Third iteration: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes\n4. Fourth iteration: 20^4 = 160,000 cubes\n\nSo, there are 160,000 cubes in the 4th iteration of a Menger sponge constructed initially from a single cube."
