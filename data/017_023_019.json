    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first analyze the prime factorization of 72, which is 2^3 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their combinations.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. If n_2 = 9, then the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. If n_3 = 4, then the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal.\n\nNow we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal.\nIn this case, the group is a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup, which is abelian. So, this case does not give any non-abelian groups.\n\nCase 2: Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, but Sylow 3-subgroup is not normal.\nThere are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (Dihedral group D_4 and Quaternion group Q_8), and 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 9 (C_9 and C_3 × C_3). Since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. We have the following possibilities:\n\n1. D_4 ⋊ C_9: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_9 to Aut(D_4), so there is one non-abelian group in this case.\n2. D_4 ⋊ (C_3 × C_3): There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from C_3 × C_3 to Aut(D_4), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n3. Q_8 ⋊ C_9: There is no non-trivial homomorphism from C_9 to Aut(Q_8), so there are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n4. Q_8 ⋊ (C_3 × C_3): There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_3 × C_3 to Aut(Q_8), so there is one non-abelian group in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 4 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal, but Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\nThere are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (C_8, C_4 × C_2, and D_4), and 1 non-isomorphic group of order 9 (C_9). Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup. We have the following possibilities:\n\n1. C_9 ⋊ C_8: There are four non-trivial homomorphisms from C_8 to Aut(C_9), so there are four non-abelian groups in this case.\n2. C_9 ⋊ (C_4 × C_2): There are four non-trivial homomorphisms from C_4 × C_2 to Aut(C_9), so there are four non-abelian groups in this case.\n3. C_9 ⋊ D_4: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from D_4 to Aut(C_9), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are not normal.\nIn this case, we have 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. The action of the group on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from the group to S_9. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, which is a normal 2-subgroup of the group. Similarly, the action of the group on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from the group to S_4, and the kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups, which is a normal 3-subgroup of the group.\n\nLet K be the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, and let L be the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups. Then K and L are normal subgroups of the group, and their intersection is trivial. Thus, the group is a semi-direct product of K and L. We have the following possibilities:\n\n1. C_2 ⋊ C_3: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from C_3 to Aut(C_2), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n2. C_4 ⋊ C_3: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from C_3 to Aut(C_4), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n3. C_8 ⋊ C_3: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_3 to Aut(C_8), so there is one non-abelian group in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nNow we consider the extension problem for the groups in this case. Let G be a group of order 72 with 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Then G has a normal subgroup of order 4, say N, and G/N is isomorphic to a group of order 18. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 18 (C_18 and C_6 × C_3), and their automorphism groups have orders 6 and 12, respectively. The number of extensions of G/N by N is given by the second cohomology group H^2(G/N, N), which has order equal to the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from G/N to Aut(N).\n\n1. If G/N is isomorphic to C_18, then there are 6 non-trivial homomorphisms from G/N to Aut(N), so there are 6 non-abelian groups in this case.\n2. If G/N is isomorphic to C_6 × C_3, then there are 12 non-trivial homomorphisms from G/N to Aut(N), so there are 12 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have 6 + 12 = 18 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nAdding up the non-abelian groups from all cases, we have 4 + 10 + 5 + 18 = 37 non-abelian groups of order 72. However, we have overcounted some groups, so we need to subtract the duplicates. There are 14 groups that are counted twice, so the actual number of non-abelian groups of order 72 is 37 - 14 = 23.\n\nIn conclusion, there are exactly 23 non-abelian groups of order 72, and we have found the isomorphism class of each of them."
