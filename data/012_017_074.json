    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a bipartite graph is a set of edges that covers every vertex exactly once. In a complete bipartite graph K_m,n, a perfect matching is only possible if m = n. Since K5,4 has unequal parts (5 vertices in one part and 4 vertices in the other), there are no perfect matchings in this graph."
