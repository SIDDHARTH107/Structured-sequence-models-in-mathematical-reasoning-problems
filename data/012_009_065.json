    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, the degree sequence is {4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2}. Summing up the degrees, we get:\n\n4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18\n\nNow, we can use the Handshaking Lemma:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * Number of edges\n\n18 = 2 * Number of edges\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nNumber of edges = 9\n\nSo, the graph has 9 edges."
