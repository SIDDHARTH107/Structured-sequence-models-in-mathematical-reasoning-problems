    "message_2": "For a matrix to be positive semi-definite, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative. Let's find the eigenvalues of the given matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \nx_{1} & 1 \\\\\n1 & x_{2} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\n\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = (x_{1} - \\lambda)(x_{2} - \\lambda) - 1 = 0\n$$\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - (x_{1} + x_{2})\\lambda + (x_{1}x_{2} - 1) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we use the fact that the discriminant of a quadratic equation is non-negative for a positive semi-definite matrix:\n\n$$\n\\Delta = (x_{1} + x_{2})^2 - 4(x_{1}x_{2} - 1) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get:\n\n$$\n3x_{1}x_{2} - 2(x_{1} + x_{2}) + 1 \\leq 0\n$$\n\nNow, we want to maximize $x_{1} + x_{2}$ subject to the constraint $3x_{1}x_{2} - 2(x_{1} + x_{2}) + 1 \\leq 0$. We can rewrite the constraint as:\n\n$$\n3x_{1}x_{2} \\leq 2(x_{1} + x_{2}) - 1\n$$\n\nNotice that if $x_{1} = x_{2} = 0$, the constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, at least one of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ must be positive. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x_{1} > 0$. Then, we can divide both sides of the constraint by $x_{1}$:\n\n$$\n3x_{2} \\leq 2\\left(\\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} + 1\\right) - \\frac{1}{x_{1}}\n$$\n\nNow, let $y = \\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}$. Then, the constraint becomes:\n\n$$\n3y \\leq 2(y + 1) - \\frac{1}{x_{1}}\n$$\n\nSince $x_{1} > 0$, we have $\\frac{1}{x_{1}} > 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when:\n\n$$\n3y = 2(y + 1) - \\frac{1}{x_{1}}\n$$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n\n$$\ny = 1 - \\frac{1}{2x_{1}}\n$$\n\nNow, we can express $x_{2}$ in terms of $x_{1}$:\n\n$$\nx_{2} = yx_{1} = x_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we want to maximize $x_{1} + x_{2} = x_{1} + x_{1} - \\frac{1}{2} = 2x_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}$. Since there is no upper bound on $x_{1}$, the optimal values of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ that maximize the objective function are unbounded. In other words, the objective function can be made arbitrarily large by choosing larger values of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2} = x_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}$."
