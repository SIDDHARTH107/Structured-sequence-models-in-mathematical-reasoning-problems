    "message_2": "To calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the central square and the 4 corner squares), and the scaling factor is 3 (since each side of the square is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the size of each square in the fractal pattern is 1 unit is approximately 1.465."
