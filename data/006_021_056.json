    "message_1": "A certain type of environmental event occurs in a particular region with a probability of 0.25 per month. Calculate the probability that this event will occur at least twice in a three-month period in this region.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the event occurring at least twice in a three-month period, we can use the complementary probability, which means finding the probability of the event occurring less than twice (0 or 1 time) and subtracting it from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of the event not occurring at all in the three months (0 times):\nP(0) = (1 - 0.25)^3 = 0.75^3 = 0.421875\n\nNow let's find the probability of the event occurring exactly once in the three months:\nP(1) = 3 * (0.25) * (0.75)^2 = 3 * 0.25 * 0.5625 = 0.421875\n\nNow we can find the complementary probability:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - 0.421875 - 0.421875 = 0.15625\n\nSo the probability of the event occurring at least twice in a three-month period is 0.15625 or 15.625%."
