    "message_1": "Suppose a company's network is susceptible to three types of cyber attacks, A, B, and C, with the probabilities of occurrence being 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. What is the probability that the network will be attacked by either type A or B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the network will be attacked by either type A or B, we can simply add the probabilities of each type of attack occurring, since they are mutually exclusive events.\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\nP(A or B) = 0.4 + 0.3\n\nP(A or B) = 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that the network will be attacked by either type A or B is 0.7 or 70%."
