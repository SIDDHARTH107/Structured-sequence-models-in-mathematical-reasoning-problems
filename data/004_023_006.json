    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 + 2x and y = 3x - 2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 + 2x = 3x - 2\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 3x + 2 = 0\nx^2 - x + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find the roots using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = 2:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 - 8)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √(-7)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation, which means the two curves do not intersect. Therefore, there is no area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 + 2x and y = 3x - 2."
