    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them).\n\nFor R(4, 5), it is known that the exact value is 25. This means that in any graph with 25 vertices, there will always be either a clique of size 4 or an independent set of size 5."
