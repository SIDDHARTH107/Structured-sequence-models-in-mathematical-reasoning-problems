    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$ and then sum them up. Recall that the exterior derivative of a function $f$ with respect to a coordinate $x^i$ is given by $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} dx^i$. \n\nFor the first term in $\\omega$, $x^2 dx$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (x^2)}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial (x^2)}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dx$\n\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, the first term simplifies to:\n\n$2x dx \\wedge dx = 0$\n\nFor the second term in $\\omega$, $xy^2 dy$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (xy^2)}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy + \\frac{\\partial (xy^2)}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dy$\n\nSince $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, the second term simplifies to:\n\n$y^2 dx \\wedge dy$\n\nNow, we sum up the exterior derivatives of the two terms:\n\n$d\\omega = 0 + y^2 dx \\wedge dy$\n\nThus, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n\n$d\\omega = y^2 dx \\wedge dy$"
