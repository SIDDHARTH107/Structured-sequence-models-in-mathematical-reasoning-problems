    "message_2": "This graph does have a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every vertex is visited exactly once. Here is an example of a Hamiltonian cycle for the given graph:\n\n1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 3 - 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, satisfying the conditions for a Hamiltonian cycle."
