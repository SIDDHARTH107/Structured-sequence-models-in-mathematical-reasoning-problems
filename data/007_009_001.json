    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To compute φ(72), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 72:\n\n72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n\nNow, we can plug the prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(72) = 72 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(72) = 72 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(72) = 36\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(72) is 36."
