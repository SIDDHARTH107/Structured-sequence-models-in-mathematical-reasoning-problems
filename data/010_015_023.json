    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the second de Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(X)$, we can use the Euler-Poincaré characteristic formula for the torus $X$. The Euler-Poincaré characteristic formula is given by:\n\n$\\chi(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \\dim H^i_{dR}(X)$,\n\nwhere $\\dim H^i_{dR}(X)$ is the dimension of the $i$-th de Rham cohomology group.\n\nFor the torus $X$, we are given that $\\chi(X) = 0$ and $H^1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, we have:\n\n$0 = \\dim H^0_{dR}(X) - \\dim H^1_{dR}(X) + \\dim H^2_{dR}(X)$.\n\nSince $H^0_{dR}(X)$ is the space of constant functions on $X$, we have $\\dim H^0_{dR}(X) = 1$. Also, we are given that $\\dim H^1_{dR}(X) = 2$. Plugging these values into the Euler-Poincaré characteristic formula, we get:\n\n$0 = 1 - 2 + \\dim H^2_{dR}(X)$.\n\nSolving for $\\dim H^2_{dR}(X)$, we find that:\n\n$\\dim H^2_{dR}(X) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the second de Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(X)$ of the torus presented as a finite-dimensional real vector space is $1$."
