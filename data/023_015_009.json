    "message_2": "To determine the displacement of the string at time t=0.01 s using the Fourier Transform method, we first need to find the Fourier Transform of the initial displacement function y(x,0) = 0.005x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 200 mm.\n\nLet's convert the given dimensions to meters for consistency: 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2 m.\n\nThe Fourier Transform of y(x,0) is given by:\n\nY(k,0) = ∫[y(x,0) * e^(-i*k*x)] dx, where the integral is taken over the interval [0, 0.2].\n\nY(k,0) = ∫[0.005x * e^(-i*k*x)] dx from 0 to 0.2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 0.005x and dv = e^(-i*k*x) dx\nThen, du = 0.005 dx and v = -1/(i*k) * e^(-i*k*x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nY(k,0) = [-0.005x * e^(-i*k*x) / (i*k)] - ∫[-0.005 * e^(-i*k*x) / (i*k)] dx from 0 to 0.2\n\nY(k,0) = [-0.005x * e^(-i*k*x) / (i*k)] + [0.005 * e^(-i*k*x) / (k^2)] from 0 to 0.2\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier Transform to get the displacement of the string at time t=0.01 s:\n\ny(x,t) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[Y(k,0) * e^(i*k*(x - 100t))] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\ny(x,0.01) = (1/(2π)) * ∫[(-0.005x * e^(-i*k*x) / (i*k) + 0.005 * e^(-i*k*x) / (k^2)) * e^(i*k*(x - 1))] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral is quite complex and may not have a closed-form solution. However, we can approximate the displacement of the string at time t=0.01 s using numerical methods, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or by evaluating the integral numerically using software like Mathematica or MATLAB."
