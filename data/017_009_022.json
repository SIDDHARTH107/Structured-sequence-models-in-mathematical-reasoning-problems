    "message_1": "Let G be a group of order 9. Suppose there are four distinct subgroups of G. What is the group operation table for G and which group is G isomorphic to?",
    "message_2": "Since G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, there must be a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 9. The four distinct subgroups of G must be the trivial subgroup {e}, the whole group G, and two subgroups of order 3, say H and K.\n\nNow, since G has order 9, which is a prime power (3^2), G must be a p-group, and in particular, it must be abelian. Therefore, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: Z_9 (the cyclic group of order 9) or Z_3 × Z_3 (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nIf G were isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, then it would have at least three distinct subgroups of order 3 (corresponding to the three non-identity elements of Z_3 × Z_3). However, we are given that G has only two subgroups of order 3, so G cannot be isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nThus, G must be isomorphic to Z_9. The group operation table for Z_9 is given by the addition modulo 9:\n\n```\n+ | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n--+-------------------\n0 | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n1 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0\n2 | 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1\n3 | 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2\n4 | 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3\n5 | 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4\n6 | 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 5\n7 | 7 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n8 | 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\nSo, G is isomorphic to Z_9, and its group operation table is given by the addition modulo 9."
