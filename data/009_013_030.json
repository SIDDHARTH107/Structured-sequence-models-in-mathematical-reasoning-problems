    "message_1": "A population of prey animals is growing at a rate of 4% per year. A population of predators is declining at a rate of 2% per year. If there were initially 500 prey animals and 200 predators, use the Lotka-Volterra equations to estimate the population of prey and predators after 10 years.",
    "message_2": "The Lotka-Volterra equations are a pair of first-order, non-linear, differential equations that describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The equations are:\n\ndx/dt = αx - βxy\ndy/dt = δxy - γy\n\nwhere:\nx is the number of prey (for example, rabbits)\ny is the number of predators (for example, foxes)\nα, β, δ, and γ are positive real parameters describing the interaction of the two species.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are given the growth and decline rates of prey and predators, which are not directly related to the Lotka-Volterra equations. Instead, we can use the exponential growth/decay formula to estimate the population after 10 years.\n\nFor prey population (growing at 4% per year):\nP_prey(t) = P_prey_initial * (1 + growth_rate_prey)^t\nP_prey(10) = 500 * (1 + 0.04)^10\n\nFor predator population (declining at 2% per year):\nP_predator(t) = P_predator_initial * (1 - decline_rate_predator)^t\nP_predator(10) = 200 * (1 - 0.02)^10\n\nNow, we can calculate the populations after 10 years:\n\nP_prey(10) = 500 * (1.04)^10 ≈ 740.12\nP_predator(10) = 200 * (0.98)^10 ≈ 164.03\n\nAfter 10 years, the estimated population of prey animals is approximately 740, and the estimated population of predators is approximately 164."
