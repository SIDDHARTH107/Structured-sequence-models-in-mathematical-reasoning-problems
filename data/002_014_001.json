    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nSurface Area = 2(7)(5) + 2(7)(3) + 2(5)(3)\nSurface Area = 2(35) + 2(21) + 2(15)\nSurface Area = 70 + 42 + 30\nSurface Area = 142 cmÂ²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 142 square centimeters."
