    "message_2": "We will use Morse inequalities to solve this problem. Recall that Morse inequalities state that for a smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with non-degenerate critical points on a compact manifold $M$, we have\n$$\\sum_{i} (-1)^i k_i \\leq \\sum_j (-1)^j b_j,$$\nwhere $k_i$ is the number of critical points of index $i$, and $b_j$ is the $j$-th Betti number of $M$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $M$ is a 2-dimensional compact manifold with boundary, and $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function with $k_0 = 4, k_1 = 4, k_2 = 1$ critical points with indices $0, 1$, and $2$, respectively.\n\nApplying the Morse inequalities, we have\n$$\\sum_{i} (-1)^i k_i \\leq \\sum_j (-1)^j b_j.$$\nPlugging in the given values for $k_i$, we get\n$$(-1)^0 k_0 + (-1)^1 k_1 + (-1)^2 k_2 \\leq \\sum_j (-1)^j b_j.$$\nSimplifying, we have\n$$4 - 4 + 1 \\leq \\sum_j (-1)^j b_j.$$\n\nNow, for a 2-dimensional manifold, we have three Betti numbers: $b_0, b_1,$ and $b_2$. Thus, the inequality becomes\n$$1 \\leq (-1)^0 b_0 + (-1)^1 b_1 + (-1)^2 b_2,$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$1 \\leq b_0 - b_1 + b_2.$$\n\nSince Betti numbers are non-negative integers, the minimum values for $b_0, b_1,$ and $b_2$ that satisfy this inequality are $b_0 = 1, b_1 = 0,$ and $b_2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum Betti numbers for $M$ are $b_0 = 1, b_1 = 0,$ and $b_2 = 0$."
