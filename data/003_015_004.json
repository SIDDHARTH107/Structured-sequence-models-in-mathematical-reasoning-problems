    "message_1": "A student needs to find the amplitude and period of the function `y = 4sin(2x)`. What is the amplitude and period of this trigonometric function?",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 4sin(2x).\n\nTo find the amplitude, we look at the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is 4.\n\nTo find the period, we look at the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, it is 2. The period of the sine function is 2π, so to find the period of this function, we divide the period of the sine function by the coefficient of x:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude is 4 and the period is π."
