    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of these two sets. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n\n(A x B) Δ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is commutative. The symmetric difference is commutative if (A x B) Δ (B x A) = (B x A) Δ (A x B).\n\n(B x A) Δ (A x B) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) Δ (B x A) = (B x A) Δ (A x B). Therefore, the symmetric difference of these two sets is commutative."
