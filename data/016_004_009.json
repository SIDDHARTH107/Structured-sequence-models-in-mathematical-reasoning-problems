    "message_2": "The Julia set is connected if and only if the parameter \"c\" belongs to the Mandelbrot set. Therefore, if the Julia set is connected but not contained in the Mandelbrot set, it must be on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and it is not easy to determine the exact smallest value of \"c\" for which the corresponding Julia set is connected but not contained in the Mandelbrot set. However, we can approximate the smallest value of \"c\" by considering the points on the boundary of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe main cardioid is the largest connected region of the Mandelbrot set, and its boundary can be parameterized by the equation:\n\nc(θ) = 1/2 * (1 - cos(θ)) * e^(iθ)\n\nwhere θ is a real number between 0 and 2π, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nWhen θ = 0, we have:\n\nc(0) = 1/2 * (1 - cos(0)) * e^(i0) = 1/2 * (1 - 1) * 1 = 0\n\nHowever, c = 0 is in the Mandelbrot set, so we need to consider a slightly larger value of θ. As θ increases from 0, the point c(θ) moves along the boundary of the main cardioid, and the corresponding Julia set becomes connected but not contained in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nSince the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal, it is difficult to determine the exact smallest value of θ for which this occurs. However, we can approximate the smallest value of \"c\" by considering a small positive value of θ, such as θ = 0.001.\n\nUsing this value, we get:\n\nc(0.001) ≈ 1/2 * (1 - cos(0.001)) * e^(i0.001)\n\nThis is an approximation of the smallest value of \"c\" for which the corresponding Julia set is connected but not contained in the Mandelbrot set."
