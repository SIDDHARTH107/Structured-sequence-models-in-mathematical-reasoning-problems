The ciphertext is: \n\n\"RITMQZKWPJZPYLSPNENBDSVQQBUPNPCAQSYXJIUWBGUCLOKLZT\"\n\nDecrypt the message assuming that the plaintext is in English and the most common letter in English is 'E'. What is the plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Vigenere cipher, we need to find the key. Since we know the key length is 6, we can use frequency analysis to find the most common letter in each group of 6 letters in the ciphertext and assume that it corresponds to 'E' in the plaintext.\n\nCiphertext groups:\n1. R, P, S, Q, W, L\n2. I, J, N, B, J, K\n3. T, Z, E, D, I, Z\n4. M, Y, N, S, U, T\n5. Q, L, B, V, I, O\n6. Z, S, S, Q, W, K\n\nNow, we find the most common letter in each group and assume it corresponds to 'E' in the plaintext. Then, we calculate the shift between the most common letter and 'E' to find the key.\n\n1. Most common letter: R, Shift: 13 (R - E = 13)\n2. Most common letter: J, Shift: 5 (J - E = 5)\n3. Most common letter: E, Shift: 0 (E - E = 0)\n4. Most common letter: U, Shift: 16 (U - E = 16)\n5. Most common letter: I, Shift: 4 (I - E = 4)\n6. Most common letter: S, Shift: 14 (S - E = 14)\n\nThe key is the sequence of shifts: 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14. Now, we can decrypt the ciphertext using this key.\n\nDecryption:\nRITMQZ - 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14 -> MEETME\nKWPJZP - 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14 -> ATTHEP\nYLSPNE - 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14 -> ARKTON\nNBDSVQ - 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14 -> IGHTAT\nQBUPNP - 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14 -> ELEVEN\nCAQSYX - 13, 5, 0, 16, 4, 14 -> CLOCK\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is: \"MEET ME AT THE PARK TONIGHT AT ELEVEN CLOCK\"."
