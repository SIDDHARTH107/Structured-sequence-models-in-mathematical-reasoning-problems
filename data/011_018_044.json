    "message_1": "A school council wants to form a committee of 5 students, with 2 girls and 3 boys in it. If there are 7 girls and 10 boys in the school who are willing to join the committee, how many ways can the committee be formed?",
    "message_2": "To form the committee, we need to choose 2 girls out of 7 and 3 boys out of 10. We can use combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose the students.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 7 is denoted as C(7, 2), which is calculated as:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 * 120)\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 10 is denoted as C(10, 3), which is calculated as:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!)\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (6 * 7!)\nC(10, 3) = 3628800 / (6 * 5040)\nC(10, 3) = 3628800 / 30240\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nNow, to form the committee, we need to combine the choices of girls and boys. We can do this by multiplying the number of ways to choose girls and boys:\n\nTotal ways = C(7, 2) * C(10, 3)\nTotal ways = 21 * 120\nTotal ways = 2520\n\nSo, there are 2520 ways to form the committee with 2 girls and 3 boys."
