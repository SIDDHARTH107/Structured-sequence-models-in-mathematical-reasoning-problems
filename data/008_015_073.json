    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b:\n\n```\nA = | 2  4  1 |      x = | x |      b = | 10 |\n    | 4  2  3 |          | y |          | 16 |\n    | 0  3  2 |          | z |          | 11 |\n```\n\nTo apply Cholesky decomposition, we need to make sure that the matrix A is symmetric and positive definite. The matrix A is symmetric, but it is not positive definite since its determinant is negative (det(A) = -48). Therefore, we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition to solve the system. In this case, let's use Gaussian elimination.\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row to eliminate x from the second equation:\n\n```\n   | 2  4  1 |          | 10 |\n   | 0 -6  1 |          | -4 |\n   | 0  3  2 |          | 11 |\n```\n\n2. Divide the second row by -6:\n\n```\n   | 2  4  1 |          | 10 |\n   | 0  1 -1/6 |          | 2/3 |\n   | 0  3  2 |          | 11 |\n```\n\n3. Subtract 3 times the second row from the third row to eliminate y from the third equation:\n\n```\n   | 2  4  1 |          | 10 |\n   | 0  1 -1/6 |          | 2/3 |\n   | 0  0  11/6 |          | 31/3 |\n```\n\n4. Divide the third row by 11/6:\n\n```\n   | 2  4  1 |          | 10 |\n   | 0  1 -1/6 |          | 2/3 |\n   | 0  0  1 |          | 3 |\n```\n\n5. Add 1/6 times the third row to the second row:\n\n```\n   | 2  4  1 |          | 10 |\n   | 0  1  0 |          | 1 |\n   | 0  0  1 |          | 3 |\n```\n\n6. Subtract the third row from the first row and subtract 4 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n   | 2  0  0 |          | 2 |\n   | 0  1  0 |          | 1 |\n   | 0  0  1 |          | 3 |\n```\n\n7. Divide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n   | 1  0  0 |          | 1 |\n   | 0  1  0 |          | 1 |\n   | 0  0  1 |          | 3 |\n```\n\nNow we have the solution in the form of an identity matrix:\n\nx = 1\ny = 1\nz = 3"
