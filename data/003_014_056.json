    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the given function y = 3sin(2x - π/6), we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, the function is y = 3sin(2x - π/6), so we have:\n\nA = 3\nB = 2\nC = π/6\nD = 0\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period: The period of the function is determined by the coefficient B in the argument of the sine function. The period is given by the formula (2π)/B. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C in the argument of the sine function. In this case, the phase shift is π/6. Since the argument is in the form (2x - π/6), the phase shift is a horizontal shift to the right by π/6 units.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and the phase shift is π/6 to the right."
