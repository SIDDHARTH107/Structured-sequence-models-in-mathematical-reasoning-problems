    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a central angle of 120 degrees, and the radius of the circle is 6 cm. What is the area of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is 120 degrees and the radius (r) is 6 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (120 / 360) × π × 6²\nArea of sector = (1/3) × π × 36\nArea of sector = 12π cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 12π cm²."
