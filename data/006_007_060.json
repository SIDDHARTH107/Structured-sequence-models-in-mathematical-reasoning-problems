    "message_1": "Suppose the current stock price of a company is $50, and the probability of the stock price increasing by 10% is 0.6, and the probability of the stock price decreasing by 5% is 0.4. What is the probability that the stock price will be exactly $55?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock price will be exactly $55, we need to consider the scenario where the stock price increases by 10%. Since the probability of the stock price increasing by 10% is 0.6, the probability that the stock price will be exactly $55 is 0.6."
