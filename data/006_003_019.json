    "message_2": "There are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. So, there are a total of 8 cards that are either a King or a Queen.\n\nThe probability of drawing a King or Queen is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (drawing a King or Queen) to the total number of possible outcomes (drawing any card from the deck).\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 8 (Kings and Queens) / 52 (total cards)\n\nProbability = 2 / 13\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a King or Queen from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is 2/13 or approximately 0.1538 (rounded to four decimal places)."
