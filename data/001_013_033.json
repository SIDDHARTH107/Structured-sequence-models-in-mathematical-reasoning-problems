    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x + 9) - √x = 1, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the square root terms.\nAdd √x to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(2x + 9) = √x + 1\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.\n(√(2x + 9))^2 = (√x + 1)^2\n\n(2x + 9) = (x + 2√x + 1)\n\nStep 3: Simplify and move all terms to one side of the equation.\n2x + 9 = x + 2√x + 1\n\nx + 8 = 2√x\n\nStep 4: Isolate the square root term.\nx - 2√x + 8 = 0\n\nStep 5: Square both sides of the equation again to eliminate the square root.\n(x - 2√x + 8)^2 = 0^2\n\n(x^2 - 4x√x + 16x) = 0\n\nStep 6: Isolate the term with the square root.\nx^2 + 16x = 4x√x\n\nStep 7: Divide both sides of the equation by x to simplify.\nx + 16 = 4√x\n\nStep 8: Square both sides of the equation one more time to eliminate the square root.\n(x + 16)^2 = (4√x)^2\n\n(x^2 + 32x + 256) = 16x\n\nStep 9: Move all terms to one side of the equation and simplify.\nx^2 + 32x - 16x + 256 = 0\n\nx^2 + 16x + 256 = 0\n\nStep 10: Factor the quadratic equation.\n(x + 8)(x + 8) = 0\n\nStep 11: Solve for x.\nx + 8 = 0\n\nx = -8\n\nHowever, we need to check if this solution is valid by plugging it back into the original equation:\n\n√(2(-8) + 9) - √(-8) = 1\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the solution x = -8 is not valid for the original equation. Therefore, there is no real solution for this equation."
