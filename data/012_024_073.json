    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. For a complete graph K_n with n vertices, the genus g can be calculated using the formula:\n\ng = (1/2) * (n - 3) * (n - 4) + 1\n\nIn the case of a complete graph on six vertices (K_6), we can plug n = 6 into the formula:\n\ng = (1/2) * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) + 1\ng = (1/2) * 3 * 2 + 1\ng = 3 + 1\ng = 4\n\nSo, the genus of a complete graph on six vertices (K_6) is 4."
