    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. The general form of the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a₀/2 + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = 0 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for 0 < x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 dx + ∫[0, π] 1 dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is x evaluated from 0 to π:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [0 + (π - 0)] = 1\n\nNow let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x)cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0*cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] 1*cos(nx) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (1/n)*sin(nx) evaluated from 0 to π:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [0 + (1/n)*(sin(nπ) - sin(0))] = 0\n\nThis is because sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n.\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x)sin(nx) dx\n\nSplitting the integral into two parts:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0*sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] 1*sin(nx) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (-1/n)*cos(nx) evaluated from 0 to π:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [0 + (-1/n)*(cos(nπ) - cos(0))] = (-1/n)*(cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ[(-1/n)*(cos(nπ) - 1)sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity."
