    "message_1": "The Playfair Cipher uses a $5x5$ grid of letters to encrypt messages. If the plain text message is \"MATHISEASY\", and the key phrase is \"CRYPTO\", what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to create the 5x5 grid using the key phrase \"CRYPTO\". Remove duplicate letters from the key phrase and fill in the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\nThe grid will look like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A B D E\nF G H I K\nL M N S U\nV W X Z Q\n\nNow, we need to divide the plain text message \"MATHISEASY\" into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letters, insert an 'X' between them. If the plain text has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\nM A T H I S E A S Y\n(MA) (TH) (IS) (EA) (SY)\n\nNow, we will encrypt each pair using the grid:\n\n1. For MA, M is in the same row as A, so we replace M with the letter to its right (N) and A with the letter to its right (B). The encrypted pair is NB.\n2. For TH, T is in the same row as H, so we replace T with the letter to its right (O) and H with the letter to its right (I). The encrypted pair is OI.\n3. For IS, I and S are in the same column, so we replace I with the letter below it (K) and S with the letter below it (U). The encrypted pair is KU.\n4. For EA, E and A are in different rows and columns, so we replace E with the letter in the same row as E and the same column as A (Y), and A with the letter in the same row as A and the same column as E (R). The encrypted pair is YR.\n5. For SY, S and Y are in different rows and columns, so we replace S with the letter in the same row as S and the same column as Y (M), and Y with the letter in the same row as Y and the same column as S (T). The encrypted pair is MT.\n\nThe encrypted message is: NBOIKUYRMT"
