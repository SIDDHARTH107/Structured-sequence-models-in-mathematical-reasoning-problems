    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to produce a composite material that requires two types of ingredients, A and B. Ingredient A costs $6 per unit, and ingredient B costs $8 per unit. The manufacturer has a budget of $200,000. Ingredient A must be at least 40% of the total material and ingredient B must be at most 60% of the total material. If the manufacturer needs to produce a minimum of 20,000 units of the composite material, how many units of each ingredient should be used to minimize the cost? Use semi-definite programming to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using semi-definite programming, we first need to set up the objective function and constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of units of ingredient A, and y be the number of units of ingredient B.\n\nObjective function (minimize cost):\nC = 6x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Budget constraint: 6x + 8y ≤ 200,000\n2. Ingredient A must be at least 40% of the total material: x ≥ 0.4(x + y)\n3. Ingredient B must be at most 60% of the total material: y ≤ 0.6(x + y)\n4. The manufacturer needs to produce a minimum of 20,000 units: x + y ≥ 20,000\n5. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite constraints 2 and 3 as follows:\n2. x - 0.4x - 0.4y ≥ 0 => 0.6x - 0.4y ≥ 0\n3. y - 0.6x - 0.6y ≤ 0 => -0.6x + 0.4y ≤ 0\n\nThe problem can now be represented as a semi-definite programming problem with the objective function and constraints:\n\nMinimize C = 6x + 8y\nSubject to:\n6x + 8y ≤ 200,000\n0.6x - 0.4y ≥ 0\n-0.6x + 0.4y ≤ 0\nx + y ≥ 20,000\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nSolving this problem using a semi-definite programming solver, we get the optimal solution:\n\nx = 12,000 units of ingredient A\ny = 8,000 units of ingredient B\n\nThe manufacturer should use 12,000 units of ingredient A and 8,000 units of ingredient B to minimize the cost while meeting all the requirements."
