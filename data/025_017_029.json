    "message_2": "To find the minimal resolution of singularities of the algebraic variety given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 1$, we first need to find the singular points of the variety. A point is singular if the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to each variable vanish simultaneously at that point.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - 1) = 4x^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - 1) = 4y^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - 1) = 4z^3$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z)$ where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$4x^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$4y^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\n$4z^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 0$\n\nThe only point where all these conditions are satisfied is the origin $(0, 0, 0)$. However, this point does not lie on the variety since it does not satisfy the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 1$. Therefore, the given variety has no singular points.\n\nSince the variety has no singular points, it is already smooth, and the minimal resolution of singularities is the variety itself, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 1$."
