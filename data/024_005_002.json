    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (2, 0, 0), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n2. Compute the Gaussian curvature (K) and the mean curvature (H).\n3. Solve the quadratic equation to find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2).\n\nStep 1: Find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial derivatives of the surface with respect to u and v:\n\n∂r/∂u = <1, 2u, 1>\n∂r/∂v = <2, -2v, -1>\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form (e, f, g).\n\nE = <∂r/∂u, ∂r/∂u> = 1^2 + (2u)^2 + 1^2 = 4u^2 + 2\nF = <∂r/∂u, ∂r/∂v> = 1*2 + 2u*(-2v) + 1*(-1) = 2 - 4uv\nG = <∂r/∂v, ∂r/∂v> = 2^2 + (-2v)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivatives of the surface with respect to u and v:\n\n∂²r/∂u² = <0, 2, 0>\n∂²r/∂u∂v = <0, -2v, 0>\n∂²r/∂v² = <0, -2, 0>\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form (e, f, g).\n\ne = <∂²r/∂u², N> = 2\nf = <∂²r/∂u∂v, N> = -2v\ng = <∂²r/∂v², N> = -2\n\nStep 2: Compute the Gaussian curvature (K) and the mean curvature (H).\n\nWe can compute the Gaussian curvature (K) using the formula:\n\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (2, 0, 0), we have u = 2 and v = 0. So, E = 4*2^2 + 2 = 18, F = 2, G = 4, e = 2, f = 0, and g = -2.\n\nK = (2*(-2) - 0^2) / (18*4 - 2^2) = -4 / 68 = -1/17\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature (H) using the formula:\n\nH = (eG - 2fF + gE) / 2(EG - F^2)\n\nH = (2*4 - 2*0 - 2*18) / 2(18*4 - 2^2) = (-28) / (68) = -7/17\n\nStep 3: Solve the quadratic equation to find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2).\n\nThe principal curvatures (k1 and k2) are the roots of the following quadratic equation:\n\n(k - H)^2 - K = 0\n\n(k + 7/17)^2 - (-1/17) = 0\n\nLet's solve this quadratic equation:\n\nk^2 + (14/17)k + 49/289 - 17/289 = 0\nk^2 + (14/17)k + 32/289 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nk = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nk1, k2 = (-(14/17) ± √((14/17)^2 - 4(32/289))) / 2\n\nk1, k2 = (-(14/17) ± √(196/289 - 128/289)) / 2\nk1, k2 = (-(14/17) ± √(68/289)) / 2\n\nk1 = (-7/17) + √(17)/17\nk2 = (-7/17) - √(17)/17\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (2, 0, 0) are k1 = (-7/17) + √(17)/17 and k2 = (-7/17) - √(17)/17."
