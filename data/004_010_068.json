    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 1, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the given function, we have:\n\nAntiderivative of 2x^3: (2/4)x^(3+1) = (1/2)x^4\nAntiderivative of 5x^2: (5/3)x^(2+1) = (5/3)x^3\nAntiderivative of -4x: (-4/2)x^(1+1) = -2x^2\nAntiderivative of 1: 1x^(0+1) = x\n\nNow, we combine these antiderivatives and include the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = (1/2)x^4 + (5/3)x^3 - 2x^2 + x + C"
