    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (4x^2 - 6x - 8)/(2x - 3) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function u(x) and the denominator function v(x):\n\nu(x) = 4x^2 - 6x - 8\nv(x) = 2x - 3\n\nNow we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(4x^2 - 6x - 8)/dx = 8x - 6\nv'(x) = d(2x - 3)/dx = 2\n\nThe quotient rule states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x)/v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / [v(x)]^2\n\nNow we can plug in the derivatives and functions we found earlier:\n\nf'(x) = [(8x - 6)(2x - 3) - (4x^2 - 6x - 8)(2)] / (2x - 3)^2\n\nNow we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = [(16x^2 - 24x - 12x + 18) - (8x^2 - 12x - 16)] / (2x - 3)^2\n\nf'(x) = [(16x^2 - 36x + 18) - (8x^2 - 12x - 16)] / (2x - 3)^2\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = (8x^2 - 24x + 34) / (2x - 3)^2\n\nSo the derivative of the function f(x) = (4x^2 - 6x - 8)/(2x - 3) is:\n\nf'(x) = (8x^2 - 24x + 34) / (2x - 3)^2"
