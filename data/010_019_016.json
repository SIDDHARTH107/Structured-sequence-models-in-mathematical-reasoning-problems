    "message_2": "Recall that a Morse function is a smooth function with non-degenerate critical points, and the Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $i$ is at least the $i$-th Betti number $b_i$ of the manifold. In particular, we have:\n\n$$k = \\sum_{i=0}^{2} c_i \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^{2} b_i,$$\n\nwhere $c_i$ is the number of critical points of index $i$.\n\nFor a compact orientable surface $M$ of genus $g$, we have the following Betti numbers:\n\n$$b_0 = 1, \\quad b_1 = 2g, \\quad b_2 = 1.$$\n\nNow, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ is given by the alternating sum of the Betti numbers:\n\n$$\\chi(M) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2g + 1 = 2 - 2g.$$\n\nSince $k \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^{2} b_i = 2 + 2g$, we have:\n\n$$\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g \\leq k.$$"
