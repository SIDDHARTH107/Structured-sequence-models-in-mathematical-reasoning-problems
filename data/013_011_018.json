    "message_1": "Consider two firms A and B competing in a market with identical products. Their cost functions are as follows: \n\n- Firm A: c(q) = 2q \n- Firm B: c(q) = 4q^2 \n\nThe demand function of the market is given by: P = 10 - q, where P is the market price and q is the total quantity supplied by the two firms. \n\nWhat quantity should each firm produce to maximize its profit? What price will prevail in the market and what will be the total quantity supplied?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity for each firm, we first need to find their respective marginal cost (MC) functions. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function with respect to quantity.\n\nFirm A:\nc(q) = 2q\nMC_A = dc(q)/dq = 2\n\nFirm B:\nc(q) = 4q^2\nMC_B = dc(q)/dq = 8q\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse demand function, which gives us the quantity as a function of price. The given demand function is P = 10 - q. Solving for q, we get:\n\nq = 10 - P\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction functions for each firm. A reaction function shows the optimal quantity a firm should produce, given the quantity produced by its competitor. We can find the reaction functions using the Cournot competition model.\n\nLet q_A and q_B be the quantities produced by Firm A and Firm B, respectively. The total quantity supplied in the market is q = q_A + q_B. We can substitute this into the inverse demand function:\n\nq = 10 - P\nq_A + q_B = 10 - P\n\nNow, we can find the revenue functions for each firm:\n\nR_A = P * q_A = (10 - q_A - q_B) * q_A\nR_B = P * q_B = (10 - q_A - q_B) * q_B\n\nNext, we find the profit functions for each firm by subtracting their cost functions from their revenue functions:\n\nπ_A = R_A - c_A(q_A) = (10 - q_A - q_B) * q_A - 2q_A\nπ_B = R_B - c_B(q_B) = (10 - q_A - q_B) * q_B - 4q_B^2\n\nTo find the optimal quantity for each firm, we take the derivative of their profit functions with respect to their own quantity and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπ_A/dq_A = 0\ndπ_B/dq_B = 0\n\nTaking the derivatives, we get:\n\ndπ_A/dq_A = 10 - 2q_A - q_B - 2 = 0\ndπ_B/dq_B = 10 - q_A - 2q_B - 8q_B = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nq_A = 3\nq_B = 2\n\nSo, Firm A should produce 3 units, and Firm B should produce 2 units to maximize their profits.\n\nNow, we can find the market price and total quantity supplied. We know that q = q_A + q_B, so:\n\nq = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSubstituting this into the demand function:\n\nP = 10 - q = 10 - 5 = 5\n\nThe market price will be $5, and the total quantity supplied will be 5 units."
