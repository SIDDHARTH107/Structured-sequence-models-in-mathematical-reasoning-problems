    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to determine the optimal amount of two raw materials, A and B, to use in the production of a particular product. Material A costs $5 per unit and material B costs $3 per unit. The total cost of producing each unit of the product is given by the function:\n\nC(x,y) = 5x + 3y + x^2 + xy + y^2\n\nwhere x represents the amount of material A used and y represents the amount of material B used. The company wants to produce at least 50 units of the product. Use tabu search to determine the optimal values of x and y to minimize the total cost of production.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the optimal solution in a large search space. It uses a memory structure called the tabu list to keep track of previously visited solutions and avoid revisiting them. In this problem, we will use tabu search to find the optimal values of x and y to minimize the total cost of production.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the search\nLet's start with an initial solution (x, y) = (25, 25), which satisfies the constraint of producing at least 50 units of the product. Calculate the cost for this initial solution:\n\nC(25, 25) = 5(25) + 3(25) + 25^2 + 25(25) + 25^2 = 3125\n\nStep 2: Define the neighborhood\nWe will define the neighborhood of a solution as all the solutions that can be obtained by changing the values of x and y by Â±1. For example, the neighbors of the initial solution (25, 25) are (24, 25), (26, 25), (25, 24), and (25, 26).\n\nStep 3: Perform the tabu search\nWe will perform the tabu search for a fixed number of iterations or until the cost does not improve for a certain number of consecutive iterations. In each iteration, we will explore the neighborhood of the current solution and select the best non-tabu solution as the next solution. If the new solution has a lower cost than the current best solution, we will update the best solution.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the tabu search algorithm for this problem:\n\n1. Set the initial solution (x, y) = (25, 25) and calculate its cost.\n2. Initialize the tabu list with a certain size (e.g., 10).\n3. Set the number of iterations (e.g., 100) and the stopping criterion (e.g., no improvement for 20 consecutive iterations).\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Generate the neighborhood of the current solution.\n   b. Select the best non-tabu solution from the neighborhood.\n   c. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list is full.\n   d. If the new solution has a lower cost than the current best solution, update the best solution.\n   e. If the stopping criterion is met, stop the search.\n5. Return the best solution found.\n\nAfter running the tabu search algorithm, we will obtain the optimal values of x and y that minimize the total cost of production. Note that the actual optimal solution may vary depending on the parameters of the tabu search algorithm (e.g., tabu list size, number of iterations, and stopping criterion)."
