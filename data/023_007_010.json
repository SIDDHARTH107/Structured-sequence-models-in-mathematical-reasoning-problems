    "message_2": "To find the frequency spectrum of the given signal f(t) using the Fourier transform, we first need to express the given signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nEuler's formula: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)\n\nSo, we can rewrite f(t) as:\n\nf(t) = Im{e^(i2π(3t + 1))} + Re{e^(i2π(5t - 7))}\n\nNow, we can apply the Fourier transform F(ω) to f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(i2π(3t + 1)) + e^(i2π(5t - 7))] * e^(-iωt) dt\n     = ∫[e^(i2π(3t + 1)) * e^(-iωt) + e^(i2π(5t - 7)) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n     = ∫[e^(i2π(3t + 1 - ωt)) + e^(i2π(5t - 7 - ωt))] dt\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nF(ω) = ∫e^(i2π(3t + 1 - ωt)) dt + ∫e^(i2π(5t - 7 - ωt)) dt\n\nThe integrals are of the form ∫e^(i2π(at)) dt, which evaluates to (1/(2πa)) * e^(i2π(at)) + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, since we are dealing with Fourier transforms, we can ignore the constant term.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nF(ω) = (1/(2π(3 - ω))) * e^(i2π(3t + 1 - ωt)) + (1/(2π(5 - ω))) * e^(i2π(5t - 7 - ωt))\n\nThis is the frequency spectrum of the given signal f(t) using the Fourier transform. The spectrum has two main components, one at ω = 3 and another at ω = 5, which correspond to the frequencies of the sine and cosine terms in the original signal."
