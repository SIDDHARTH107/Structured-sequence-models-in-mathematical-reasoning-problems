    "message_2": "To show that if $v$ has a non-degenerate periodic orbit and $w$ is complete, then $w$ also has a periodic orbit, we will use the following lemma:\n\nLemma: Let $M$ be a symplectic manifold of dimension $4$ with symplectic form $\\omega$. If $v$ and $w$ are two Hamiltonian vector fields on $M$ such that $[v,w]=-X_h$ for some function $h:M\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, then for any point $p\\in M$, there exists a unique curve $\\gamma_p:[0,1]\\rightarrow M$ such that $\\gamma_p(0)=p$, $\\gamma_p(1)=\\phi_v^1(p)$, and $\\gamma_p'(t)=w(\\gamma_p(t))$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$, where $\\phi_v^1$ is the time-1 flow of $v$.\n\nProof of Lemma: Since $[v,w]=-X_h$, we have that $L_vw=-dh$, where $L_v$ is the Lie derivative along $v$. By Cartan's magic formula, we have $L_vw=i_v(dw)+di_vw=i_v(-dh)+di_vw$. Thus, $i_v(dw-dh)=-di_vw$. Integrating both sides along the curve $\\phi_v^t(p)$, we get\n$$\\int_0^1 i_v(dw-dh)(\\phi_v^t(p))dt=-\\int_0^1 di_vw(\\phi_v^t(p))dt.$$\n\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have\n$$\\int_0^1 i_v(dw-dh)(\\phi_v^t(p))dt=w(\\phi_v^1(p))-w(p).$$\n\nSince $v$ has a non-degenerate periodic orbit, there exists a point $p\\in M$ such that $\\phi_v^1(p)=p$. Then, we have\n$$\\int_0^1 i_v(dw-dh)(\\phi_v^t(p))dt=w(p)-w(p)=0.$$\n\nThus, $i_v(dw-dh)(\\phi_v^t(p))=0$ for almost every $t\\in[0,1]$. Since $v$ is non-vanishing, we have $dw-dh=0$ for almost every $t\\in[0,1]$. Therefore, $w$ is the Hamiltonian vector field of the function $h$ along the curve $\\phi_v^t(p)$ for almost every $t\\in[0,1]$. This implies that there exists a unique curve $\\gamma_p:[0,1]\\rightarrow M$ such that $\\gamma_p(0)=p$, $\\gamma_p(1)=\\phi_v^1(p)$, and $\\gamma_p'(t)=w(\\gamma_p(t))$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$.\n\nNow, let's return to the main problem. Since $v$ has a non-degenerate periodic orbit, there exists a point $p\\in M$ such that $\\phi_v^1(p)=p$. By the lemma, there exists a unique curve $\\gamma_p:[0,1]\\rightarrow M$ such that $\\gamma_p(0)=p$, $\\gamma_p(1)=\\phi_v^1(p)=p$, and $\\gamma_p'(t)=w(\\gamma_p(t))$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$. Since $\\gamma_p(0)=\\gamma_p(1)$, we have that $w$ has a periodic orbit.\n\nNow, let's consider the vector field $w=x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}-y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This vector field is the Hamiltonian vector field of the function $h(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ with respect to the standard symplectic form $\\omega=dx\\wedge dy$. The time-1 flow of $w$ is a rotation by angle $2\\pi$, which is periodic. Therefore, the vector field $w$ has a periodic orbit."
