    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest Game, there are 5 contestants who are asked to pick a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the one whose number is the closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers picked. What number should each contestant pick to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, each contestant should try to predict what the other contestants will pick and then choose a number that is 2/3 of the predicted average.\n\nLet's assume that all contestants think rationally and believe that the others will also pick rationally. If all contestants think that the others will pick a number uniformly at random between 0 and 100, then the expected average would be 50. In this case, each contestant should pick 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all contestants think that the others will pick 33.33, then the expected average would be 33.33, and each contestant should pick 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, leading to the following sequence of numbers: 33.33, 22.22, 14.81, 9.87, 6.58, and so on. This sequence converges to 0. In practice, the optimal number to pick would depend on the level of rationality of the other contestants and how many iterations of this thought process they go through.\n\nIn summary, there is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on the assumptions made about the other contestants' choices. However, picking a number around 20-30 might be a reasonable strategy, as it accounts for a few iterations of the thought process described above."
