    "message_2": "Yes, the sequence (x_n) converges to a point, but not in X.\n\nTo see this, let's first recall the definition of convergence. A sequence (x_n) converges to a limit L if for every ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the distance between x_n and L is less than ε, i.e., |x_n - L| < ε.\n\nNow, consider the sequence (x_n) = 1/n in X. We claim that this sequence converges to the limit L = 0. To prove this, let ε > 0 be given. We need to find a natural number N such that for all n > N, |1/n - 0| < ε.\n\nSince 1/n > 0 for all n ∈ ℕ, we have |1/n - 0| = 1/n. Now, we need to find N such that 1/n < ε for all n > N. Since ε > 0, we can use the Archimedean property of real numbers, which states that for any real number x > 0, there exists a natural number n such that 1/n < x. In our case, x = ε, so there exists a natural number N such that 1/N < ε.\n\nNow, for all n > N, we have 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε, so |1/n - 0| < ε. Thus, by the definition of convergence, the sequence (x_n) converges to the limit L = 0.\n\nHowever, note that 0 ∉ X, since X = {1/n | n ∈ ℕ}. So, while the sequence (x_n) converges to a point, that point is not in the set X."
