    "message_2": "To decipher the Vigenere cipher text \"UFVFMZ\" with the keyword \"MATHS\", we need to reverse the Vigenere cipher process.\n\nThe Vigenere cipher uses a table called the Vigenere square, which consists of 26 rows of the alphabet, each shifted one position to the left compared to the row above it. To decipher, we will use the keyword letter to select the row in the Vigenere square and the cipher text letter to select the column. The letter at the intersection of the row and column will be the plaintext letter.\n\nKeyword: MATHS\nCipher text: UFVFMZ\n\n1. For the first letter:\nKeyword letter: M (12th letter in the alphabet)\nCipher text letter: U (20th letter in the alphabet)\nIn the Vigenere square, go to the row starting with M and find the letter U in that row. The column it is in corresponds to the plaintext letter.\nPlaintext letter: T\n\n2. For the second letter:\nKeyword letter: A (0th letter in the alphabet)\nCipher text letter: F (5th letter in the alphabet)\nIn the Vigenere square, go to the row starting with A and find the letter F in that row. The column it is in corresponds to the plaintext letter.\nPlaintext letter: E\n\n3. For the third letter:\nKeyword letter: T (19th letter in the alphabet)\nCipher text letter: V (21st letter in the alphabet)\nIn the Vigenere square, go to the row starting with T and find the letter V in that row. The column it is in corresponds to the plaintext letter.\nPlaintext letter: S\n\n4. For the fourth letter:\nKeyword letter: H (7th letter in the alphabet)\nCipher text letter: F (5th letter in the alphabet)\nIn the Vigenere square, go to the row starting with H and find the letter F in that row. The column it is in corresponds to the plaintext letter.\nPlaintext letter: T\n\n5. For the fifth letter:\nKeyword letter: S (18th letter in the alphabet)\nCipher text letter: M (12th letter in the alphabet)\nIn the Vigenere square, go to the row starting with S and find the letter M in that row. The column it is in corresponds to the plaintext letter.\nPlaintext letter: I\n\n6. For the sixth letter:\nKeyword letter: M (12th letter in the alphabet)\nCipher text letter: Z (25th letter in the alphabet)\nIn the Vigenere square, go to the row starting with M and find the letter Z in that row. The column it is in corresponds to the plaintext letter.\nPlaintext letter: G\n\nSo, the original plaintext is \"TESTIG\"."
