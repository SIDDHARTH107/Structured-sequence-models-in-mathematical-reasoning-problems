    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = 4x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,5), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\nr(u, v) = (u, v, 4u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 8u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form, which consists of the coefficients E, F, and G:\nE = <r_u, r_u> = 1^2 + 0^2 + (8u)^2 = 1 + 64u^2\nF = <r_u, r_v> = 1*0 + 0*1 + 8u*2v = 16uv\nG = <r_v, r_v> = 0^2 + 1^2 + (2v)^2 = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we find the second fundamental form, which consists of the coefficients L, M, and N. To do this, we first find the normal vector N:\nN = r_u × r_v = (8u, -16u, 1) × (2v, 8v, -1) = (-16uv, 8u^2 + 4v^2, 16uv)\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nr_uu = (∂^2r/∂u^2) = (0, 0, 8)\nr_uv = (∂^2r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂^2r/∂v^2) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we find the coefficients L, M, and N:\nL = <r_uu, N> = 0*8u - 16u*0 + 8*(8u^2 + 4v^2) = 64u^2 + 32v^2\nM = <r_uv, N> = 0*8u - 16u*0 + 0*(8u^2 + 4v^2) = 0\nN = <r_vv, N> = 0*8u - 16u*0 + 2*(8u^2 + 4v^2) = 16u^2 + 8v^2\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\nH = (1/2) * (EG - F^2) * (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,5), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nE = 1 + 64(1)^2 = 65\nF = 16(1)(1) = 16\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 64(1)^2 + 32(1)^2 = 96\nM = 0\nN = 16(1)^2 + 8(1)^2 = 24\n\nNow, we plug these values into the formula for H:\nH = (1/2) * (65*24 - 16^2) / (65*5 - 16^2)^2\nH = (1/2) * (1560 - 256) / (325 - 256)^2\nH = (1/2) * (1304) / (69)^2\nH = 1304 / (2 * 69^2)\nH ≈ 0.273\n\nTherefore, the mean curvature of the surface z = 4x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,5) is approximately 0.273."
