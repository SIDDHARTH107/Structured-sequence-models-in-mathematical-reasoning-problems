    "message_1": "A company is trying to select a team of 4 people out of 8 employees to work on a project. In how many ways can the team be selected?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to select a team of 4 people out of 8 employees, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (8 in this case), k is the number of people to be selected (4 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 different ways to select a team of 4 people out of 8 employees."
