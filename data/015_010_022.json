    "message_1": "Consider a simple chaotic system given by the equation: \n\n$x_{n+1} = 4x_n(1-x_n)$\n\nwhere $x_0 = 0.1$ and $n=1,2,3,...$. \n\nUsing the Poincaré map, find the period-$3$ orbit of the system.",
    "message_2": "To find the period-3 orbit of the system, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the system returns to the same value after three iterations. In other words, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the following equation:\n\n$x_{n+3} = x_n$\n\nApplying the given equation for three iterations:\n\n$x_{n+1} = 4x_n(1-x_n)$\n\n$x_{n+2} = 4x_{n+1}(1-x_{n+1})$\n\n$x_{n+3} = 4x_{n+2}(1-x_{n+2})$\n\nNow, we substitute $x_{n+3} = x_n$:\n\n$x_n = 4x_{n+2}(1-x_{n+2})$\n\nSubstitute $x_{n+2}$ with the second equation:\n\n$x_n = 4[4x_{n+1}(1-x_{n+1})](1-[4x_{n+1}(1-x_{n+1})])$\n\nSubstitute $x_{n+1}$ with the first equation:\n\n$x_n = 4[4[4x_n(1-x_n)](1-[4x_n(1-x_n)])](1-[4[4x_n(1-x_n)](1-[4x_n(1-x_n)])])$\n\nNow, we have an equation in terms of $x_n$ only. Let $x = x_n$:\n\n$x = 4[4[4x(1-x)](1-[4x(1-x)])](1-[4[4x(1-x)](1-[4x(1-x)])])$\n\nThis is a polynomial equation of degree 8. Solving this equation analytically is quite challenging. However, we can find the period-3 orbit numerically using a root-finding algorithm such as the Newton-Raphson method or by iterating the map and looking for a cycle of period 3.\n\nUsing a numerical method, we find that the period-3 orbit has the following approximate values:\n\n$x_1 \\approx 0.2137$\n\n$x_2 \\approx 0.4459$\n\n$x_3 \\approx 0.8213$\n\nThese values correspond to a period-3 orbit of the given chaotic system."
