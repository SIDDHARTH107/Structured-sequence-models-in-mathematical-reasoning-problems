    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the length of its hypotenuse, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 10 cm and b = 8 cm.\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (10 cm)² + (8 cm)²\nc² = 100 cm² + 64 cm²\nc² = 164 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √(164 cm²)\nc ≈ 12.8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is approximately 12.8 cm, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter."
