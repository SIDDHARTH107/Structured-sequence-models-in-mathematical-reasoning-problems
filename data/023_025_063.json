    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a signal f(t) = 3cos(5t) + 2sin(7t) can be found using the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of the function f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of each component of the signal separately:\n\n1. Fourier transform of 3cos(5t):\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[3cos(5t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite cos(5t) as:\n\ncos(5t) = (1/2)[e^(j5t) + e^(-j5t)]\n\nSo, F1(ω) = 3/2 * ∫[(e^(j5t) + e^(-j5t)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 * [∫(e^(j(5-ω)t) dt) + ∫(e^(-j(5+ω)t) dt)]\n\nThe Fourier transform of an exponential function is a Dirac delta function:\n\nF1(ω) = 3/2 * [π(δ(ω-5) + δ(ω+5))]\n\n2. Fourier transform of 2sin(7t):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[2sin(7t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite sin(7t) as:\n\nsin(7t) = (1/2j)[e^(j7t) - e^(-j7t)]\n\nSo, F2(ω) = (1/j) * ∫[(e^(j7t) - e^(-j7t)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF2(ω) = (1/j) * [∫(e^(j(7-ω)t) dt) - ∫(e^(-j(7+ω)t) dt)]\n\nThe Fourier transform of an exponential function is a Dirac delta function:\n\nF2(ω) = (1/j) * [π(δ(ω-7) - δ(ω+7))]\n\nNow, we can combine the Fourier transforms of both components:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) = 3/2 * [π(δ(ω-5) + δ(ω+5))] + (1/j) * [π(δ(ω-7) - δ(ω+7))]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given signal in the frequency domain.\n\nIn materials science, Fourier transform can be used to analyze the molecular structure of a material by studying its diffraction pattern. When X-rays or electrons are scattered by a material, they create a diffraction pattern that contains information about the arrangement of atoms in the material. By applying the Fourier transform to this diffraction pattern, we can obtain the electron density distribution in the material, which can be used to determine its molecular structure. In this specific case, the Fourier transform of the given signal represents two frequency components (5 and 7), which could correspond to two different periodicities in the material's structure. By analyzing these frequency components, we can gain insights into the arrangement of atoms and the overall structure of the material."
