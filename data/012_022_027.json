    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices contains either a complete subgraph with m vertices or an independent set with n vertices. In this case, we are looking for the Ramsey number R(4, 4).\n\nThe Ramsey number R(4, 4) is known to be 18. This means that in any graph with 18 vertices, there is either a complete subgraph with 4 vertices (a clique of size 4) or an independent set with 4 vertices (a set of 4 vertices with no edges between them)."
