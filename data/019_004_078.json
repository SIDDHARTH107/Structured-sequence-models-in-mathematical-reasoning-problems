    "message_1": "Consider a system that can have two possible states: On and Off. Let the state of the system at time t be denoted by S(t). Using temporal logic, write a formula that represents the property \"the system has been On for at least 5 consecutive time units\". Then, determine if the following sequence of system states satisfies this property: Off, On, On, Off, On, On, On, Off, Off, On.",
    "message_2": "Using temporal logic, we can represent the property \"the system has been On for at least 5 consecutive time units\" with the following formula:\n\nF(S(t) = On ∧ X(S(t+1) = On) ∧ X^2(S(t+2) = On) ∧ X^3(S(t+3) = On) ∧ X^4(S(t+4) = On))\n\nThis formula states that there exists a time t in the future (F) where the system is On, and for the next 4 consecutive time units (X, X^2, X^3, X^4), the system remains On.\n\nNow, let's check if the given sequence of system states satisfies this property:\n\nOff, On, On, Off, On, On, On, Off, Off, On\n\nWe can see that there is no subsequence of 5 consecutive \"On\" states in the given sequence. Therefore, the sequence does not satisfy the property."
