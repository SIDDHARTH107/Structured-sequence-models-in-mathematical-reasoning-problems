    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the rectangular field that would give it the maximum area, we can use the following formula:\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2 * (length + width)\n\nGiven the perimeter is 200 meters, we can write the equation as:\n\n200 = 2 * (length + width)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n100 = length + width\n\nNow, we need to express the width in terms of the length:\n\nwidth = 100 - length\n\nThe area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea (A) = length * width\n\nSubstitute the expression for width in terms of length into the area formula:\n\nA = length * (100 - length)\n\nA = 100 * length - length^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to length and set it equal to zero:\n\ndA/dlength = 100 - 2 * length = 0\n\nSolve for length:\n\n2 * length = 100\n\nlength = 50 meters\n\nNow, substitute the length back into the expression for width:\n\nwidth = 100 - length\n\nwidth = 100 - 50\n\nwidth = 50 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular field that would give it the maximum area are 50 meters by 50 meters."
