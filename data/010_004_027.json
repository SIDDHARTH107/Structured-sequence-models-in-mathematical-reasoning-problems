    "message_2": "To determine if the set A is compact, we need to check if it satisfies the two properties of compactness: being closed and bounded.\n\nThe set A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ} is a subset of the real numbers. Let's analyze each property:\n\n1. Boundedness: A set is bounded if there exists a real number M such that |x| ≤ M for all x in the set. In this case, we can see that all elements of A are positive and less than or equal to 1 (since n is a natural number and n ≥ 1). Therefore, A is bounded.\n\n2. Closedness: A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. The limit points of A are the points that can be approached arbitrarily closely by elements of A. In this case, we can see that 0 is a limit point of A, since the sequence 1/n converges to 0 as n goes to infinity. However, 0 is not an element of A, since there is no natural number n such that 1/n = 0. Therefore, A is not closed.\n\nSince A is bounded but not closed, the set A is not compact."
