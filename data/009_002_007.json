    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student studying modeling the spread of infectious diseases using differential equations:\n\nSuppose a population of 10,000 individuals is initially infected with a new disease. The rate of infection is modeled by the differential equation dI/dt = 0.2(I/N)(N-I), where I(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t, N is the total population, and the constant 0.2 represents the rate of transmission. Assume that there are no recovery or vaccination processes in place. What is the maximum number of infected individuals at any given time, and at what time does this occur?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of infected individuals and the time at which this occurs, we need to analyze the given differential equation:\n\ndI/dt = 0.2(I/N)(N-I)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in terms of I and t:\n\ndI/dt = 0.2(I/10000)(10000-I)\n\nNow, we'll solve this differential equation using the method of separation of variables. We'll rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1/(I(10000-I))) dI = 0.2 dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/(I(10000-I))) dI = ∫0.2 dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1/(I(10000-I)) = A/I + B/(10000-I)\n\nMultiplying both sides by I(10000-I), we get:\n\n1 = A(10000-I) + B(I)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for I:\n\nIf I = 0, then 1 = 10000A, so A = 1/10000.\n\nIf I = 10000, then 1 = 10000B, so B = 1/10000.\n\nNow we can rewrite the integral:\n\n∫(1/(I(10000-I))) dI = ∫((1/10000)/I + (1/10000)/(10000-I)) dI\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n(1/10000)∫(1/I + 1/(10000-I)) dI = 0.2∫dt\n\n(1/10000)(∫(1/I) dI + ∫(1/(10000-I)) dI) = 0.2∫dt\n\n(1/10000)(ln|I| - ln|10000-I|) = 0.2t + C\n\nNow, we'll solve for the constant C using the initial condition I(0) = 10000:\n\n(1/10000)(ln|10000| - ln|0|) = 0.2(0) + C\n\nC = ln(1) = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\n(1/10000)(ln|I| - ln|10000-I|) = 0.2t\n\nTo find the maximum number of infected individuals, we need to find the critical points of I(t) by taking the derivative with respect to t and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndI/dt = 0.2(I/N)(N-I) = 0\n\n0.2(I/10000)(10000-I) = 0\n\nThis occurs when I = 0 or I = 10000. Since we are looking for the maximum number of infected individuals, we can ignore the case where I = 0.\n\nThus, the maximum number of infected individuals is 10000.\n\nTo find the time at which this occurs, we can plug I = 10000 back into the equation:\n\n(1/10000)(ln|10000| - ln|0|) = 0.2t\n\n0 = 0.2t\n\nt = 0\n\nSo, the maximum number of infected individuals (10000) occurs at time t = 0."
