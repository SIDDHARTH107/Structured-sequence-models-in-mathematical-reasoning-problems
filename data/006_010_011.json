    "message_1": "What is the probability that among a group of 1000 people, 120 are affected by a certain disease if the overall prevalence of the disease in the population is 6%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) in n trials (the group of 1000 people)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of success (the prevalence of the disease, which is 6% or 0.06)\n- x is the number of successes (120 people affected by the disease)\n- n is the number of trials (1000 people)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate nCx, which is:\n\nnCx = n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).\n\nnCx = 1000! / (120! * (1000-120)!)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(120) = (1000! / (120! * 880!)) * (0.06^120) * (1-0.06)^(1000-120)\n\nP(120) = (1000! / (120! * 880!)) * (0.06^120) * (0.94^880)\n\nCalculating this expression, we get:\n\nP(120) â‰ˆ 0.0014\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 120 people out of 1000 are affected by the disease is approximately 0.14% or 0.0014."
