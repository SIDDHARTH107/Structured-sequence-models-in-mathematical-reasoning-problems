    "message_2": "The quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a\n\nFor the equation x² + 8x + 16 = 0, the coefficients are a = 1, b = 8, and c = 16.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-(8) ± √((8)² - 4(1)(16))) / (2(1))\n\nx = (-8 ± √(64 - 64)) / 2\n\nx = (-8 ± √(0)) / 2\n\nSince the square root of 0 is 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nx = (-8 ± 0) / 2\n\nx = -8 / 2\n\nx = -4\n\nSo, the solution to the equation x² + 8x + 16 = 0 is x = -4."
