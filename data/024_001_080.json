    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to the parameter $t$. \n\nFirst derivatives:\n$x'(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = 6t$\n$y'(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = 12t^2$\n$z'(t) = \\frac{dz}{dt} = 5$\n\nSecond derivatives:\n$x''(t) = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 6$\n$y''(t) = \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = 24t$\n$z''(t) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature, denoted as $\\kappa(t)$, using the formula:\n\n$\\kappa(t) = \\frac{||\\textbf{T}'(t)||}{||\\textbf{r}'(t)||^3}$\n\nWhere $\\textbf{r}'(t) = \\langle x'(t), y'(t), z'(t) \\rangle$ is the tangent vector and $\\textbf{T}'(t) = \\langle x''(t), y''(t), z''(t) \\rangle$ is the derivative of the tangent vector.\n\nAt $t=1$, we have:\n\n$\\textbf{r}'(1) = \\langle 6, 12, 5 \\rangle$\n$\\textbf{T}'(1) = \\langle 6, 24, 0 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitudes of these vectors:\n\n$||\\textbf{r}'(1)|| = \\sqrt{6^2 + 12^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{205}$\n$||\\textbf{T}'(1)|| = \\sqrt{6^2 + 24^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{720}$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature at $t=1$:\n\n$\\kappa(1) = \\frac{||\\textbf{T}'(1)||}{||\\textbf{r}'(1)||^3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{720}}{(\\sqrt{205})^3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{720}}{205\\sqrt{205}}$\n\nNext, we need to find the torsion, denoted as $\\tau(t)$. We can use the formula:\n\n$\\tau(t) = \\frac{(\\textbf{r}'(t) \\times \\textbf{T}'(t)) \\cdot \\textbf{T}''(t)}{||\\textbf{r}'(t) \\times \\textbf{T}'(t)||^2}$\n\nHowever, since the second derivative of the tangent vector $\\textbf{T}''(t)$ is zero in this case, the torsion $\\tau(t)$ will also be zero.\n\nSo, the curvature at $t=1$ is $\\kappa(1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{720}}{205\\sqrt{205}}$, and the torsion at $t=1$ is $\\tau(1) = 0$."
