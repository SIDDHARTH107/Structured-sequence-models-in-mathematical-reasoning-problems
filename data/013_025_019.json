    "message_1": "Consider two travelers who have lost their bags on a flight. They are told by the airline that their bags will be valued and compensated equally, up to a certain amount. The airline tells them that the maximum value of the claim allowed is $200.\n\nThe travelers must now decide how much to claim for their lost bag. If both claim an amount less than or equal to 100, the airline will pay each the amount claimed. If both claim an amount greater than 100, the airline will only pay each an amount of 100. However, if one claims less than or equal to 100 while the other claims over 100, then the one who claims more will receive 2 times the amount of the smaller claim and the smaller claimant will receive nothing.\n\nWhat is the dominant strategy for the two travelers and what is the likely outcome?",
    "message_2": "To find the dominant strategy for the two travelers, we need to analyze the possible outcomes based on their decisions.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both travelers claim less than or equal to 100:\nIn this case, both travelers will receive the amount they claimed.\n\n2. Both travelers claim more than 100:\nIn this case, both travelers will receive only 100 each.\n\n3. One traveler claims less than or equal to 100, and the other claims more than 100:\nThe traveler who claims more than 100 will receive 2 times the amount of the smaller claim, and the traveler who claims less than or equal to 100 will receive nothing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the dominant strategy for each traveler:\n\nFor Traveler A:\n- If Traveler B claims less than or equal to 100, Traveler A should claim more than 100 to receive 2 times the amount of Traveler B's claim.\n- If Traveler B claims more than 100, Traveler A should also claim more than 100 to receive 100.\n\nFor Traveler B:\n- If Traveler A claims less than or equal to 100, Traveler B should claim more than 100 to receive 2 times the amount of Traveler A's claim.\n- If Traveler A claims more than 100, Traveler B should also claim more than 100 to receive 100.\n\nThe dominant strategy for both travelers is to claim more than 100, as it guarantees them at least 100 in compensation, regardless of the other traveler's decision.\n\nThe likely outcome is that both travelers will claim more than 100, and the airline will pay each of them 100."
