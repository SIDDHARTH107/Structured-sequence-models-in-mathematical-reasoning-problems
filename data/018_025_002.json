    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of A and the result. Repeat the same process but this time find the symmetric difference of B and A, and find the intersection of B and the result. Show that the two intersections are not equal, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {4}\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and the result (A ∆ B):\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = A ∩ {1, 4} = {1}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A:\n\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B)\nB - A = {4}\nA - B = {1}\nB ∆ A = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B and the result (B ∆ A):\n\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = B ∩ {1, 4} = {4}\n\nWe can see that the two intersections are not equal:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1}\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = {4}\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
