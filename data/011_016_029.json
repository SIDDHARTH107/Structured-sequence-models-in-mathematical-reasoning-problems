    "message_1": "Suppose a designer wants to create a seating arrangement for a dinner party with six guests. How many ways can the designer arrange the guests at a circular table if each guest must be seated next to exactly two other guests?",
    "message_2": "In a circular arrangement, we can fix one guest's position and then arrange the remaining guests around the table. This eliminates the need to account for rotations of the same arrangement. \n\nThere are 5 remaining guests to be seated. We can arrange these 5 guests in a linear fashion, which would be 5! (5 factorial) ways. However, since the table is circular, we need to divide by 2 to account for the clockwise and counterclockwise arrangements, which are considered the same in a circular table.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the 6 guests at a circular table is:\n\n(5!)/2 = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/2 = 60 ways."
