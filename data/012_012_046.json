    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of graph G, we can use the inequality involving the number of vertices (n), the number of edges (m), and the girth (g) of a graph:\n\nm ≤ (n * (n - 1) / 2) - (n - g + 1) * (g - 2) / 2\n\nIn this case, n = 12 and m = 18. We will try different values of g and see which one satisfies the inequality.\n\n1. g = 3 (triangle)\n18 ≤ (12 * 11 / 2) - (12 - 3 + 1) * (3 - 2) / 2\n18 ≤ 66 - 45\n18 ≤ 21\n\nThe inequality holds for g = 3, so the girth of the graph G is 3. This means that the shortest cycle in the graph is a triangle."
