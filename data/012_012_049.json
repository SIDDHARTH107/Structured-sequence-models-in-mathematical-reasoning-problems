    "message_2": "To find the length of the shortest cycle in G, we can use the fact that the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph is related to the number of edges. Let's denote the minimum degree of a vertex in G as δ(G).\n\nSince G has 10 vertices and 15 edges, the average degree of a vertex in G is (2 * 15) / 10 = 3. Therefore, δ(G) must be at least 3, as the minimum degree cannot be less than the average degree.\n\nNow, let's consider a vertex v with degree δ(G). Since v has δ(G) edges connected to it, there are δ(G) other vertices connected to v. In the best-case scenario, these δ(G) vertices are all connected to each other, forming a complete subgraph. In this case, the shortest cycle involving v would be of length 3 (a triangle).\n\nHowever, if the δ(G) vertices are not all connected to each other, there must be at least one pair of vertices among them that are not directly connected. In this case, the shortest cycle involving v would be of length 4 (a quadrilateral).\n\nSince δ(G) is at least 3, the shortest cycle in G must be of length 3 or 4. To determine which is the case, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. If there is a vertex with degree 4 or more, then there must be a cycle of length 3 (a triangle) in G. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, a vertex with degree 4 would be connected to 4 other vertices, and by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these vertices must be connected to each other, forming a triangle.\n\nIf all vertices have degree 3, then the graph G is a 3-regular graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. In this case, the shortest cycle in G is of length 4 (a quadrilateral).\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest cycle in G is either 3 or 4."
