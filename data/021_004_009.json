    "message_2": "First, let's solve the numerical differentiation problem.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 3, we want to approximate f'(2) using a forward finite difference method with step size h = 0.1.\n\nThe forward finite difference method is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nSo, we need to find f(2) and f(2 + 0.1) and then plug them into the formula.\n\nf(2) = (2^3) - 2(2^2) + 5(2) - 3 = 8 - 8 + 10 - 3 = 7\nf(2 + 0.1) = ((2 + 0.1)^3) - 2((2 + 0.1)^2) + 5(2 + 0.1) - 3 = 8.271 - 8.82 + 10.5 - 3 = 6.951\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1 = (6.951 - 7) / 0.1 = -0.49\n\nNow, let's solve the numerical integration problem.\n\nWe want to estimate the integral of f(x) = sin(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2 using the trapezoidal rule with h = 0.1. The trapezoidal rule is given by:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ h * (0.5 * (f(x_0) + f(x_n)) + Σf(x_i))\n\nwhere x_0 = 0, x_n = π/2, and x_i are the points between x_0 and x_n with a step size of h.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of intervals (n) and the x_i values:\n\nn = (π/2 - 0) / 0.1 = π / (2 * 0.1) ≈ 15.7 ≈ 16 (rounded to the nearest integer)\n\nx_i values: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.5, 1.6 (total of 16 values)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the trapezoidal rule formula:\n\n∫sin(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 * (sin(0) + sin(π/2)) + Σsin(x_i))\n\nCompute the sum Σsin(x_i):\n\nΣsin(x_i) ≈ sin(0.1) + sin(0.2) + ... + sin(1.5) + sin(1.6) ≈ 9.983\n\nNow, plug this value into the formula:\n\n∫sin(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 * (0 + 1) + 9.983) = 0.1 * (0.5 + 9.983) = 0.1 * 10.483 ≈ 1.0483\n\nSo, the estimated integral of sin(x) from x = 0 to x = π/2 using the trapezoidal rule with h = 0.1 is approximately 1.0483."
