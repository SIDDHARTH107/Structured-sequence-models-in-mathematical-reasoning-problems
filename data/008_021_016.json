    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 5\n\n2x + 4y - 2z = 10\n\n4x + 8y - 4z = 20\n\nDetermine whether this system of linear equations has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions.",
    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations by dividing the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 4:\n\nx + 2y - z = 5\n\nx + 2y - z = 5 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\n\nx + 2y - z = 5 (after dividing the third equation by 4)\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, as there are an infinite number of points that satisfy all three equations."
