    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations is:\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  6 |\n|  1 -1  2 | -1 |\n|  3 -2  4 |  3 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will replace the second row with (-1/2) * (first row) + (second row) and replace the third row with (-3/2) * (first row) + (third row).\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  6  |\n|  0  -2   2 | -4  |\n|  0  -4.5  5.5 | -6 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will replace the third row with (-4.5/-2) * (second row) + (third row).\n\n|  2   3   -1 |  6  |\n|  0  -2    2 | -4  |\n|  0   0    1 |  2  |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Back-substitution\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 2.\n\nNow substitute z into the second row equation: -2y + 2(2) = -4. Solving for y, we get y = 1.\n\nFinally, substitute y and z into the first row equation: 2x + 3(1) - (2) = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = 2."
