    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge. A maximum independent set is an independent set with the largest possible number of vertices.\n\nTo find the maximum independent set in the given graph, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with an empty set and add vertices to the set one by one, ensuring that the new vertex is not connected to any vertex already in the set.\n\n1. Start with an empty set: {}\n2. Add vertex 1: {1}\n3. Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, so skip it.\n4. Add vertex 3: {1, 3}\n5. Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 2, so skip it.\n6. Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3, so skip it.\n7. Add vertex 7: {1, 3, 7}\n8. Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 5, so skip it.\n9. Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 1, so skip it.\n\nThe maximum independent set in the given graph is {1, 3, 7}."
