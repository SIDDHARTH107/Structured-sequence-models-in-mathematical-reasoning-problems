    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups, we will use Sylow's theorems. The order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. Let n_p be the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\nBy Sylow's theorems, we have:\n1. n_2 divides 15 and n_2 = 1 mod 2, so n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}.\n2. n_3 divides 20 and n_3 = 1 mod 3, so n_3 ∈ {1, 10}.\n3. n_5 divides 12 and n_5 = 1 mod 5, so n_5 ∈ {1, 6}.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, Sylow 3-subgroup, and Sylow 5-subgroup. By Sylow's theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P_2, P_3, and P_5 be the corresponding Sylow subgroups. Then, G is the internal direct product of P_2, P_3, and P_5. Since |P_2| = 4, |P_3| = 3, and |P_5| = 5, we have P_2 ≅ C_4 or C_2 × C_2, P_3 ≅ C_3, and P_5 ≅ C_5. Thus, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C_4 × C_3 × C_5, (C_2 × C_2) × C_3 × C_5, which are isomorphic to C_60 and A_5 × C_2, respectively.\n\nCase 2: n_2 ≠ 1, n_3 ≠ 1, or n_5 ≠ 1\nIn this case, G has more than one Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p. It is known that there are 33 non-isomorphic groups of order 60, and 32 of them are non-abelian. Since we have already covered the cases of C_60 and A_5 × C_2, the remaining 32 non-abelian groups fall into this case.\n\nNow, let's determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to if its center is non-trivial and has order 2.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C_60, then its center is G itself, which has order 60, not 2. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C_60 in this case.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to A_5 × C_2, then its center is isomorphic to the center of A_5, which is trivial, not of order 2. So, G cannot be isomorphic to A_5 × C_2 in this case.\n\nThus, if G has a non-trivial center of order 2, it must be isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
