    "message_2": "To find the possible pairs of prime numbers that sum up to n according to Goldbach's conjecture, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List all prime numbers less than n.\n2. For each prime number p in the list, check if n - p is also a prime number.\n3. If n - p is a prime number, add the pair (p, n - p) to the list of possible pairs.\n\nLet's find the possible pairs for a general even integer n > 2:\n\n1. List all prime numbers less than n: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ..., p_i (where p_i < n)\n2. For each prime number p_i in the list, check if n - p_i is also a prime number.\n3. If n - p_i is a prime number, add the pair (p_i, n - p_i) to the list of possible pairs.\n\nSince n is an even number greater than 2, it cannot be paired with 2, as the sum would be even and not prime. Therefore, we can exclude 2 from the list of prime numbers to check.\n\nThe possible pairs of prime numbers that sum up to n according to Goldbach's conjecture will depend on the specific value of n. For example:\n\n- If n = 10, the possible pairs are (3, 7) and (7, 3).\n- If n = 12, the possible pairs are (5, 7) and (7, 5).\n- If n = 14, the possible pairs are (3, 11), (7, 7), and (11, 3).\n\nNote that Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven or disproven, but it has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it holds true for all tested cases."
