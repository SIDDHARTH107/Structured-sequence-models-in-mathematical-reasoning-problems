    "message_2": "To find explicit formulas for the 0th, 1st, and 2nd cohomology groups of X with coefficients in G, we will use the induced group homomorphisms f* and g* from H*(K(G,1)) to the cohomology groups of X. Recall that the Eilenberg-Maclane space K(G,1) has the property that its fundamental group is G and its higher homotopy groups are trivial.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 0th cohomology group H^0(X;G). Since H^0(X;G) is just the group of constant maps from X to G, it is isomorphic to G. The induced homomorphisms f* and g* are trivial in this case, as they map the constant maps to constant maps. Therefore, we have:\n\nH^0(X;G) ≅ G.\n\nNext, let's consider the 1st cohomology group H^1(X;G). By the universal coefficient theorem, we have:\n\nH^1(X;G) ≅ Hom(H_1(X), G) ⊕ Ext(H_0(X), G),\n\nwhere Hom denotes the group of homomorphisms and Ext denotes the group of extensions. Since H_1(K(G,1)) = G and H_0(K(G,1)) = Z, the induced homomorphisms f* and g* can be thought of as group homomorphisms from G to H^1(X;G). Therefore, we have:\n\nH^1(X;G) ≅ Hom(G, G) ⊕ Ext(Z, G).\n\nFinally, let's consider the 2nd cohomology group H^2(X;G). By the universal coefficient theorem, we have:\n\nH^2(X;G) ≅ Hom(H_2(X), G) ⊕ Ext(H_1(X), G).\n\nSince H_2(K(G,1)) = 0 and H_1(K(G,1)) = G, the induced homomorphisms f* and g* can be thought of as group homomorphisms from G to H^2(X;G). Therefore, we have:\n\nH^2(X;G) ≅ Hom(0, G) ⊕ Ext(G, G).\n\nIn summary, the explicit formulas for the 0th, 1st, and 2nd cohomology groups of X with coefficients in G in terms of the induced group homomorphisms f* and g* are:\n\nH^0(X;G) ≅ G,\nH^1(X;G) ≅ Hom(G, G) ⊕ Ext(Z, G),\nH^2(X;G) ≅ Hom(0, G) ⊕ Ext(G, G)."
