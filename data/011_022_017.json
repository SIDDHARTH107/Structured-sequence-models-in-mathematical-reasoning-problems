    "message_1": "A student is going on a hiking trip and can only carry a maximum weight of 10 kg in their backpack. They need to decide which items to bring from the list below:\n\n- Tent (weight 4 kg)\n- Sleeping bag (weight 2 kg)\n- Water filter (weight 1 kg)\n- Cooking stove (weight 1.5 kg)\n- Food (weight 3 kg)\n- Map (weight 0.5 kg)\n\nWhat is the maximum weight of food the student can bring while still remaining under the weight limit of 10 kg? Use the Knapsack problem to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Knapsack problem, we need to determine the maximum value (in this case, the maximum weight of food) that can be carried in the backpack without exceeding the weight limit of 10 kg.\n\nFirst, let's list the essential items and their weights:\n1. Tent - 4 kg\n2. Sleeping bag - 2 kg\n3. Water filter - 1 kg\n4. Cooking stove - 1.5 kg\n5. Map - 0.5 kg\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of these essential items:\n4 kg (tent) + 2 kg (sleeping bag) + 1 kg (water filter) + 1.5 kg (cooking stove) + 0.5 kg (map) = 9 kg\n\nSince the student can carry a maximum weight of 10 kg, they have 1 kg left for food:\n10 kg (maximum weight) - 9 kg (essential items) = 1 kg\n\nTherefore, the maximum weight of food the student can bring while still remaining under the weight limit of 10 kg is 1 kg."
