    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor.\n   For 2^3, there are 4 partitions: (3), (2, 1), (1, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1, 1)\n   For 3^1, there are 2 partitions: (1) and (1, 1)\n3. Apply the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of partitions for each prime factor.\n   In this case, the formula is: 4 * 2 = 8\n\nHowever, this formula gives us an upper bound on the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24. We need to examine each case to determine if they correspond to an actual group.\n\n1. (3) and (1): This corresponds to the direct product of the cyclic groups C_8 and C_3, which gives the group C_24.\n2. (2, 1) and (1): This corresponds to the direct product of the dihedral group D_4 and the cyclic group C_3, which gives the group D_12.\n3. (1, 1, 1) and (1): This corresponds to the direct product of the Klein four-group V_4 and the cyclic group C_3, which gives the group C_2 x C_2 x C_3.\n4. (1, 1, 1, 1) and (1): This case does not correspond to a group.\n5. (3) and (1, 1): This case does not correspond to a group.\n6. (2, 1) and (1, 1): This corresponds to the direct product of the dihedral group D_4 and the Klein four-group V_4, which gives the group D_4 x C_2 x C_2.\n7. (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1): This case does not correspond to a group.\n8. (1, 1, 1, 1) and (1, 1): This case does not correspond to a group.\n\nSo, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 24: C_24, D_12, C_2 x C_2 x C_3, and D_4 x C_2 x C_2."
