    "message_1": "Suppose $f$ is a smooth function on a compact, connected, oriented manifold $M$ and $p_i$ are non-degenerate critical points of Morse index $i$. Let $N_{i,j}$ denote the number of connecting orbits between the critical points $p_i$ and $p_j$ of indices $i$ and $j$ respectively. If $M$ is a 2-dimensional torus and $f$ has critical points of index 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, with a total of 10 critical points, and the number of connecting orbits is given by: $N_{0,1} = 1 , N_{1,2} = 2, N_{2,3} = 1, N_{3,4} = 2$, find $N_{0,4}$.",
    "message_2": "Since $M$ is a 2-dimensional torus, the Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $i$ is at least the $i$-th Betti number $b_i$ of the torus. The Betti numbers of a 2-dimensional torus are $b_0 = b_2 = 1$ and $b_1 = 2$. Therefore, there must be at least one critical point of index 0, two critical points of index 1, one critical point of index 2, and no critical points of index 3 or 4.\n\nHowever, the given information states that there are critical points of index 3 and 4, which is a contradiction. This means that the given information is inconsistent with the topology of a 2-dimensional torus, and it is not possible to determine $N_{0,4}$ based on the given information."
