The distances between the cities are as follows:\n- City 1 to City 2: 10 km\n- City 1 to City 3: 6 km\n- City 1 to City 4: 8 km\n- City 1 to City 5: 3 km\n- City 2 to City 3: 4 km\n- City 2 to City 4: 6 km\n- City 2 to City 5: 5 km\n- City 3 to City 4: 7 km\n- City 3 to City 5: 9 km\n- City 4 to City 5: 11 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 5 cities exactly once before returning home?",
