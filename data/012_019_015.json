    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. \n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, for any simple, undirected graph G, the chromatic index χ'(G) satisfies the inequality:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in G.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph G. Since G has 10 vertices and 18 edges, the average degree of the vertices is:\n\n(2 * 18) / 10 = 3.6\n\nSince the average degree is 3.6, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher. Let's assume the maximum degree Δ(G) is 4. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be at least:\n\n4 * 10 = 40\n\nHowever, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in G is actually:\n\n2 * 18 = 36\n\nThis means that our assumption of Δ(G) = 4 is incorrect, and the maximum degree must be higher. Let's try Δ(G) = 5. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices would be at least:\n\n5 * 10 = 50\n\nSince 50 is greater than 36, we can conclude that the maximum degree Δ(G) is 5.\n\nNow, we can apply Vizing's theorem to find the chromatic index χ'(G):\n\n5 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 6\n\nTo determine whether χ'(G) is 5 or 6, we need to check if it's possible to properly color the edges of G with 5 colors. If it's not possible, then χ'(G) must be 6.\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the specific structure of the graph G, we cannot definitively determine whether χ'(G) is 5 or 6. However, we can conclude that the chromatic index of G is either 5 or 6."
