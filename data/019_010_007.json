    "message_1": "Consider the following formula in linear logic: A ⊸ B ∧ C. If A has 4 resources and B has 7 resources, and the formula consumes 3 resources to produce B and 5 resources to produce C, how many resources does C have?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the linear logic formula and the resources involved.\n\nThe formula A ⊸ B ∧ C means that A resources can be used to produce both B and C resources. Given that A has 4 resources, we can calculate how many resources are used to produce B and C.\n\nFor B:\nResources used to produce B = 3\nResources of B = 7\n\nFor C:\nResources used to produce C = 5\n\nNow, we can calculate the resources of C using the remaining resources from A.\n\nRemaining resources of A = Total resources of A - Resources used to produce B - Resources used to produce C\nRemaining resources of A = 4 - 3 - 5\nRemaining resources of A = -4\n\nSince we have a negative value for the remaining resources of A, it means that there are not enough resources in A to produce both B and C with the given consumption rates. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the resources of C in this scenario."
