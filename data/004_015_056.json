    "message_2": "To find the inflection point(s) of the function, we need to find the second derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection point(s), we set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the inflection point is 2."
