    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X, L^2), we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for line bundles on curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve X of genus g:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nNow, we are given that deg(L) = 2, and we want to find h^1(X, L^2). First, let's compute the degree of L^2:\n\ndeg(L^2) = 2 * deg(L) = 2 * 2 = 4\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem to the line bundle L^2:\n\nh^0(X, L^2) - h^1(X, L^2) = deg(L^2) + 1 - g = 4 + 1 - 3 = 2\n\nTo find h^1(X, L^2), we need to determine h^0(X, L^2). Since deg(L^2) = 4 > 2g - 2 = 4, we know that L^2 is very ample, which means that h^0(X, L^2) > 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nh^1(X, L^2) = h^0(X, L^2) - 2\n\nSince h^0(X, L^2) > 0, we can conclude that h^1(X, L^2) is at least 1. However, we cannot determine the exact value of h^1(X, L^2) without more information about the curve X and the line bundle L."
