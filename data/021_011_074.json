    "message_2": "To maximize the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 2 using the conjugate gradient method, we first need to find the gradient of the function, which is the first derivative with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4\n\nNow, let's implement the conjugate gradient method with an initial guess of x0 = 1, a tolerance of 0.001, and a maximum number of iterations of 100.\n\n1. Initialize x0 = 1, k = 0 (iteration counter), and r0 = -f'(x0) (negative gradient at x0).\n2. Set p0 = r0 (initial search direction).\n3. For each iteration k:\n   a. Calculate αk = (r_k^T * r_k) / (p_k^T * A * p_k), where A is the Hessian matrix of f(x) (second derivative).\n   b. Update x_k+1 = x_k + αk * p_k.\n   c. Check if the stopping criterion is met: ||f'(x_k+1)|| < tolerance or k >= max_iterations. If met, stop and return x_k+1.\n   d. Update r_k+1 = r_k - αk * A * p_k.\n   e. Calculate βk = (r_k+1^T * r_k+1) / (r_k^T * r_k).\n   f. Update p_k+1 = r_k+1 + βk * p_k.\n   g. Increment k.\n\nFirst, we need the second derivative (Hessian matrix) of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow, let's implement the algorithm:\n\nx0 = 1\nf'(x0) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 4 = 1\nr0 = -f'(x0) = -1\np0 = r0 = -1\n\nk = 0\nwhile k < 100:\n  A = 6x_k - 6\n  αk = (r_k^T * r_k) / (p_k^T * A * p_k) = (1) / (-1 * (6(1) - 6) * (-1)) = 1/6\n  x_k+1 = x_k + αk * p_k = 1 + (1/6) * (-1) = 5/6\n  f'(x_k+1) = 3(5/6)^2 - 6(5/6) + 4 = -0.5\n  if ||f'(x_k+1)|| < 0.001: break\n  r_k+1 = r_k - αk * A * p_k = -1 - (1/6) * (6(1) - 6) * (-1) = -0.5\n  βk = (r_k+1^T * r_k+1) / (r_k^T * r_k) = (-0.5)^2 / (1) = 0.25\n  p_k+1 = r_k+1 + βk * p_k = -0.5 + 0.25 * (-1) = -0.75\n  k = k + 1\n\nSince the algorithm converges in just one iteration, the maximum point is approximately x = 5/6 = 0.8333.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + 2 is approximately f(5/6) = (5/6)^3 - 3(5/6)^2 + 4(5/6) + 2 = 3.2083."
