    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 27, its order can be written as a power of a prime number: 27 = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 27. The only possibilities are 1 and 27. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal and G is a p-group, which implies that G is cyclic. In this case, there are three cyclic subgroups up to isomorphism: one of order 3^0 = 1, one of order 3^1 = 3, and one of order 3^2 = 9.\n\nIf there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is not cyclic, and it must be the direct product of two smaller groups. Since 27 = 3^3, the only possibility is that G is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 and 9. In this case, there are still three cyclic subgroups up to isomorphism: one of order 3^0 = 1, one of order 3^1 = 3, and one of order 3^2 = 9.\n\nIn either case, there are 3 cyclic subgroups of G up to isomorphism."
