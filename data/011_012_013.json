    "message_2": "To find the number of students who study only Physics or only Chemistry, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.\n\nTotal students studying Physics or Chemistry = Students studying Physics + Students studying Chemistry - Students studying both Physics and Chemistry\n\nLet A be the number of students studying only Physics, and B be the number of students studying only Chemistry.\n\nA = Total students studying Physics - Students studying both Physics and Chemistry\nA = 25 - 20\nA = 5\n\nB = Total students studying Chemistry - Students studying both Physics and Chemistry\nB = 30 - 20\nB = 10\n\nSo, the number of students studying only Physics or only Chemistry is A + B = 5 + 10 = 15."
