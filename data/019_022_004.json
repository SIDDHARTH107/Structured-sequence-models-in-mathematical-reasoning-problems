    "message_1": "A student is deciding between two different after-school activities, Activity 1 and Activity 2. For Activity 1, the student has a probability of success of 0.6 and the reward for success is $10. For Activity 2, the student has a probability of success of 0.8 and the reward for success is $8. What is the expected value of each activity, and which one should the student choose based on the expected value?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of each activity, we multiply the probability of success by the reward for success.\n\nExpected Value of Activity 1:\nProbability of success (0.6) * Reward for success ($10) = 0.6 * 10 = $6\n\nExpected Value of Activity 2:\nProbability of success (0.8) * Reward for success ($8) = 0.8 * 8 = $6.4\n\nBased on the expected value, the student should choose Activity 2, as it has a higher expected value of $6.4 compared to Activity 1's expected value of $6."
