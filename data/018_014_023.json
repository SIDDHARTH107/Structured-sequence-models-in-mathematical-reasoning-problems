    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)'.\n\nSince we are not given a universal set, we cannot find the exact complement of A × B. However, we can still prove that the Cartesian product is not distributive over complement by showing that A' × B' is not equal to (A × B)'.\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively. Again, we cannot find the exact complements without a universal set, but we can represent them symbolically.\n\nA' = {x | x ∉ A}\nB' = {y | y ∉ B}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A' × B':\n\nA' × B' = {(x, y) | x ∈ A', y ∈ B'}\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B)' and A' × B':\n\n(A × B)' contains all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∉ A or b ∉ B, while A' × B' contains all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x ∈ A' and y ∈ B'. \n\nThese two sets are not equal because (A × B)' includes ordered pairs where either the first element is not in A or the second element is not in B, while A' × B' only includes ordered pairs where both elements are not in their respective original sets.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
