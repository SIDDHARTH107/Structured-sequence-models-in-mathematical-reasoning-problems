    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that a person actually has the disease (A) given that they tested positive (B). We know the following probabilities:\n\n- P(A) = 0.02 (2% of the population has the disease)\n- P(B|A) = 0.95 (the test is 95% accurate in identifying the disease)\n- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) (the probability of testing positive)\n\nTo find P(B), we need to find P(B|¬A) and P(¬A). Since the test is 95% accurate, it has a 5% false positive rate, so P(B|¬A) = 0.05. The probability of not having the disease is P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nNow we can find P(B):\n\nP(B) = (0.95 * 0.02) + (0.05 * 0.98)\nP(B) = 0.019 + 0.049\nP(B) = 0.068\n\nFinally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (0.95 * 0.02) / 0.068\nP(A|B) = 0.019 / 0.068\nP(A|B) ≈ 0.2794\n\nSo, the probability that a person who tests positive for the disease actually has the disease is approximately 27.94%."
