If Y is countable, prove that Y is closed in X. \n\nFurthermore, prove that if every infinite subset of Y has a limit point in Y, then X is a Hausdorff space.",
    "message_2": "To prove that Y is closed in X, we need to show that the complement of Y in X, denoted as X \\ Y, is open in X. Let's consider an arbitrary point z in X \\ Y. Since every singleton set {x} is closed in X, the complement of {z} is open in X. \n\nNow, z is not in Y, so it cannot be a limit point of Y. Therefore, there exists an open neighborhood U of z such that U does not contain any other points of Y except possibly z itself. However, since z is not in Y, U does not contain any points of Y. Thus, U is a subset of X \\ Y. Since z is an arbitrary point in X \\ Y, this implies that X \\ Y is open in X, and therefore Y is closed in X.\n\nNow, let's prove that if every infinite subset of Y has a limit point in Y, then X is a Hausdorff space. A topological space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points x and y in the space, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U and V containing x and y, respectively.\n\nLet x and y be two distinct points in X. If both x and y are not in Y, then since Y is closed, X \\ Y is open, and we can find open neighborhoods U and V containing x and y, respectively, such that U and V are disjoint (we can take U and V to be subsets of X \\ Y).\n\nIf one of the points, say x, is in Y and y is not in Y, then since {x} is closed, its complement is open, and we can find an open neighborhood V of y such that V does not contain x. Since x is in Y and Y is closed, there exists an open neighborhood U of x such that U is a subset of Y. Thus, U and V are disjoint.\n\nFinally, if both x and y are in Y, then since they are distinct and every point in Y has a unique limit point in Y, neither x nor y can be a limit point of the other. Therefore, there exist open neighborhoods U and V of x and y, respectively, such that U does not contain y and V does not contain x. Thus, U and V are disjoint.\n\nIn all cases, we have found disjoint open neighborhoods U and V containing x and y, respectively. Therefore, X is a Hausdorff space."
