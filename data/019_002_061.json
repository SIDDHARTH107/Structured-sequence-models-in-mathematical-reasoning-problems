Is statement 2 true, false or cannot be determined? Justify your answer.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z}, P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x,7)$\n\nThis statement says that for all integers x, if x is a prime number, then x + 7 = 12. We can rewrite the statement Q(x,7) as x = 12 - 7, which simplifies to x = 5. So, the statement is saying that if x is a prime number, then x = 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the statement is true for x = 5. However, there are other prime numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 7, 11, ...) that do not satisfy the condition x = 5. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\n2. $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z}, P(x) \\wedge Q(x,7)$\n\nThis statement says that there exists an integer x such that x is a prime number and x + 7 = 12. We can rewrite the statement Q(x,7) as x = 12 - 7, which simplifies to x = 5. So, the statement is saying that there exists an integer x such that x is a prime number and x = 5. Since 5 is a prime number, statement 2 is true.\n\nIn conclusion, statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true."
