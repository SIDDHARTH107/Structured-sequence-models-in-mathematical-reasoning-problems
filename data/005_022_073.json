    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Robust Statistics:\n\nThe test scores of 10 students in a math class are given below:\n\n87, 92, 95, 72, 90, 88, 63, 85, 82, 88\n\nFind the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the test scores, assuming one outlier score of 50 has been added to the data set. Use the five-number summary and the boxplot to determine if the outlier score affects the overall statistics.",
    "message_2": "First, let's sort the test scores in ascending order and include the outlier score of 50:\n\n50, 63, 72, 82, 85, 87, 88, 88, 90, 92, 95\n\nNow, we can find the median (Q2), which is the middle value of the data set. Since there are 11 scores, the median is the 6th value:\n\nMedian (Q2) = 87\n\nNext, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the overall median), and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the overall median).\n\nQ1 = Median of {50, 63, 72, 82, 85} = 72\nQ3 = Median of {88, 88, 90, 92, 95} = 90\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between Q3 and Q1:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 90 - 72 = 18\n\nThe five-number summary consists of the minimum value, Q1, the median (Q2), Q3, and the maximum value:\n\nFive-number summary: 50, 72, 87, 90, 95\n\nTo determine if the outlier score affects the overall statistics, we can compare the five-number summary and IQR with and without the outlier score.\n\nWithout the outlier score, the five-number summary and IQR are:\n\nSorted scores without outlier: 63, 72, 82, 85, 87, 88, 88, 90, 92, 95\nQ1 = 72, Q2 = 87.5, Q3 = 90, IQR = 18\n\nComparing the two five-number summaries, we can see that the minimum value is affected by the outlier score (50 vs. 63), but the other values (Q1, Q2, Q3, and the maximum value) remain relatively stable. The IQR is the same in both cases (18), which indicates that the overall spread of the data is not significantly affected by the outlier score.\n\nIn conclusion, the outlier score of 50 does affect the minimum value of the data set, but the other statistics, such as the median and IQR, remain relatively stable. This demonstrates the robustness of these statistics in the presence of outliers."
