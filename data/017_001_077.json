    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4, and let x be an element in G of order 4. We want to show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nSince the order of x is 4, we have x^4 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Now, consider the elements e, x, x^2, and x^3. We claim that these are distinct elements of G. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that two of these elements are equal, say x^i = x^j for some 0 ≤ i < j ≤ 3. Then x^(j-i) = e, but since 0 < j - i < 4, this contradicts the fact that x has order 4. Therefore, e, x, x^2, and x^3 are distinct elements of G.\n\nSince G has order 4 and we have found 4 distinct elements in G, we conclude that G = {e, x, x^2, x^3}. Now, consider the map φ: G → C4 defined by φ(x^i) = i, where C4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} is the cyclic group of order 4 under addition modulo 4. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism: Let a = x^i and b = x^j be elements in G. Then φ(ab) = φ(x^(i+j)) = (i + j) mod 4 = (φ(a) + φ(b)) mod 4, so φ is a homomorphism.\n\n2. φ is injective: Suppose φ(a) = φ(b) for some a, b in G. Then φ(x^i) = φ(x^j), which implies i = j mod 4. Since 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 3, we have i = j, and thus a = b. Therefore, φ is injective.\n\n3. φ is surjective: For any i in C4, there exists an element x^i in G such that φ(x^i) = i. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nNow, suppose there is no element of order 4 in G. Since G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, or 4. The identity element e has order 1, and since there is no element of order 4, all non-identity elements in G must have order 2.\n\nLet a, b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then a^2 = b^2 = e. Since G has order 4, there must be one more element in G, which we will call c. Note that c cannot be equal to a or b, as they are distinct. Also, c cannot be equal to e, as e is the identity element. Therefore, c must satisfy c^2 = e.\n\nNow, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. We claim that c = ab. If c = ab, then G = {e, a, b, ab}, and every element in G has order 2. This is the definition of the Klein four-group V4. To show that c = ab, we will prove that ab ≠ a, ab ≠ b, and ab ≠ e.\n\n1. ab ≠ a: If ab = a, then b = e, which contradicts the fact that b is a non-identity element.\n2. ab ≠ b: If ab = b, then a = e, which contradicts the fact that a is a non-identity element.\n3. ab ≠ e: If ab = e, then a = b^(-1), which contradicts the fact that a and b are distinct non-identity elements.\n\nSince ab ≠ a, ab ≠ b, and ab ≠ e, we have c = ab. Thus, G = {e, a, b, ab}, and every element in G has order 2. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
