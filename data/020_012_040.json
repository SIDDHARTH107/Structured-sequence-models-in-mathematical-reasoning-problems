    "message_1": "A chemical reaction has an activation energy of 50 kJ/mol. At a temperature of 300 K, what is the minimum fraction of molecules with energy greater than the activation energy for the reaction to occur? (Assume a normal distribution of molecular energies with a standard deviation of 10 kJ/mol.)",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum fraction of molecules with energy greater than the activation energy, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. The CDF gives the probability that a random variable from the distribution is less than or equal to a given value.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score, which is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the activation energy is. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the activation energy (50 kJ/mol), μ is the mean energy (which we'll assume is equal to the average energy at 300 K), and σ is the standard deviation (10 kJ/mol).\n\nThe average energy at 300 K can be estimated using the equipartition theorem, which states that the average energy per degree of freedom is (1/2) * k * T, where k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 x 10^(-5) eV/K or 8.314 J/mol K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. For simplicity, we will assume that the molecules have only translational degrees of freedom, which means that there are 3 degrees of freedom per molecule. Thus, the average energy per molecule is:\n\nμ = (3/2) * k * T\n\nUsing the Boltzmann constant in J/mol K:\n\nμ = (3/2) * 8.314 J/mol K * 300 K ≈ 3739.3 J/mol ≈ 3.74 kJ/mol\n\nNow we can calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (50 kJ/mol - 3.74 kJ/mol) / 10 kJ/mol ≈ 4.626\n\nNext, we need to find the CDF value corresponding to this z-score. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the CDF value. The CDF value for a z-score of 4.626 is approximately 0.99998.\n\nFinally, we need to find the fraction of molecules with energy greater than the activation energy. This is equal to 1 minus the CDF value:\n\nFraction = 1 - 0.99998 ≈ 0.00002\n\nSo, the minimum fraction of molecules with energy greater than the activation energy for the reaction to occur is approximately 0.00002 or 0.002%."
