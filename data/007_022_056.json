    "message_2": "To find the order of an elliptic curve over a finite field, we can use the Hasse's theorem which states that the number of points on the curve (including the point at infinity) is approximately equal to the number of elements in the field plus 1, plus or minus twice the square root of the number of elements in the field. In our case, the field is GF(11), so there are 11 elements.\n\nHasse's theorem: |N - (q + 1)| <= 2 * sqrt(q)\nwhere N is the number of points on the curve, and q is the number of elements in the field.\n\nFor GF(11), q = 11, so the range of possible values for N is:\n\n|N - (11 + 1)| <= 2 * sqrt(11)\n|N - 12| <= 6.633\n\nNow, we need to find the actual points on the curve. The curve equation is y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2. We can iterate through all possible x and y values in GF(11) and check if they satisfy the curve equation.\n\nPoints on the curve:\n(0,5), (0,6)\n(2,2), (2,9)\n(3,5), (3,6)\n(5,2), (5,9)\n(6,4), (6,7)\n(7,2), (7,9)\n(8,3), (8,8)\n(10,2), (10,9)\n\nThere are 16 points in total, including the point at infinity. Therefore, the order of the elliptic curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the prime field GF(11) is 16."
