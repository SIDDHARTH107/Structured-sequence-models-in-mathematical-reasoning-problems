    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 centimeters and a slant height of 10 centimeters. Find the surface area of the cone (rounded to two decimal places).",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven, r = 5 cm and l = 10 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 75π\n\nNow, we'll approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 75 * 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 235.5 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 235.5 square centimeters, rounded to two decimal places."
