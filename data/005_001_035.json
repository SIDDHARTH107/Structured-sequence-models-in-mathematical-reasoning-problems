    "message_1": "A manufacturer of cell phones wants to reduce the number of defective phones produced. Currently, 10% of the phones are defective. The company implemented a new quality control process and would like to determine whether it has been effective. A sample of 100 phones was taken and it was found that 6 of them were defective. Using a significance level of 0.05, can the new quality control process be considered effective in reducing the number of defective phones?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the new quality control process is effective in reducing the number of defective phones, we can perform a hypothesis test. \n\nLet p0 = 0.10 be the proportion of defective phones before the new quality control process, and p1 be the proportion of defective phones after the new quality control process.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): p1 >= p0 (The new process is not effective or the proportion of defective phones has not decreased)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): p1 < p0 (The new process is effective and the proportion of defective phones has decreased)\n\nWe will use a one-sample z-test for proportions to test the hypotheses.\n\nSample proportion (p-hat) = 6/100 = 0.06\nSample size (n) = 100\n\nStandard error (SE) = sqrt[(p0 * (1 - p0)) / n] = sqrt[(0.10 * 0.90) / 100] = 0.03\n\nz-score = (p-hat - p0) / SE = (0.06 - 0.10) / 0.03 = -1.333\n\nNow, we need to find the p-value associated with this z-score. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the p-value is approximately 0.091.\n\nSince the p-value (0.091) is greater than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the new quality control process is effective in reducing the number of defective phones at a 0.05 significance level."
