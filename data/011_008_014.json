    "message_2": "To partition a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty subsets, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind. The Stirling number S(n, k) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find S(6, 3).\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the second kind can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nwith the base cases:\n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0\nS(0, 0) = 1\nS(n, n) = 1 for n > 0\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can calculate S(6, 3) as follows:\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find S(5, 3) and S(5, 2):\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\n\nContinuing to break down the Stirling numbers:\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 1) = 1 * S(3, 1) + S(3, 0) = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the values back into the original expressions:\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nFinally, we can find S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 ways to partition a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty subsets."
