    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible isomorphism classes for groups of order 20, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By Sylow's first theorem, there must be at least one Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let's denote this normal subgroup as N.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's first theorem, there must be at least one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 20/4 = 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 or 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Let's denote a Sylow 2-subgroup as H.\n\nCase 1: There is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal.\nIn this case, both N and H are normal subgroups. Since the orders of N and H are coprime, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, the group is the direct product of N and H. Thus, the group is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_4, which is isomorphic to Z_20.\n\nCase 2: There are five Sylow 2-subgroups.\nIn this case, H is not normal. However, N is still normal, as it is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. We can form the semidirect product of N and H. The action of H on N is determined by the automorphism group of N, which is Aut(N) ≅ Z_4 (since N is isomorphic to Z_5). There are two possibilities for the action of H on N:\n\n1. H acts trivially on N: In this case, the semidirect product is the direct product, and we get the group Z_5 × Z_4, which we already considered in Case 1.\n\n2. H acts non-trivially on N: In this case, the semidirect product is a non-abelian group of order 20. This group is denoted as Dih_10, the dihedral group of order 20.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two isomorphism classes for groups of order 20:\n\n1. Z_20 (the cyclic group of order 20)\n2. Dih_10 (the dihedral group of order 20)"
