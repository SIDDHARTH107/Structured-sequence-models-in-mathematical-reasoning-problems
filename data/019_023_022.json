    "message_1": "A factory produces 1000 screws of two types -- Type A and Type B. Type A screws have a probability of 0.8 of being perfect and Type B screws have a probability of 0.6 of being perfect. If 40 screws are randomly selected from the factory, what is the probability that at least half of the screws are perfect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the probability of selecting a perfect screw from the factory. Let's assume there are x Type A screws and y Type B screws in the factory, with x + y = 1000.\n\nThe probability of selecting a perfect screw from the factory is given by:\n\nP(perfect) = P(perfect | Type A) * P(Type A) + P(perfect | Type B) * P(Type B)\n\nSince we don't know the exact number of Type A and Type B screws, we can't find the exact probability of selecting a perfect screw. However, we can express the probability in terms of x and y:\n\nP(perfect) = 0.8 * (x/1000) + 0.6 * (y/1000)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least half (20 or more) of the 40 randomly selected screws are perfect. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(at least 20 perfect) = Î£ [C(40, k) * (P(perfect))^k * (1 - P(perfect))^(40-k)] for k = 20 to 40\n\nwhere C(40, k) is the number of combinations of selecting k perfect screws out of 40.\n\nSince we don't know the exact values of x and y, we can't find the exact probability. However, we can express the probability in terms of x and y using the above formulas."
