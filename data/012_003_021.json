    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent. To find the maximum number of independent vertices that can be selected from this graph, we can try different combinations of non-adjacent vertices.\n\nOne possible maximum independent set is {1, 4, 6, 8}. This set has 4 vertices, and no two vertices are adjacent. There is no larger independent set in this graph.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of independent vertices that can be selected from this graph is 4."
