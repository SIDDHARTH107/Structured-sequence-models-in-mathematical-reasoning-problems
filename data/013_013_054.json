    "message_1": "Suppose there are three bidders in an auction for an item with a reserve price of $1000. Each bidder values the item differently and submits a bid as follows: Bidder 1 offers $1200, Bidder 2 offers $1300, and Bidder 3 offers $1100. \n\nUsing the second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction) method, determine which bidder wins the auction and what their final price will be.",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction), the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nIn this case, the bids are as follows:\nBidder 1: $1200\nBidder 2: $1300\nBidder 3: $1100\n\nBidder 2 has the highest bid at $1300, so they win the auction. However, they will pay the second-highest bid price, which is $1200 from Bidder 1. Therefore, Bidder 2 wins the auction and pays $1200 for the item."
