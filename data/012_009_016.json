    "message_2": "To determine whether a graph with the given degree sequence exists, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, the sum of the degrees is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 18, which is an even number. This means that the graph could potentially exist.\n\nNext, we apply the Havel-Hakimi algorithm, which is used to determine if a degree sequence is graphical (i.e., if there exists a graph with that degree sequence). The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.\n2. Remove the first number (let's call it N) from the sequence.\n3. Subtract 1 from the next N numbers in the sequence.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the sequence is empty or we reach a contradiction.\n\nApplying the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to our degree sequence:\n\n1. The sequence is already sorted: 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2.\n2. Remove the first number: N = 4, remaining sequence: 4, 3, 3, 2.\n3. Subtract 1 from the next 4 numbers: 3, 2, 2, 1.\n4. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: 3, 2, 2, 1.\n5. Remove the first number: N = 3, remaining sequence: 2, 2, 1.\n6. Subtract 1 from the next 3 numbers: 1, 1, 0.\n7. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: 1, 1, 0.\n8. Remove the first number: N = 1, remaining sequence: 1, 0.\n9. Subtract 1 from the next 1 number: 0, 0.\n10. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: 0, 0.\n\nThe sequence is now empty, and we did not encounter any contradictions. Therefore, a graph with the given degree sequence exists.\n\nNow, let's draw the graph G. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F with degrees 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.\n\n1. Connect vertex A (degree 4) to vertices B, C, D, and E.\n2. Connect vertex B (degree 4) to vertices C, D, E, and F.\n3. Connect vertex C (degree 3) to vertices A, B, and F.\n4. Connect vertex D (degree 3) to vertices A, B, and F.\n5. Connect vertex E (degree 2) to vertices A and B.\n6. Connect vertex F (degree 2) to vertices B and C.\n\nThe graph G with the given degree sequence has been drawn."
