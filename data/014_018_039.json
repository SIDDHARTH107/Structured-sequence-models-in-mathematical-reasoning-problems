    "message_1": "Suppose we have a substitution cipher in which every letter is replaced by a different letter of the English alphabet. If the letter \"E\" is encrypted as the letter \"X\", and the letter \"T\" is encrypted as the letter \"Q\", what letter is encrypted as the letter \"C\"?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot solve this problem without more information. A substitution cipher can have many different configurations, and knowing the encryption of just two letters (E and T) is not enough to determine the encryption of the letter \"C\". We would need to know the specific substitution pattern or more encrypted letters to solve this problem."
