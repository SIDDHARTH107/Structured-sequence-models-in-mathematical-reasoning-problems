    "message_2": "To compute the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(M)$, we need to find the space of closed 2-forms modulo the space of exact 2-forms on $M$.\n\nFirst, let's find the closed 2-forms on $M$. A 2-form on $M$ can be written as $\\alpha = f(x,y,z) \\, dx \\wedge dy + g(x,y,z) \\, dy \\wedge dz + h(x,y,z) \\, dz \\wedge dx$, where $f, g, h$ are smooth functions on $M$. A 2-form is closed if its exterior derivative is zero, i.e., $d\\alpha = 0$.\n\nNow, let's compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n\n$d\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}\\right) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}\\right) dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$.\n\nFor $d\\alpha = 0$, we must have:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = 0$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$\n\nNow, let's find the exact 2-forms on $M$. A 2-form $\\beta$ is exact if there exists a 1-form $\\eta$ such that $\\beta = d\\eta$. Since $\\omega = xy \\,dx + yz \\,dy + zx \\,dz$ is a 1-form on $M$, let's compute its exterior derivative:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (zx)}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial (yz)}{\\partial z}\\right) dx \\wedge dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial (xy)}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial (zx)}{\\partial x}\\right) dy \\wedge dz + \\left(\\frac{\\partial (yz)}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial (xy)}{\\partial y}\\right) dz \\wedge dx = (z - z) dx \\wedge dy + (x - x) dy \\wedge dz + (y - y) dz \\wedge dx = 0$.\n\nSince $d\\omega = 0$, any exact 2-form on $M$ must be zero. Therefore, the space of exact 2-forms on $M$ is trivial.\n\nNow, we can compute the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(M)$ as the space of closed 2-forms modulo the space of exact 2-forms. Since the space of exact 2-forms is trivial, we have $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong$ the space of closed 2-forms.\n\nThe space of closed 2-forms is determined by the three conditions above. Since $M$ is a 2-dimensional manifold, it is expected that $H^2_{dR}(M)$ is 1-dimensional. Indeed, the space of closed 2-forms is spanned by the volume form $\\alpha = dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz + dz \\wedge dx$ on $M$, which satisfies the three conditions.\n\nThus, the second De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(M)$ is 1-dimensional and spanned by the volume form $\\alpha$."
