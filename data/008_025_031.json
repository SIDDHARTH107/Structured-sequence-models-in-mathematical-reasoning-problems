    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method. \n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first two equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(1) 2(x + 2y - z) = 2(5)\n(2) 1(2x - y + 3z) = 1(12)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(1) 2x + 4y - 2z = 10\n(2) 2x - y + 3z = 12\n\nNow subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): (2x + 4y - 2z) - (2x - y + 3z) = 10 - 12\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5y - 5z = -2\n\nNow divide by 5:\n\ny - z = -2/5\n\nNow we have a new equation (3):\n\n(3) y - z = -2/5\n\nNext, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(2) 3(2x - y + 3z) = 3(12)\n(3) 2(3x + y - 5z) = 2(1)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(2) 6x - 3y + 9z = 36\n(3) 6x + 2y - 10z = 2\n\nNow add equation (2) and equation (3):\n\n(2) + (3): (6x - 3y + 9z) + (6x + 2y - 10z) = 36 + 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n12x - z = 38\n\nNow we have a new equation (4):\n\n(4) 12x - z = 38\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (z and x):\n\n(3) y - z = -2/5\n(4) 12x - z = 38\n\nMultiply equation (3) by -1 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n(3) -1(y - z) = -1(-2/5)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(3) -y + z = 2/5\n\nNow add equation (3) and equation (4):\n\n(3) + (4): (-y + z) + (12x - z) = 2/5 + 38\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n12x - y = 192/5\n\nNow we have a new equation (5):\n\n(5) 12x - y = 192/5\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and x):\n\n(5) 12x - y = 192/5\n(1) x + 2y - z = 5\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 12 to make the coefficients of x equal:\n\n(1) 12(x + 2y - z) = 12(5)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(1) 12x + 24y - 12z = 60\n\nNow subtract equation (5) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (5): (12x + 24y - 12z) - (12x - y) = 60 - 192/5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n25y - 12z = -12/5\n\nNow divide by 25:\n\ny - (12/25)z = -12/125\n\nNow we have a new equation (6):\n\n(6) y - (12/25)z = -12/125\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(3) y - z = -2/5\n(6) y - (12/25)z = -12/125\n\nMultiply equation (6) by 25 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(6) 25(y - (12/25)z) = 25(-12/125)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(6) 25y - 12z = -60/5\n\nNow subtract equation (3) from equation (6):\n\n(6) - (3): (25y - 12z) - (y - z) = -60/5 - (-2/5)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n24y - 11z = -50/5\n\nNow divide by 24:\n\ny - (11/24)z = -50/120\n\nNow we have a new equation (7):\n\n(7) y - (11/24)z = -50/120\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(3) y - z = -2/5\n(7) y - (11/24)z = -50/120\n\nMultiply equation (3) by 24 and equation (7) by -1 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(3) 24(y - z) = 24(-2/5)\n(7) -1(y - (11/24)z) = -1(-50/120)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(3) 24y - 24z = -96/5\n(7) -y + (11/24)z = 50/120\n\nNow add equation (3) and equation (7):\n\n(3) + (7): (24y - 24z) + (-y + (11/24)z) = -96/5 + 50/120\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n23y - (563/24)z = -142/15\n\nNow divide by 23:\n\ny - (563/552)z = -142/345\n\nNow we have a new equation (8):\n\n(8) y - (563/552)z = -142/345\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(3) y - z = -2/5\n(8) y - (563/552)z = -142/345\n\nMultiply equation (3) by 563 and equation (8) by 552 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(3) 563(y - z) = 563(-2/5)\n(8) 552(y - (563/552)z) = 552(-142/345)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(3) 563y - 563z = -2252/5\n(8) 552y - 563z = -142*552/345\n\nNow add equation (3) and equation (8):\n\n(3) + (8): (563y - 563z) + (552y - 563z) = -2252/5 - 142*552/345\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1115y - 1126z = -2252/5 - 142*552/345\n\nNow divide by 1115:\n\ny - (1126/1115)z = (-2252/5 - 142*552/345)/1115\n\nNow we have a new equation (9):\n\n(9) y - (1126/1115)z = (-2252/5 - 142*552/345)/1115\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(3) y - z = -2/5\n(9) y - (1126/1115)z = (-2252/5 - 142*552/345)/1115\n\nSince the coefficients of y and z in both equations are not proportional, the system of linear equations has a unique solution."
