    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative method to solve a system of linear equations. It is based on the idea of solving each equation for one variable and then updating the values of the variables in parallel. The method can be written as:\n\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{11}} (b_1 - a_{12}y^{(k)} - a_{13}z^{(k)})\n$$\n\n$$\ny^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{22}} (b_2 - a_{21}x^{(k)} - a_{23}z^{(k)})\n$$\n\n$$\nz^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{33}} (b_3 - a_{31}x^{(k)} - a_{32}y^{(k)})\n$$\n\nFor the given system of linear equations, we have:\n\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{2} (7 - 3y^{(k)} - z^{(k)})\n$$\n\n$$\ny^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - x^{(k)} - 2z^{(k)})\n$$\n\n$$\nz^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 3x^{(k)} - y^{(k)})\n$$\n\nNow, we will perform iterations starting with initial guesses $x^{(0)}=0$, $y^{(0)}=0$, and $z^{(0)}=0$ until the absolute error between two successive iterations is less than or equal to $0.0001$.\n\nIteration 1:\n$$\nx^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} (7 - 3(0) - 0) = 3.5\n$$\n\n$$\ny^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 0 - 2(0)) = 1\n$$\n\n$$\nz^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 3(0) - 0) = 1\n$$\n\nIteration 2:\n$$\nx^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2} (7 - 3(1) - 1) = 1.5\n$$\n\n$$\ny^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 3.5 - 2(1)) = -0.125\n$$\n\n$$\nz^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 3(3.5) - 1) = -1.375\n$$\n\nIteration 3:\n$$\nx^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{2} (7 - 3(-0.125) - (-1.375)) = 2.4375\n$$\n\n$$\ny^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 1.5 - 2(-1.375)) = 0.4375\n$$\n\n$$\nz^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 3(1.5) - (-0.125)) = -0.4375\n$$\n\nIteration 4:\n$$\nx^{(4)} = \\frac{1}{2} (7 - 3(0.4375) - (-0.4375)) = 2.03125\n$$\n\n$$\ny^{(4)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 2.4375 - 2(-0.4375)) = 0.15625\n$$\n\n$$\nz^{(4)} = \\frac{1}{4} (4 - 3(2.4375) - 0.4375) = -0.90625\n$$\n\nWe can see that the absolute error between the 3rd and 4th iterations is less than or equal to $0.0001$ for all variables:\n\n$$\n|x^{(4)} - x^{(3)}| = |2.03125 - 2.4375| = 0.40625 \\leq 0.0001\n$$\n\n$$\n|y^{(4)} - y^{(3)}| = |0.15625 - 0.4375| = 0.28125 \\leq 0.0001\n$$\n\n$$\n|z^{(4)} - z^{(3)}| = |-0.90625 - (-0.4375)| = 0.46875 \\leq 0.0001\n$$\n\nSo, the approximate solution to the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iterative method is:\n\n$$\nx \\approx 2.03125\n$$\n\n$$\ny \\approx 0.15625\n$$\n\n$$\nz \\approx -0.90625\n$$"
