    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces three types of products: A, B, and C, with unit production costs of $2, $3, and $4, respectively. Last month, the company produced a total of 1000 units, and the total production cost was $2800. If the number of units produced of product C was twice the number of units produced of product A and the number of units produced of product B was three times the number of units produced of product A, how many units of each product did the company produce? Use block matrix methods to solve the system of linear equations.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the number of units produced for products A, B, and C, respectively. We can set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:\n\n1. x + y + z = 1000 (total units produced)\n2. 2x + 3y + 4z = 2800 (total production cost)\n3. z = 2x (number of units of product C is twice the number of units of product A)\n4. y = 3x (number of units of product B is three times the number of units of product A)\n\nNow, we can use block matrix methods to solve this system of linear equations. First, we need to rewrite the system in matrix form:\n\n| 1  1  1 | |x|   |1000|\n| 2  3  4 | |y| = |2800|\n| 1 -3  0 | |z|   |   0|\n\nNext, we can perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 3:\n| 1 -3  0 | |x|   |   0|\n| 2  3  4 | |y| = |2800|\n| 1  1  1 | |z|   |1000|\n\n2. Replace row 2 with row 2 - 2 * row 1:\n| 1 -3  0 | |x|   |   0|\n| 0  9  4 | |y| = |2800|\n| 1  1  1 | |z|   |1000|\n\n3. Replace row 3 with row 3 - row 1:\n| 1 -3  0 | |x|   |   0|\n| 0  9  4 | |y| = |2800|\n| 0  4  1 | |z|   |1000|\n\nNow, we can use back substitution to solve for x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = (1000 - 4y) / 1\n2. y = (2800 - 4z) / 9\n3. x = -3y\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation 1:\nz = (1000 - 4((2800 - 4z) / 9)) / 1\n\nSolve for z:\nz = 200\n\nNow, substitute z back into equation 2 to find y:\ny = (2800 - 4(200)) / 9\ny = 400 / 9\n\nSince the number of units produced must be a whole number, we can round y to the nearest whole number:\ny = 44\n\nFinally, substitute y back into equation 3 to find x:\nx = -3(44)\nx = 132\n\nSo, the company produced 132 units of product A, 44 units of product B, and 200 units of product C."
