    "message_1": "A car manufacturer claims that their average fuel efficiency for a certain model is 25 miles per gallon (mpg) with a standard deviation of 3 mpg. A sample of 36 cars is selected and their average fuel efficiency is found to be 23.5 mpg. Is there enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H₀) is that the true average fuel efficiency is 25 mpg, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁) is that the true average fuel efficiency is not 25 mpg.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √sample size)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 23.5 mpg, the population mean is 25 mpg, the sample standard deviation is 3 mpg, and the sample size is 36 cars.\n\nt = (23.5 - 25) / (3 / √36)\nt = (-1.5) / (3 / 6)\nt = (-1.5) / 0.5\nt = -3\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance with 35 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.03.\n\nSince our calculated t-score of -3 is less than the critical t-value of -2.03, we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to suggest that the true average fuel efficiency is not 25 mpg at a 5% level of significance."
