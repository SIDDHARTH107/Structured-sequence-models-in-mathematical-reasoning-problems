    "message_2": "To find a lower bound for the Betti number $b_k$ in terms of the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$, we can use the Morse inequalities. The Morse inequalities relate the Betti numbers of a manifold to the critical points of a Morse function on the manifold. \n\nLet $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function on the surface $M$, and let $m_k$ denote the number of critical points of index $k$ for $f$. The Morse inequalities state that\n\n$$b_k \\leq m_k$$\n\nfor each $k \\geq 0$. Moreover, the Morse inequalities also state that\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (b_k - m_k) t^k \\geq 0$$\n\nas a formal power series in $t$. \n\nNow, let's compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$. For a connected, compact, and orientable surface $M$ with genus $g$ and $n$ boundary components, the Euler characteristic is given by\n\n$$\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g - n$$\n\nBy the Morse theory, we also have\n\n$$\\chi(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k m_k$$\n\nSince $M$ is a surface, we only have two non-zero Betti numbers: $b_0$ and $b_1$. Therefore, we can rewrite the Morse inequalities as\n\n$$b_0 \\leq m_0$$\n$$b_1 \\leq m_1$$\n\nNow, let's find a lower bound for $b_1$. From the Morse inequalities, we have\n\n$$b_1 \\leq m_1$$\n\nUsing the Euler characteristic formula, we can write\n\n$$\\chi(M) = m_0 - m_1$$\n\nSince $M$ is connected, we have $b_0 = m_0 = 1$. Thus,\n\n$$1 - m_1 = 2 - 2g - n$$\n\nSolving for $m_1$, we get\n\n$$m_1 = 1 - 2 + 2g + n = 2g + n - 1$$\n\nNow, using the inequality $b_1 \\leq m_1$, we have\n\n$$b_1 \\leq 2g + n - 1$$\n\nThus, we have found a lower bound for the Betti number $b_1$ in terms of the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$:\n\n$$b_1 \\geq 1 - \\chi(M)$$"
