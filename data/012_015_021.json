    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 8, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is 8 - 1 = 7.\n\nSince the given graph has 14 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (7), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the edges could be distributed in such a way that the graph is still disconnected.\n\nTo prove that the graph is connected, we can use the fact that the maximum number of edges in a disconnected graph with n vertices can be found by considering the complete graph with n-1 vertices, which has (n-1)(n-2)/2 edges. In this case, the maximum number of edges in a disconnected graph with 8 vertices is given by:\n\n(8-1)(8-2)/2 = 7*6/2 = 21/2 = 10.5\n\nSince the maximum number of edges in a disconnected graph with 8 vertices is 10.5, and our graph has 14 edges, which is greater than this value, we can conclude that the graph is connected."
