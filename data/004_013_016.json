    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 over the interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 3. These are the critical points of the function.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value of the function is 6, which occurs at x = 1 and x = 4, and the minimum value of the function is 2, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 3."
