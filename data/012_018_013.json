    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph into two disjoint subgraphs, we need to remove edges such that there is no path between any pair of vertices from the two subgraphs. \n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. A complete graph with 7 vertices has (7 * (7 - 1)) / 2 = 21 edges. However, our graph has only 10 edges, so it is not a complete graph.\n\nWe can use the fact that a tree is a connected graph with the minimum number of edges, and it has n - 1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. So, a tree with 7 vertices has 6 edges. If we remove one edge from this tree, it will become disconnected into two disjoint subgraphs.\n\nTherefore, in the worst-case scenario, we need to remove at least one edge to disconnect the graph into two disjoint subgraphs."
