    "message_2": "Since H is a subgroup of G with order 3, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G. In this case, 3 divides 24. \n\nTo find a generator for H, we need to find an element in G whose order is 3. Recall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e (the identity element).\n\nWe know that the order of a is 24, so a^24 = e. We want to find an element of the form a^k with order 3, meaning (a^k)^3 = a^(3k) = e. Since a^24 = e, we want to find a k such that 3k divides 24.\n\nThe smallest such k is 8, as 3 * 8 = 24. Therefore, a generator for H is a^8."
