    "message_1": "Here's a question for the student:\n\nA researcher is conducting a factor analysis on a dataset consisting of 10 variables. After running the analysis, the researcher determines that there are 3 underlying factors that explain the data. The researcher lists the factor loadings for each variable in a matrix as follows:\n\n| Variable | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|    V1    |    0.8   |    0.2   |    0.1   |\n|    V2    |    0.7   |    0.3   |   -0.1   |\n|    V3    |    0.5   |   -0.1   |    0.8   |\n|    V4    |    0.3   |    0.5   |    0.4   |\n|    V5    |    0.2   |    0.7   |   -0.3   |\n|    V6    |   -0.1   |    0.8   |   -0.2   |\n|    V7    |   -0.2   |    0.6   |    0.6   |\n|    V8    |   -0.4   |    0.4   |   -0.7   |\n|    V9    |   -0.6   |   -0.3   |    0.6   |\n|   V10    |   -0.7   |   -0.4   |   -0.5   |\n\nIf the researcher decides to retain only those variables with factor loadings above 0.5, how many variables would be retained?",
    "message_2": "To determine how many variables would be retained, we need to count the number of variables with factor loadings above 0.5 for any of the three factors. Let's examine each variable:\n\nV1: Factor 1 loading is 0.8 (above 0.5)\nV2: Factor 1 loading is 0.7 (above 0.5)\nV3: Factor 3 loading is 0.8 (above 0.5)\nV4: No factor loadings above 0.5\nV5: Factor 2 loading is 0.7 (above 0.5)\nV6: Factor 2 loading is 0.8 (above 0.5)\nV7: Factor 2 loading is 0.6 and Factor 3 loading is 0.6 (above 0.5)\nV8: No factor loadings above 0.5\nV9: Factor 3 loading is 0.6 (above 0.5)\nV10: No factor loadings above 0.5\n\nOut of the 10 variables, 7 variables (V1, V2, V3, V5, V6, V7, and V9) have factor loadings above 0.5. Therefore, the researcher would retain 7 variables."
