    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve, related to semi-definite programming:\n\nMaximize the quadratic function f(x) = 5x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 subject to the constraint x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 = 4 and x1 + x2 = 1, where x = [x1, x2] is a vector of variables. \n\nHint: Use semi-definite programming with the help of the Lagrange multiplier method to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Lagrange multiplier method, we first need to form the Lagrangian function. Let's denote the constraints as g(x) = x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 - 4 and h(x) = x1 + x2 - 1. Then, the Lagrangian function L(x, λ, μ) is given by:\n\nL(x, λ, μ) = f(x) - λg(x) - μh(x)\n           = 5x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 - λ(x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 - 4) - μ(x1 + x2 - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L with respect to x1, x2, λ, and μ, and set them to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x1 = 10x1 + 4x2 - 2λx1 - 4λx2 - μ = 0\n∂L/∂x2 = 4x1 + 10x2 - 4λx1 - 10λx2 - μ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 - 4 = 0\n∂L/∂μ = x1 + x2 - 1 = 0\n\nWe have a system of four equations with four unknowns (x1, x2, λ, and μ). Solving this system, we get:\n\nx1 = 1/3\nx2 = 2/3\nλ = 1/3\nμ = 2\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the original function f(x) to find the maximum value:\n\nf(x) = 5(1/3)^2 + 4(1/3)(2/3) + 5(2/3)^2\n     = 5/9 + 8/9 + 20/9\n     = 33/9\n     = 11/3\n\nSo, the maximum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 5x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 subject to the constraints x1^2 + 4x1x2 + 5x2^2 = 4 and x1 + x2 = 1 is 11/3."
