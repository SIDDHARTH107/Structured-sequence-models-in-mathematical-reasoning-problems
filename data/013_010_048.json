    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly where two firms produce an identical product with a total market demand function of P = 200 - Q, where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced. Both firms have a constant marginal cost of production equal to $20. Determine the quantity of output produced by each firm and the corresponding price in the Nash equilibrium of the game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the reaction functions for both firms. Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. Then, the total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2.\n\nThe revenue for firm 1 is R1 = P * q1 = (200 - Q) * q1 = (200 - (q1 + q2)) * q1.\nThe cost for firm 1 is C1 = 20 * q1.\nThe profit for firm 1 is π1 = R1 - C1 = (200 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 20 * q1.\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm 1 will choose q1 such that the first-order condition (FOC) is satisfied:\ndπ1/dq1 = 200 - 2*q1 - q2 - 20 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for firm 2:\nThe revenue for firm 2 is R2 = P * q2 = (200 - Q) * q2 = (200 - (q1 + q2)) * q2.\nThe cost for firm 2 is C2 = 20 * q2.\nThe profit for firm 2 is π2 = R2 - C2 = (200 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 20 * q2.\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm 2 will choose q2 such that the FOC is satisfied:\ndπ2/dq2 = 200 - 2*q2 - q1 - 20 = 0.\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns:\n\n1) 180 - 2*q1 - q2 = 0\n2) 180 - 2*q2 - q1 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nFrom equation 1: q2 = 180 - 2*q1\nSubstitute this into equation 2: 180 - 2*(180 - 2*q1) - q1 = 0\n\nSimplify: 180 - 360 + 4*q1 - q1 = 0\n3*q1 = 180\nq1 = 60\n\nNow, substitute q1 back into the equation for q2:\nq2 = 180 - 2*60\nq2 = 180 - 120\nq2 = 60\n\nSo, in the Nash equilibrium, both firms produce 60 units each. To find the corresponding price, plug the quantities back into the demand function:\n\nP = 200 - Q\nP = 200 - (q1 + q2)\nP = 200 - (60 + 60)\nP = 200 - 120\nP = 80\n\nIn the Nash equilibrium, each firm produces 60 units, and the market price is $80."
