    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture, which remains unproven, states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Since the conjecture has not been disproven, there is currently no known smallest even number greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
