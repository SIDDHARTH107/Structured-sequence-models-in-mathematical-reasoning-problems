    "message_1": "A company has developed a system with 3 components that work together. The probability of the first component failing is 0.05, the probability of the second component failing is 0.02 and the probability of the third component failing is 0.07. What is the probability that the entire system will fail due to any one of the components failing?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the entire system will fail due to any one of the components failing, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will find the probability that none of the components fail, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that the first component does not fail is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\nThe probability that the second component does not fail is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\nThe probability that the third component does not fail is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93.\n\nNow, we find the probability that all three components do not fail by multiplying their individual probabilities:\n\n0.95 * 0.98 * 0.93 ≈ 0.865034\n\nFinally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the entire system will fail due to any one of the components failing:\n\n1 - 0.865034 ≈ 0.134966\n\nSo, the probability that the entire system will fail due to any one of the components failing is approximately 0.134966 or 13.50%."
