    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network with 50 machines will experience a ransomware attack, given that the historical data shows that such attacks occur on average three times a month on a network of 100 machines? Assume that the probability of a single machine being affected by an attack is independent of other machines and remains constant throughout the network.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of a single machine experiencing a ransomware attack as p. Since there are 100 machines in the network and on average 3 attacks occur per month, we can write:\n\n100 * p = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for p:\n\np = 3 / 100\np = 0.03\n\nNow that we know the probability of a single machine experiencing an attack, we can calculate the probability of a network with 50 machines experiencing an attack. Since the probability of a single machine being affected is independent of other machines, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k machines experiencing an attack\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n - k)!))\n- n is the total number of machines (50 in this case)\n- k is the number of machines experiencing an attack (we want to find the probability of at least one attack, so k >= 1)\n- p is the probability of a single machine experiencing an attack (0.03)\n- (1 - p) is the probability of a single machine not experiencing an attack (0.97)\n\nTo find the probability of at least one machine experiencing an attack, we can find the probability of no machines experiencing an attack and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.03)^0 * (0.97)^50\n\nSince C(50, 0) = 1 and 0.03^0 = 1, we have:\n\nP(X = 0) = (0.97)^50\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one machine experiencing an attack:\n\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - (0.97)^50\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nP(X >= 1) ≈ 1 - 0.2136\nP(X >= 1) ≈ 0.7864\n\nSo, the probability that a network with 50 machines will experience a ransomware attack is approximately 78.64%."
