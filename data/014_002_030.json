They agree to use a prime number p = 23 and a base g = 5. Alice chooses a secret integer a = 6 and calculates A = g^a mod p. Bob chooses a secret integer b = 15 and calculates B = g^b mod p. What is the value of the secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B:\n\nA = g^a mod p = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\nB = g^b mod p = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow, Alice and Bob will use the following formulas to compute the secret key:\n\nAlice: secret_key = B^a mod p = 19^6 mod 23\nBob: secret_key = A^b mod p = 8^15 mod 23\n\nBoth should result in the same secret key. Let's calculate it:\n\nAlice: secret_key = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\nBob: secret_key = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nThe secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their communication is 2."
