    "message_2": "A simple graph G with 6 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3 means that each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices in the graph. In this case, the graph G is known as a 3-regular graph.\n\nTo find the clique number of the graph G, we need to find the largest complete subgraph (clique) within the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for the largest clique in the graph G:\n\n1. A 6-vertex clique: This is not possible because in a 6-vertex clique, each vertex would have a degree of 5 (connected to all other 5 vertices), but in our graph, each vertex has a degree of 3.\n\n2. A 5-vertex clique: In a 5-vertex clique, each vertex would have a degree of 4 (connected to all other 4 vertices). However, this is also not possible because each vertex in our graph has a degree of 3.\n\n3. A 4-vertex clique: In a 4-vertex clique, each vertex would have a degree of 3 (connected to all other 3 vertices). This is possible in our graph since each vertex has a degree of 3.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible clique in the graph G is a 4-vertex clique, and the clique number of the graph G is 4."
