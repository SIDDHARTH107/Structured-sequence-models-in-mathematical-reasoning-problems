    "message_1": "A math student is trying to design a schedule for a tournament with 12 teams. Each team must play against every other team exactly once. How many rounds of matches will be needed for the tournament?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of rounds needed for the tournament, we can use the formula for the number of matches in a round-robin tournament, which is:\n\nNumber of matches = n(n-1)/2\n\nwhere n is the number of teams.\n\nIn this case, n = 12, so the number of matches is:\n\nNumber of matches = 12(12-1)/2 = 12(11)/2 = 66\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of rounds needed to complete these 66 matches. In each round, every team can play only one match. Since there are 12 teams, there can be a maximum of 12/2 = 6 matches in each round (as each match involves 2 teams).\n\nTo find the number of rounds, we can divide the total number of matches by the maximum number of matches per round:\n\nNumber of rounds = 66/6 = 11\n\nSo, the tournament will need a minimum of 11 rounds for each team to play against every other team exactly once."
