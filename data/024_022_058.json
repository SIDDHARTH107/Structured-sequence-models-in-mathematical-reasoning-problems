    "message_2": "To find the isometries, we first note that the given metric is a Riemannian metric. An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points, i.e., the metric tensor remains invariant under the transformation.\n\nLet's denote the transformation as $T(x, y, z) = (x', y', z')$. Since the transformation fixes the point $(0, 0, 0)$, we have $T(0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0)$. Moreover, the transformation maps $(1, 0, 0)$ to $(0, 2, 0)$, i.e., $T(1, 0, 0) = (0, 2, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the distance between the points $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 0)$. According to the given metric, this distance is:\n\n$ds^2 = (1-0)^2 + 4(0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 = 1$.\n\nSince the transformation is an isometry, the distance between the transformed points $(0, 2, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 0)$ should also be equal to 1. Using the given metric, we have:\n\n$1 = (0-0)^2 + 4(2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 = 16$.\n\nThis is a contradiction, as the distance between the transformed points is not equal to the distance between the original points. Therefore, there is no isometry of the given metric that fixes the point $(0, 0, 0)$ and maps $(1, 0, 0)$ to $(0, 2, 0)$."
