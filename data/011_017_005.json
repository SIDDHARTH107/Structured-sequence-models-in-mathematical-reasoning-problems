    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. For a 3x3 Latin square, we have n = 3, and we can use the numbers 1, 2, and 3 as our symbols.\n\nTo count the number of 3x3 Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. There is only one way to fill the first row, as the order of the numbers doesn't matter (we can always relabel the symbols afterward). So, we can assume the first row is [1, 2, 3].\n\n2. For the first column, we have two choices for the second row (either 2 or 3). Without loss of generality, let's choose 2. Then, the first column will be [1, 2, 3] (the same as the first row).\n\n3. Now, we need to fill the second row. Since the first element is 2, we have two choices for the second element: 1 or 3. If we choose 1, the second row will be [2, 1, 3], and the third row will be [3, 1, 2]. If we choose 3, the second row will be [2, 3, 1], and the third row will be [3, 1, 2]. In both cases, we get a valid Latin square.\n\nSo, there are 2 different 3x3 Latin squares."
