    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |4x-3| = 9, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero.\n4x - 3 = 9\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n4x = 12\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative.\n-(4x - 3) = 9\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n-4x + 3 = 9\n-4x = 6\nx = -1.5\n\nSo, the solutions for the absolute value equation |4x-3| = 9 are x = 3 and x = -1.5."
