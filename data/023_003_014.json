    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at any given point of the rod using Fourier series, we first need to determine the Fourier coefficients. Since the given function is defined over the interval [0, L], we will use the half-range Fourier sine series representation. The general form of the half-range Fourier sine series is:\n\nf(x) = Σ (B_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere B_n is the Fourier sine coefficient and is given by:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[0 to L] (f(x) * sin(nπx/L)) dx\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 1 - x/L for 0 ≤ x < L, so we need to find the B_n coefficients for this function.\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[0 to L] ((1 - x/L) * sin(nπx/L)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 1 - x/L and dv = sin(nπx/L) dx\nThen du = -1/L dx and v = -(L/nπ) * cos(nπx/L)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nB_n = (2/L) * [(1 - x/L) * (-(L/nπ) * cos(nπx/L)) - ∫(-(L/nπ) * cos(nπx/L) * (-1/L) dx)] from 0 to L\n\nB_n = (2/L) * [-(L/nπ) * (1 - x/L) * cos(nπx/L) + (1/nπ) * ∫cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nNow, integrate cos(nπx/L) with respect to x:\n\n∫cos(nπx/L) dx = (L/nπ) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nSo, the expression for B_n becomes:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * [-(L/nπ) * (1 - x/L) * cos(nπx/L) + (1/nπ) * (L/nπ) * sin(nπx/L)] from 0 to L\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nB_n = 2 * [-(1/nπ) * (1 - L/L) * cos(nπ) + (1/n²π²) * sin(nπ)] - 2 * [-(1/nπ) * (1 - 0) * cos(0) + (1/n²π²) * sin(0)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n\nB_n = 2 * [-(1/nπ) * (-1)^n + (1/nπ)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier sine series representation of the temperature distribution:\n\nf(x) = Σ (B_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nf(x) = Σ [2 * (-(1/nπ) * (-1)^n + (1/nπ)) * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution at any given point of the rod using Fourier series."
