    "message_1": "A medical researcher observed that 20% of people over the age of 60 are affected by a certain disease. What is the probability that out of a group of 10 people over the age of 60, at least 2 will be affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of having the disease, which is 20% or 0.2)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people in the group, which is 10)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people affected by the disease)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 2 people are affected by the disease, so we can find the probability that 0 or 1 person is affected and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = C(10, 0) * 0.2^0 * (1-0.2)^(10-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(10, 1) * 0.2^1 * (1-0.2)^(10-1)\n\nCalculate P(X = 0):\nC(10, 0) = 1\n0.2^0 = 1\n(1-0.2)^10 = 0.8^10 ≈ 0.1074\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.1074 ≈ 0.1074\n\nCalculate P(X = 1):\nC(10, 1) = 10\n0.2^1 = 0.2\n(1-0.2)^9 = 0.8^9 ≈ 0.1342\nP(X = 1) = 10 * 0.2 * 0.1342 ≈ 0.2685\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 people being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) ≈ 1 - 0.1074 - 0.2685 ≈ 0.6241\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 people out of a group of 10 people over the age of 60 will be affected by the disease is approximately 62.41%."
