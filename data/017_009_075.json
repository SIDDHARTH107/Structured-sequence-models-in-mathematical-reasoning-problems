    "message_2": "To show that a group G of order 9 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or a non-abelian group of order 9, we will first analyze the possible structures of G and then determine the structure of its Cayley table.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), G must be a p-group. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the possible structures for an abelian group of order 9 are C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3).\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of the Cayley table for G.\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C9, then G has one element of order 1 (the identity element) and eight elements of order 9. The Cayley table will have a structure where each row and each column contains every element of G exactly once, and the product of any two elements in the same row or column will also be an element of G. This is because the elements of C9 are generated by a single element g, where g^9 = 1, and the elements of G are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^8}.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G has one element of order 1 (the identity element), four elements of order 3, and four elements of order 9. The Cayley table will have a structure where each row and each column contains every element of G exactly once, and the product of any two elements in the same row or column will also be an element of G. This is because the elements of C3 × C3 are generated by two elements a and b, where a^3 = b^3 = 1, and the elements of G are {1, a, a^2, b, b^2, ab, a^2b, ab^2, a^2b^2}.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of a non-abelian group of order 9. A non-abelian group of order 9 would have at least one pair of elements that do not commute, i.e., there exist elements a, b in G such that ab ≠ ba. However, since the order of G is 9, by the class equation, the number of conjugacy classes must divide the order of G. This means that the center of G (the set of elements that commute with every element in G) must have order 1, 3, or 9.\n\nIf the center of G has order 1, then G is not abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is a non-abelian group of order 9. If the center of G has order 9, then G is abelian, which also contradicts our assumption. The only remaining possibility is that the center of G has order 3. However, this would imply that G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which is cyclic, and by a theorem in group theory, if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G must be abelian. This again contradicts our assumption that G is a non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that a group G of order 9 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the abelian group C3 × C3, and the structure of its Cayley table will correspond to one of these two cases."
