    "message_2": "A topological space is called Hausdorff (or T2) if for any two distinct points x and y in the space, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nLet's check if the topology T satisfies this condition.\n\n1. For x = 1 and y = 2, we can choose U = {1, 2} and V = {2, 3}. These sets are not disjoint since 2 ∈ U and 2 ∈ V. Thus, we cannot find disjoint open sets for these points.\n\nSince we have found a pair of points for which we cannot find disjoint open sets, the topology T is not Hausdorff."
