    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 500 employees and an email phishing attack is launched against the company. The probability of an employee falling victim to the attack is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 25 employees will fall victim to the attack?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 25 employees will fall victim to the attack, we can use the complement rule, which states that P(A) = 1 - P(A'), where A is the event we are interested in and A' is the complement of that event. In this case, A is the event that at least 25 employees fall victim to the attack, and A' is the event that fewer than 25 employees fall victim to the attack.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of A':\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of employees, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of employees who fall victim to the attack)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an employee falling victim to the attack, which is 0.05)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nTo find P(A'), we need to sum the probabilities of having 0 to 24 employees fall victim to the attack:\n\nP(A') = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 24)\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of A:\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A')\n\nCalculating the exact probability would require a lot of computation, so we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution to estimate the probability. The normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nIn this case:\n\nμ = 500 * 0.05 = 25\nσ = sqrt(500 * 0.05 * (1-0.05)) = sqrt(500 * 0.05 * 0.95) ≈ 4.87\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability:\n\nP(Z ≥ 25) = P(Z ≥ (25 - μ) / σ) = P(Z ≥ (25 - 25) / 4.87) = P(Z ≥ 0)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(Z ≥ 0) ≈ 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 employees will fall victim to the attack is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
