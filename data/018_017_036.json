The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) × {1} and {1} × (A △ B).\n\n(A △ B) × {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\n{1} × (A △ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 3)}\n\nSo, (A △ B) × {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)} and {1} × (A △ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 3)}."
