    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of $\\omega$, we need to apply the exterior derivative operator $d$ to each term in $\\omega$ and then sum the results. Recall that the exterior derivative operator acts on a differential form by taking the derivative of its coefficients and then wedging the result with the original form.\n\nLet's compute the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$:\n\n1. For the term $x^3 dx\\wedge dy$, we have:\n$$\nd(x^3 dx\\wedge dy) = d(x^3) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = (3x^2 dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, this term vanishes.\n\n2. For the term $e^x dz\\wedge dx$, we have:\n$$\nd(e^x dz\\wedge dx) = d(e^x) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = (e^x dx) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx\n$$\nUsing the antisymmetry property of the wedge product, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\n(e^x dx) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = - (e^x dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dz\n$$\nAgain, since $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, this term also vanishes.\n\n3. For the term $xy dy\\wedge dz$, we have:\n$$\nd(xy dy\\wedge dz) = d(xy) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = (x dy + y dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nNow we can distribute the wedge product:\n$$\n(x dy + y dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = x dy \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + y dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nSince $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, the first term vanishes, and we are left with:\n$$\ny dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nNow, summing the results from each term, we have:\n$$\nd\\omega = 0 + 0 + y dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = y dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nSo the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $d\\omega = y dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$."
