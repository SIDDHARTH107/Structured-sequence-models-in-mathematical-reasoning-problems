    "message_1": "A problem related to elliptic curves and their properties can be:\n\nWhat is the equation of the elliptic curve over the field of real numbers defined by the equation:\n\ny² = x³ + 3x + 2\n\nAnd what are the coordinates of the points of order 2 on this curve?",
    "message_2": "The equation of the elliptic curve over the field of real numbers is already given:\n\ny² = x³ + 3x + 2\n\nTo find the points of order 2 on this curve, we need to find the points (x, y) such that when added to themselves using the group law for elliptic curves, they result in the point at infinity (the identity element of the group).\n\nFor points of order 2, the y-coordinate must be 0, because when we double the point, the line tangent to the curve at that point will be vertical, and the resulting point will be the point at infinity. So, we need to find the x-coordinates that satisfy the equation when y = 0:\n\n0 = x³ + 3x + 2\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and we can try to find its roots. One way to do this is by trying to factor the equation:\n\nx³ + 3x + 2 = x(x² + 3) + 2\n\nUnfortunately, this equation does not factor nicely, so we must resort to numerical methods to find the roots. Using a numerical solver, we find that there is one real root:\n\nx ≈ -1.532\n\nThus, there is one point of order 2 on this elliptic curve:\n\n(-1.532, 0)"
