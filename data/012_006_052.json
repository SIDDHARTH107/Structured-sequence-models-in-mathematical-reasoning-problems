    "message_2": "This graph is not Eulerian but it is Hamiltonian.\n\nA graph is Eulerian if it has an Eulerian circuit, which is a closed walk that visits every edge exactly once. For a graph to be Eulerian, all its vertices must have an even degree. In this graph, vertices A, C, D, and F have a degree of 2, but vertices B and E have a degree of 3, which is odd. Therefore, this graph is not Eulerian.\n\nA graph is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian path, which is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. In this graph, there is a Hamiltonian path:\n\nA - B - C - F - E - D\n\nSo, the graph is Hamiltonian."
