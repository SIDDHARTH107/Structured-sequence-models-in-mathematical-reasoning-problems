    "message_2": "To prove this, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and the properties of groups of order 8.\n\nFirst, note that 8 = 2^3, so by the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 8, and\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nThus, n_2 can be either 1 or 8. \n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup of G, since all Sylow subgroups are conjugate. Let P be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is normal and has order 8, we have that G/P is a group of order 1, which implies that G is isomorphic to P. Since P has order 8, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 8\nIf there are 8 2-Sylow subgroups, each of order 2^3 = 8, then each of these subgroups has 8 - 1 = 7 non-identity elements. Since there are 8 such subgroups, we have a total of 8 * 7 = 56 non-identity elements in the union of these subgroups. However, G has only 8 - 1 = 7 non-identity elements, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of G based on the number of elements of order 2 and the number of elements of order 4.\n\nCase 3: G has an element of order 4\nLet x be an element of order 4 in G. Then the subgroup H generated by x has order 4, and H is a normal subgroup of G since it has index 2. Let y be an element in G not in H. Then G can be written as the disjoint union of the cosets H and yH. \n\nNow, consider the product of two elements in yH: (yh_1)(yh_2) = y(h_1h_2)y^{-1}y = y(h_1h_2), where h_1, h_2 are in H. Since H is normal, y(h_1h_2) is in yH. Thus, yH is closed under the group operation, and G is the internal direct product of H and the subgroup generated by y. \n\nIf y has order 2, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. If y has order 4, then G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nCase 4: G has no elements of order 4\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. However, this is not possible for a group of order 8, as a group with all elements of order 2 must be abelian, and the only abelian group of order 8 is the cyclic group C8, which has an element of order 8, contradicting our assumption.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4."
