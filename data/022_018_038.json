    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial condition, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y).$$\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the PDE:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0.$$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}.$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) $$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0.$$\n\n2) $$Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0.$$\n\nLet's solve these ODEs:\n\n1) The general solution for the first ODE is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx).$$\n\n2) The general solution for the second ODE is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky).$$\n\nNow, we have the general solution for the PDE:\n\n$$u(x, y) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))(C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky)).$$\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the initial condition $u(x, 0) = 2\\cos(2x) + \\sin(4x)$. When $y = 0$, we have:\n\n$$u(x, 0) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))(C).$$\n\nComparing this with the initial condition, we can see that we need two terms in the sum, one with $k = 2$ and another with $k = 4$. Therefore, we can write the solution as a sum of two solutions:\n\n$$u(x, y) = u_1(x, y) + u_2(x, y),$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$u_1(x, y) = (A_1\\cos(2x) + B_1\\sin(2x))(C_1\\cosh(2y) + D_1\\sinh(2y)),$$\n\nand\n\n$$u_2(x, y) = (A_2\\cos(4x) + B_2\\sin(4x))(C_2\\cosh(4y) + D_2\\sinh(4y)).$$\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition to each term:\n\n$$u_1(x, 0) = 2\\cos(2x),$$\n\nwhich implies that $A_1 = 2$, $B_1 = 0$, and $C_1 = 1$. Therefore,\n\n$$u_1(x, y) = 2\\cos(2x)(\\cosh(2y) + D_1\\sinh(2y)).$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$u_2(x, 0) = \\sin(4x),$$\n\nwhich implies that $A_2 = 0$, $B_2 = 1$, and $C_2 = 1$. Therefore,\n\n$$u_2(x, y) = \\sin(4x)(\\cosh(4y) + D_2\\sinh(4y)).$$\n\nFinally, the solution to the PDE that satisfies the initial condition is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = 2\\cos(2x)(\\cosh(2y) + D_1\\sinh(2y)) + \\sin(4x)(\\cosh(4y) + D_2\\sinh(4y)).$$"
