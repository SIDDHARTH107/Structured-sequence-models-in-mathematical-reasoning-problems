    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have v = 9 and e = 12. We can rearrange the formula to solve for f:\n\nf = 2 - v + e\nf = 2 - 9 + 12\nf = 5\n\nNow, we can use the inequality derived from the Handshaking lemma for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 9 - 6\n12 ≤ 27 - 6\n12 ≤ 21\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, this is not a guarantee, so we need to check if we can draw the graph without any edge crossings.\n\nWe can start by drawing a simple graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges without any edge crossings:\n\n1. Draw a cycle with 6 vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and connect them with 6 edges.\n2. Add the 7th vertex inside the cycle and connect it to vertices 1, 2, and 3 with 3 edges.\n3. Add the 8th vertex inside the cycle and connect it to vertices 4, 5, and 6 with 3 edges.\n4. Finally, add the 9th vertex inside the cycle but outside the triangle formed by vertices 7 and 8. Connect it to vertices 1 and 4 with 2 edges.\n\nNow we have a graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges without any edge crossings, so the graph G is indeed planar."
