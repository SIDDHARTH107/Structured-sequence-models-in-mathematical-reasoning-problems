If both players choose the same number, they share the reward equally.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium for the Traveler's Dilemma game, we need to identify the strategies where no player can benefit by changing their choice, given the other player's choice. In this game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose the lowest possible number, which is 2.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that if a player chooses any number higher than 2, their opponent can choose a number just one less than their choice and get a higher payoff. For example, if player A chooses 3, player B can choose 2 and get a payoff of 3, while player A only gets a payoff of 2. If player A chooses 4, player B can choose 3 and get a payoff of 4, while player A only gets a payoff of 3. This pattern continues for all choices above 2.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium outcome for this Traveler's Dilemma game is when both players choose 2, resulting in a shared payoff of 2 for each player."
