    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Jacobi iteration method, we first need to rearrange the equations in the form of x, y, and z:\n\nEquation 1: x = (7 - 3y - z) / 2\nEquation 2: y = (-8 - x - 2z) / 5\nEquation 3: z = (9 - 3x - y) / -6\n\nNow, we will use an initial guess for x, y, and z. Let's use x0 = 0, y0 = 0, and z0 = 0 as our initial guess.\n\nNext, we will iterate through the equations using the Jacobi iteration method:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (7 - 3(0) - 0) / 2 = 3.5\ny1 = (-8 - 0 - 2(0)) / 5 = -1.6\nz1 = (9 - 3(0) - 0) / -6 = -1.5\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (7 - 3(-1.6) - (-1.5)) / 2 = 2.55\ny2 = (-8 - 3.5 - 2(-1.5)) / 5 = -0.7\nz2 = (9 - 3(2.55) - (-0.7)) / -6 = -0.675\n\nWe can continue iterating until the values of x, y, and z converge to a certain level of accuracy. For this example, let's stop at iteration 2. The approximate solution for the system of linear equations using the Jacobi iteration method is:\n\nx ≈ 2.55\ny ≈ -0.7\nz ≈ -0.675"
