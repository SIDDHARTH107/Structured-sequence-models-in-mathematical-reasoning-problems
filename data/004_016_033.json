    "message_2": "Yes, we can use the Mean Value Theorem to find the average speed at which the car traveled at some point during this time period.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, let's consider the position function of the car, s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t. The function s(t) is continuous on the closed interval [9, 11] and differentiable on the open interval (9, 11).\n\nThe average speed of the car over the time interval [9, 11] is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, which is:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nAverage speed = 150 km / 2 hours\nAverage speed = 75 km/h\n\nNow, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists at least one point c in the interval (9, 11) such that the derivative of the position function, s'(c), is equal to the average speed:\n\ns'(c) = 75 km/h\n\nSince s'(t) represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time t, this means that at some point during the time period (9, 11), the car traveled at an average speed of 75 km/h."
