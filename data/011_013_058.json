    "message_2": "To find the number of students interested in either math or physics, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that the number of students interested in either math or physics is equal to the sum of the number of students interested in math and the number of students interested in physics, minus the number of students interested in both.\n\nSo, the number of students interested in either math or physics is:\n\n(Number of students interested in math) + (Number of students interested in physics) - (Number of students interested in both)\n\n= 7 + 6 - 4\n\n= 13\n\nTherefore, 13 students are interested in either math or physics."
