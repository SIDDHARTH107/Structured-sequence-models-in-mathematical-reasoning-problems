    "message_2": "A group of order 30 has a prime factorization of 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, we can analyze the possible Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, there can be 1 or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups.\nFor the prime factor 3, there can be 1 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups.\nFor the prime factor 5, there can be 1 or 6 Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup.\nIn this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups: Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_30.\n\n2. One Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and six Sylow 5-subgroups.\nIn this case, the group is a semidirect product of Z_3 and Z_10, which is isomorphic to Z_30.\n\n3. Fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup.\nIn this case, the group is a semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_6. There are two possibilities: Z_30 and D_30 (dihedral group of order 30).\n\n4. Fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and six Sylow 5-subgroups.\nThis combination is not possible due to the Sylow theorems.\n\n5. One Sylow 2-subgroup, ten Sylow 3-subgroups, and one Sylow 5-subgroup.\nThis combination is not possible due to the Sylow theorems.\n\n6. One Sylow 2-subgroup, ten Sylow 3-subgroups, and six Sylow 5-subgroups.\nThis combination is not possible due to the Sylow theorems.\n\n7. Fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, ten Sylow 3-subgroups, and one Sylow 5-subgroup.\nThis combination is not possible due to the Sylow theorems.\n\n8. Fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, ten Sylow 3-subgroups, and six Sylow 5-subgroups.\nThis combination is not possible due to the Sylow theorems.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three distinct ways a group of order 30 can be presented up to isomorphism: Z_30, Z_30, and D_30."
