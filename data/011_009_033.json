    "message_2": "The Bell number formula is used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. However, in this problem, we are asked to arrange the balls in a straight line, which is a permutation problem. Therefore, we will use the permutation formula with repetition allowed.\n\nThere are 5 different colors of balls, and we need to arrange them in a straight line of length 10. Since the balls can be repeated, we have 5 choices for each of the 10 positions in the line.\n\nUsing the permutation formula with repetition allowed, we have:\n\nNumber of ways = 5^10 = 9,765,625\n\nSo, there are 9,765,625 ways to arrange these colors of balls in a straight line of length 10."
