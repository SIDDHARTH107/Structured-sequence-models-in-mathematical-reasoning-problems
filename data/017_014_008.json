    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism class of the group G, we will first analyze the given information.\n\n1. The order of G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5.\n2. The element a has order 10, and the element b has order 2.\n3. The relation ab = ba^3 is given.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible isomorphism classes for a group of order 20:\n\n1. C_20: The cyclic group of order 20.\n2. C_2 x C_10: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 10.\n3. D_20: The dihedral group of order 20.\n4. C_5 x C_4: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nWe can eliminate the first two possibilities because in both C_20 and C_2 x C_10, all elements commute, which is not the case in our group G (since ab ≠ ba).\n\nNow let's consider D_20. The dihedral group D_20 has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^10 = e, b^2 = e, ab = ba^9⟩. Comparing this with the given presentation of G, we see that the only difference is the relation ab = ba^3 in G instead of ab = ba^9 in D_20. However, since (a^9)^3 = a^27 = a^7 (mod 10), the relation ab = ba^3 is equivalent to the relation ab = ba^9 in D_20. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D_20.\n\nFinally, let's consider C_5 x C_4. In this group, all elements commute, which is not the case in G. So, G cannot be isomorphic to C_5 x C_4.\n\nThus, we conclude that the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_20."
