    "message_2": "a) To find the Fourier transform of f(x) = cos(3x) + sin(5x), we can use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nFirst, we need to find the Fourier transform of each term separately.\n\nFor cos(3x):\n\nF_cos(ω) = ∫[cos(3x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite cos(3x) as:\n\ncos(3x) = (1/2) * (e^(i3x) + e^(-i3x))\n\nNow, we can rewrite F_cos(ω) as:\n\nF_cos(ω) = (1/2) * ∫[(e^(i3x) + e^(-i3x)) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nSeparate the integrals:\n\nF_cos(ω) = (1/2) * [∫[e^(i(3-ω)x)] dx + ∫[e^(-i(3+ω)x)] dx] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\nF_cos(ω) = (1/2) * [π * (δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3))]\n\nFor sin(5x):\n\nF_sin(ω) = ∫[sin(5x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite sin(5x) as:\n\nsin(5x) = (1/2i) * (e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x))\n\nNow, we can rewrite F_sin(ω) as:\n\nF_sin(ω) = (1/2i) * ∫[(e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x)) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nSeparate the integrals:\n\nF_sin(ω) = (1/2i) * [∫[e^(i(5-ω)x)] dx - ∫[e^(-i(5+ω)x)] dx] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\nF_sin(ω) = (1/2i) * [π * (δ(ω - 5) - δ(ω + 5))]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of f(x) by adding the Fourier transforms of the individual terms:\n\nF(ω) = F_cos(ω) + F_sin(ω) = (1/2) * [π * (δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3))] + (1/2i) * [π * (δ(ω - 5) - δ(ω + 5))]\n\nb) The function f(x) can be expressed in terms of frequency components using the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωx)] dω from -∞ to ∞\n\nUsing the Fourier transform F(ω) obtained in part a:\n\nf(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[((1/2) * [π * (δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3))] + (1/2i) * [π * (δ(ω - 5) - δ(ω + 5))]) * e^(iωx)] dω from -∞ to ∞\n\nUsing the properties of the Dirac delta function, we can simplify the integral:\n\nf(x) = (1/2) * [cos(3x) + (1/i) * sin(5x)]\n\nf(x) = cos(3x) + sin(5x)\n\nc) The maximum frequency component in the function f(x) can be found by looking at the frequencies present in the Fourier transform F(ω). We have frequency components at ω = ±3 and ω = ±5. The maximum frequency component is ω = 5."
