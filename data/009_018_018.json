    "message_2": "This is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), and finding an explicit general solution is not always possible. However, we can attempt to find a numerical solution for this specific initial value problem.\n\nLet's rewrite the ODE as a system of first-order ODEs. Define a new function v(t) = y'(t). Then, the given ODE can be written as:\n\ny'(t) = v(t)\nv'(t) = y'(t) - y^2(t)\n\nNow, we have a system of first-order ODEs:\n\ny'(t) = v(t)\nv'(t) = -y^2(t) + v(t)\n\nwith the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = v(0) = 1.\n\nWe can use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to find an approximate solution for this system of ODEs. The general solution cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, but the numerical solution will provide a good approximation for specific values of t."
