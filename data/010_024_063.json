    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a regular hyperbolic hexagon can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area (A) of a regular hyperbolic hexagon with edge length (L) is given by:\n\nA = (6 - 12π/3) * L^2\n\nIn this case, the edge length L is 4. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nA = (6 - 12π/3) * 4^2\nA = (6 - 4π) * 16\nA = 96 - 64π\n\nSo, the area of the regular hyperbolic hexagon with edge length 4 is 96 - 64π square units."
