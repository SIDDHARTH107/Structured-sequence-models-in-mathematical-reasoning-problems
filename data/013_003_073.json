    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A has a sum of $50 to split with Player B. Player A proposes a split, and Player B can either accept or reject the split. If Player B accepts the split, the money is split according to the proposal. If Player B rejects the split, neither player gets any money. If Player A proposes a split of $30/$20, what is the minimum amount that Player B would need to receive in order to accept the split?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount that Player B would need to receive in order to accept the split depends on their preferences and how they value the money. There is no fixed minimum amount that applies to all Player Bs. However, if we assume that Player B is rational and wants to maximize their payoff, they would accept any amount greater than $0, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. In this case, the minimum amount that Player B would need to receive in order to accept the split would be $0.01 (assuming we are dealing with cents as the smallest unit of currency)."
