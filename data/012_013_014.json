    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 6 vertices and 7 edges, we need to consider the possible structures of the graph and the chromatic polynomial for each structure. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) gives the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G.\n\nCase 1: G is a tree\nIf G is a tree, it has 5 edges (since a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges). This case is not possible because G has 7 edges.\n\nCase 2: G contains a cycle\nSince G has 6 vertices and 7 edges, it must contain at least one cycle. Let's consider the possible cycle structures:\n\n1. G contains a single 3-cycle (triangle) and the remaining 4 edges form a tree structure.\n2. G contains a single 4-cycle (square) and the remaining 3 edges form a tree structure.\n3. G contains a single 5-cycle (pentagon) and the remaining 2 edges form a tree structure.\n4. G contains a single 6-cycle (hexagon) and the remaining edge forms a tree structure.\n\nFor each of these cases, we can use the chromatic polynomial formula for cycles and trees to find the chromatic polynomial of G.\n\n1. P(G, k) = P(triangle, k) * P(tree with 4 edges, k) = (k(k-1)(k-2)) * k(k-1)^4\n2. P(G, k) = P(square, k) * P(tree with 3 edges, k) = (k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3)) * k(k-1)^3\n3. P(G, k) = P(pentagon, k) * P(tree with 2 edges, k) = (k(k-1)(k^3-6k^2+11k-6)) * k(k-1)^2\n4. P(G, k) = P(hexagon, k) * P(tree with 1 edge, k) = (k(k-1)(k^4-10k^3+35k^2-50k+24)) * k(k-1)\n\nSince G must have one of these structures, the chromatic polynomial of G is the sum of the chromatic polynomials for each case:\n\nP(G, k) = (k(k-1)(k-2)) * k(k-1)^4 + (k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3)) * k(k-1)^3 + (k(k-1)(k^3-6k^2+11k-6)) * k(k-1)^2 + (k(k-1)(k^4-10k^3+35k^2-50k+24)) * k(k-1)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 6 vertices and 7 edges."
