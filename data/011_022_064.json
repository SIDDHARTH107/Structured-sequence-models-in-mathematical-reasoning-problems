They have 5 items to choose from, each with a different weight and value:\n\nItem 1: 4 lbs, $10 value\nItem 2: 3 lbs, $8 value\nItem 3: 2 lbs, $5 value\nItem 4: 1 lb, $3 value\nItem 5: 3 lbs, $9 value\n\nWhat combination of items should the student choose to maximize the total value of items they can carry in their knapsack, without exceeding the maximum weight limit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value of items in the knapsack without exceeding the weight limit, we can try different combinations of items and calculate their total value and weight.\n\n1. Item 1 + Item 2: 4 lbs + 3 lbs = 7 lbs, $10 + $8 = $18 value\n2. Item 1 + Item 3: 4 lbs + 2 lbs = 6 lbs, $10 + $5 = $15 value\n3. Item 1 + Item 4: 4 lbs + 1 lb = 5 lbs, $10 + $3 = $13 value\n4. Item 1 + Item 5: 4 lbs + 3 lbs = 7 lbs, $10 + $9 = $19 value\n5. Item 2 + Item 3: 3 lbs + 2 lbs = 5 lbs, $8 + $5 = $13 value\n6. Item 2 + Item 4: 3 lbs + 1 lb = 4 lbs, $8 + $3 = $11 value\n7. Item 2 + Item 5: 3 lbs + 3 lbs = 6 lbs, $8 + $9 = $17 value\n8. Item 3 + Item 4: 2 lbs + 1 lb = 3 lbs, $5 + $3 = $8 value\n9. Item 3 + Item 5: 2 lbs + 3 lbs = 5 lbs, $5 + $9 = $14 value\n10. Item 4 + Item 5: 1 lb + 3 lbs = 4 lbs, $3 + $9 = $12 value\n\nNow, let's check if we can add a third item to any of these combinations without exceeding the weight limit:\n\n1. Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 4: 4 lbs + 3 lbs + 1 lb = 8 lbs, $10 + $8 + $3 = $21 value\n2. Item 1 + Item 3 + Item 4: 4 lbs + 2 lbs + 1 lb = 7 lbs, $10 + $5 + $3 = $18 value\n3. Item 2 + Item 3 + Item 4: 3 lbs + 2 lbs + 1 lb = 6 lbs, $8 + $5 + $3 = $16 value\n\nThe combination with the highest value without exceeding the 10-pound weight limit is Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 4, with a total weight of 8 lbs and a total value of $21."
