    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and d is the diameter of the circle.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the circular plot is 12 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(12)\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 12\n\nC ≈ 37.699\n\nTherefore, the perimeter (circumference) of the circular plot is approximately 37.699 meters."
