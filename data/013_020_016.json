    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, let there be 10 contestants who are trying to guess what 85% of the average of all guesses will be. Each contestant's guess will be an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive. If the game is repeated multiple times, what would be the optimal strategy for a contestant to use in order to win the game? What should be the contestant's guess in the first round to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "In the Beauty Contest Game, the optimal strategy involves iteratively applying the reasoning that other players are also trying to guess 85% of the average of all guesses. This is known as the \"level-k\" reasoning, where k represents the number of iterations.\n\nLet's start with the first round:\n\n1. If all players choose a random number between 0 and 100, the average would be around 50.\n2. If all players think that others will choose a random number, they would guess 85% of 50, which is 42.5 (rounded to 43 as an integer).\n3. If all players think that others will guess 43, they would guess 85% of 43, which is 36.55 (rounded to 37).\n4. If all players think that others will guess 37, they would guess 85% of 37, which is 31.45 (rounded to 31).\n\nAs we continue this iterative process, the guesses will converge to a value. In this case, the value converges to 0. However, since the game is played with integers, the optimal guess would be 1, as it is the closest integer to 0 that is within the allowed range.\n\nIn the first round, a contestant should guess 43 to maximize their chances of winning, assuming that other players are also using the level-k reasoning. However, as the game is repeated multiple times, players may adapt their strategies, and the optimal guess may change. It is essential to observe the opponents' behavior and adjust the strategy accordingly."
