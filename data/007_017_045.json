    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that have a difference of 2. To find the first twin prime pair greater than 50, we can start by checking prime numbers just above 50.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 50 is 53. The number 53 + 2 = 55, but 55 is not a prime number (it's divisible by 5 and 11). So, we move on to the next prime number.\n\nThe next prime number is 59. The number 59 + 2 = 61, which is also a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the first twin prime pair greater than 50 is (59, 61)."
