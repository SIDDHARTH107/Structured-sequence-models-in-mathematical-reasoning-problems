    "message_2": "To find the electric potential V at point P(2,3,4) due to a point charge Q = 5 nC at the origin (0,0,0), we can use the formula for the electric potential due to a point charge:\n\nV(r) = kQ/r,\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (approximately 8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge (5 nC), and r is the distance between the point charge and the point P.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance r between the origin and point P(2,3,4). Using the distance formula:\n\nr = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)\nr = √((2 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2)\nr = √(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2)\nr = √(4 + 9 + 16)\nr = √29\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the electric potential formula:\n\nV(r) = kQ/r\nV(√29) = (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2)(5 × 10^-9 C) / √29\nV(√29) ≈ (44.95 × 10^0 N m^2/C) / √29\nV(√29) ≈ 242.73 V\n\nSo the electric potential V at point P(2,3,4) due to the point charge Q = 5 nC at the origin (0,0,0) is approximately 242.73 V."
