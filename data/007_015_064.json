    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime number can be represented as M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the 7th Mersenne prime, we need to find the first 7 prime numbers and then calculate the corresponding Mersenne primes.\n\nThe first 7 prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nNow, we'll calculate the Mersenne primes for these prime numbers:\n\nM_2 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\nM_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\nM_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31\nM_7 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\nM_11 = 2^11 - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047 (not prime, divisible by 23 and 89)\nM_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191\nM_17 = 2^17 - 1 = 131072 - 1 = 131071\n\nThe 7th Mersenne prime number is 131071."
