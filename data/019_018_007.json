    "message_2": "To prove that the sum of two odd integers is an even integer, let's first define what an odd integer and an even integer are.\n\nAn odd integer can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is any integer. Similarly, an even integer can be represented as 2m, where m is any integer.\n\nNow, let a and b be any two odd integers. We can represent them as:\n\na = 2n1 + 1\nb = 2n2 + 1\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a and b:\n\na + b = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\na + b = 2n1 + 2n2 + 2\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\na + b = 2(n1 + n2 + 1)\n\nLet m = n1 + n2 + 1, where m is also an integer since the sum of integers is an integer.\n\nSo, we can represent the sum a + b as:\n\na + b = 2m\n\nSince the sum a + b can be represented in the form 2m, where m is an integer, we have proven algebraically that the sum of two odd integers is an even integer."
