    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 people participating in a beauty contest game, and each person is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). The winner of the game is the person whose number is closest to a fraction of two-thirds of the average of all the numbers submitted. What number should you choose to have the best chance of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the numbers chosen by the participants as x1, x2, ..., x100. The average of all the numbers submitted can be represented as:\n\n(1) (x1 + x2 + ... + x100) / 100\n\nThe target number, which is two-thirds of the average, can be represented as:\n\n(2) (2/3) * ((x1 + x2 + ... + x100) / 100)\n\nTo maximize your chances of winning, you should choose a number that is closest to the expected value of the target number. Let's assume that the other 99 participants choose their numbers uniformly and independently from the range [0, 100]. The expected value of their sum is:\n\n(3) 99 * (100 / 2) = 99 * 50\n\nNow, let's assume you choose a number x. The expected value of the sum of all 100 numbers, including yours, is:\n\n(4) x + 99 * 50\n\nSubstituting (4) into (2), we get the expected value of the target number:\n\n(5) (2/3) * ((x + 99 * 50) / 100)\n\nTo find the optimal value of x, we can differentiate (5) with respect to x and set the derivative equal to zero:\n\n(6) d/dx((2/3) * ((x + 99 * 50) / 100)) = 0\n\nThe derivative of (5) with respect to x is simply (2/3) / 100, which is a constant. Since the derivative is constant and non-zero, there is no maximum or minimum value for the expected target number. However, we can still analyze the behavior of the target number as x varies.\n\nAs x increases, the expected target number also increases. Since the target number is a fraction of the average, it will always be less than the average. Therefore, you should choose a number that is less than the expected average of the other participants' numbers, which is 50.\n\nA common strategy in this type of game is to iteratively apply the two-thirds rule. In the first iteration, you would choose (2/3) * 50 = 33.33. In the second iteration, you would choose (2/3) * 33.33 = 22.22, and so on. After several iterations, the number converges to zero. However, choosing zero might not be the best strategy, as other participants might also use the same iterative process.\n\nTo maximize your chances of winning, you should choose a number slightly above the result of a few iterations of the two-thirds rule, but still less than the expected average of 50. For example, you might choose a number around 20-25, depending on how you expect the other participants to behave. This strategy balances the two-thirds rule with the assumption that other participants might also be using a similar strategy."
