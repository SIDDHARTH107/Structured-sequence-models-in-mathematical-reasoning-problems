    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (z+1)/(z-3) about the point z=0, we can first rewrite the function as a sum of simpler functions that can be easily expanded.\n\nf(z) = (z+1)/(z-3) = 1 + 4/(z-3)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of the second term, 4/(z-3), by using the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = z/3, so:\n\n1/(1-z/3) = 1 + z/3 + (z/3)^2 + (z/3)^3 + ...\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 4:\n\n4/(1-z/3) = 4 + 4(z/3) + 4(z/3)^2 + 4(z/3)^3 + ...\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (z+1)/(z-3) is:\n\nf(z) = 1 + 4 + 4(z/3) + 4(z/3)^2 + 4(z/3)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we need to determine the convergence of this series in the annulus 1<|z|<3. The geometric series converges if |x| < 1. In our case, x = z/3, so we have:\n\n|z/3| < 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n|z| < 3\n\nSince we are given that 1 < |z| < 3, the Laurent series converges in the annulus 1<|z|<3."
