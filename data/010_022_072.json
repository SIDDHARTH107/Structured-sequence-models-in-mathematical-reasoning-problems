    "message_2": "To find the largest possible diameter of a cylindrical hole that can be drilled through the center of the sphere, we need to consider the diameter of the cylinder to be equal to the diameter of the sphere when the cylinder is inscribed within the sphere.\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is twice its radius, so the diameter of the sphere is 2 * 5 cm = 10 cm.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible diameter of a cylindrical hole that can be drilled through the center of the sphere is 10 cm."
