    "message_2": "To find the value of x at iteration 100, we will use the logistic equation iteratively with the given values of r and x_0. \n\nx_n+1 = 3.8 * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nx_0 = 0.2\nr = 3.8\n\nWe will now calculate the value of x at each iteration until we reach the 100th iteration.\n\nHere's a Python code to calculate the value of x at the 100th iteration:\n\n```python\nr = 3.8\nx = 0.2\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nprint(x)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get the value of x at the 100th iteration:\n\nx_100 â‰ˆ 0.839191\n\nSo, the value of x at iteration 100 is approximately 0.839191."
