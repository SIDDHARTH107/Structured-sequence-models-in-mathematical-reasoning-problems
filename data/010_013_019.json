If the total Chern class of $E$ is given by $c(E) = 1 + 2a + 2b$, where $a,b\\in H^2(\\mathbb{RP}^2;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$, then determine the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that admit a vector bundle structure on $E$.",
    "message_2": "Since $E$ is a rank $2$ real vector bundle, we know that its first Chern class $c_1(E)$ must be zero, as the first Chern class is always zero for real vector bundles. The total Chern class $c(E)$ can be written as $c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E)$, where $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$ are the first and second Chern classes, respectively.\n\nGiven that $c(E) = 1 + 2a + 2b$, we can deduce that $c_1(E) = 0$ and $c_2(E) = 2a + 2b$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2$, we have four possible combinations for $(a, b)$:\n\n1. $(a, b) = (0, 0)$: In this case, $c_2(E) = 0$. This corresponds to the trivial rank $2$ vector bundle $E = \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n2. $(a, b) = (0, 1)$: In this case, $c_2(E) = 2$. This corresponds to the nontrivial rank $2$ vector bundle $E$ with second Chern class $c_2(E) = 2$.\n\n3. $(a, b) = (1, 0)$: In this case, $c_2(E) = 2$. This also corresponds to a nontrivial rank $2$ vector bundle $E$ with second Chern class $c_2(E) = 2$.\n\n4. $(a, b) = (1, 1)$: In this case, $c_2(E) = 0$. This corresponds to the trivial rank $2$ vector bundle $E = \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThus, all possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ admit a vector bundle structure on $E$."
