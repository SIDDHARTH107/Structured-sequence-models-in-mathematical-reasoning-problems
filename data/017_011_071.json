    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphic group of G, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 12, which has prime factors 2 and 3. By the Sylow theorems, there exist subgroups of order 2^2 = 4 and 3^1 = 3.\n\nLet n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), so n_2 = 1 or 3. Similarly, n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, then both are normal in G. Let H be the Sylow 2-subgroup and K be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since H and K are both normal, their product HK is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, |HK| = |H||K| = 4 * 3 = 12. Thus, HK = G. Since H and K are both abelian (as they have prime orders), G is also abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to C12, the cyclic group of order 12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIf there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is not abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to either A4 (the alternating group on 4 elements) or D6 (the dihedral group of order 12).\n\nTo distinguish between A4 and D6, we can look at the number of elements of order 2 in G. In A4, there are three elements of order 2, while in D6, there are six elements of order 2.\n\nLet's count the elements of order 2 in G. Each Sylow 2-subgroup has one non-identity element of order 2 (since it is isomorphic to C2 × C2). Since there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, there are at least three elements of order 2 in G. However, there cannot be more than three elements of order 2, as each Sylow 2-subgroup has index 3 in G, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation has three orbits. Thus, there are exactly three elements of order 2 in G.\n\nSince G has three elements of order 2, it is isomorphic to A4. To find an isomorphism mapping, we can map the elements of G to the corresponding permutations in A4. For example, we can map the identity element of G to the identity permutation, the elements of the Sylow 2-subgroups to the 3-cycles, and the elements of the Sylow 3-subgroups to the double transpositions.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to A4, and the isomorphism mapping can be given by mapping the elements of G to the corresponding permutations in A4."
