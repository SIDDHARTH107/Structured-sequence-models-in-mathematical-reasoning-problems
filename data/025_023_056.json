    "message_2": "For a smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus g over the complex numbers, the intersection cohomology groups are given by the singular cohomology groups. In our case, g = 2. The singular cohomology groups for a curve X of genus g are as follows:\n\nH^0(X, ℂ) = ℂ (the constant functions),\nH^1(X, ℂ) = ℂ^(2g) (the space of holomorphic 1-forms),\nH^2(X, ℂ) = ℂ (the space of 2-forms, which is 1-dimensional since X is a curve).\n\nFor genus 2, we have:\n\nH^0(X, ℂ) = ℂ,\nH^1(X, ℂ) = ℂ^4,\nH^2(X, ℂ) = ℂ.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial P(t) is defined as the generating function of the Betti numbers b_i, which are the dimensions of the singular cohomology groups:\n\nP(t) = b_0 + b_1 * t + b_2 * t^2 + ...\n\nFor our curve X of genus 2, the Betti numbers are:\n\nb_0 = dim H^0(X, ℂ) = 1,\nb_1 = dim H^1(X, ℂ) = 4,\nb_2 = dim H^2(X, ℂ) = 1.\n\nThus, the Poincaré polynomial of X is:\n\nP(t) = 1 + 4t + t^2."
