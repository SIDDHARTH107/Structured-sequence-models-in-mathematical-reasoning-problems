Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S = A^b mod p.\n\nGiven the values p = 11, g = 2, a = 3, and b = 4:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8.\n2. Bob computes B = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S = 5^3 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 4.\n4.
