Then, show that either G is isomorphic to <x> (i.e., G is cyclic), or there exists an element y in G of order 2 such that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, or there exists no element of order 2 in G and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.",
    "message_2": "First, let's prove that there exists an element x in G such that the subgroup <x> generated by x is a cyclic group of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be a subgroup of order 5 and K be a subgroup of order 2. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H must be cyclic. Let x be a generator of H, so the order of x is 5. \n\nNow, we want to show that either G is isomorphic to <x> (i.e., G is cyclic), or there exists an element y in G of order 2 such that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, or there exists no element of order 2 in G and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element x in G such that the order of x is 10. In this case, G is isomorphic to <x>, which is a cyclic group of order 10.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5\nLet y be an element of order 2 in G (which exists since K is a subgroup of order 2). If the product of the orders of x and y is equal to the order of G (i.e., 10), then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. This is because the dihedral group D5 has 10 elements and is generated by an element of order 5 and an element of order 2, with their product having order 10.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10 with no element of order 2\nIf there exists no element of order 2 in G, then G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10. This is because there are only two non-abelian groups of order 10 up to isomorphism: the dihedral group D5 and the non-abelian group of order 10 without an element of order 2.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists an element x in G such that the subgroup <x> generated by x is a cyclic group of order 10. Furthermore, we have shown that either G is isomorphic to <x> (i.e., G is cyclic), or there exists an element y in G of order 2 such that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5, or there exists no element of order 2 in G and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10."
