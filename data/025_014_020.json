    "message_2": "The number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials on a complex torus $(\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda)$ can be determined by the first Betti number, which is equal to the complex dimension of the torus.\n\nIn this case, the complex torus is formed by quotienting the complex plane by the lattice $\\Lambda$ generated by $1$ and $\\tau$. Since the complex plane has complex dimension 1, the complex torus also has complex dimension 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials on the complex torus $(\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda)$ is 1."
