    "message_1": "Consider a Beauty Contest Game where there are 4 players and each player has to choose an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The winning criterion is that the winning number is the one closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. If two or more players choose the same number, only the earliest submitted entry counts. If a player chooses a number outside the given range, it is considered an invalid entry and the player is automatically disqualified. What number should each player choose to win the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number to choose, we need to think about the possible choices of the other players and the resulting average. Let's denote the chosen numbers by the players as A, B, C, and D. The average of these numbers is (A + B + C + D) / 4, and the winning criterion is 2/3 of this average.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and will choose numbers within the given range. In the first round of thinking, players might assume that everyone will choose a number uniformly at random between 1 and 100. In this case, the expected average would be 50.5 (the midpoint of the range), and 2/3 of this average would be 33.67. Therefore, a rational player might choose 34 in the first round of thinking.\n\nHowever, if all players think this way, then the expected average would be (34 + 34 + 34 + 34) / 4 = 34, and 2/3 of this average would be 22.67. So, in the second round of thinking, a rational player might choose 23.\n\nContinuing this iterative process, we can see that the chosen numbers will converge to a lower value. The sequence of numbers chosen in each round of thinking would be 34, 23, 15, 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1. At this point, choosing 1 would result in an average of 1, and 2/3 of this average would be 2/3, which is closest to 1.\n\nTherefore, each player should choose 1 to win the game, assuming all players are rational and follow the same thought process. However, it is important to note that this game relies heavily on the assumptions about the other players' strategies, and the optimal choice may vary depending on the actual choices made by the other players."
