    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the third de Rham cohomology group H^3(M,ℤ), we can use the Poincaré duality theorem for closed, oriented manifolds. Poincaré duality states that for a closed, oriented manifold M of dimension n, there is an isomorphism between the k-th and (n-k)-th cohomology groups:\n\nH^k(M,ℤ) ≅ H^(n-k)(M,ℤ)\n\nIn our case, M is a closed 3-dimensional manifold, and we are given the dimension of H^1(M,ℤ) as 4. We want to find the dimension of H^3(M,ℤ). Using Poincaré duality, we have:\n\nH^3(M,ℤ) ≅ H^(3-3)(M,ℤ) = H^0(M,ℤ)\n\nThe 0-th cohomology group H^0(M,ℤ) represents the connected components of the manifold. Since M is a closed, connected 3-dimensional manifold, it has only one connected component. Therefore, the dimension of H^0(M,ℤ) is 1.\n\nThus, the dimension of the third de Rham cohomology group H^3(M,ℤ) is also 1."
