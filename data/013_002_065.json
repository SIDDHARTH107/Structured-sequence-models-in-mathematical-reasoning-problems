    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibria, we need to look for situations where neither player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategy of the other player.\n\n1. If player 1 chooses strategy A and player 2 chooses strategy C:\n   - Player 1's payoff is 2. If they switch to strategy B, their payoff would be 1. So, player 1 has no incentive to change their strategy.\n   - Player 2's payoff is 5. If they switch to strategy D, their payoff would be 0. So, player 2 has no incentive to change their strategy.\n   - Therefore, (A, C) is a Nash Equilibrium.\n\n2. If player 1 chooses strategy A and player 2 chooses strategy D:\n   - Player 1's payoff is 0. If they switch to strategy B, their payoff would be 4.
