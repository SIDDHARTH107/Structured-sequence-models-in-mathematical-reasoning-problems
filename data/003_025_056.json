    "message_1": "A boat travels 10 km due east, then 12 km due north. What is the magnitude and direction of its displacement from the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry. The boat's displacement can be represented as a right triangle, with the eastward travel as one leg (10 km) and the northward travel as the other leg (12 km).\n\n1. Find the magnitude (hypotenuse) of the displacement:\nMagnitude = √(Eastward² + Northward²)\nMagnitude = √(10² + 12²)\nMagnitude = √(100 + 144)\nMagnitude = √244\nMagnitude ≈ 15.62 km\n\n2. Find the direction (angle) of the displacement:\nWe can use the tangent function to find the angle (θ) between the eastward leg and the displacement (hypotenuse).\ntan(θ) = Northward / Eastward\ntan(θ) = 12 / 10\nθ = arctan(12/10)\nθ ≈ 50.19°\n\nSo, the boat's displacement from the starting point is approximately 15.62 km in a direction of 50.19° north of east."
