    "message_2": "The trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, and its complement is the space obtained by removing the knot from the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. To find the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot, we can use the Wirtinger presentation.\n\nThe Wirtinger presentation is a method for computing the fundamental group of the complement of a knot by considering the knot diagram. For the trefoil knot, we can draw a diagram with three crossings. Label the arcs of the knot diagram as A, B, and C, and label the overcrossings as x, y, and z.\n\nThe Wirtinger presentation is given by the following relations:\n\n1. At each crossing, the undercrossing arc is expressed as a product of the overcrossing arc and the adjacent arc. For example, at the crossing with overcrossing x and undercrossing A, we have A = xBx^(-1).\n\n2. The product of the overcrossing arcs is equal to the identity. In this case, xyz = 1.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is then given by the group presentation:\n\n⟨x, y, z | A = xBx^(-1), B = yCy^(-1), C = zAz^(-1), xyz = 1⟩\n\nSubstituting the relations for A, B, and C, we get:\n\n⟨x, y, z | x(yCy^(-1))x^(-1) = yCy^(-1), y(z(x(yCy^(-1))z^(-1))y^(-1) = z(x(yCy^(-1))z^(-1), z(x(yCy^(-1))z^(-1) = x(yCy^(-1)), xyz = 1⟩\n\nSimplifying the relations, we obtain:\n\n⟨x, y, z | xyx^(-1) = yzy^(-1), yzy^(-1) = zxz^(-1), zxz^(-1) = xyx^(-1), xyz = 1⟩\n\nThis group presentation corresponds to the braid group on three strands, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3. Therefore, the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3."
