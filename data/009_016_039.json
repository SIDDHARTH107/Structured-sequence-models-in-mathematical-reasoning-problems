    "message_1": "A metal plate of dimensions 2 m x 3 m is placed in the xy-plane. The temperature on the edges of the plate is kept constant at 0°C while the temperature on the top surface is given by the function T(x,y) = 50 - 10x + 5y, where x and y are the coordinates on the plate. Find the temperature at the center of the plate.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the center of the plate, we need to find the coordinates of the center. Since the plate has dimensions 2 m x 3 m, the center will be at the point (1, 1.5).\n\nNow, we can plug these coordinates into the temperature function T(x, y) = 50 - 10x + 5y:\n\nT(1, 1.5) = 50 - 10(1) + 5(1.5)\nT(1, 1.5) = 50 - 10 + 7.5\nT(1, 1.5) = 40 + 7.5\nT(1, 1.5) = 47.5\n\nSo, the temperature at the center of the plate is 47.5°C."
