    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve related to digital signatures:\n\nSuppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob and wants to digitally sign it so that Bob is assured that the message indeed came from Alice. She plans to use the RSA cryptosystem with her private key (d, n) and Bob's public key (e, n). Assume that both the private and public keys are 2048 bits long. If Alice's message is \"Hello Bob!\", what is the resulting digital signature?",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature for Alice's message \"Hello Bob!\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message into a numerical representation (usually by using a hash function).\n2. Encrypt the hash using Alice's private key (d, n).\n\nHowever, we are not provided with the actual values of Alice's private key (d, n) or Bob's public key (e, n). Therefore, we cannot compute the exact digital signature for the given message. But we can describe the process in general terms.\n\n1. Convert the message \"Hello Bob!\" into a numerical representation using a hash function, such as SHA-256:\n\n   hash(\"Hello Bob!\") = H\n\n2. Encrypt the hash using Alice's private key (d, n):\n\n   signature = H^d mod n\n\nThe resulting digital signature would be the value of 'signature'. This signature can then be sent along with the message to Bob, who can verify it using Alice's public key (e, n)."
