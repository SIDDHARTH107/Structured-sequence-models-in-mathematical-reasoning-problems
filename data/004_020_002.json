    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force F(x) as the particle moves from x = 1 to x = 4, we need to calculate the integral of F(x) with respect to x over the given interval [1, 4]. The work done by a force is given by the formula:\n\nW = ∫(F(x) dx) from x = 1 to x = 4\n\nIn this case, F(x) = 4x + 5. So, we need to find the integral of (4x + 5) with respect to x:\n\n∫(4x + 5) dx = 2x^2 + 5x + C\n\nNow, we need to find the work done from x = 1 to x = 4:\n\nW = (2(4)^2 + 5(4)) - (2(1)^2 + 5(1))\nW = (2(16) + 20) - (2 + 5)\nW = (32 + 20) - 7\nW = 52 - 7\nW = 45 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force F(x) as the particle moves from x = 1 to x = 4 is 45 Joules."
