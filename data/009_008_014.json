    "message_1": "A rope is stretched between two poles that are 10 meters apart. The rope has a mass of 0.5 kg and is under a tension of 50 N. If the rope is disturbed such that a wave with a frequency of 5 Hz and a wavelength of 2 meters is formed, find the speed of the wave and the time it takes for the wave to travel from one pole to the other.",
    "message_2": "To find the speed of the wave, we can use the formula:\n\nspeed = frequency × wavelength\n\nGiven the frequency is 5 Hz and the wavelength is 2 meters, we can calculate the speed:\n\nspeed = 5 Hz × 2 meters = 10 meters/second\n\nNow, to find the time it takes for the wave to travel from one pole to the other, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nThe distance between the poles is 10 meters, and we found the speed of the wave to be 10 meters/second. Therefore, the time it takes for the wave to travel from one pole to the other is:\n\ntime = 10 meters / 10 meters/second = 1 second"
