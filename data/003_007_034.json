    "message_2": "We are given a triangle with sides a = 8, b = 10, and c = 12. We want to find the angle C opposite the side with length 12. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the given side lengths:\n\ncos(C) = (8^2 + 10^2 - 12^2) / (2 * 8 * 10)\ncos(C) = (64 + 100 - 144) / 160\ncos(C) = 20 / 160\ncos(C) = 1/8\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 1/8. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle:\n\nC = arccos(1/8)\n\nC ≈ 82.82°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 12 is approximately 82.82°."
