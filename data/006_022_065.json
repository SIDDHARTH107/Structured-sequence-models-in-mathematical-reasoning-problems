    "message_1": "In a school with 500 students, 60% are expected to score an A grade in their Probability exam. What is the probability that a random sample of 50 students from this school will have at least 30 students who scored an A grade in their Probability exam?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student scoring an A grade)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of students in the sample)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students who scored an A grade)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 50 (the sample size)\n- p = 0.6 (the probability of a student scoring an A grade)\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 30 students who scored an A grade, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 30, 31, 32, ..., 50.\n\nP(X >= 30) = P(X = 30) + P(X = 31) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 30) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.6)^k * (0.4)^(50-k)] for k = 30 to 50\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 30) ≈ 0.972\n\nSo, the probability that a random sample of 50 students from this school will have at least 30 students who scored an A grade in their Probability exam is approximately 0.972 or 97.2%."
