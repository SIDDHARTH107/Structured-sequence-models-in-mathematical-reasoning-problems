    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangles in each layer can be found using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles in layer n = 4^(n-1)\n\nIn this case, we have 4 layers, so we need to find the number of triangles in each layer and sum them up:\n\nLayer 1: 4^(1-1) = 4^0 = 1 triangle\nLayer 2: 4^(2-1) = 4^1 = 4 triangles\nLayer 3: 4^(3-1) = 4^2 = 16 triangles\nLayer 4: 4^(4-1) = 4^3 = 64 triangles\n\nTotal number of triangles = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85 triangles"
