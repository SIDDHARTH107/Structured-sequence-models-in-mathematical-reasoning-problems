    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in the first and second equations equal:\n\n4x - 8iy - 12z = -6 - 4i\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:\n\n(4x - 8iy - 12z) - (2x + 3y + iz) = (-6 - 4i) - 5\n\n2x - 8iy - 12z - 2x - 3y - iz = -11 - 4i\n\nNow we have:\n\n-3y - 8iy - 13z = -11 - 4i\n\nLet's move to the third equation. Multiply the first equation by 2i to make the coefficients of x in the first and third equations equal:\n\n4ix + 6iy + 2iz = 10i\n\nNow, subtract the third equation from the modified first equation:\n\n(4ix + 6iy + 2iz) - (2ix + 3y + 5z) = 10i - (4i - 1)\n\n2ix + 6iy + 2iz - 2ix - 3y - 5z = 6i + 1\n\nNow we have:\n\n6iy - 3y - 3z = 6i + 1\n\nNow we have two equations with y and z:\n\n1) -3y - 8iy - 13z = -11 - 4i\n2) 6iy - 3y - 3z = 6i + 1\n\nLet's multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n18iy - 9y - 9z = 18i + 3\n\nNow, add the first equation to the modified second equation:\n\n(-3y - 8iy - 13z) + (18iy - 9y - 9z) = (-11 - 4i) + (18i + 3)\n\n-12y + 10iy - 22z = -8 + 14i\n\nNow we have:\n\n10iy - 12y - 22z = -8 + 14i\n\nLet's divide the equation by 2:\n\n5iy - 6y - 11z = -4 + 7i\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y + iz = 5\n2) x - 4iy - 6z = -3 - 2i\n3) 5iy - 6y - 11z = -4 + 7i\n\nNow let's express y from the third equation:\n\ny(5i - 6) = 11z + 4 - 7i\n\ny = (11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6)\n\nNow let's substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3((11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6)) + iz = 5\n\nNow let's solve for x:\n\n2x = 5 - iz - 3((11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6))\n\nx = (5 - iz - 3((11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6))) / 2\n\nNow we have expressions for x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = (5 - iz - 3((11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6))) / 2\ny = (11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6)\n\nNow let's substitute these expressions for x and y into the second equation:\n\n(5 - iz - 3((11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6))) / 2 - 4i((11z + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6)) - 6z = -3 - 2i\n\nAfter substituting and solving the equation for z, we get:\n\nz = -1 + i\n\nNow we can find x and y using the expressions we found earlier:\n\nx = (5 - i(-1 + i) - 3((11(-1 + i) + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6))) / 2\nx = (1 + 3i) / 2\nx = 1/2 + 3i/2\n\ny = (11(-1 + i) + 4 - 7i) / (5i - 6)\ny = (-7 - 4i) / (5i - 6)\ny = 1 - i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1/2 + 3i/2\ny = 1 - i\nz = -1 + i"
