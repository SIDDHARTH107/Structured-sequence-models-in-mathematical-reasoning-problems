    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 5x - 1, we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^4)/dx + d(2x^3)/dx - d(7x^2)/dx + d(5x)/dx - d(1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation (d(x^n)/dx = n * x^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4 * 3x^3 + 3 * 2x^2 - 2 * 7x + 5\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 14x + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^3 + 6(2)^2 - 14(2) + 5\n\nf'(2) = 12(8) + 6(4) - 28 + 5\n\nf'(2) = 96 + 24 - 28 + 5\n\nf'(2) = 97\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) at the point x = 2 is 97."
