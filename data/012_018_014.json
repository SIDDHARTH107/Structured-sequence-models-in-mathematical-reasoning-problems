In other words, it is the smallest number of edges whose removal results in a disconnected or trivial graph.\n\nMenger's theorem states that the edge connectivity λ(G) of a graph G is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in G.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 13 edges, we can use the following inequality to find the edge connectivity:\n\nλ(G) ≤ min{d(u) + d(v) - 2 | uv ∉ E(G)}\n\nwhere d(u) and d(v) are the degrees of vertices u and v, respectively, and E(G) is the set of edges in G.\n\nLet's find the minimum degree (δ) of the graph G:\n\nδ(G) = 2 * |E(G)| / |V(G)| = 2 * 13 / 8 = 26 / 8 ≈ 3.25\n\nSince the degree of a vertex must be an integer, the minimum degree of G is 3.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph G:\n\nΔ(G) = |E(G)| - δ(G) + 1 = 13 - 3 + 1 = 11\n\nSince λ(G) is the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in G, it must be less than or equal to the minimum degree of G:\n\nλ(G) ≤ δ(G) = 3\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario where the graph G is a tree (i.e., it has no cycles). In this case, the edge connectivity would be 1, as removing a single edge would disconnect the graph. However, a tree with 8 vertices has only 7 edges, and our graph G has 13 edges, which means it must have at least one cycle.\n\nTherefore, the edge connectivity of G is greater than 1:\n\nλ(G) > 1\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we get:\n\n1 < λ(G) ≤ 3\n\nSince λ(G) must be an integer, the only possible value for the edge connectivity of G is 2. Thus, the edge connectivity of the graph G is 2."
