    "message_2": "The statement \"For all integers x, if x is even then x squared is even\" is true.\n\nProof: Let x be an even integer. By definition, an even integer can be written as x = 2k, where k is an integer. Now, let's square x:\n\nx^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2).\n\nSince 2k^2 is an integer, we can see that x^2 is a multiple of 2, which means x^2 is even. Therefore, the statement is true."
