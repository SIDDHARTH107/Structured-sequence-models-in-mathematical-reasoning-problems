    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we need to apply the chain rule and the sum rule. The sum rule states that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, and the chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the product of the derivative of the outer function and the derivative of the inner function.\n\nSo, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = sin(2x) + cos(3x)\n\ndy/dx = d(sin(2x))/dx + d(cos(3x))/dx\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (d(sin(2x))/d(2x)) * (d(2x)/dx) + (d(cos(3x))/d(3x)) * (d(3x)/dx)\n\nThe derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of cos(u) with respect to u is -sin(u). Also, the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2, and the derivative of 3x with respect to x is 3.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ndy/dx = (cos(2x) * 2) + (-sin(3x) * 3)\n\ndy/dx = 2cos(2x) - 3sin(3x)\n\nThus, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 2cos(2x) - 3sin(3x)"
