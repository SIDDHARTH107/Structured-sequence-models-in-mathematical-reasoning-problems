    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, we are given the population mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), and we want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) falls between 118 and 122 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 10 grams and n = 36 apples, so:\n\nSE = 10 / √36 = 10 / 6 = 1.67 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the sample mean weight (118 and 122 grams, respectively). The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (118 grams):\n\nz_lower = (118 - 120) / 1.67 ≈ -1.20\n\nFor the upper bound (122 grams):\n\nz_upper = (122 - 120) / 1.67 ≈ 1.20\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -1.20 and 1.20. We can do this by looking up the z-scores in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator with a built-in z-score function.\n\nP(-1.20 < z < 1.20) = P(z < 1.20) - P(z < -1.20)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(z < 1.20) ≈ 0.8849\nP(z < -1.20) ≈ 0.1151\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean weight falls between 118 and 122 grams is:\n\nP(-1.20 < z < 1.20) = 0.8849 - 0.1151 ≈ 0.7698\n\nTherefore, there is approximately a 76.98% chance that the sample mean weight of the 36 apples will be between 118 and 122 grams."
