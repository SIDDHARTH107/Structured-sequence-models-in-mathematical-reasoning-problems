    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a closed orientable surface can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere g is the genus of the surface (i.e., the number of holes). In the case of a two-holed torus (genus 2), the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus 2 in the context of topological quantum field theory is -2."
