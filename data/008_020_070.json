    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -1 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} 6x + 9y + 3z &= 21 \\\\ -5x - 7y - 3z &= -13 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate z:\n\n$$x + 2y = 8$$\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the third equation by 3 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} 4x + 6y + 2z &= 14 \\\\ 12x + 3y - 6z &= 3 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow, add the two equations to eliminate z:\n\n$$16x + 9y = 17$$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} x + 2y &= 8 \\\\ 16x + 9y &= 17 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nMultiply the first equation by -16 to eliminate x:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} -16x - 32y &= -128 \\\\ 16x + 9y &= 17 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate x:\n\n$$-23y = -111$$\n\nNow, divide by -23 to find the value of y:\n\n$$y = \\frac{-111}{-23} = 4.826$$\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the equation x + 2y = 8:\n\n$$x + 2(4.826) = 8$$\n\n$$x + 9.652 = 8$$\n\nSubtract 9.652 from both sides:\n\n$$x = -1.652$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of z by substituting the values of x and y into any of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$$2(-1.652) + 3(4.826) + z = 7$$\n\n$$-3.304 + 14.478 + z = 7$$\n\nAdd 3.304 and subtract 14.478 from both sides:\n\n$$z = 7 + 3.304 - 14.478 = -4.174$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\n$$x = -1.652, y = 4.826, z = -4.174$$"
