    "message_2": "To verify that A ∩ B is a subset of A and also a subset of B, we first need to find the intersection of sets A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nIn this case, the elements common to both A and B are 3 and 7. So,\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\n\nNow, we need to verify that A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B. A set C is a subset of a set D if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\n1. A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be in A. Since A ∩ B = {3, 7}, we can see that both 3 and 7 are elements of A:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nThus, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\n2. A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be in B. Since A ∩ B = {3, 7}, we can see that both 3 and 7 are elements of B:\n\nB = {2, 3, 4, 7}\n\nThus, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have verified that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B."
