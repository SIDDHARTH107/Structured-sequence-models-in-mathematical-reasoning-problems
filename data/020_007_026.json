    "message_1": "Suppose that you are in charge of selecting a team of 5 students to represent your school in a mathematics competition. There are 10 students who have registered for the competition from your school. However, due to scheduling conflicts, only 3 of the 10 students can attend the competition. How many different teams of 5 students can you create, given that you can only select from the 3 students who are available to attend?",
    "message_2": "Since there are only 3 students available to attend the competition, it is not possible to create a team of 5 students from the available students."
