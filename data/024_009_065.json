    "message_2": "The scalar curvature of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nScalar curvature (R) = 2 * (n - 1) * K\n\nwhere n is the dimension of the sphere (n = 2 for a 2-dimensional sphere, like the surface of a 3-dimensional ball) and K is the Gaussian curvature. For a sphere of radius r, the Gaussian curvature is given by:\n\nK = 1 / r^2\n\nIn this case, the radius of the sphere is 5 units. So, the Gaussian curvature is:\n\nK = 1 / (5^2) = 1 / 25\n\nNow, we can calculate the scalar curvature for a 2-dimensional sphere (surface of the 3D ball):\n\nR = 2 * (2 - 1) * (1 / 25) = 2 * 1 * (1 / 25) = 2 / 25\n\nSo, the scalar curvature of the sphere with radius 5 units is 2/25 or 0.08."
