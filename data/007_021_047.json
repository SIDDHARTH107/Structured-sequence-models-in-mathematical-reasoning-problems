    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 86871 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % n, where n is the number we want to factor (86871 in this case).\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating x = f(x) and y = f(f(y)).\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n.\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to n, the algorithm has failed. If the GCD is between 1 and n, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % 86871\n2. x = y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) % 86871 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 86871 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 86871) = GCD(21, 86871) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) % 86871 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 86871 = 49284\nGCD(|26 - 49284|, 86871) = GCD(49258, 86871) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) % 86871 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(49284)) = f(84950) = (84950^2 + 1) % 86871 = 83975\nGCD(|677 - 83975|, 86871) = GCD(83298, 86871) = 1\n\nIteration 4:\nx = f(x) = (677^2 + 1) % 86871 = 49284\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(83975)) = f(29096) = (29096^2 + 1) % 86871 = 83975\nGCD(|49284 - 83975|, 86871) = GCD(34691, 86871) = 34691\n\nThe smallest prime factor of 86871 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 34691."
