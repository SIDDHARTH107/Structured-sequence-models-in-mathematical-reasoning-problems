    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 × (side length)²\n\nGiven the side length of the cube is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 × (5 cm)²\n\nSurface Area = 6 × 25 cm²\n\nSurface Area = 150 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
