    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car theft occurring in the specific neighborhood, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of successful outcomes is the number of car thefts reported (12), and the total number of possible outcomes is the number of car owners (250).\n\nProbability = 12 / 250\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can multiply the result by 100:\n\nProbability = (12 / 250) * 100 = 4.8%\n\nSo, the probability of a car theft occurring in the specific neighborhood is 4.8%."
