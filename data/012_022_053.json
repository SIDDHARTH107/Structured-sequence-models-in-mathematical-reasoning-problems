    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(5,5) is the smallest integer N such that any graph with N vertices will contain either a clique of size 5 (a complete subgraph with 5 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex) or an independent set of size 5 (a subgraph with 5 vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge).\n\nThe exact value of R(5,5) is not known, but it is known to be between 43 and 49, inclusive. The lower bound of 43 was proven by Brendan McKay and Stanisław Radziszowski in 1991, while the upper bound of 49 was proven by Paul Erdős in 1966."
