    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve given by the intersection of the two hypersurfaces $X$ and $Y$, we can use the technique of homogenization and intersection theory.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equations of the hypersurfaces in homogeneous coordinates:\n\n$$F(X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3) = X_0X_2 - X_1^2 = 0,$$\n$$G(X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3) = X_1^2X_3 - X_0^3 - X_2^3 = 0.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection multiplicities of the two hypersurfaces at each intersection point. To do this, we can use the Bézout's theorem, which states that the sum of the intersection multiplicities of two curves in a projective space is equal to the product of their degrees.\n\nThe degree of a hypersurface is the degree of its defining polynomial. In our case, the degree of $F$ is 2, and the degree of $G$ is 3. Therefore, by Bézout's theorem, the sum of the intersection multiplicities of $X$ and $Y$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of intersection points between the two hypersurfaces. Since the intersection multiplicities are all positive, the number of intersection points is at most 6. To find the actual number of intersection points, we can analyze the intersection multiplicities at each point.\n\nLet's consider the intersection of $X$ and $Y$ in the affine patch $X_0 = 1$. In this patch, the equations of the hypersurfaces become:\n\n$$x_2 - x_1^2 = 0,$$\n$$x_1^2x_3 - 1 - x_2^3 = 0.$$\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\n$$x_1^2x_3 - 1 - (x_1^2)^3 = 0.$$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $x_1^2$, and it has at most three solutions. For each solution, we can find the corresponding values of $x_2$ and $x_3$ using the equations of the hypersurfaces. Therefore, the intersection curve $X \\cap Y$ has at most three points in the affine patch $X_0 = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of $X$ and $Y$ in the affine patch $X_3 = 1$. In this patch, the equations of the hypersurfaces become:\n\n$$x_0x_2 - x_1^2 = 0,$$\n$$x_1^2 - x_0^3 - x_2^3 = 0.$$\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\n$$x_1^2 - x_0^3 - (x_0x_1)^3 = 0.$$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $x_1^2$, and it has at most three solutions. For each solution, we can find the corresponding values of $x_0$ and $x_2$ using the equations of the hypersurfaces. Therefore, the intersection curve $X \\cap Y$ has at most three points in the affine patch $X_3 = 1$.\n\nSince the intersection curve $X \\cap Y$ has at most three points in each of the affine patches $X_0 = 1$ and $X_3 = 1$, it has at most six points in total. Therefore, the degree of the curve given by the intersection of the two hypersurfaces is 6."
