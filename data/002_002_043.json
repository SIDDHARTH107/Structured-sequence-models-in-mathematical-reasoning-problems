    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(6 cm)³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(216 cm³)\n\nVolume = (288/3)π cm³\n\nVolume = 96π cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 301.59 cubic centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)."
