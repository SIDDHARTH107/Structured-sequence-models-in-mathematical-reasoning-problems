    "message_2": "To find the wavelength and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the wave equation given:\n\ny(x, t) = 0.005 sin(0.1x - 2t)\n\nThis equation is in the form of a sine wave:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, x is the horizontal distance, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time.\n\nFrom the given equation, we can identify the wave number (k) and the angular frequency (ω):\n\nk = 0.1 (rad/m)\nω = 2 (rad/s)\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) using the following relationships:\n\nk = 2π/λ\nω = 2πf\n\nFirst, let's find the wavelength (λ):\n\n0.1 = 2π/λ\nλ = 2π/0.1\nλ = 20π meters\n\nNow, let's find the frequency (f):\n\n2 = 2πf\nf = 2/(2π)\nf = 1/π Hz\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is 20π meters, and the frequency is 1/π Hz."
