    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 + 4x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial or use numerical methods to find the roots. In this case, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, then p must be a factor of the constant term, and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor our polynomial, the constant term is 2, and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2, and the factors of 1 are ±1. So, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±2.\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n(1)^3 + 4(1)^2 + 5(1) + 2 = 1 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 12 ≠ 0\n\n2. For x = -1:\n(-1)^3 + 4(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 2 = -1 + 4 - 5 + 2 = 0\n\nSo, x = -1 is a root of the polynomial. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 + 4x^2 + 5x + 2) ÷ (x + 1) = x^2 + 3x + 2\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic factor:\n\nx^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\nx^3 + 4x^2 + 5x + 2 = (x + 1)^2(x + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the roots:\n\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1 (double root)\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation x^3 + 4x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0 are x = -1 (with multiplicity 2) and x = -2."
