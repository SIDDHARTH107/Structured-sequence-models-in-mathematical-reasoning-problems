    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r), we will use the following formula:\n\nr = [N * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy] / sqrt([N * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2] * [N * Σ(y^2) - (Σy)^2])\n\nwhere N is the number of data points, Σ(xy) is the sum of the product of x and y, Σx is the sum of x values, Σy is the sum of y values, Σ(x^2) is the sum of the square of x values, and Σ(y^2) is the sum of the square of y values.\n\nFirst, let's find the sums:\n\nΣx = 10 + 5 + 8 + 6 = 29\nΣy = 85 + 70 + 82 + 77 = 314\nΣ(xy) = (10 * 85) + (5 * 70) + (8 * 82) + (6 * 77) = 850 + 350 + 656 + 462 = 2318\nΣ(x^2) = 10^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 + 6^2 = 100 + 25 + 64 + 36 = 225\nΣ(y^2) = 85^2 + 70^2 + 82^2 + 77^2 = 7225 + 4900 + 6724 + 5929 = 24778\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = [4 * 2318 - 29 * 314] / sqrt([4 * 225 - 29^2] * [4 * 24778 - 314^2])\nr = [9272 - 9106] / sqrt([900 - 841] * [99112 - 98596])\nr = [166] / sqrt([59] * [516])\nr = 166 / sqrt(30444)\nr = 166 / 174.48\n\nr ≈ 0.95\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours spent studying per week and the average exam score is approximately 0.95, which indicates a strong positive correlation."
