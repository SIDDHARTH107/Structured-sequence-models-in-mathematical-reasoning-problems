    "message_2": "To find all possible multiplication tables for a group of order 8, we first need to identify the possible groups of order 8. There are three such groups up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, and the dihedral group D4.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8:\n\nThe cyclic group C8 has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, where a is a generator of the group. The multiplication table for C8 is as follows:\n\n```\n   | 1  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5  a^6  a^7\n---+--------------------------------\n 1 | 1  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5  a^6  a^7\n a | a a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5  a^6  a^7   1\na^2|a^2 a^3  a^4  a^5  a^6  a^7   1   a\na^3|a^3 a^4  a^5  a^6  a^7   1   a  a^2\na^4|a^4 a^5  a^6  a^7   1   a  a^2  a^3\na^5|a^5 a^6  a^7   1   a  a^2  a^3  a^4\na^6|a^6 a^7   1   a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\na^7|a^7  1   a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5  a^6\n```\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8:\n\nThe quaternion group Q8 has elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}, with the following relations: i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. The multiplication table for Q8 is as follows:\n\n```\n   |  1  -1   i  -i   j  -j   k  -k\n---+-------------------------------\n 1 |  1  -1   i  -i   j  -j   k  -k\n-1 | -1   1  -i   i  -j   j  -k   k\n i |  i  -i  -1   1   k  -k  -j   j\n-i | -i   i   1  -1  -k   k   j  -j\n j |  j  -j  -k   k  -1   1   i  -i\n-j | -j   j   k  -k   1  -1  -i   i\n k |  k  -k   j  -j  -i   i  -1   1\n-k | -k   k  -j   j   i  -i   1  -1\n```\n\n3. Dihedral group D4:\n\nThe dihedral group D4 has elements {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The multiplication table for D4 is as follows:\n\n```\n   |  1   r  r^2  r^3   s  sr  sr^2 sr^3\n---+-----------------------------------\n 1 |  1   r  r^2  r^3   s  sr  sr^2 sr^3\n r |  r  r^2  r^3   1  sr sr^2 sr^3   s\nr^2| r^2  r^3   1   r sr^2 sr^3   s  sr\nr^3| r^3   1   r  r^2 sr^3   s  sr sr^2\n s |  s  sr  sr^2 sr^3   1   r  r^2  r^3\n sr| sr sr^2 sr^3   s   r  r^2  r^3   1\nsr^2|sr^2 sr^3   s  sr  r^2  r^3   1   r\nsr^3|sr^3   s  sr sr^2  r^3   1   r  r^2\n```\n\nNow, we can determine which group each table corresponds to:\n\n- The first table corresponds to the cyclic group C8, as it is generated by a single element a and has the structure of a cyclic group.\n- The second table corresponds to the quaternion group Q8, as it has the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 and the structure of the quaternion group.\n- The third table corresponds to the dihedral group D4, as it has the structure of a dihedral group with rotations r and reflections s."
