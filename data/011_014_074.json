    "message_2": "To minimize the number of connected components, we want to maximize the number of edges in each connected component. A connected graph with n vertices will have at least n-1 edges. \n\nLet's consider the case where the graph has only one connected component. In this case, the graph would have 7 edges (8 vertices - 1). However, this is not possible since the graph has 12 edges.\n\nNow let's consider the case where the graph has two connected components. In this case, we want to distribute the vertices and edges between the two connected components to maximize the number of edges in each.\n\nLet one connected component have 5 vertices and the other have 3 vertices. The first connected component will have at least 4 edges (5 vertices - 1) and the second connected component will have at least 2 edges (3 vertices - 1). This gives us a total of 6 edges, which is still less than 12.\n\nNow let's try three connected components. We can distribute the vertices as 4, 2, and 2. The first connected component will have at least 3 edges (4 vertices - 1), and the other two connected components will have at least 1 edge each (2 vertices - 1). This gives us a total of 5 edges, which is still less than 12.\n\nFinally, let's try four connected components. We can distribute the vertices as 3, 2, 2, and 1. The first connected component will have at least 2 edges (3 vertices - 1), and the other two connected components with 2 vertices will have at least 1 edge each (2 vertices - 1). The last connected component has only 1 vertex and no edges. This gives us a total of 4 edges, which is still less than 12.\n\nHowever, we can add the remaining 8 edges (12 - 4) to the connected components with 3 and 2 vertices without creating any new connected components. For example, we can add 5 edges to the connected component with 3 vertices, making it a complete graph, and add 3 edges to one of the connected components with 2 vertices, making it a multigraph.\n\nSo, the minimum possible number of connected components that this graph can have is 4."
