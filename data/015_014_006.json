    "message_2": "Since the daily temperature can vary by a maximum of 10 degrees Fahrenheit, we need to consider the possible temperature changes for the next three days.\n\nFor the maximum temperature:\nDay 1: 70 + 10 = 80 degrees Fahrenheit\nDay 2: 80 + 10 = 90 degrees Fahrenheit\nDay 3: 90 + 10 = 100 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nFor the minimum temperature:\nDay 1: 70 - 10 = 60 degrees Fahrenheit\nDay 2: 60 - 10 = 50 degrees Fahrenheit\nDay 3: 50 - 10 = 40 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nSo, the maximum temperature the city could experience in the next three days is 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the minimum temperature is 40 degrees Fahrenheit."
