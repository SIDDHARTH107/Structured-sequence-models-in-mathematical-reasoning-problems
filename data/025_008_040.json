    "message_2": "To calculate the dimension of the space of holomorphic forms of degree 2 on X, we can use the Hodge decomposition theorem. For a smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus g, the Hodge decomposition theorem states that the space of differential forms of degree k on X can be decomposed into the direct sum of spaces of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic forms:\n\nΩ^k(X) = ⊕_{p+q=k} H^p(X, Ω^q).\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the space of holomorphic forms of degree 2, so we want to find the dimension of H^2(X, Ω^0), where Ω^0 denotes the space of holomorphic functions on X.\n\nNow, we can use the Hodge diamond to find the dimensions of the cohomology groups H^p(X, Ω^q). The Hodge diamond for a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus g is given by:\n\n      1\n    0   0\n  g-1 g-1\n    0   0\n      1\n\nIn our case, g = 3, so the Hodge diamond looks like:\n\n      1\n    0   0\n  2   2\n    0   0\n      1\n\nFrom the Hodge diamond, we can see that the dimension of H^2(X, Ω^0) is 1. Therefore, the dimension of the space of holomorphic forms of degree 2 on X is 1."
