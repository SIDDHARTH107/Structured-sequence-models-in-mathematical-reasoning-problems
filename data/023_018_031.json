    "message_1": "A system has the transfer function G(s) = 1 / (s^2 + 2s + 2). Apply the Fourier transform to this transfer function to find its frequency response. Then find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at ω = 1.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to replace s with jω in the transfer function G(s), where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency. So, the frequency response G(jω) is given by:\n\nG(jω) = 1 / ((jω)^2 + 2(jω) + 2)\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression:\n\nG(jω) = 1 / (-ω^2 + 2jω + 2)\n\nTo find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at ω = 1, we substitute ω = 1 into the expression:\n\nG(j) = 1 / (-1 + 2j + 2)\n\nG(j) = 1 / (1 + 2j)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude and phase of G(j):\n\nMagnitude: |G(j)| = √(Real^2 + Imaginary^2) = √(1^2 + 2^2) = √5\n\nPhase: θ = arctan(Imaginary / Real) = arctan(2 / 1) = arctan(2)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the frequency response at ω = 1 is √5, and the phase is arctan(2)."
