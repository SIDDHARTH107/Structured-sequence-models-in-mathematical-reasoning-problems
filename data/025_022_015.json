    "message_2": "To compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups H^i(X,ℂ) for i = 0,1,2, we will use the fact that X is a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus g, and we will first determine the genus of the curve.\n\nThe given equation is x^3 + y^3 = 1. We can homogenize this equation by introducing a new variable z, obtaining x^3 + y^3 = z^3. This is now a homogeneous equation in the projective plane ℙ^2.\n\nThe degree of the curve is the maximum of the degrees of the monomials, which is 3 in this case. To find the genus, we can use the formula:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2,\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, d = 3, so:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1.\n\nNow that we know the genus of the curve is 1, we can compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups H^i(X,ℂ) for i = 0,1,2 using the following facts:\n\n1. For i = 0, the cohomology group H^0(X,ℂ) corresponds to the space of constant functions on X, which is 1-dimensional. So, dim H^0(X,ℂ) = 1.\n\n2. For i = 1, the cohomology group H^1(X,ℂ) is related to the genus of the curve by the formula dim H^1(X,ℂ) = 2g. Since g = 1, we have dim H^1(X,ℂ) = 2.\n\n3. For i = 2, the cohomology group H^2(X,ℂ) is related to the Euler characteristic of the curve, which is given by the formula χ(X) = 2 - 2g. In our case, χ(X) = 2 - 2(1) = 0. Since the Euler characteristic is 0, we have dim H^2(X,ℂ) = 0.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the cohomology groups H^i(X,ℂ) for i = 0,1,2 are:\n\ndim H^0(X,ℂ) = 1,\ndim H^1(X,ℂ) = 2,\ndim H^2(X,ℂ) = 0."
