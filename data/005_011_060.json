A completely randomized design is used. How many tomato plants are needed for the experiment if the sample size per plot is 16, and there are a total of 16 plots?",
    "message_2": "To determine the total number of tomato plants needed for the experiment, you can multiply the sample size per plot by the total number of plots.\n\nIn this case, the sample size per plot is 16, and there are 16 plots. So, the total number of tomato plants needed is:\n\n16 (sample size per plot) x 16 (total number of plots) = 256 tomato plants"
