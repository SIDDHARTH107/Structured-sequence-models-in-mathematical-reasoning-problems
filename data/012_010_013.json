    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum size of the vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of a minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of a maximum matching.\n\nA matching is a set of edges in a graph such that no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum matching is the largest possible matching that can be found in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges. The maximum number of edges in a matching for a graph with 7 vertices is 3 (since each vertex can be part of at most one edge in the matching, and we have an odd number of vertices). This is because if we have a matching with 4 edges, it would require 8 vertices, which is more than the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nNow, we know that the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. Since the maximum matching has 3 edges, the minimum vertex cover must have at least 3 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
