    "message_2": "To find an explicit formula for $a_n$, we will first look at the first few terms of the sequence and try to identify a pattern.\n\n$a_1 = 1$\n\n$a_2 = 2a_1 + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$\n\n$a_3 = 2a_2 + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$\n\n$a_4 = 2a_3 + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$\n\nWe can see that the sequence is $1, 3, 7, 15, \\dots$. Notice that each term is one less than a power of 2:\n\n$1 = 2^1 - 1$\n\n$3 = 2^2 - 1$\n\n$7 = 2^3 - 1$\n\n$15 = 2^4 - 1$\n\nBased on this pattern, we can conjecture that the explicit formula for $a_n$ is:\n\n$a_n = 2^n - 1$\n\nNow, we will prove this formula by induction.\n\nBase case: For $n=1$, we have $a_1 = 2^1 - 1 = 1$, which is true.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the formula holds for some $n \\geq 1$, i.e., $a_n = 2^n - 1$. We want to show that the formula also holds for $n+1$, i.e., $a_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - 1$.\n\nUsing the recursive formula, we have:\n\n$a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 1$\n\nSubstitute the inductive hypothesis $a_n = 2^n - 1$:\n\n$a_{n+1} = 2(2^n - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 2 + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1$\n\nThus, the formula holds for $n+1$.\n\nBy induction, the explicit formula for $a_n$ is:\n\n$a_n = 2^n - 1$ for all $n \\geq 1$."
