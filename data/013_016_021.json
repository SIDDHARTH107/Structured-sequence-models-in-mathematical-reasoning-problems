An insured driver can choose between driving carefully and causing no accidents or driving carelessly and causing an accident with a probability of 0.20, where the total cost of an accident (including the deductible) is $10,000. What policy should a driver choose and why?",
    "message_2": "To determine which policy a driver should choose, we need to calculate the expected cost of each policy for both careful and careless driving. The expected cost is the sum of the monthly premium and the expected cost of accidents.\n\nLet's first calculate the expected cost of accidents for both careful and careless driving:\n\n1. Careful driving: The probability of causing an accident is 0, so the expected cost of accidents is $0.\n\n2. Careless driving: The probability of causing an accident is 0.20, so the expected cost of accidents is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected cost of each policy for both careful and careless driving:\n\n1. Policy A:\n   - Careful driving: Expected cost = Monthly premium + Expected cost of accidents = $100 * 12 + $0 = $1,200 per year.\n   - Careless driving: Expected cost = Monthly premium + Expected cost of accidents = $100 * 12 + $2,000 = $3,200 per year.\n\n2. Policy B:\n   - Careful driving: Expected cost = Monthly premium + Expected cost of accidents = $150 * 12 + $0 = $1,800 per year.\n   - Careless driving: Expected cost = Monthly premium + Expected cost of accidents - Deductible difference = $150 * 12 + $2,000 - ($500 - $250) = $3,250 per year.\n\nComparing the expected costs, we can see that:\n\n- For careful driving, Policy A is cheaper ($1,200 per year) than Policy B ($1,800 per year).\n- For careless driving, Policy A is also cheaper ($3,200 per year) than Policy B ($3,250 per year).\n\nTherefore, a driver should choose Policy A, as it has a lower expected cost for both careful and careless driving. However, it's important to note that driving carefully is always the best option, as it significantly reduces the expected cost of insurance."
