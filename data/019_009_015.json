    "message_1": "Let p and q be two propositions. If we know that p → q is true and p is true as well, what can we conclude about q in intuitionistic logic?",
    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, if we know that p → q is true and p is true as well, we can conclude that q is true. This is because intuitionistic logic follows the modus ponens rule, which states that if a conditional statement (p → q) is true and its antecedent (p) is true, then its consequent (q) must also be true."
