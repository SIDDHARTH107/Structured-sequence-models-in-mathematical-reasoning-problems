    "message_2": "Let's first understand the construction of the Peano curve of order 3.\n\n1. Start with a straight line segment of length L.\n2. Divide the segment into 3 equal parts, each of length L/3.\n3. Replace the middle part with two segments that form a right-angled equilateral triangle. The length of each new segment is also L/3.\n\nNow, we have 4 segments, each of length L/3. The total length of the curve after the first iteration is 4 * (L/3) = (4/3)L.\n\nFor the second iteration, we apply the same process to each of the 4 segments. Each segment is divided into 3 equal parts and replaced by 4 segments of the same length. So, the total number of segments after the second iteration is 4 * 4 = 16, and the length of each segment is (L/3) / 3 = L/9. The total length of the curve after the second iteration is 16 * (L/9) = (16/9)L.\n\nFor the third iteration, we apply the same process to each of the 16 segments. Each segment is divided into 3 equal parts and replaced by 4 segments of the same length. So, the total number of segments after the third iteration is 16 * 4 = 64, and the length of each segment is (L/9) / 3 = L/27. The total length of the curve after the third iteration (order 3) is 64 * (L/27) = (64/27)L.\n\nSo, the length of the Peano Curve of order 3 is (64/27)L, where L is the initial length of the straight line segment."
