    "message_1": "If the statement \"All dogs I have seen have fur\" is true for the first 50 dogs I have seen, what is the probability that the next dog I see will also have fur according to inductive logic?",
    "message_2": "Inductive logic is based on the idea that if a pattern has held true in the past, it is likely to continue in the future. In this case, since all 50 dogs you have seen so far have fur, inductive logic would suggest that the next dog you see is also likely to have fur. However, inductive logic does not provide exact probabilities.\n\nTo estimate a probability, we can use the observed frequency of dogs with fur in your sample. In this case, the frequency is 50/50 or 100%. While this might suggest that the probability of the next dog having fur is 100%, it's important to remember that inductive logic is not foolproof, and there is always a possibility that the next dog you see might not have fur. The larger the sample size, the more confident we can be in our inductive reasoning, but we can never be absolutely certain."
