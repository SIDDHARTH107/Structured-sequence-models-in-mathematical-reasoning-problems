    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 3z + 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-(3) ± √((3)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nz = (-3 ± √(9 - 8)) / 2\nz = (-3 ± √1) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) z = (-3 + √1) / 2\nz = (-3 + 1) / 2\nz = -2 / 2\nz = -1\n\n2) z = (-3 - √1) / 2\nz = (-3 - 1) / 2\nz = -4 / 2\nz = -2\n\nSo, the solutions to the complex number equation z^2 + 3z + 2 = 0 are z = -1 and z = -2."
