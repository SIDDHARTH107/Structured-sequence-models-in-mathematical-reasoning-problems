    "message_2": "There is no Eulerian path in this graph. An Eulerian path is a path that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).\n\nIn this graph, all vertices have an odd degree:\n\n- A, C, D, and F have a degree of 3.\n- B and E have a degree of 4.\n\nSince there are more than 2 vertices with an odd degree, there is no Eulerian path in this graph."
