    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to select 2 red balls and 3 blue balls from the bag, we can use the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nFor selecting 2 red balls from 7:\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7*6) / (2*1) = 21 ways\n\nFor selecting 3 blue balls from 5:\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4) / (3*2) = 10 ways\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to select 2 red balls and 3 blue balls, we multiply the number of ways for each color:\n21 (ways to select red balls) * 10 (ways to select blue balls) = 210 ways"
