    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x+5) = 7, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n(√(2x+5))^2 = 7^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 5 = 49\n\nNow, we will isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\n2x = 44\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 22"
