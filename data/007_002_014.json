    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 6, 8, and 10 simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.\n\nPrime factorization of the numbers:\n6 = 2 × 3\n8 = 2^3\n10 = 2 × 5\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor:\n2^3, 3, and 5\n\nMultiply these prime factors together:\n2^3 × 3 × 5 = 8 × 3 × 5 = 24 × 5 = 120\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 6, 8, and 10 simultaneously is 120."
