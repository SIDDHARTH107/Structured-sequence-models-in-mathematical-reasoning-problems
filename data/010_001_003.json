To confirm this, note that there is no combination of elements in T that can be united to form {1,3}.\n\n3) {1} is not open since it is not an element of the topology T. To confirm this, note that there is no combination of elements in T that can be united to form {1}.\n\n4) {4} is not open since 4 is not an element of X. By definition, a subset of X can only be open if it is an element of the topology T, and since 4 is not in X, {4} cannot be an element of T."
