    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will use the Sylow Theorems and analyze the possible subgroups of G.\n\nRecall the Sylow Theorems:\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nSince the order of G is 12, we have two prime divisors: 2 and 3. Let's analyze the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nSylow 2-subgroups:\nThe order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 2^2 = 4. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nSylow 3-subgroups:\nThe order of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 3^1 = 3. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow let's analyze the possible structures of G based on the number of Sylow subgroups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are normal in G. The order of P is 4 and the order of Q is 3, and they intersect trivially. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C4 x C3 = C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Let Q be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since Q is unique, it is normal in G. The order of Q is 3, and it has index 4 in G. By the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, G has a subgroup H of order 4 such that G is the semidirect product of Q and H. The only groups of order 4 are C4 and C2 x C2. If H is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C3 and C4, which is D6. If H is isomorphic to C2 x C2, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C3 and C2 x C2, which is A4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is not possible, as it would imply that there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 3, which would account for 4 * 2 = 8 elements of order 3 in G. However, this would leave only 4 elements remaining in G, which is not enough to form a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups."
