    "message_2": "To find the minimum size of a vertex cover of G, we can use the concept of the maximum matching. A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. A matching is a set of edges with no common vertices.\n\nAccording to König's theorem, in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. However, we don't know if G is bipartite or not. So, we can use the following inequality for general graphs:\n\nSize of minimum vertex cover ≥ (Size of maximum matching)\n\nSince G has 6 vertices and 8 edges, the maximum degree of a vertex in G is at least 8/6 > 4/3, so there must be at least one vertex with degree 3 or more. Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where G has a vertex with degree 3, and the other 5 vertices have degree 1. In this case, the maximum matching would have size 3, and the minimum vertex cover would also have size 3.\n\nHowever, if there are more edges, the size of the maximum matching and the minimum vertex cover would increase. Since G has 8 edges, the size of the maximum matching must be at least 4 (as each edge in a matching is disjoint, and 8/2 = 4). Therefore, the size of the minimum vertex cover must be at least 4.\n\nSo, the minimum size of a vertex cover of G is 4."
