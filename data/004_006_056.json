    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find its first derivative and set it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first try to factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, to classify these critical points as local maxima, local minima, or saddle points, we need to examine the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nDifferentiating f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 is a local maximum.\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a local minimum.\n\nIn summary, the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 3. There are no saddle points."
