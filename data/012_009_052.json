    "message_2": "This degree sequence is not possible for a simple graph. Here's why:\n\nA simple graph is an undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges between vertices. In a simple graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices must be even, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nIn the given degree sequence (4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0), the sum of the degrees is 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 20, which is even. However, there is another condition that must be satisfied for the degree sequence to be valid.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 20, so there should be 10 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the degree sequence. There are three vertices with degree 4, which means that they are connected to four other vertices. However, there are only two vertices with degree 1, and two vertices with degree 0. The vertices with degree 4 cannot be connected to the vertices with degree 0, as they would then have a degree of 1. This means that the three vertices with degree 4 must be connected to the two vertices with degree 1 and at least one of the vertices with degree 3.\n\nHowever, this creates a contradiction. If a vertex with degree 4 is connected to a vertex with degree 1, that vertex with degree 1 cannot be connected to any other vertex with degree 4. This means that it is impossible to connect the three vertices with degree 4 to the two vertices with degree 1 and still maintain the given degree sequence.\n\nTherefore, this degree sequence is not possible for a simple graph."
