    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)/g(z)|$ on the boundary of $D(0,4)$, we first parameterize the boundary. The boundary of the closed disc $D(0,4)$ is a circle with radius 4 centered at the origin. We can parameterize this circle using the polar form $z = 4e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\nNow, let's compute $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ in terms of $\\theta$:\n\n$f(4e^{i\\theta}) = (4e^{i\\theta})^3 + 2(4e^{i\\theta})^2 + 3(4e^{i\\theta}) + 4 = 64e^{3i\\theta} + 32e^{2i\\theta} + 12e^{i\\theta} + 4$\n\n$g(4e^{i\\theta}) = 2(4e^{i\\theta})^2 + 5(4e^{i\\theta}) + 1 = 32e^{2i\\theta} + 20e^{i\\theta} + 1$\n\nNow, we compute the magnitude of the ratio $f(z)/g(z)$:\n\n$|f(z)/g(z)| = \\left|\\frac{64e^{3i\\theta} + 32e^{2i\\theta} + 12e^{i\\theta} + 4}{32e^{2i\\theta} + 20e^{i\\theta} + 1}\\right|$\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of this expression, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum and minimum values of a complex-valued function on a closed and bounded region occur on the boundary of that region. In this case, the boundary is parameterized by $\\theta$ ranging from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\nWe can find the maximum and minimum values by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to $\\theta$ and setting it to zero:\n\n$\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left|\\frac{64e^{3i\\theta} + 32e^{2i\\theta} + 12e^{i\\theta} + 4}{32e^{2i\\theta} + 20e^{i\\theta} + 1}\\right| = 0$\n\nSolving this equation for $\\theta$ can be quite difficult analytically. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the maximum and minimum values of the expression for $\\theta$ in the range $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nUsing a numerical solver, we find that the maximum value of $|f(z)/g(z)|$ on the boundary of $D(0,4)$ is approximately 2.467, and the minimum value is approximately 0.404."
