    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Here, we have:\n\nlog(base 4) [(4^3)(4^2)/(4^(-3))]\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression inside the brackets using the properties of exponents:\n\n(4^3)(4^2) = 4^(3+2) = 4^5\n\n(4^5)/(4^(-3)) = 4^(5 - (-3)) = 4^(5+3) = 4^8\n\nNow, we have:\n\nlog(base 4) [4^8]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that states log(base b) [b^x] = x, we can simplify the expression:\n\nlog(base 4) [4^8] = 8\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is 8."
