    "message_2": "To find the roots of the polynomial equation x^3 - 7x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, 4) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, the only possible value for q is 1. Therefore, we only need to test the factors of the constant term, 4, which are ±1, ±2, and ±4.\n\nTesting these values, we find that x = 1 is a root of the polynomial, since:\n\n(1)^3 - 7(1)^2 + 12(1) - 4 = 1 - 7 + 12 - 4 = 0\n\nNow that we have found one root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor. Dividing the original polynomial by (x - 1), we get:\n\nx^3 - 7x^2 + 12x - 4 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 6x + 4)\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -6, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 16)) / 2\nx = (6 ± √20) / 2\nx = (6 ± 2√5) / 2\nx = 3 ± √5\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation x^3 - 7x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0 are:\n\nx = 1, x = 3 + √5, and x = 3 - √5."
