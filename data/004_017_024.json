    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 4. Find the length of the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we need to use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x). The formula is:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nwhere L is the length of the curve, a and b are the limits of integration (in this case, x = 0 and x = 4), and f'(x) is the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function y = x^2:\n\nf(x) = x^2\nf'(x) = 2x\n\nNow, let's plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (2x)^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + 4x^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = 2x\ndu/dx = 2\ndx = du/2\n\nWhen x = 0, u = 0\nWhen x = 4, u = 8\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[0, 8] √(1 + u^2) (du/2)\n\nL = (1/2) ∫[0, 8] √(1 + u^2) du\n\nThis integral is a standard integral for the arc length of a hyperbolic function. The result is:\n\nL = (1/2) * [u/2 * √(1 + u^2) + (1/2) * sinh^(-1)(u)] [0, 8]\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nL = (1/2) * [(8/2 * √(1 + 8^2) + (1/2) * sinh^(-1)(8)) - (0/2 * √(1 + 0^2) + (1/2) * sinh^(-1)(0))]\n\nL = (1/2) * [(4 * √(1 + 64) + (1/2) * sinh^(-1)(8)) - (0 + 0)]\n\nL = (1/2) * (4 * √65 + (1/2) * sinh^(-1)(8))\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the numerical value:\n\nL ≈ (1/2) * (32.01562118716424 + 2.961946980917455)\n\nL ≈ 17.48878408404085\n\nSo, the length of the curve y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 17.49 units."
