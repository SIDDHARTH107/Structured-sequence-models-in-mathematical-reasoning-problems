    "message_2": "To find the total number of students who play only basketball or only volleyball, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe number of students who play basketball only is the total number of basketball players minus the number of students who play both sports: 18 - 6 = 12.\n\nThe number of students who play volleyball only is the total number of volleyball players minus the number of students who play both sports: 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nNow, we add the number of students who play basketball only and the number of students who play volleyball only: 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nSo, there are 18 students who play only basketball or only volleyball."
