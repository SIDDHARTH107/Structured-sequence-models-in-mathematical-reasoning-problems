    "message_2": "(a) To determine the values of x for which the series converges absolutely, we will consider the absolute value of the series:\n\n$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2n}\\right| = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right)^{n}$\n\nNow we apply the Ratio Test:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{n+1}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right)^{n+1}}{\\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right)^{n}} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1}\\left(\\frac{x^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{x^2}{4}$\n\nFor the series to converge absolutely, this limit must be less than 1:\n\n$\\frac{x^2}{4} < 1 \\Rightarrow x^2 < 4 \\Rightarrow -2 < x < 2$\n\nSo the series converges absolutely for $x \\in (-2, 2)$.\n\n(b) To determine the values of x for which the series converges conditionally, we need to find the values of x for which the series converges but not absolutely. Since the series is alternating, we can apply the Alternating Series Test:\n\n1. The terms are decreasing in magnitude: $\\frac{1}{n} > \\frac{1}{n+1}$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n2. The limit of the terms goes to zero: $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0$.\n\nThus, the series converges for all $x$ by the Alternating Series Test. However, we already found that it converges absolutely for $x \\in (-2, 2)$. Therefore, the series converges conditionally for $x = -2$ and $x = 2$.\n\n(c) The radius of convergence is the value $R$ such that the series converges for $|x| < R$. From part (a), we found that the series converges absolutely for $x \\in (-2, 2)$, which corresponds to $|x| < 2$. Therefore, the radius of convergence is $R = 2$."
