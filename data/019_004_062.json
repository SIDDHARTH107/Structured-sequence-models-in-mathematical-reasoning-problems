    "message_2": "To determine which statement is true at time t=3, we need to analyze the given temporal logic formula. The formula is given as:\n\n(¬p ∧ Xq) ∨ (p ∧ X(¬q ∧ Xp))\n\nLet's break down the formula:\n\n- ¬p: p is false\n- Xq: q is true in the next time step\n- p: p is true\n- X(¬q ∧ Xp): ¬q is true in the next time step, and p is true in the time step after that\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements:\n\n1. p is true and q is false\n   - If p is true and q is false at time t=3, then the formula (¬p ∧ Xq) is false, since ¬p is false.\n   - For the second part of the formula (p ∧ X(¬q ∧ Xp)), p is true, so we need to check the truth value of X(¬q ∧ Xp) at time t=3.\n     - At t=3, ¬q is true (since q is false), so we need to check the truth value of Xp at time t=4.\n     - We don't have information about the truth value of p at t=4, so we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\n\n2. p is false and q is true\n   - If p is false and q is true at time t=3, then the formula (¬p ∧ Xq) is true, since ¬p is true and Xq is true in the next time step (t=4).\n   - For the second part of the formula (p ∧ X(¬q ∧ Xp)), p is false, so this part is false.\n   - Since the first part of the formula is true, the entire formula is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that statement 2 (p is false and q is true) is true at time t=3."
