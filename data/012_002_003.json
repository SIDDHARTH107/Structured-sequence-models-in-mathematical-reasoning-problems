    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, the graph G is a cycle with 6 vertices. To determine the chromatic number, we can try to color the vertices with the minimum number of colors while ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWe can start by coloring vertex 1 with color A. Then, vertex 2 must have a different color, so we color it with color B. Vertex 3 must also have a different color from vertex 2, so we color it with color A. We can continue this pattern, coloring vertex 4 with color B, vertex 5 with color A, and vertex 6 with color B.\n\nNow, all vertices are colored, and no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We used 2 colors (A and B) to color the graph G. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph G is 2."
