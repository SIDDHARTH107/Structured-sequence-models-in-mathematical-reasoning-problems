    "message_2": "To find the chaotic attractor of the Ikeda map with the given parameter values and initial conditions, we need to iterate the map equations multiple times and observe the behavior of the points (x, y) in the phase space.\n\nThe Ikeda map is defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - (1 / (1 + sqrt(x_n^2 + y_n^2)))\n\nGiven the parameter values a = 0.9184 and b = 0.7932, and the initial conditions x0 = 1 and y0 = 1, we can iterate the map equations to generate a sequence of points (x, y) in the phase space.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform numerical simulations or plot the attractor. To find the chaotic attractor, you can use a programming language like Python or MATLAB to iterate the map equations and plot the points (x, y) in the phase space. The chaotic attractor will be the set of points that the system visits repeatedly in a seemingly random manner."
