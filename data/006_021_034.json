    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of an earthquake occurring in the next year, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nOver the last 100 years, there have been 12 earthquakes. Therefore, the average rate of earthquakes per year is:\n\n12 earthquakes / 100 years = 0.12 earthquakes per year\n\nThis means that, on average, there is a 0.12 probability (or 12%) that the city will experience an earthquake in the next year. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on historical data, and the actual probability may be different due to various factors."
