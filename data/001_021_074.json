    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (-2) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (2).\n\nFactors of -2: ±1, ±2\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±1/2\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n2(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) - 2 = 2 + 5 - 3 - 2 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -1:\n2(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 2 = -2 + 5 + 3 - 2 = 4 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 2:\n2(2)^3 + 5(2)^2 - 3(2) - 2 = 16 + 20 - 6 - 2 = 28 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -2:\n2(-2)^3 + 5(-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 2 = -16 + 20 + 6 - 2 = 8 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 1/2:\n2(1/2)^3 + 5(1/2)^2 - 3(1/2) - 2 = 1/4 + 5/4 - 3/2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1/2 is a root of the polynomial. Now, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n      ______________________\n1/2 |  2    5    -3    -2\n         1    3     0\n      ______________________\n          2    6     0    -2\n```\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is 2x^2 + 6x - 2. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-(6) ± √((6)^2 - 4(2)(-2))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-6 ± √(36 + 16)) / 4\n\nx = (-6 ± √52) / 4\n\nx = (-3 ± √13) / 2\n\nSo, the three possible values of x are:\n\nx = 1/2, x = (-3 + √13) / 2, and x = (-3 - √13) / 2"
