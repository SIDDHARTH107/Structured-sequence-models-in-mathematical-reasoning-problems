    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2, so that the coefficients of x in both equations will be the same.\n\n(2)(2x + 3y) = (2)(11)\n4x + 6y = 22\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 22\n4x - 5y = -7\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 22 - (-7)\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 22 + 7\n11y = 29\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 29 / 11\ny = 2.6363636363636362\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(2.6363636363636362) = 11\n2x + 7.909090909090908 = 11\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 11 - 7.909090909090908\n2x = 3.090909090909092\nx = 1.545454545454546\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1.545454545454546\ny = 2.6363636363636362"
