The material for the top and bottom of the container costs $50 per square meter while the material for the sides costs $20 per square meter. What are the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of materials?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of materials, we need to find the dimensions of the cylinder that minimize the surface area. The volume of a cylinder is given by V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. We are given the volume (V = 500 m^3) and the height (h = 10 m). We can use this information to find the radius.\n\n500 = πr^2(10)\nr^2 = 500 / (10π)\nr^2 = 50 / π\nr ≈ 3.989 m\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the surface area of the cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder is given by A = 2πrh + 2πr^2, where A is the surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height. We can plug in the values we found for r and h.\n\nA = 2π(3.989)(10) + 2π(3.989)^2\nA ≈ 251.33 + 100.53\nA ≈ 351.86 m^2\n\nNow we can find the cost of materials. The top and bottom of the container cost $50 per square meter, and the sides cost $20 per square meter. The top and bottom are both circles with an area of πr^2, and the sides are a rectangle with an area of 2πrh.\n\nCost = (2 * 50 * πr^2) + (20 * 2πrh)\nCost = 100π(3.989)^2 + 40π(3.989)(10)\nCost ≈ 5026.55 + 10053.10\nCost ≈ $15079.65\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of materials are a radius of approximately 3.989 meters and a height of 10 meters, with a total cost of approximately $15,079.65."
