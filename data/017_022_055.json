    "message_2": "To determine whether the group G of order 60 is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 15 (60/2^2) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 20 (60/3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 12 (60/5) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then G has unique Sylow subgroups of orders 2^2, 3, and 5. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since their orders are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is the cyclic group C60.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6, then G has multiple Sylow subgroups of orders 2^2, 3, and 5. In this case, G cannot be abelian, as there are non-normal Sylow subgroups. This is the most general case, and it corresponds to the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n3. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, both of which are normal in G. The intersection of these subgroups is trivial, and their product has order 15. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 15, which is isomorphic to C3 × C5. The quotient group G/(C3 × C5) has order 4, so it is either C4 or C2 × C2. In either case, G is an extension of C3 × C5 by a group of order 4, which is one of the non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 60 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. Without further information about the structure of G, we cannot determine which specific group G is isomorphic to."
