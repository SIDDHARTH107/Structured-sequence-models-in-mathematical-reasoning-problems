    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $15. The production process involves 3 steps and each product requires a different amount of time for each step as shown in the table below:\n\n| Step | Product A | Product B |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1    | 1 hour    | 2 hours   |\n| 2    | 2 hours   | 1 hour    |\n| 3    | 3 hours   | 3 hours   |\n\nThe company has 100 hours for step 1, 120 hours for step 2 and 150 hours for step 3 available. The production capacity for Product A is limited to 80 units and for Product B to 100 units. Due to a limited supply of raw materials, the total production of Product A and Product B together cannot exceed 180 units. Find the optimal number of units of each product to produce that maximizes the total profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the total profit, which is given by the objective function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Time constraint for step 1: x + 2y ≤ 100\n2. Time constraint for step 2: 2x + y ≤ 120\n3. Time constraint for step 3: 3x + 3y ≤ 150\n4. Production capacity constraint for Product A: x ≤ 80\n5. Production capacity constraint for Product B: y ≤ 100\n6. Raw materials constraint: x + y ≤ 180\n7. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can graph the feasible region and find the vertices. Then, we can evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is given by the intersection of the constraints. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 50)\n3. (40, 30)\n4. (60, 0)\n5. (80, 0)\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 50) = 10(0) + 15(50) = 750\n3. P(40, 30) = 10(40) + 15(30) = 850\n4. P(60, 0) = 10(60) + 15(0) = 600\n5. P(80, 0) = 10(80) + 15(0) = 800\n\nThe maximum profit is $850, which occurs when producing 40 units of Product A and 30 units of Product B."
