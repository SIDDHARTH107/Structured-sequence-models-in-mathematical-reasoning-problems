    "message_2": "To find the probability that the sample mean will be between 830 and 870 hours, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough (n > 30). In this case, the sample size is 50, so we can apply the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sampling distribution. The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation (60 hours) and n is the sample size (50 bulbs).\n\nSE = 60 / √50 ≈ 8.485\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the interval (830 and 870 hours, respectively). The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nwhere x is the sample mean, μ is the population mean (850 hours), and SE is the standard error.\n\nFor the lower bound (830 hours):\n\nz_lower = (830 - 850) / 8.485 ≈ -2.36\n\nFor the upper bound (870 hours):\n\nz_upper = (870 - 850) / 8.485 ≈ 2.36\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -2.36 and 2.36. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the area under the curve between these two z-scores.\n\nP(-2.36 < z < 2.36) ≈ 0.9818\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean will be between 830 and 870 hours is approximately 98.18%."
