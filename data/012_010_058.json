    "message_2": "To find the minimum vertex cover, we need to select the smallest number of vertices such that each edge in the graph is connected to at least one selected vertex.\n\nIn this graph, we can achieve this by selecting the following vertices: A, C, and E.\n\nBy selecting these vertices, we cover all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Vertex A covers edges AB and AD.\n- Vertex C covers edges BC and CD.\n- Vertex E covers edges DE and EF.\n\nSo, the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3."
