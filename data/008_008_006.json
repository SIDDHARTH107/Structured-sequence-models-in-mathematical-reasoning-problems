    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products P and Q using two machines M1 and M2. Each unit of P requires 3 hours of machine time on M1 and 1 hour on M2, while each unit of Q requires 1 hour on M1 and 2 hours on M2. If the company has 110 hours of machine time available on M1 and 90 hours on M2, determine the maximum number of units of each product that can be produced assuming that all units produced can be sold.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product P and y be the number of units of product Q.\n\nAccording to the problem, the time required for product P on machine M1 is 3 hours per unit and for product Q is 1 hour per unit. So, the total time used on machine M1 can be represented as:\n\n3x + y ≤ 110 (1)\n\nSimilarly, the time required for product P on machine M2 is 1 hour per unit and for product Q is 2 hours per unit. So, the total time used on machine M2 can be represented as:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 90 (2)\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of units of each product that can be produced, so we need to find the maximum values of x and y that satisfy both inequalities (1) and (2).\n\nFirst, let's solve inequality (1) for y:\n\ny ≤ 110 - 3x\n\nNow, let's solve inequality (2) for y:\n\ny ≤ (90 - x) / 2\n\nNow we have two inequalities for y:\n\ny ≤ 110 - 3x\ny ≤ (90 - x) / 2\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum number of units, we need to find the largest values of x and y that satisfy both inequalities. We can do this by graphing the inequalities and finding the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. In this case, it is the area where y is less than or equal to both 110 - 3x and (90 - x) / 2.\n\nTo find the maximum number of units, we need to find the largest integer values of x and y that lie within the feasible region. We can do this by testing different values of x and y and checking if they satisfy both inequalities.\n\nFor example, let's try x = 20 and y = 30:\n\n3(20) + 30 = 90, which is less than or equal to 110\n20 + 2(30) = 80, which is less than or equal to 90\n\nSo, x = 20 and y = 30 is a possible solution. However, we need to check if there are any larger values of x and y that also satisfy the inequalities.\n\nLet's try x = 22 and y = 28:\n\n3(22) + 28 = 94, which is less than or equal to 110\n22 + 2(28) = 78, which is less than or equal to 90\n\nSo, x = 22 and y = 28 is also a possible solution, and it results in a larger total number of units (22 + 28 = 50) compared to the previous solution (20 + 30 = 50).\n\nWe can continue testing different values of x and y, but it turns out that x = 22 and y = 28 is the largest integer solution that satisfies both inequalities.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of units of product P that can be produced is 22, and the maximum number of units of product Q that can be produced is 28."
