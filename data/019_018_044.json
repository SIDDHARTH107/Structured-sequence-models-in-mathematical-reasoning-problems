    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the contrapositive method. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" If the contrapositive is true, then the original statement is also true.\n\nOriginal statement: If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n\nContrapositive: If the ground is not wet (not Q), then it is not raining (not P).\n\nAssume the ground is not wet (not Q). If it were raining (P), then the ground would be wet (Q) according to the original statement. However, this contradicts our assumption that the ground is not wet (not Q). Therefore, it must be the case that it is not raining (not P).\n\nThus, we have proven the contrapositive: If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining. This means the original statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is also true."
