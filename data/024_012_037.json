    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator applied to the 1-form α, we first need to find an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point of M. Since the volume form is given by dVol(v, w, u) = √2 v ∧ w ∧ u, we can choose the orthonormal basis {e1, e2, e3} such that e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3 = √2 e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3. \n\nNow, we can express the 1-form α in terms of the basis:\n\nα = (x dy - y dx + z^2 dz) = α1 dx + α2 dy + α3 dz,\n\nwhere α1 = -y, α2 = x, and α3 = z^2.\n\nThe Hodge star operator applied to α is a 2-form, which can be written as:\n\n*α = β1 dy ∧ dz + β2 dz ∧ dx + β3 dx ∧ dy,\n\nwhere β1, β2, and β3 are the coefficients to be determined.\n\nTo find these coefficients, we use the property that for any 1-form ω,\n\nα ∧ *ω = ⟨α, ω⟩ dVol,\n\nwhere ⟨α, ω⟩ is the inner product of α and ω.\n\nLet ω = ω1 dx + ω2 dy + ω3 dz. Then,\n\nα ∧ *ω = (α1 dx + α2 dy + α3 dz) ∧ (β1 dy ∧ dz + β2 dz ∧ dx + β3 dx ∧ dy).\n\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, we get:\n\nα ∧ *ω = (α1β3 - α2β2) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz.\n\nOn the other hand, ⟨α, ω⟩ dVol = (α1ω1 + α2ω2 + α3ω3) √2 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz.\n\nComparing the coefficients of dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, we get:\n\nα1β3 - α2β2 = √2 (α1ω1 + α2ω2 + α3ω3).\n\nSubstituting α1 = -y, α2 = x, and α3 = z^2, we obtain:\n\n-yβ3 + xβ2 = √2 (-yω1 + xω2 + z^2ω3).\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients β1, β2, and β3 by solving the above equation for ω1, ω2, and ω3:\n\n1. For ω1 = 1, ω2 = ω3 = 0, we get β2 = 0 and β3 = -√2.\n2. For ω2 = 1, ω1 = ω3 = 0, we get β2 = √2 and β3 = 0.\n3. For ω3 = 1, ω1 = ω2 = 0, we get β1 = √2.\n\nThus, the Hodge star operator applied to α is:\n\n*α = √2 dy ∧ dz."
