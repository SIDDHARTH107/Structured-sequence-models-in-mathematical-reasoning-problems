    "message_2": "To find the area of the smallest bulb of the Mandelbrot set with a cardioid boundary, we need to determine the radius of the smallest cardioid. The smallest bulb is attached to the main cardioid at the cusp on the left side of the Mandelbrot set. The distance from the origin to the cusp is 0.25 units.\n\nThe radius of the smallest cardioid is half of this distance, which is 0.25/2 = 0.125 units.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nA = (3/8)πr^2\n\nSubstitute the radius r = 0.125:\n\nA = (3/8)π(0.125)^2\nA = (3/8)π(0.015625)\nA ≈ 0.0183103\n\nThe area of the smallest bulb of the Mandelbrot set with a cardioid boundary is approximately 0.0183103 square units."
