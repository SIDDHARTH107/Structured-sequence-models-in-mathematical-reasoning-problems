    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular field be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 500 meters of fencing, we can write the equation as:\n\n500 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that will give us the maximum area. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can solve the perimeter equation for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (500 - 2L) / 2\nW = 250 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (250 - L)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to L and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 250 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 250\nL = 125 meters\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 250 - 125\nW = 125 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular field with the maximum area that can be fenced off are 125 meters by 125 meters."
