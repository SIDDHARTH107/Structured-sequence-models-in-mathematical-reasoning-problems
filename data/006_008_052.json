    "message_1": "A weather forecaster predicts that the probability of rain on a given day is 0.3. If the probability of rain on that day is independent of the probability of having thunderstorms, which has a probability of 0.2, what is the probability that there will be either rain or thunderstorms or both on that day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either rain or thunderstorms or both, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of rain, B is the event of thunderstorms, and A ∩ B is the event of both rain and thunderstorms.\n\nSince the events are independent, the probability of both events occurring is:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44\n\nSo the probability of either rain or thunderstorms or both on that day is 0.44 or 44%."
