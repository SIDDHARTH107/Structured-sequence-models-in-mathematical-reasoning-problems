    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. We can divide the second equation by 2:\n\n(4x + 6y = 24) / 2\n2x + 3y = 12\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 13\n2) 2x + 3y = 12\n\nWe can subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(2x + 3y) - (2x + 3y) = 13 - 12\n0 = 1\n\nSince we have obtained a false statement (0 = 1), this means that the system of linear equations has no solutions."
