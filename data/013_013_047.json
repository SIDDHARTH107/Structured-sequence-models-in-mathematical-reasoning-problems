    "message_1": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, an item worth $100 is being auctioned. There are two bidders, A and B. Bidder A values the item at $75 and bidder B values it at $90. What is the optimal bid for each bidder, assuming they have perfect information about each other's values?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins and pays their bid amount. Since both bidders have perfect information about each other's values, they can strategize accordingly.\n\nBidder A knows that bidder B values the item at $90. If A bids anything above $75, they would be overpaying for the item based on their valuation. Therefore, bidder A's optimal bid would be just below bidder B's valuation, say $89.99, to maximize their chances of winning without overpaying.\n\nBidder B knows that bidder A values the item at $75. To ensure they win the auction, bidder B should bid just above A's valuation, say $75.01. This way, they can secure the item at a price lower than their own valuation and avoid overpaying.\n\nSo, the optimal bids are:\nBidder A: $89.99\nBidder B: $75.01"
