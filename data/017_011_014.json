    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), so n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nCase 1: G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3.\nSince P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. If G also has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2, then P_2 is normal in G as well. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 4. Since the orders are coprime, P_3 ∩ P_2 = {e}, and G is isomorphic to the direct product P_3 × P_2, which is isomorphic to C3 × C4, and thus G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\nCase 2: G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 and four 3-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, P_2 is normal in G, but none of the 3-Sylow subgroups are normal. Let Q be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P_2 is normal, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |P_2||Q| / |P_2 ∩ Q| = 4 * 3 / 1 = 12, so PQ = G. Since P_2 is normal, we have gP_2 = P_2g for all g in G. Therefore, G is a semidirect product of Q and P_2. The action of Q on P_2 is determined by an automorphism of P_2, which is isomorphic to C4. The automorphism group of C4 is isomorphic to C2, so there are two possible actions of Q on P_2: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action results in the direct product C3 × C4, which is isomorphic to C12, but we already considered this case. The non-trivial action results in a group isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nCase 3: G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, neither the 2-Sylow nor the 3-Sylow subgroups are normal in G. Let P_2 and Q be representatives of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups, respectively. Since |G| = 12, there exists an element g in G that is not in P_2 or Q. Consider the conjugate gP_2g^(-1). Since P_2 is not normal, gP_2g^(-1) is a different 2-Sylow subgroup. Similarly, gQg^(-1) is a different 3-Sylow subgroup. Now, consider the element g^2. If g^2 is in P_2 or Q, then g^2 would be in the centralizer of P_2 or Q, which contradicts the fact that g is not in P_2 or Q. Thus, g^2 is not in P_2 or Q, and g^2 must be in the third 2-Sylow subgroup and the fourth 3-Sylow subgroup. This implies that G is generated by the elements of order 2 and 3, so G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6. There are no other non-isomorphic groups of order 12."
