    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 contestants in a beauty contest game, and each contestant must choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the contest will be the contestant whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all the numbers chosen. What number do you choose to maximize your chances of winning the game, and why?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning the game, you should choose a number that is two-thirds of the expected average of all the numbers chosen by the contestants, including yourself.\n\nLet's assume that all the contestants are rational and will also try to maximize their chances of winning. If all the contestants choose a number between 0 and 100, the average of their numbers will be 50. Two-thirds of 50 is 33.33 (repeating).\n\nNow, if all the contestants think this way, they will all choose 33.33. In this case, the average will still be 33.33, and two-thirds of that average will be 22.22 (repeating). \n\nThis process can be iterated, and the numbers will converge to 0. However, since the contestants can only choose a whole number between 0 and 100, they will have to round their choices. \n\nIn this scenario, the best strategy would be to choose 22, as it is the closest whole number to the second iteration (22.22). By choosing 22, you maximize your chances of winning the game, assuming that all the contestants are rational and trying to maximize their chances as well."
