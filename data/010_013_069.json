    "message_2": "To show that there exists a section of $E$ whose zero set is a finite set with exactly $6$ points, we will use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\n\nLet $s: B \\rightarrow E$ be a generic smooth section of the vector bundle $\\pi: E \\rightarrow B$. The zero set of $s$ is given by $Z(s) = \\{b \\in B \\mid s(b) = 0\\}$. We want to show that there exists a section $s$ such that $|Z(s)| = 6$.\n\nConsider the Euler class $e(E) = 3 \\in H^2(B;\\mathbb{Z})$. By definition, the Euler class is the Poincaré dual of the zero set of a generic section, i.e., $PD(e(E)) = [Z(s)]$ for some section $s$. In particular, this implies that the Euler characteristic of the zero set of a generic section is equal to the Euler class of the bundle, i.e., $\\chi(Z(s)) = 3$.\n\nNow, we apply the Poincaré-Hopf theorem to the section $s$. The Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that for a generic section $s$ of a vector bundle, the sum of the indices of the zeros of $s$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of the base manifold $B$, i.e.,\n\n$$\\sum_{b \\in Z(s)} \\operatorname{ind}_b(s) = \\chi(B).$$\n\nSince the rank of the vector bundle is $2$, the indices of the zeros of $s$ are either $+1$ or $-1$. Let $n_+$ and $n_-$ denote the number of zeros with index $+1$ and $-1$, respectively. Then, we have\n\n$$n_+ - n_- = \\chi(B).$$\n\nOn the other hand, the Euler characteristic of the zero set of $s$ is given by\n\n$$\\chi(Z(s)) = n_+ + n_- = 3.$$\n\nSolving these two equations for $n_+$ and $n_-$, we get\n\n$$n_+ = \\frac{\\chi(B) + 3}{2}, \\quad n_- = \\frac{3 - \\chi(B)}{2}.$$\n\nSince $n_+$ and $n_-$ are integers, it follows that $\\chi(B)$ must be an odd integer. Moreover, since $n_+ + n_- = 3$, we have that $|Z(s)| = n_+ + n_- = 6$. Thus, there exists a section $s$ of the vector bundle $E$ whose zero set is a finite set with exactly $6$ points."
