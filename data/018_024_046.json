    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of the two sets and show that it is not distributive over complement by taking the complement of each set and comparing the results.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the two sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {4}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of each set. We need to define a universal set U that contains all the elements in A and B. Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nA' = U - A = {4, 5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A')\n\nA' - B' = {4}\nB' - A' = {1}\n\nSo, A' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. If it is distributive, then (A ∆ B)' = A' ∆ B'. \n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {2, 3, 5}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' = {2, 3, 5} and A' ∆ B' = {1, 4}, we can see that (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B'. Therefore, the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
