The cost to produce one unit of Product A is $5 and the cost to produce one unit of Product B is $3. However, there are limited resources in the production process – you can only produce up to 100 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B.\n\nYour company wants to maximize both profit and production, subject to the resource constraints. The profit for each unit of Product A is $20, and the profit for each unit of Product B is $15. Determine the maximum profit and production quantities for both products.\n\nWhat is the optimal solution for this multi-objective optimization problem?",
    "message_2": "To solve this multi-objective optimization problem, we first need to find the profit function for each product. The profit function is the difference between the revenue and the cost of producing the products.\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nProfit for Product A = Revenue - Cost = 20x - 5x = 15x\nProfit for Product B = Revenue - Cost = 15y - 3y = 12y\n\nThe total profit function P(x, y) = 15x + 12y\n\nNow, we need to consider the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 100 (cannot produce more than 100 units of Product A)\n2. y ≤ 150 (cannot produce more than 150 units of Product B)\n\nWe can use linear programming to find the optimal solution for this problem. The feasible region is a rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (100, 0), (0, 150), and (100, 150). We need to evaluate the profit function at these vertices to find the maximum profit.\n\nP(0, 0) = 15(0) + 12(0) = 0\nP(100, 0) = 15(100) + 12(0) = 1500\nP(0, 150) = 15(0) + 12(150) = 1800\nP(100, 150) = 15(100) + 12(150) = 3300\n\nThe maximum profit is $3300 when producing 100 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B."
