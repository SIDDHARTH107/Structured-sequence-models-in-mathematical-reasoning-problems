    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 12 cm, we can calculate the circumference (C) as follows:\n\nC = πd\nC = 3.14159 × 12\nC ≈ 37.699\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 37.699 cm."
