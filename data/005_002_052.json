To test the claim, a sample of 40 cereal boxes is selected and their weights are recorded. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of the cereal boxes.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of the cereal boxes, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for a 95% confidence interval), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nx̄ = 500 grams (the company's claim for the average weight)\nσ = 5 grams (the company's claim for the standard deviation)\nn = 40 (the sample size)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 500 ± (1.96 * (5 / √40))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard Error = 5 / √40 ≈ 0.79\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (Z * Standard Error):\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.79 ≈ 1.55\n\nFinally, we can find the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 500 ± 1.55\n\nLower Limit = 500 - 1.55 = 498.45 grams\nUpper Limit = 500 + 1.55 = 501.55 grams\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of the cereal boxes is approximately (498.45 grams, 501.55 grams)."
