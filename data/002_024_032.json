    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to add the lengths of all its sides.\n\nPerimeter = Longer base + Shorter base + Side 1 + Side 2\n\nGiven, longer base = 12 cm, shorter base = 8 cm, and both sides have equal length of 5 cm.\n\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 8 cm + 5 cm + 5 cm = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 30 cm."
