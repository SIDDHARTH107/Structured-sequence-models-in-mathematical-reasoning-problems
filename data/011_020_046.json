    "message_1": "A company has 8 job openings for 30 applicants. If each applicant can only fill one job position, how many different ways can the company fill the job openings?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different ways the company can fill the 8 job openings, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of applicants (30), k is the number of job openings (8), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(30, 8) = 30! / (8!(30-8)!)\n\nC(30, 8) = 30! / (8!22!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n30! = 30 × 29 × 28 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 2,652,528,598,121,910,586,363,084,800\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n22! = 22 × 21 × 20 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(30, 8) = 2,652,528,598,121,910,586,363,084,800 / (40,320 × 1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000)\n\nC(30, 8) = 2,652,528,598,121,910,586,363,084,800 / 45,303,204,242,545,530,880,000\n\nC(30, 8) ≈ 58,566,240\n\nSo, there are approximately 58,566,240 different ways the company can fill the 8 job openings."
