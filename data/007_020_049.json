    "message_2": "To find the value of d, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function, φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Find the modular multiplicative inverse of e mod φ(n), which is the value of d\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. n = p * q = 17 * 13 = 221\n2. φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (17-1) * (13-1) = 16 * 12 = 192\n3. Now we need to find d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1, i.e., (d * 7) % 192 = 1\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\n\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for e = 7 and φ(n) = 192, we get:\n\ngcd(7, 192) = 1 = 7 * 55 - 192 * 2\n\nSo, d = 55 (since -2 is not a valid private key)\n\nTherefore, the value of d, the private key in the RSA encryption algorithm, is 55."
