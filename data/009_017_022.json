    "message_1": "Consider a wire with a cross-sectional area of 0.4 square centimeters carrying a current of 3 amperes in the positive x-direction. Find the magnitude and direction of the electric field at a point 1.5 cm away from the wire in the y-direction if the wire is in a vacuum. (Assume the wire is infinitely long and straight.)",
    "message_2": "To find the electric field around a current-carrying wire, we need to use the Ampere's Law. However, Ampere's Law gives us the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire, not the electric field. The electric field around a current-carrying wire in a vacuum is zero because there is no charge accumulation on the wire. The current is uniformly distributed throughout the wire, and there is no net charge on the wire.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the electric field at a point 1.5 cm away from the wire in the y-direction is 0 N/C, and there is no direction associated with it since the electric field is zero."
