Here's a question for them to solve:\n\nLet X be a smooth projective variety, and let L be an ample line bundle on X. Suppose that C is a smooth, irreducible curve on X such that C.L < 0. \n\nProve that there exists a Mori contraction f: X → Y such that f(C) is a point. \n\nThen, use this result to show that any birationally equivalent projective variety X' with a nef (i.e., non-negative intersection with any curve) and big (i.e., has a non-zero global section of some positive power of the line bundle) Cartier divisor is isomorphic to a blowup of a smooth projective variety along a subvariety. \n\nHint: Use the fact that the Picard group of a smooth projective variety is generated by ample line bundles.",
    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nStep 1: Existence of Mori contraction\n\nSince L is an ample line bundle on X, by the Cone Theorem, there exists an extremal ray R in the Mori cone of X such that C.L < 0. Let f: X → Y be the Mori contraction associated with this extremal ray R. Note that f is a projective morphism with connected fibers.\n\nNow, we want to show that f(C) is a point. Since C.L < 0, it follows that C is contained in the union of the fibers of f. If f(C) is not a point, then it must be a curve. However, this would imply that C is contained in a fiber of f, contradicting the fact that C is an irreducible curve. Therefore, f(C) must be a point.\n\nStep 2: Birational equivalence and blowup\n\nLet X' be a projective variety that is birationally equivalent to X, and let D be a nef and big Cartier divisor on X'. Since X and X' are birationally equivalent, there exists a common resolution Z of X and X', and birational morphisms p: Z → X and q: Z → X'. Let E be the exceptional divisor of p, and let F be the exceptional divisor of q. Then, we have p^*L = q^*D + E and q^*D = p^*L - E.\n\nSince D is nef, we have (q^*D).C' ≥ 0 for any curve C' in Z. Thus, (p^*L - E).C' ≥ 0. Since L is ample, p^*L is also ample, and we have (p^*L).C' > 0 for any curve C' in Z. Therefore, E.C' ≥ 0 for any curve C' in Z.\n\nNow, let Y be the image of the Mori contraction f: X → Y, and let g: X' → Y be the induced morphism. Since f(C) is a point, g(C') is also a point for any curve C' in X'. Thus, g factors through the blowup of Y along a subvariety, and X' is isomorphic to this blowup.\n\nIn conclusion, any birationally equivalent projective variety X' with a nef and big Cartier divisor is isomorphic to a blowup of a smooth projective variety along a subvariety."
