    "message_1": "A metal block has a length of 10 cm, width of 5 cm, and height of 2 cm. The temperature distribution in the block is given by the function:\n\nT(x,y,z) = 20 + 100sin(πx/10)sin(2πy/5)sin(πz/2)\n\nwhere T is in degrees Celsius and x, y, and z are the spatial coordinates in centimeters. Find the maximum and minimum temperature in the block.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum temperature in the block, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of the function T(x, y, z).\n\nT(x, y, z) = 20 + 100sin(πx/10)sin(2πy/5)sin(πz/2)\n\nThe maximum and minimum values of the sine function are 1 and -1, respectively. Therefore, we can find the maximum and minimum values of T(x, y, z) by plugging in the maximum and minimum values of the sine functions.\n\nFor the maximum temperature, all sine functions should have a value of 1:\n\nT_max = 20 + 100(1)(1)(1) = 20 + 100 = 120 degrees Celsius\n\nFor the minimum temperature, all sine functions should have a value of -1:\n\nT_min = 20 + 100(-1)(-1)(-1) = 20 - 100 = -80 degrees Celsius\n\nSo, the maximum temperature in the block is 120 degrees Celsius, and the minimum temperature is -80 degrees Celsius."
