    "message_2": "To find the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0, we can first try to factor the polynomial or use a numerical method like the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.\n\nLet's try the Rational Root Theorem first. The possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients are of the form ±(p/q), where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is -1 and the leading coefficient is 3. The factors of -1 are ±1, and the factors of 3 are ±1 and ±3. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/3.\n\nNow, let's test these possible roots:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n3(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1 = 3 - 6 + 3 - 1 = -1 ≠ 0\n\n2. For x = -1:\n3(-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 1 = -3 - 6 - 3 - 1 = -13 ≠ 0\n\n3. For x = 1/3:\n3(1/3)^3 - 6(1/3)^2 + 3(1/3) - 1 = 1/9 - 2/3 + 1 - 1 = 0\n\n4. For x = -1/3:\n3(-1/3)^3 - 6(-1/3)^2 + 3(-1/3) - 1 = -1/9 - 2/3 - 1 - 1 ≠ 0\n\nSo, x = 1/3 is a rational root of the polynomial.\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(3x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 1) / (x - 1/3)\n\nUsing synthetic division or long division, we find the quotient to be:\n\n3x^2 - 3x + 1\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -3, and c = 1:\n\nx = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(3)(1))) / (2(3))\nx = (3 ± √(9 - 12)) / 6\nx = (3 ± √(-3)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the remaining roots are complex:\n\nx = (3 + i√3) / 6 and x = (3 - i√3) / 6\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 are:\n\nx = 1/3, x = (3 + i√3) / 6, and x = (3 - i√3) / 6."
