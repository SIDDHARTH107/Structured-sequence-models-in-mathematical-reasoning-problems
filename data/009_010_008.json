    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes model, we need the following inputs:\n\n1. Current stock price (S): $100\n2. Strike price (K): $110\n3. Time to maturity (T): 0.5 years (6 months)\n4. Risk-free interest rate (r): 5% or 0.05\n5. Volatility (σ): This value is not provided, so we will assume a value for it. Let's say the volatility is 20% or 0.2.\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes formula for the call option price (C):\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\n- N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n- d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\n- d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + (0.2^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.2 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.4504\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.2 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ -0.6504\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2):\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.3264\nN(d2) ≈ 0.2578\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option price (C):\n\nC = 100 * 0.3264 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * 0.2578\nC ≈ 32.64 - 110 * 0.9753 * 0.2578\nC ≈ 32.64 - 29.16\nC ≈ $3.48\n\nSo, the price of the European call option is approximately $3.48."
