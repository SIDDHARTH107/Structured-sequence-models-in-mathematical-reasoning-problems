    "message_2": "To find the damping factor and natural frequency of an RLC circuit, we first need to find the angular frequency (ω) and the damping coefficient (α).\n\nThe formula for the angular frequency (ω) in an RLC circuit is:\n\nω = 1 / √(LC)\n\nwhere L is the inductance (0.5 H) and C is the capacitance (10^-6 F).\n\nω = 1 / √(0.5 * 10^-6)\nω ≈ 1414.21 rad/s\n\nThe damping coefficient (α) is given by:\n\nα = R / (2L)\n\nwhere R is the resistance (100 ohms) and L is the inductance (0.5 H).\n\nα = 100 / (2 * 0.5)\nα = 100\n\nNow, we can find the damping factor (ζ) and the natural frequency (ω_n) using the following formulas:\n\nζ = α / (2ω)\nω_n = ω / √(1 - ζ^2)\n\nFirst, let's find the damping factor (ζ):\n\nζ = 100 / (2 * 1414.21)\nζ ≈ 0.0353\n\nNow, let's find the natural frequency (ω_n):\n\nω_n = 1414.21 / √(1 - 0.0353^2)\nω_n ≈ 1412.94 rad/s\n\nSo, the damping factor of the RLC circuit is approximately 0.0353, and the natural frequency is approximately 1412.94 rad/s."
