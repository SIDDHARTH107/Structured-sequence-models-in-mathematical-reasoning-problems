    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 1729 and 4101 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform a series of divisions with remainder until we reach a remainder of 0. Then, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide 4101 by 1729:\n4101 = 1729 * 2 + 643\n\nStep 2:\nNow, divide the previous divisor (1729) by the remainder (643):\n1729 = 643 * 2 + 443\n\nStep 3:\nDivide the previous remainder (643) by the new remainder (443):\n643 = 443 * 1 + 200\n\nStep 4:\nDivide the previous remainder (443) by the new remainder (200):\n443 = 200 * 2 + 43\n\nStep 5:\nDivide the previous remainder (200) by the new remainder (43):\n200 = 43 * 4 + 28\n\nStep 6:\nDivide the previous remainder (43) by the new remainder (28):\n43 = 28 * 1 + 15\n\nStep 7:\nDivide the previous remainder (28) by the new remainder (15):\n28 = 15 * 1 + 13\n\nStep 8:\nDivide the previous remainder (15) by the new remainder (13):\n15 = 13 * 1 + 2\n\nStep 9:\nDivide the previous remainder (13) by the new remainder (2):\n13 = 2 * 6 + 1\n\nStep 10:\nDivide the previous remainder (2) by the new remainder (1):\n2 = 1 * 2 + 0\n\nWe have reached a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder is 1, so the GCD of 1729 and 4101 is 1. This means that 1729 and 4101 are relatively prime (i.e., they have no common divisors other than 1)."
