    "message_2": "We cannot definitively determine if graph G has a Hamiltonian cycle without more information about the specific graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. \n\nHowever, we can discuss some conditions that would guarantee the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph. According to Dirac's theorem, if a connected graph G with n vertices (n â‰¥ 3) has the property that the degree of each vertex is at least n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. In our case, n = 10, so if each vertex has a degree of at least 5, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the specific graph G, we cannot determine if it has a Hamiltonian cycle. However, if the graph satisfies the conditions of Dirac's theorem, then it will have a Hamiltonian cycle."
