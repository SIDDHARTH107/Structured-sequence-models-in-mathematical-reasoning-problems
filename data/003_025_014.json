    "message_1": "A boat is traveling at a speed of 30 knots in a direction of 150 degrees. What is the magnitude and direction (in degrees) of the boat's velocity relative to the current, given that the current is flowing at a speed of 10 knots in a direction of 270 degrees? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the boat's velocity relative to the current, we need to subtract the current's velocity vector from the boat's velocity vector. First, we'll break down the boat's and current's velocities into their x and y components.\n\nBoat's velocity:\nMagnitude: 30 knots\nDirection: 150 degrees\n\nBoat's x-component (Vbx) = 30 * cos(150) = -15 knots\nBoat's y-component (Vby) = 30 * sin(150) = 25.98 knots (approximately)\n\nCurrent's velocity:\nMagnitude: 10 knots\nDirection: 270 degrees\n\nCurrent's x-component (Vcx) = 10 * cos(270) = -10 knots\nCurrent's y-component (Vcy) = 10 * sin(270) = 0 knots\n\nNow, we'll subtract the current's velocity components from the boat's velocity components to find the relative velocity components.\n\nRelative x-component (Vrx) = Vbx - Vcx = -15 - (-10) = -5 knots\nRelative y-component (Vry) = Vby - Vcy = 25.98 - 0 = 25.98 knots\n\nNow, we'll find the magnitude and direction of the relative velocity vector.\n\nMagnitude (Vr) = sqrt(Vrx^2 + Vry^2) = sqrt((-5)^2 + (25.98)^2) = sqrt(25 + 674.96) = sqrt(699.96) ≈ 26.46 knots\n\nDirection (θ) = arctan(Vry / Vrx) = arctan(25.98 / -5) = arctan(-5.196) ≈ -79.4 degrees\n\nSince the angle is negative, we'll add 360 degrees to find the direction in the standard [0, 360) range.\n\nθ = -79.4 + 360 = 280.6 degrees\n\nSo, the boat's velocity relative to the current has a magnitude of approximately 26.46 knots and a direction of 280.6 degrees."
