    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, sunny days) in n trials (days in a week)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 7 days in a week)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 3 sunny days)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6 for a sunny day)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.4 for a non-sunny day)\n\nPlugging in the values for our problem:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(7, 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^4\n\nFirst, we need to find C(7, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 sunny days out of 7 days:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!)\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * 4!)\nC(7, 3) = 5040 / (6 * 24)\nC(7, 3) = 5040 / 144\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 35 * 0.6^3 * 0.4^4\nP(X = 3) = 35 * 0.216 * 0.0256\nP(X = 3) = 35 * 0.0055296\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.193536\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 sunny days in a week is approximately 0.193536 or 19.35%."
