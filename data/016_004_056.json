    "message_2": "To determine if a complex number c is in the Julia Set of a given function, we need to iterate the function and check if the magnitude of the resulting complex number remains bounded. In this case, the function is f(z) = z^2 - 0.70176 - 0.3842i.\n\nLet's denote the maximum number of iterations as N. There isn't a fixed value for N, as it depends on the desired level of accuracy and the specific Julia Set being analyzed. However, a common choice for N is 1000 iterations, as it provides a reasonable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n\nSo, to determine if c = 0.3 + 0.4i is in the Julia Set of f(z) = z^2 - 0.70176 - 0.3842i, you can iterate the function up to 1000 times (or another chosen value for N) and check if the magnitude of the resulting complex number remains bounded. If it does, then c is likely in the Julia Set; if not, then c is not in the Julia Set."
