    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg of length 5 cm and the length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm. How long is the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given the values of a (5 cm) and c (13 cm). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\n\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 12 cm."
