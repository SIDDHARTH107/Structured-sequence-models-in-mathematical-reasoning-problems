    "message_2": "The moduli space M_n(2) refers to the space of elliptic curves with a marked 2-torsion point, where n is the level structure. In this case, n = 6. \n\nFor elliptic curves with a marked 2-torsion point, the dimension of the moduli space is 1. This is because an elliptic curve can be uniquely determined by its j-invariant, which is a single complex number. The j-invariant is a function of the coefficients of the Weierstrass equation that defines the elliptic curve, and it is invariant under isomorphism. Therefore, the moduli space M_6(2) has dimension 1."
