    "message_2": "First, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B, so A ∩ B = {} (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ B) × A. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set. Since A ∩ B is the empty set, there are no elements to form ordered pairs with elements from A. Therefore, (A ∩ B) × A = {} (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's find A × A and A × B. \n\nA × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nFinally, let's find (A × A) ∩ (A × B). As mentioned earlier, the intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common ordered pairs between A × A and A × B. Therefore, (A × A) ∩ (A × B) = {} (the empty set).\n\nSo, (A ∩ B) × A = {} and (A × A) ∩ (A × B) = {}."
