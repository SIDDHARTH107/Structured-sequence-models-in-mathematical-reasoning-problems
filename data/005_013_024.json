    "message_2": "(a) To calculate the correlation between the prices of the two products, we first need to find the mean of X (price of A) and Y (price of B), the standard deviation of X and Y, and then the covariance of X and Y.\n\nMean of X (price of A) = (15 + 14 + 17 + 16 + 13 + 18 + 14 + 19 + 15 + 12) / 10 = 153 / 10 = 15.3\nMean of Y (price of B) = (18 + 20 + 17 + 19 + 22 + 16 + 21 + 15 + 19 + 23) / 10 = 190 / 10 = 19\n\nStandard deviation of X:\n1. Calculate the squared differences between each X value and the mean of X:\n(15 - 15.3)^2 = 0.09\n(14 - 15.3)^2 = 1.69\n(17 - 15.3)^2 = 2.89\n(16 - 15.3)^2 = 0.49\n(13 - 15.3)^2 = 5.29\n(18 - 15.3)^2 = 7.29\n(14 - 15.3)^2 = 1.69\n(19 - 15.3)^2 = 13.69\n(15 - 15.3)^2 = 0.09\n(12 - 15.3)^2 = 10.89\n\n2. Calculate the mean of these squared differences:\n(0.09 + 1.69 + 2.89 + 0.49 + 5.29 + 7.29 + 1.69 + 13.69 + 0.09 + 10.89) / 10 = 43.31 / 10 = 4.331\n\n3. Take the square root of the mean of squared differences:\nsqrt(4.331) ≈ 2.08\n\nStandard deviation of Y:\n1. Calculate the squared differences between each Y value and the mean of Y:\n(18 - 19)^2 = 1\n(20 - 19)^2 = 1\n(17 - 19)^2 = 4\n(19 - 19)^2 = 0\n(22 - 19)^2 = 9\n(16 - 19)^2 = 9\n(21 - 19)^2 = 4\n(15 - 19)^2 = 16\n(19 - 19)^2 = 0\n(23 - 19)^2 = 16\n\n2. Calculate the mean of these squared differences:\n(1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 9 + 9 + 4 + 16 + 0 + 16) / 10 = 60 / 10 = 6\n\n3. Take the square root of the mean of squared differences:\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.45\n\nCovariance of X and Y:\n1. Calculate the product of the differences between each X value and the mean of X, and each Y value and the mean of Y:\n(15 - 15.3)(18 - 19) = -0.3\n(14 - 15.3)(20 - 19) = -1.3\n(17 - 15.3)(17 - 19) = 4.6\n(16 - 15.3)(19 - 19) = 0\n(13 - 15.3)(22 - 19) = 6.9\n(18 - 15.3)(16 - 19) = 9.3\n(14 - 15.3)(21 - 19) = -2.6\n(19 - 15.3)(15 - 19) = 13.8\n(15 - 15.3)(19 - 19) = 0\n(12 - 15.3)(23 - 19) = 12.9\n\n2. Calculate the mean of these products:\n(-0.3 - 1.3 + 4.6 + 0 + 6.9 + 9.3 - 2.6 + 13.8 + 0 + 12.9) / 10 = 43.3 / 10 = 4.33\n\nCovariance of X and Y = 4.33\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation between the prices of the two products:\n\nCorrelation = Covariance(X, Y) / (Standard deviation of X * Standard deviation of Y)\nCorrelation = 4.33 / (2.08 * 2.45) ≈ 0.85\n\n(b) To perform a regression analysis to predict the sales of product A based on the price of product B, we need to find the slope (b1) and the intercept (b0) of the regression line.\n\nSlope (b1) = Covariance(Y, S) / Variance(Y)\n1. Calculate the mean of S (sales of A):\nMean of S = (250 + 200 + 300 + 350 + 150 + 250 + 200 + 300 + 350 + 250) / 10 = 2600 / 10 = 260\n\n2. Calculate the covariance of Y and S:\nCovariance(Y, S) = [(18 - 19)(250 - 260) + (20 - 19)(200 - 260) + (17 - 19)(300 - 260) + (19 - 19)(350 - 260) + (22 - 19)(150 - 260) + (16 - 19)(250 - 260) + (21 - 19)(200 - 260) + (15 - 19)(300 - 260) + (19 - 19)(350 - 260) + (23 - 19)(250 - 260)] / 10\nCovariance(Y, S) = [-10 + 60 - 40 + 0 - 330 + 30 - 120 + 120 + 0 - 40] / 10 = -240 / 10 = -24\n\n3. Calculate the variance of Y:\nVariance(Y) = (Standard deviation of Y)^2 = (2.45)^2 = 6\n\n4. Calculate the slope (b1):\nb1 = Covariance(Y, S) / Variance(Y) = -24 / 6 = -4\n\nIntercept (b0) = Mean of S - b1 * Mean of Y\nb0 = 260 - (-4) * 19 = 260 + 76 = 336\n\nNow, we have the regression equation to predict the sales of product A based on the price of product B:\n\nS = 336 - 4 * Y"
