    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible for me to provide a precise numerical problem related to Deontic logic as it deals with concepts like moral obligation, permission, and prohibition rather than numerical calculations. Deontic logic is more about understanding the ethical and moral implications of certain logical statements. It is more of a theoretical and philosophical subject than a numerical one.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are referring to Deontic logic, which is not a numerical subject. If you have any other mathematical problems or questions, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with those."
