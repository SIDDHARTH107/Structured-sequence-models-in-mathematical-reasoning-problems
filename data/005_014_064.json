    "message_1": "Suppose a researcher collected data on the height, weight, and age of 100 individuals. Using an exploratory factor analysis, the researcher determined that these three variables are related to a latent factor. The researcher calculated the factor loadings as follows: height = 0.8, weight = 0.7, age = 0.5. \n\nWhat is the percentage of variance in the data explained by this latent factor?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of variance in the data explained by the latent factor, we need to calculate the communality of each variable and then find the average communality.\n\nCommunality is the proportion of variance in a given variable that is accounted for by the latent factor. It is calculated by squaring the factor loading of each variable.\n\nCommunality for height = 0.8^2 = 0.64\nCommunality for weight = 0.7^2 = 0.49\nCommunality for age = 0.5^2 = 0.25\n\nNow, we find the average communality:\n\nAverage communality = (0.64 + 0.49 + 0.25) / 3 = 1.38 / 3 â‰ˆ 0.46\n\nThe percentage of variance in the data explained by the latent factor is approximately 46%."
