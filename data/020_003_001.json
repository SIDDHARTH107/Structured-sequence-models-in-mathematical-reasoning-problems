    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from selling one unit of A is $4 and from selling one unit of B is $6. The company can produce up to 100 units of A and up to 80 units of B. The production of one unit of A requires 2 hours of time and the production of one unit of B requires 3 hours of time. The company has a total of 250 hours of production time available. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 4x + 6y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x ≤ 100 (maximum units of A)\n2. y ≤ 80 (maximum units of B)\n3. 2x + 3y ≤ 250 (total production time)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints.\n\n1. x = 100 (vertical line)\n2. y = 80 (horizontal line)\n3. 2x + 3y = 250 => y = (250 - 2x)/3 (slope-intercept form)\n\nNow, we find the intersection points of these lines:\nA. Intersection of x = 100 and y = 80: (100, 80)\nB. Intersection of x = 100 and 2x + 3y = 250: (100, (250 - 2*100)/3) = (100, 50/3)\nC. Intersection of y = 80 and 2x + 3y = 250: (2x + 3*80 = 250) => x = 35, y = 80 => (35, 80)\n\nNow we will test these intersection points in the objective function to find the maximum profit:\n\nA. Profit at (100, 80): 4(100) + 6(80) = 400 + 480 = 880\nB. Profit at (100, 50/3): 4(100) + 6(50/3) = 400 + 100 = 500\nC. Profit at (35, 80): 4(35) + 6(80) = 140 + 480 = 620\n\nThe maximum profit is $880 when the company produces 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
