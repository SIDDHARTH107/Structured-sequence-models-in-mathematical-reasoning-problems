We can find an isomorphism between them by mapping the vertices of Graph A to the vertices of Graph B in such a way that the edges are preserved.\n\nOne possible isomorphism is:\n\n1 → a\n2 → b\n3 → c\n4 → d\n\nUnder this mapping, the edges of Graph A correspond to the edges of Graph B:\n\n(1,2) → (a,b)\n(2,3) → (b,c)\n(3,1) → (c,a)\n(3,4) → (c,d)\n(4,1) → (d,a)\n\nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and edges of Graph A and Graph B, the two graphs are isomorphic."
