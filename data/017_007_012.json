    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C6 or D3, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 6 is either cyclic or not.\n2. If a group of order 6 is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to C6.\n3. If a group of order 6 is not cyclic, then it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nNow, let's check if G is cyclic or not. A group is cyclic if it has an element that generates the whole group.\n\nLet's denote the elements of G as {e, a, b, c, d, f}, where e is the identity element. Since the order of G is 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of the elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n- The order of e is 1.\n- If there is an element of order 6, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C6.\n- If there are no elements of order 6, then G is not cyclic.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are no elements of order 6 in G. In this case, the possible orders of the remaining elements are 2 and 3. \n\n- If there is an element of order 3, say a, then a^3 = e. The remaining elements of G can be written as {e, a, a^2, b, c, d}, where b, c, and d are not equal to a or a^2. Now, consider the element b. If the order of b is 3, then b^3 = e, and G would be generated by the elements a and b, which would make G a cyclic group, contradicting our assumption. Therefore, the order of b must be 2, and b^2 = e.\n- Similarly, the orders of c and d must also be 2.\n\nNow, we have a group G with elements {e, a, a^2, b, c, d}, where the orders of a, b, c, and d are 3, 2, 2, and 2, respectively. This structure is consistent with the dihedral group D3, which has elements {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}, where r has order 3 and s has order 2.\n\nTherefore, if G is not cyclic, it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, it is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3, depending on whether it has an element of order 6 or not."
