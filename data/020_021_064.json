The table below shows the time (in hours) required by each machine to produce one unit of each product.\n\n|         | Product A | Product B | Product C |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Machine 1   | 2         | 3         | 4         |\n| Machine 2   | 1         | 2         | 3         |\n| Machine 3   | 3         | 2         | 1         |\n\nThe factory has 100 hours of operating time per week. Determine how many units of each product the factory should produce to maximize total production.",
    "message_2": "To maximize total production, we should assign each machine to the product it can produce most efficiently (i.e., the one that takes the least time). \n\nMachine 1 is most efficient at producing Product A (2 hours per unit).\nMachine 2 is most efficient at producing Product A as well (1 hour per unit).\nMachine 3 is most efficient at producing Product C (1 hour per unit).\n\nNow, we need to allocate the 100 hours of operating time per week among the three machines.\n\nMachine 1: 100 hours / 2 hours per unit of Product A = 50 units of Product A\nMachine 2: 100 hours / 1 hour per unit of Product A = 100 units of Product A\nMachine 3: 100 hours / 1 hour per unit of Product C = 100 units of Product C\n\nSo, the factory should produce 150 units of Product A and 100 units of Product C to maximize total production. No units of Product B will be produced."
