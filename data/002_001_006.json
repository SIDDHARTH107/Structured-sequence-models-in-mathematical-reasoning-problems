    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8cm and a height of 5cm. What is the area of this triangle in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 × 5) / 2\nArea = 40 / 2\nArea = 20 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the triangle is 20 square centimeters."
