    "message_2": "The method of sparse matrices is not applicable to this problem, as it is used for matrices with a large number of zero elements, which is not the case here. Instead, we can solve this system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's write the given system of equations in the matrix form AX = B:\n\nA = | -3  4 -2 |\n    |  8 -7  2 |\n    |  2  3 -6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  15  |\n    | -29  |\n    |  10  |\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform matrix A into an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Add (4/3) times the first row to the second row:\n\nA = | -3  4 -2 |\n    |  0 -5  0 |\n    |  2  3 -6 |\n\nB = |  15  |\n    | -33  |\n    |  10  |\n\n2. Add (2/3) times the first row to the third row:\n\nA = | -3  4 -2 |\n    |  0 -5  0 |\n    |  0 -1 -4 |\n\nB = |  15  |\n    | -33  |\n    |   0  |\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\n1. From the third equation: -1y - 4z = 0 => y = -4z\n2. From the second equation: -5y = -33 => y = 6.6\n3. Substitute the value of y into the equation from step 1: y = -4z => 6.6 = -4z => z = -1.65\n4. From the first equation: -3x + 4y - 2z = 15 => -3x + 4(6.6) - 2(-1.65) = 15 => x = -1.45\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -1.45 (rounded to two decimal places)\ny = 6.6 (rounded to one decimal place)\nz = -1.65 (rounded to two decimal places)"
