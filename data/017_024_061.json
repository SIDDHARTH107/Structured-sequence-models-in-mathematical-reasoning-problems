    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 96 exist and how do they differ from the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find all possible group structures of order 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nn(96) = n(2^5) * n(3)\n\nFor p-groups, the number of groups of order p^n is given by the partition function P(n). In this case, we have:\n\nn(2^5) = P(5) = 7\nn(3) = P(1) = 1\n\nSo, n(96) = 7 * 1 = 7\n\nHowever, this includes both abelian and non-abelian groups. To find the number of non-abelian groups, we need to subtract the number of abelian groups of order 96. There are three abelian groups of order 96: C96, C48 × C2, and C32 × C3. Thus, there are 7 - 3 = 4 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nNow, let's compare these non-abelian groups with the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2. The cyclic group C96 is an abelian group, so it is fundamentally different from the non-abelian groups. The elements in C96 commute, meaning that for any elements a and b in C96, ab = ba. This property does not hold for non-abelian groups.\n\nThe alternating group A4 × C4 × C2 is a direct product of three groups, where A4 is the alternating group of degree 4, C4 is the cyclic group of order 4, and C2 is the cyclic group of order 2. This group has a more complex structure than the cyclic group C96, but it is still abelian since the direct product of abelian groups is abelian. Therefore, it also differs from the non-abelian groups of order 96 in that its elements commute.\n\nIn summary, there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 96, and they differ from the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2 in that they do not have the commutative property."
