    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain stock price increasing on a given day is 0.7, and the probability of it decreasing is 0.3. What is the probability that it will neither increase nor decrease, but remain the same?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, there are only two possible outcomes: the stock price increases or decreases. The sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes is 0.7 (increase) + 0.3 (decrease) = 1. Since there are no other possible outcomes, the probability that the stock price will neither increase nor decrease (remain the same) is 0."
