    "message_1": "A stock has a 50% chance of increasing in price and a 50% chance of decreasing in price. If the current price of the stock is $100, what is the probability that the price will increase to $120 within the next month?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability of the stock price increasing to $120 within the next month, we need to make some assumptions about the possible price changes. Let's assume that the stock can either increase or decrease by $20 with equal probability (50%).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The stock price increases by $20 (50% chance) and reaches $120. In this case, the target is achieved.\n\n2. The stock price decreases by $20 (50% chance) and goes down to $80. In this case, the target is not achieved.\n\nSince there are only two possible outcomes, and only one of them results in the stock price reaching $120, the probability of the stock price increasing to $120 within the next month is 50%."
