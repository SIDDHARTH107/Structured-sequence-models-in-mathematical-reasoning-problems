    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer z that satisfies the given system of equations, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given system of equations is:\n\nz ≡ x (mod 7)\nz ≡ y (mod 11)\n\nWe know that x ≡ 2 (mod 7) and y ≡ 3 (mod 11). So, we can rewrite the system of equations as:\n\nz ≡ 2 (mod 7)\nz ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n\nNow, let's apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We have two coprime moduli, 7 and 11. Their product is N = 7 * 11 = 77.\n\nNext, we compute N1 and N2, where N1 is the product of all moduli except 7, and N2 is the product of all moduli except 11. In this case, N1 = 11 and N2 = 7.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of N1 and N2. We need to find integers x1 and x2 such that:\n\nN1 * x1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nN2 * x2 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nFor N1 * x1 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we have 11 * x1 ≡ 1 (mod 7). By trying different values for x1, we find that x1 = 2 satisfies the equation, as 11 * 2 = 22 ≡ 1 (mod 7).\n\nFor N2 * x2 ≡ 1 (mod 11), we have 7 * x2 ≡ 1 (mod 11). By trying different values for x2, we find that x2 = 8 satisfies the equation, as 7 * 8 = 56 ≡ 1 (mod 11).\n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive integer z that satisfies the given system of equations:\n\nz = (2 * N1 * x1) + (3 * N2 * x2) (mod N)\n\nz = (2 * 11 * 2) + (3 * 7 * 8) (mod 77)\n\nz = 44 + 168 (mod 77)\n\nz = 212 (mod 77)\n\nz ≡ 23 (mod 77)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer z that satisfies the given system of equations is z = 23."
