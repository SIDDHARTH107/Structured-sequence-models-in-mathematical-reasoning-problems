    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The length of the curve increases with each order. The formula to calculate the length of a Hilbert curve of order n is:\n\nLength = (side length of the square) * (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nIn this case, the side length of the square is 16 cm, and the order of the Hilbert curve is 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = (16) * (4^4 - 1) / 3\nLength = (16) * (256 - 1) / 3\nLength = (16) * (255) / 3\nLength = 4080 / 3\nLength = 1360 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4 drawn on a square with a side length of 16 cm is 1360 cm."
