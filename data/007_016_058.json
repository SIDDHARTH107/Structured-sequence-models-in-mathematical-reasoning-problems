These primes are named after the French mathematician Sophie Germain.\n\nTo find all Sophie Germain primes up to 50, we will first list all prime numbers up to 50 and then check if 2p + 1 is also prime for each of them.\n\nPrime numbers up to 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47\n\nNow, let's check if 2p + 1 is prime for each of these prime numbers:\n\n2: 2(2) + 1 = 5 (prime)\n3: 2(3) + 1 = 7 (prime)\n5: 2(5) + 1 = 11 (prime)\n7: 2(7) + 1 = 15 (not prime)\n11: 2(11) + 1 = 23 (prime)\n13: 2(13) + 1 = 27 (not prime)\n17: 2(17) + 1 = 35 (not prime)\n19: 2(19) + 1 = 39 (not prime)\n23: 2(23) + 1 = 47 (prime)\n29: 2(29) + 1 = 59 (not within the range of 50)\n31: 2(31) + 1 = 63 (not prime)\n37: 2(37) + 1 = 75 (not prime)\n41: 2(41) + 1 = 83 (not within the range of 50)\n43: 2(43) + 1 = 87 (not prime)\n47: 2(47) + 1 = 95 (not prime)\n\nSo, the Sophie Germain primes up to 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 11, and 23."
