    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set is a subset of A. \n\nTo prove this using set theory, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of A. By definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. \n\nFormally, a set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nB ⊆ A if and only if ∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A)\n\nNow, let B be the empty set (∅). We want to show that ∅ ⊆ A. According to the definition above, we need to show that:\n\n∀x (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A)\n\nSince there are no elements in the empty set, the statement \"x ∈ ∅\" is always false. In logic, a statement of the form \"False → P\" is always true, regardless of the truth value of P. Therefore, the statement \"x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A\" is always true, and we have:\n\n∀x (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A)\n\nThis proves that the empty set is a subset of A, regardless of the number of elements in A."
