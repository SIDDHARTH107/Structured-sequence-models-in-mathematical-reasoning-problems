    "message_2": "Let's denote the two points of intersection as A and B. Since there are two colors (black and white) to choose from, we can assign a color to each point in the following ways:\n\n1. A is black, B is black\n2. A is black, B is white\n3. A is white, B is black\n4. A is white, B is white\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that no two adjacent points have the same color. In this case, since A and B are the only points of intersection and are adjacent, they must have different colors. This eliminates options 1 and 4, where A and B have the same color.\n\nThus, there are 2 valid ways to assign colors to the points of intersection:\n\n1. A is black, B is white\n2. A is white, B is black"
