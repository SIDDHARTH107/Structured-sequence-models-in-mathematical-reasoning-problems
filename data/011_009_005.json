    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Bell numbers. Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set into any number of subsets. In this case, we have 4 distinct objects, and we want to find the number of ways to arrange them in a line, allowing any number of objects to appear in each arrangement.\n\nThe 4th Bell number, B(4), can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = sum of S(n, k) for k = 1 to n, where S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind, S(n, k), represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nFor n = 4, we have:\n\nB(4) = S(4, 1) + S(4, 2) + S(4, 3) + S(4, 4)\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind, we get:\n\nB(4) = 1 + 7 + 6 + 1 = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 different arrangements possible when arranging 4 distinct objects in a line, allowing any number of objects to appear in each arrangement."
