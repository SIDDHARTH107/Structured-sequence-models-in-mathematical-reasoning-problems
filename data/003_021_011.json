    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors v and w, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nv · w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, v · w is the dot product of v and w, and ||v|| and ||w|| are the magnitudes of v and w, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v and w:\n\nv · w = (3)(-2) + (4)(7) = -6 + 28 = 22\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of v and w:\n\n||v|| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||w|| = √((-2)² + 7²) = √(4 + 49) = √53\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n22 = (5)(√53) cos(θ)\n\nTo find the cosine of the angle, divide both sides by (5)(√53):\n\ncos(θ) = 22 / (5√53)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(22 / (5√53))\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, multiply by (180/π):\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 * (180/π) ≈ 52.7 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between vectors v and w is approximately 52.7 degrees."
