They have gathered information on three variables: the applicant's high school GPA, their SAT score, and whether they were admitted or not. Using discriminant analysis, the university finds that the following equations can be used to predict whether an applicant will be admitted or not, based on their GPA and SAT score:\n\nAdmitted = 0.2 GPA + 0.3 SAT - 5.5\nRejected = 0.1 GPA + 0.25 SAT - 4.5\n\nIf a new applicant has a high school GPA of 3.7 and an SAT score of 1200, what is the probability that they will be admitted to the university?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of being admitted, we first need to calculate the scores for both Admitted and Rejected equations using the given GPA and SAT score.\n\nAdmitted score = 0.2 * 3.7 + 0.3 * 1200 - 5.5\nAdmitted score = 0.74 + 360 - 5.5\nAdmitted score = 355.24\n\nRejected score = 0.1 * 3.7 + 0.25 * 1200 - 4.5\nRejected score = 0.37 + 300 - 4.5\nRejected score = 295.87\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probabilities using the softmax function:\n\nP(Admitted) = exp(Admitted score) / (exp(Admitted score) + exp(Rejected score))\nP(Rejected) = exp(Rejected score) / (exp(Admitted score) + exp(Rejected score))\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities:\n\nexp(355.24) ≈ 1.95 * 10^154\nexp(295.87) ≈ 3.45 * 10^128\n\nP(Admitted) = (1.95 * 10^154) / ((1.95 * 10^154) + (3.45 * 10^128))\nP(Admitted) ≈ 1 / (1 + (3.45 * 10^128) / (1.95 * 10^154))\nP(Admitted) ≈ 1 / (1 + 1.77 * 10^(-26))\nP(Admitted) ≈ 1\n\nThe probability of being admitted is approximately 1, or 100%. This means that, based on the discriminant analysis, the applicant is very likely to be admitted to the university."
