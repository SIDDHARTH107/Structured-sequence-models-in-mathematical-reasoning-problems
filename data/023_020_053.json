    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = |sin(x)| on the interval (0, 2π), we first need to determine if the function is even or odd. Since |sin(x)| is an even function, we will only need to find the Fourier cosine series.\n\nThe Fourier cosine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0)/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, defined as:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[|sin(x)| * 1]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nSince |sin(x)| = sin(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ π and |sin(x)| = -sin(x) for π ≤ x ≤ 2π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫sin(x)dx from 0 to π + ∫(-sin(x))dx from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [-cos(x)| from 0 to π + cos(x)| from π to 2π] = (1/π) * [2]\n\na_0 = 2/π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[|sin(x)| * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫sin(x) * cos(n * x)dx from 0 to π + ∫(-sin(x)) * cos(n * x)dx from π to 2π]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use the product-to-sum identity:\n\nsin(A) * cos(B) = (1/2) * [sin(A - B) - sin(A + B)]\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(1/2) * [sin((1-n) * x) - sin((1+n) * x)]dx from 0 to π + ∫(1/2) * [-sin((1-n) * x) + sin((1+n) * x)]dx from π to 2π]\n\nNow, integrate and evaluate:\n\na_n = (1/2π) * {[(1/(1-n)) * cos((1-n) * x) - (1/(1+n)) * cos((1+n) * x)]| from 0 to π + [-(1/(1-n)) * cos((1-n) * x) + (1/(1+n)) * cos((1+n) * x)]| from π to 2π}\n\nFor n = 1, 3, 5, ..., the terms with (1-n) become zero, and we get:\n\na_n = (1/2π) * {[-(1/(1+n)) * cos((1+n) * x)]| from 0 to π + [(1/(1+n)) * cos((1+n) * x)]| from π to 2π}\n\na_n = (1/2π) * [-2/(1+n)]\n\na_n = -1/[(π * (1+n))]\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = |sin(x)| on the interval (0, 2π) is:\n\nf(x) = (2/π)/2 - Σ[1/[(π * (1+n))] * cos(n * x)] for n = 1, 3, 5, ..."
