    "message_1": "In a community, there are 50 families. 20 families have at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday. If two families are chosen at random, what is the probability that both of them have at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both families have at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nIn this case, A represents the first family having at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday, and B represents the second family having at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday, given that the first family does.\n\nFirst, we find the probability of the first family having at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday:\n\nP(A) = number of families with at least one member attending a religious service / total number of families\nP(A) = 20/50\n\nNext, we find the probability of the second family having at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday, given that the first family does:\n\nSince one family has already been chosen, there are now 49 families left to choose from. And since the first family has at least one member who attends a religious service, there are now 19 families left with at least one member attending a religious service.\n\nP(B|A) = number of families with at least one member attending a religious service (after the first family is chosen) / total number of families left\nP(B|A) = 19/49\n\nNow we can find the probability of both families having at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\nP(A and B) = (20/50) * (19/49)\n\nP(A and B) â‰ˆ 0.1551020408\n\nSo the probability that both families have at least one member who attends a religious service on Sunday is approximately 15.51%."
