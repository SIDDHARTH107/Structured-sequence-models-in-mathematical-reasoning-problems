    "message_1": "A quilter wishes to create a quilt using 9 different fabric squares. She wants to arrange the squares in 3 rows of 3 so that no two rows or no two columns have the same combination of fabrics. How many different combinations can the quilter make?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the arrangement of the fabric squares in the first row. There are 9 choices for the first square, 8 choices for the second square, and 7 choices for the third square. So, there are 9 * 8 * 7 = 504 ways to arrange the fabric squares in the first row.\n\nNow, let's consider the second row. Since no two rows can have the same combination of fabrics, we have 6 choices for the first square in the second row (it cannot be any of the 3 fabrics used in the first row). Similarly, we have 5 choices for the second square and 4 choices for the third square in the second row. So, there are 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 ways to arrange the fabric squares in the second row.\n\nFinally, let's consider the third row. Since no two rows can have the same combination of fabrics, and no two columns can have the same combination of fabrics, the third row is uniquely determined by the arrangement of the first two rows. There are 3 remaining fabrics that haven't been used yet, and they must be placed in the third row in such a way that they don't repeat the fabrics in the same column. There are 2 ways to arrange the remaining 3 fabrics in the third row to satisfy this condition.\n\nSo, the total number of different combinations the quilter can make is 504 (first row) * 120 (second row) * 2 (third row) = 120,960."
