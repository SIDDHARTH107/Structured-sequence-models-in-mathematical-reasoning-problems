    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology group IH^2(X) of the projective variety X defined by the equation x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0 in P^2, we can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth projective variety Y of dimension n and a hyperplane section X = Y ∩ H, the restriction map H^k(Y) → H^k(X) is an isomorphism for k < n and injective for k = n.\n\nIn our case, X is a quartic curve in P^2, so it has dimension 1. The ambient space P^2 has dimension 2. Since X is a hyperplane section of P^2, we can apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to compute the cohomology groups of X.\n\nBy the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the restriction map H^k(P^2) → H^k(X) is an isomorphism for k < 2 and injective for k = 2. We know that H^0(P^2) = Z, H^1(P^2) = 0, and H^2(P^2) = Z. Thus, H^0(X) = Z, H^1(X) = 0, and H^2(X) = Z.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection cohomology group IH^2(X). The intersection cohomology group is defined as the cohomology group of the intersection complex, which is a complex of sheaves on X. In our case, the intersection complex is just the constant sheaf Z on X, so IH^2(X) = H^2(X) = Z.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^2(X) of X is 1."
