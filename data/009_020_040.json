    "message_1": "A car traveling at 60 mph is approaching a red light that is 300 meters ahead. The driver applies the brakes, causing the car to decelerate at a constant rate of 4 meters per second squared. Find the time it takes for the car to come to a complete stop at the red light.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the car's initial speed from mph to meters per second (m/s).\n\n1 mile = 1609.34 meters\n1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n60 mph = 60 * (1609.34 m / 3600 s) = 26.8224 m/s\n\nNow we have the initial speed (v0) and the deceleration (a) of the car. We also know the distance (s) the car needs to travel before stopping, which is 300 meters. We can use the following equation to find the time (t) it takes for the car to come to a complete stop:\n\nv^2 = v0^2 + 2as\n\nWhere:\nv = final speed (0 m/s, since the car comes to a complete stop)\nv0 = initial speed (26.8224 m/s)\na = deceleration (-4 m/s^2, since it's decelerating)\ns = distance (300 meters)\n\n0 = (26.8224)^2 + 2(-4)(300)\n\nSolving for t:\n\n(26.8224)^2 = 2(4)(300)\n719.1041 = 2400\nt^2 = 719.1041 / 2400\nt^2 = 0.299627\nt = sqrt(0.299627)\nt ≈ 0.5474 hours\n\nTo convert the time to seconds, we multiply by 3600:\n\n0.5474 hours * 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 1970.64 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 1971 seconds for the car to come to a complete stop at the red light."
