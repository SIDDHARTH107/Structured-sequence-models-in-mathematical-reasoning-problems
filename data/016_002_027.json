    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the number of sides of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 4th iteration.\n\n1st iteration:\nNumber of sides: 3 * 4^0 = 3\nSide length: 6 * (1/3)^0 = 6\nPerimeter: 3 * 6 = 18 cm\n\n2nd iteration:\nNumber of sides: 3 * 4^1 = 12\nSide length: 6 * (1/3)^1 = 2\nPerimeter: 12 * 2 = 24 cm\n\n3rd iteration:\nNumber of sides: 3 * 4^2 = 48\nSide length: 6 * (1/3)^2 = 2/3\nPerimeter: 48 * (2/3) = 32 cm\n\n4th iteration:\nNumber of sides: 3 * 4^3 = 192\nSide length: 6 * (1/3)^3 = 2/9\nPerimeter: 192 * (2/9) = 64/3 cm â‰ˆ 21.33 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 4th iteration is approximately 21.33 cm."
