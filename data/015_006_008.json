    "message_1": "Consider the Hénon map defined by the recursive formula:\n```\nx[n+1] = 1 - a*x[n]^2 + y[n]\ny[n+1] = b*x[n]\n```\nwhere `a = 1.4` and `b = 0.3`. Also, let the initial values of `x[0]` and `y[0]` be `x[0] = 0` and `y[0] = 0`.\n\nIf we iterate this map `n` times and plot the resulting `x[n]` values, what is the value of `n` needed to clearly see the strange attractor associated with this map?\n\nNote: A strange attractor is a subset of the state space of a dynamical system that is invariant under the dynamics and has a fractal structure.",
    "message_2": "To clearly see the strange attractor associated with the Hénon map, we need to iterate the map a sufficient number of times to allow the fractal structure to emerge. There isn't a specific value of `n` that will suddenly reveal the strange attractor, as it becomes more apparent with increasing iterations. However, a common choice for observing the strange attractor is to iterate the map around 10,000 to 20,000 times.\n\nKeep in mind that the strange attractor will become more detailed and intricate with more iterations, but the overall structure should be visible after around 10,000 to 20,000 iterations."
