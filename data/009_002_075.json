    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nA new infectious disease has started spreading in a small town. It is estimated that the rate at which the disease spreads is proportional to the number of infected individuals present in the town at any given time. If the initial number of infected individuals is 10, and the rate of spread is such that the number of infected individuals doubles every 4 days, how many individuals will be infected after 12 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere N(t) is the number of infected individuals after t days, N0 is the initial number of infected individuals, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in days.\n\nFirst, we need to find the growth rate r. We know that the number of infected individuals doubles every 4 days, so:\n\nN(4) = N0 * (1 + r)^4\n\nWe are given that N0 = 10 and N(4) = 2 * N0 = 20. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n20 = 10 * (1 + r)^4\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n2 = (1 + r)^4\n\nNow, take the fourth root of both sides:\n\n2^(1/4) = 1 + r\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides to find r:\n\nr = 2^(1/4) - 1 ≈ 0.1892\n\nNow that we have the growth rate, we can find the number of infected individuals after 12 days:\n\nN(12) = N0 * (1 + r)^12\n\nN(12) = 10 * (1 + 0.1892)^12\n\nN(12) ≈ 10 * (1.1892)^12\n\nN(12) ≈ 10 * 3.9968\n\nN(12) ≈ 39.968\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an infected individual, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nN(12) ≈ 40\n\nSo, after 12 days, approximately 40 individuals will be infected."
