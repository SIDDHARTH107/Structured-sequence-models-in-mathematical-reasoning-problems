    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function (x^2 + 2x - 1) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can try to simplify the function first. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)\n\nNow the function looks like this:\n\n((x + 1)(x - 1)) / (x - 1)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 1) terms:\n\n(x + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x -> 1) (x + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the limit of the function (x^2 + 2x - 1) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1 is 2."
