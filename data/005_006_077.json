    "message_2": "According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we have a sample of 36 apples with a mean weight of 4.5 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.3 ounces. We want to find the probability that the average weight of another sample of 36 apples will be less than 4.3 ounces.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error of the mean (SEM), which is the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nSEM = σ / √n\nSEM = 0.3 / √36\nSEM = 0.3 / 6\nSEM = 0.05\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score, which represents the number of standard errors a particular value is from the mean:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SEM\nz = (4.3 - 4.5) / 0.05\nz = -0.2 / 0.05\nz = -4\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to this z-score. You can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the probability. The probability of a z-score of -4 is approximately 0.00003.\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of another sample of 36 apples will be less than 4.3 ounces is approximately 0.00003 or 0.003%."
