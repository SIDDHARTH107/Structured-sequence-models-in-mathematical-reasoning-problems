Moreover, assume that $f:M\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is a Morse function such that all critical points have different Morse indices. If $M$ has $k$ critical points, then prove that the number of critical points of index $i$ is less than or equal to the $i$-th Betti number of $M$ for all $i\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots,k\\}$. \n\nNow, for a specific case, let $M$ be the torus obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a rectangle of dimensions $2a\\times 2b$ with $a>b>0$. Using Morse theory, find the number of critical points of each index for the function $f(x,y)=\\cos(x/a)+\\cos(y/b)$ on $M$.",
    "message_2": "We will first prove the general statement about the number of critical points of index $i$ being less than or equal to the $i$-th Betti number of $M$.\n\nLet $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function on $M$ with $k$ critical points, and let $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{k-1}$ be the critical points of $f$ with Morse indices $i_0, i_1, \\dots, i_{k-1}$, respectively. We will use the Morse inequalities, which state that for any $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$,\n\n$$b_i(M) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\delta_{i, i_j},$$\n\nwhere $b_i(M)$ is the $i$-th Betti number of $M$, and $\\delta_{i, i_j}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to 1 if $i = i_j$ and 0 otherwise. The sum on the right-hand side of the inequality counts the number of critical points of index $i$. Thus, the Morse inequalities imply that the number of critical points of index $i$ is less than or equal to the $i$-th Betti number of $M$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case of the torus $M$ obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a rectangle of dimensions $2a \\times 2b$ with $a > b > 0$. We are given the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x/a) + \\cos(y/b)$ on $M$. To find the critical points of $f$, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{a}\\sin(x/a) = 0,$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{b}\\sin(y/b) = 0.$$\n\nThe solutions to these equations are given by $x = n\\pi a$ and $y = m\\pi b$ for integers $n$ and $m$. Since $M$ is a torus, we only need to consider the solutions in the fundamental domain $0 \\leq x \\leq 2a$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 2b$. There are four such solutions: $(0, 0)$, $(0, 2b)$, $(2a, 0)$, and $(2a, 2b)$.\n\nTo determine the Morse indices of these critical points, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$:\n\n$$H_f(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{a^2}\\cos(x/a) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{b^2}\\cos(y/b) \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nThe Morse index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. Since the Hessian matrix is diagonal, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries. We have the following:\n\n1. At $(0, 0)$ and $(2a, 2b)$, the Hessian matrix has eigenvalues $\\frac{1}{a^2}$ and $\\frac{1}{b^2}$, both of which are positive. Thus, the Morse indices of these critical points are 0.\n\n2. At $(0, 2b)$ and $(2a, 0)$, the Hessian matrix has eigenvalues $\\frac{1}{a^2}$ and $-\\frac{1}{b^2}$, one of which is positive and the other is negative. Thus, the Morse indices of these critical points are 1.\n\nIn summary, we have found that the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x/a) + \\cos(y/b)$ on the torus $M$ has two critical points of index 0 and two critical points of index 1."
