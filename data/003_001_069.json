    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the hypotenuse has a length of 10, and one of the legs (adjacent) has a length of 6. We can represent this as:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSince we know the length of the hypotenuse (c) and one of the legs (a), we can plug in those values and solve for the length of the opposite leg (b):\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the length of the opposite leg (b):\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the opposite leg is 8."
