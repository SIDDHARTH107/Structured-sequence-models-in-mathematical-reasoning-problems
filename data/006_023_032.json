    "message_1": "The probability of a customer buying two products from a store is 0.25. If a store has 10 customers, what is the probability that at least 2 customers will buy two products each?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (customers buying two products), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.25 in this case), and n is the number of trials (10 customers).\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 2 customers will buy two products each, which means we need to find the probability of 2 or more successes. To do this, we can find the probability of 0 and 1 success and subtract their sum from 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 successes (no customers buying two products):\n\nP(X = 0) = C(10, 0) * (0.25)^0 * (1-0.25)^(10-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.75)^10\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.0563\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 success (1 customer buying two products):\n\nP(X = 1) = C(10, 1) * (0.25)^1 * (1-0.25)^(10-1)\nP(X = 1) = 10 * 0.25 * (0.75)^9\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.2816\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 successes by subtracting the probabilities of 0 and 1 success from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.0563 - 0.2816\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.6621\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 customers will buy two products each is approximately 0.6621 or 66.21%."
