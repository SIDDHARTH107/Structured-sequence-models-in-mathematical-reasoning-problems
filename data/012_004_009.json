The cost of laying a cable between each office is given in the following table:\n\n|Office A|Office B|Office C|Office D|Office E|Office F|Office G|Office H|Office I|\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|0|4|0|0|0|0|0|8|0|\n|4|0|8|0|0|0|0|11|0|\n|0|8|0|7|0|4|0|0|2|\n|0|0|7|0|9|14|0|0|0|\n|0|0|0|9|0|10|0|0|0|\n|0|0|4|14|10|0|2|0|0|\n|0|0|0|0|0|2|0|1|6|\n|8|11|0|0|0|0|1|0|7|\n|0|0|2|0|0|0|6|7|0|\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of laying cables to connect all 9 offices, and what is the route for the minimum spanning tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of laying cables to connect all 9 offices, we can use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. First, we list all the edges with their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. Office G - Office H (1)\n2. Office C - Office I (2)\n3. Office F - Office G (2)\n4. Office A - Office B (4)\n5. Office C - Office F (4)\n6. Office D - Office C (7)\n7. Office E - Office D (9)\n8. Office F - Office E (10)\n9. Office D - Office F (14)\n10. Office H - Office I (7)\n11. Office B - Office C (8)\n12. Office A - Office H (8)\n13. Office G - Office I (6)\n14. Office B - Office H (11)\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding an edge does not form a cycle.\n\n1. Add Office G - Office H (1)\n2. Add Office C - Office I (2)\n3. Add Office F - Office G (2)\n4. Add Office A - Office B (4)\n5. Add Office C - Office F (4)\n6. Add Office D - Office C (7)\n7. Add Office E - Office D (9)\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete, and the total cost of laying cables is 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 29.\n\nThe route for the minimum spanning tree is:\n\n1. Office G - Office H\n2. Office C - Office I\n3. Office F - Office G\n4. Office A - Office B\n5. Office C - Office F\n6. Office D - Office C\n7. Office E - Office D"
