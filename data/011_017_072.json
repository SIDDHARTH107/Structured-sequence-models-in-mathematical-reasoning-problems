    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 4x4 Latin square, which is a 4x4 grid in which each row and each column contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once. How many different Latin squares are there?",
    "message_2": "To count the number of different 4x4 Latin squares, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Fill in the first row with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in any order. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to do this, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3 possible numbers for the first column, 2 possible numbers for the second column, and 1 possible number for the third column (the fourth column is determined by the other three). So, there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to fill in the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible numbers for the first column and 1 possible number for the second column (the third and fourth columns are determined by the first two). So, there are 2 × 1 = 2 ways to fill in the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the first three rows, so there is only 1 way to fill it in.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each row to get the total number of different 4x4 Latin squares:\n\n24 (first row) × 6 (second row) × 2 (third row) × 1 (fourth row) = 288\n\nSo, there are 288 different 4x4 Latin squares."
