    "message_1": "Consider a double pendulum system with massless rods of length L1 = 2m and L2 = 1.5m. The mass of the first pendulum is m1 = 1kg and the mass of the second pendulum is m2 = 2kg. The initial angles of the first and second pendulums from vertical are θ1 = 10° and θ2 = 15° respectively. Determine the period of oscillation of the second pendulum if the initial velocities of the two masses are zero. (Assume the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/s²)",
    "message_2": "The period of oscillation for a double pendulum system cannot be determined using a simple formula, as it is a highly nonlinear system. However, we can approximate the period of oscillation for small angles using the small angle approximation, which assumes that sin(θ) ≈ θ for small angles.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum can be derived using the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian L is given by the difference between the kinetic energy T and the potential energy V of the system:\n\nL = T - V\n\nThe kinetic and potential energies for the double pendulum system are:\n\nT = (1/2) * m1 * (L1 * dθ1/dt)^2 + (1/2) * m2 * ((L1 * dθ1/dt)^2 + (L2 * dθ2/dt)^2 + 2 * L1 * L2 * dθ1/dt * dθ2/dt * cos(θ1 - θ2))\n\nV = m1 * g * L1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + m2 * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2)))\n\nNow, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the equations of motion:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dθ1/dt)) - ∂L/∂θ1 = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dθ2/dt)) - ∂L/∂θ2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations for small angles (θ1 and θ2) and initial velocities (dθ1/dt and dθ2/dt) equal to zero, we can approximate the period of oscillation for the second pendulum.\n\nHowever, this process is quite involved and requires numerical methods to solve the resulting differential equations. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an exact answer for the period of oscillation of the second pendulum in this format.\n\nA more practical approach would be to use a numerical simulation software or write a program to solve the equations of motion for the given initial conditions and calculate the period of oscillation."
