    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to know the universal set (U) that A is a subset of. The complement of A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in U that are not in A. Since the universal set is not provided, we cannot find the exact complement of A.\n\nHowever, we can still calculate the intersection of A and its complement, A' (once we know what the universal set is). By definition, the intersection of a set and its complement contains all elements that are both in the set and its complement. Since the complement of a set contains all elements that are not in the set, there are no elements that can be in both A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅"
