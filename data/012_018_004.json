    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate connected components.\n\nA connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges. Therefore, a connected graph with 10 vertices has at least 9 edges. If we want to create two connected components, we can think of it as splitting the 10 vertices into two smaller connected graphs, say with n1 and n2 vertices (n1 + n2 = 10).\n\nLet's consider the case where we split the graph into two connected components with the minimum number of vertices in one of them, i.e., n1 = 1 and n2 = 9. In this case, the connected component with 9 vertices will have at least 8 edges (since a connected graph with 9 vertices has at least 9-1 = 8 edges).\n\nNow, to disconnect the graph, we need to remove the edges that connect the vertex in the connected component with 1 vertex to the connected component with 9 vertices. Since the original graph has 15 edges, and the connected component with 9 vertices has at least 8 edges, there must be at least 15 - 8 = 7 edges connecting the vertex in the connected component with 1 vertex to the connected component with 9 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 7."
