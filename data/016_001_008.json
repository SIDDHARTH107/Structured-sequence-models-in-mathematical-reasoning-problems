    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, it is constructed by recursively dividing an equilateral triangle into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles, removing the central triangle, and repeating the process for the remaining three triangles. In this case, N = 3 (three self-similar pieces) and the scaling factor s = 2 (each side of the smaller triangles is half the length of the original triangle's side).\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nSo, the exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.5849625."
