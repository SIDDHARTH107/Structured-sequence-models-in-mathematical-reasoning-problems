    "message_2": "The given trigonometric function is y = 3 sin(2x - π/6). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the argument of the sine function, which is (2x - π/6).\n\nThe general form of a sine function is y = A sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift. In our case, A = 3, B = 2, and C = π/6.\n\nThe phase shift is given by C/B. So, in our case, the phase shift is (π/6) / 2.\n\nPhase shift = (π/6) / 2 = π/12.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the function y = 3 sin(2x - π/6) is π/12."
