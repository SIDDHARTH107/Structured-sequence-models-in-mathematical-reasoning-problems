    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 |\n    | 3  6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 5 |\n    | 15 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (1 * 6) - (2 * 3) = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the inverse of matrix A does not exist. This means that we cannot use the method of inverse matrices to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (3x + 6y = 3(x + 2y)). This means that the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and they can be represented as:\n\nx = 5 - 2y, where y can be any real number."
