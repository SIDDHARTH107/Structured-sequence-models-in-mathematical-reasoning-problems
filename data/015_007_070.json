    "message_1": "A train has a period of 10 minutes between its arrivals at a platform. Due to some disturbance in the track, the period starts doubling after each arrival. How long will it take for the period to reach 2 hours?",
    "message_2": "Let's find out how many times the period needs to double to reach 2 hours.\n\nFirst, convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\n\nNow, let's use the formula for geometric progression:\n\nfinal_period = initial_period * 2^n\n\nwhere final_period is the period we want to reach (120 minutes), initial_period is the starting period (10 minutes), and n is the number of times the period needs to double.\n\n120 = 10 * 2^n\n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog2(120) = log2(10 * 2^n)\nlog2(120) = log2(10) + log2(2^n)\nlog2(120) = log2(10) + n\n\nNow, we can solve for n:\n\nn = log2(120) - log2(10)\nn ≈ 3.585 - 3.322\nn ≈ 0.263\n\nSince n must be a whole number (we can't double the period a fraction of a time), we need to round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nn = 1\n\nSo, the period needs to double 1 time to reach 2 hours. Since the period doubles after each arrival, it will take 1 arrival for the period to reach 2 hours. The total time will be the sum of the periods:\n\n10 minutes (initial period) + 20 minutes (doubled period) = 30 minutes\n\nIt will take 30 minutes for the period to reach 2 hours."
