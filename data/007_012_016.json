    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer n greater than 1 that satisfies the equation (n-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod n), we can test values of n starting from 2.\n\nFor n = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Therefore, the smallest positive integer n greater than 1 that satisfies the equation is n = 2."
