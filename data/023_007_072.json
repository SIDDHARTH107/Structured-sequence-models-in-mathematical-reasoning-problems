    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of the signal and its corresponding coefficients, we will use the Fourier series representation for a periodic function. Since the given function is already expressed as a sum of sines and cosines, we can directly identify the frequency components and their corresponding coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a periodic function with period 2π is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nComparing this with the given function f(x) = cos(x) + sin(2x) + cos(3x) + sin(4x), we can directly identify the frequency components and their corresponding coefficients:\n\na_0 = 0 (no constant term)\na_1 = 1 (coefficient of cos(x))\nb_1 = 0 (no sin(x) term)\na_2 = 0 (no cos(2x) term)\nb_2 = 1 (coefficient of sin(2x))\na_3 = 1 (coefficient of cos(3x))\nb_3 = 0 (no sin(3x) term)\na_4 = 0 (no cos(4x) term)\nb_4 = 1 (coefficient of sin(4x))\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal is:\n\n1 Hz (cosine component with coefficient a_1 = 1)\n2 Hz (sine component with coefficient b_2 = 1)\n3 Hz (cosine component with coefficient a_3 = 1)\n4 Hz (sine component with coefficient b_4 = 1)\n\nAnd the corresponding coefficients are:\n\na_0 = 0\na_1 = 1\nb_1 = 0\na_2 = 0\nb_2 = 1\na_3 = 1\nb_3 = 0\na_4 = 0\nb_4 = 1"
