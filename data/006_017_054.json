    "message_2": "To find the probability of a rear-end collision occurring during rush hour, we can use the historical data provided. There have been 10 rear-end collisions out of 100 accidents during rush hour in the past year.\n\nProbability = (Number of rear-end collisions) / (Total number of accidents)\nProbability = 10 / 100\n\nThe probability of a rear-end collision occurring during rush hour is 10/100, which can be simplified to 1/10 or 0.1. So, there is a 10% chance of a rear-end collision occurring during rush hour on that particular road."
