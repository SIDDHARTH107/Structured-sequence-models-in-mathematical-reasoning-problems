    "message_2": "To calculate the sectional curvature of the surface f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 4 at the point (1, 1), we first need to find the first and second partial derivatives of the function.\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\nfx(x, y) = ∂f/∂x = 2x\nfy(x, y) = ∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\nfxx(x, y) = ∂²f/∂x² = 2\nfyy(x, y) = ∂²f/∂y² = 2\nfxy(x, y) = ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the normal vector N at the point (1, 1). The normal vector is given by the gradient of the function, which is the vector (fx, fy, -1):\n\nN(1, 1) = (2, 2, -1)\n\nNext, we need to find the Gaussian curvature K. The Gaussian curvature is given by the following formula:\n\nK = (fxx * fyy - fxy^2) / (1 + fx^2 + fy^2)^2\n\nAt the point (1, 1), we have:\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0^2) / (1 + 2^2 + 2^2)^2\nK = 4 / (1 + 4 + 4)^2\nK = 4 / 81\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 4 at the point (1, 1) is 4/81."
