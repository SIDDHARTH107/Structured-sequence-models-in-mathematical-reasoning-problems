    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = 1/(z^2 - 1) centered at z=0, we can first rewrite the function using partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = 1/(z^2 - 1) = 1/[(z - 1)(z + 1)]\n\nNow, we can rewrite f(z) as the sum of two simpler functions:\n\nf(z) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z + 1)\n\nTo find A and B, we can clear the denominators:\n\n1 = A(z + 1) + B(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by setting z = 1 and z = -1:\n\nFor z = 1: 1 = 2A => A = 1/2\nFor z = -1: 1 = -2B => B = -1/2\n\nSo, f(z) = (1/2)/(z - 1) - (1/2)/(z + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n(1/2)/(z - 1) = (1/2) * (1/(1 - (-z))) = (1/2) * Σ((-z)^n) for |z| < 1\n- (1/2)/(z + 1) = (-1/2) * (1/(1 + z)) = (-1/2) * Σ((-1)^n * z^n) for |z| < 1\n\nCombining the two series, we get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = Σ((1/2)(-z)^n) - Σ((-1/2)(-1)^n * z^n) for |z| < 1\n\nNow, let's determine the type of singularity at z=1 and z=-1.\n\nAt z=1, we have a simple pole, because the function can be written as (1/2)/(z - 1) - (1/2)/(z + 1), and the term (1/2)/(z - 1) has a simple pole at z=1.\n\nAt z=-1, we also have a simple pole, because the function can be written as (1/2)/(z - 1) - (1/2)/(z + 1), and the term -(1/2)/(z + 1) has a simple pole at z=-1."
