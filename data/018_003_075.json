    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}. What is the union of sets A and B? Is the union a superset of set A? Is the union a superset of set B? Prove your answers.",
    "message_2": "The union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, let's determine if the union is a superset of set A and set B. A set C is considered a superset of set A if every element of set A is also an element of set C. Similarly, set C is a superset of set B if every element of set B is also an element of set C.\n\nFor set A, we can see that every element in set A (1, 2, and 3) is also present in the union A ∪ B. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nFor set B, we can see that every element in set B (3, 4, and 5) is also present in the union A ∪ B. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nIn conclusion, the union of sets A and B is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and it is a superset of both set A and set B."
