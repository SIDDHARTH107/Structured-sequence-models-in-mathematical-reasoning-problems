    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we need to use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the surface and find the metric tensor. Let's parameterize the surface using the coordinates (x, y) as follows:\n\nr(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the metric tensor g_ij. To do this, we compute the first fundamental form:\n\ng_ij = ∂r/∂x_i · ∂r/∂x_j\n\nwhere x_i and x_j are the coordinates x and y. We have:\n\n∂r/∂x = (1, 0, 2x)\n∂r/∂y = (0, 1, 2y)\n\nNow, we can compute the metric tensor:\n\ng_11 = ∂r/∂x · ∂r/∂x = 1 + 4x^2\ng_12 = ∂r/∂x · ∂r/∂y = 4xy\ng_21 = g_12 = 4xy\ng_22 = ∂r/∂y · ∂r/∂y = 1 + 4y^2\n\nThe metric tensor g_ij is then given by:\n\ng_ij = | 1 + 4x^2   4xy    |\n       | 4xy      1 + 4y^2 |\n\nNow, we can write the Lagrangian for the geodesic:\n\nL = √(g_11(dx/dt)^2 + 2g_12(dx/dt)(dy/dt) + g_22(dy/dt)^2)\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations for x(t) and y(t) are:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nSolving these equations is quite complicated, and it is usually done using numerical methods or specialized software. However, we can notice that the given points (1, 1, 2) and (-1, -1, 2) are symmetric with respect to the origin. This suggests that the geodesic connecting these points should also be symmetric with respect to the origin. Therefore, we can guess that the geodesic is a straight line connecting the points (1, 1, 2) and (-1, -1, 2), which lies on the surface z = x^2 + y^2.\n\nTo verify this, let's parameterize the line as follows:\n\nx(t) = 1 - 2t\ny(t) = 1 - 2t\nz(t) = (1 - 2t)^2 + (1 - 2t)^2 = 4t^2 - 4t + 1\n\nNow, we can check if this line lies on the surface z = x^2 + y^2:\n\nz(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = (1 - 2t)^2 + (1 - 2t)^2 = 4t^2 - 4t + 1\n\nSince z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2, the line lies on the surface, and it is the geodesic connecting the points (1, 1, 2) and (-1, -1, 2)."
