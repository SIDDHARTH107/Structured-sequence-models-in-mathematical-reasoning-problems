    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example:\n\nA healthcare researcher is studying the survival rate of patients with a rare disease. She analyzes the data of 50 patients and finds that the probability of surviving for more than 2 years after diagnosis is 0.4. What is the probability that at least 20 patients will survive for more than 2 years if 50 new patients are diagnosed with the same disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, patients surviving more than 2 years)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of patients)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of patients surviving more than 2 years)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a patient surviving more than 2 years, which is 0.4)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 20 patients will survive for more than 2 years, which means we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 50.\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 20) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.4)^k * (0.6)^(50-k)] for k = 20 to 50\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 0.9599\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 patients will survive for more than 2 years if 50 new patients are diagnosed with the same disease is approximately 0.9599 or 95.99%."
