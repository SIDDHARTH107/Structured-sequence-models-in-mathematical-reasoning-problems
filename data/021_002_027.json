    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector using the Power Iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial approximation x(0) = [1; 1]\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current approximation x(k) to get the next approximation x(k+1)\n3. Normalize x(k+1) to get the unit vector\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the desired number of iterations\n\nLet's perform three iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx(1) = A * x(0) = [3 1; 2 2] * [1; 1] = [4; 4]\nNormalize x(1): x(1) = [1; 1] (unit vector)\n\nIteration 2:\nx(2) = A * x(1) = [3 1; 2 2] * [1; 1] = [4; 4]\nNormalize x(2): x(2) = [1; 1] (unit vector)\n\nIteration 3:\nx(3) = A * x(2) = [3 1; 2 2] * [1; 1] = [4; 4]\nNormalize x(3): x(3) = [1; 1] (unit vector)\n\nAfter three iterations, the eigenvector approximation remains the same: x(3) = [1; 1].\n\nNow, let's find the dominant eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ = (x(3)^T * A * x(3)) / (x(3)^T * x(3))\n\nλ = ([1 1] * [3 1; 2 2] * [1; 1]) / ([1 1] * [1; 1])\n\nλ = ([4 4] * [1; 1]) / (2)\n\nλ = 8 / 2\n\nλ = 4\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is λ = 4, and the corresponding eigenvector is x(3) = [1; 1]."
