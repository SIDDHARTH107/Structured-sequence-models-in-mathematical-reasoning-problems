    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Block ciphers in Cryptography:\n\nSuppose we have a 16-bit block cipher with a key size of 8 bits. If we use the cipher to encrypt a message consisting of 3 blocks, each containing 16 bits of data, how many possible keys are there?",
    "message_2": "Since the key size is 8 bits, there are 2^8 possible keys. \n\n2^8 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 possible keys for this 16-bit block cipher with an 8-bit key size."
