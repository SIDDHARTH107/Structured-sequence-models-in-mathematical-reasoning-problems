    "message_1": "A store sells a product at a fixed cost of $50 per unit. If the demand for the product is 100 units per week, the store can purchase it for $30 per unit. However, if the demand exceeds 100 units, the store has to purchase it for $40 per unit. Determine the optimal pricing of the product to maximize the store's profit if the demand can go up to 150 units per week.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the demand as D and the profit as P. We have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: D <= 100 units\nIn this case, the store purchases the product for $30 per unit. The profit per unit is $50 - $30 = $20. So, the total profit is P = 20D.\n\nCase 2: D > 100 units\nIn this case, the store purchases the first 100 units for $30 per unit and the remaining (D - 100) units for $40 per unit. The profit per unit for the first 100 units is $20, and the profit per unit for the remaining units is $50 - $40 = $10. So, the total profit is P = 20 * 100 + 10(D - 100) = 2000 + 10D - 1000 = 10D + 1000.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal demand (D) that maximizes the profit (P).\n\nFor Case 1 (D <= 100 units), the profit function is P = 20D. The maximum profit occurs when D = 100, so P = 20 * 100 = 2000.\n\nFor Case 2 (D > 100 units), the profit function is P = 10D + 1000. The maximum profit occurs when D = 150 (the maximum demand), so P = 10 * 150 + 1000 = 2500.\n\nSince the profit in Case 2 (P = 2500) is greater than the profit in Case 1 (P = 2000), the store should aim for a demand greater than 100 units to maximize its profit. Therefore, the optimal pricing of the product is $50 per unit, which will result in a maximum profit of $2500 when the demand reaches 150 units per week."
