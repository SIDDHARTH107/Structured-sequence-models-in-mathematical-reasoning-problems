    "message_2": "To show that (A x B) ∩ (B x A) ≠ A x B, we will first find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A, and then find their intersection.\n\nA x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So,\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nSimilarly, B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So,\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A x B and B x A, which is the set of ordered pairs that are present in both A x B and B x A.\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the intersection (A x B) ∩ (B x A) is not equal to A x B, since it only contains 4 ordered pairs, while A x B contains 9 ordered pairs. Therefore, (A x B) ∩ (B x A) ≠ A x B."
