    "message_2": "To find the degree of the projective variety $V$, we need to count the number of intersection points of $V$ with a generic hyperplane in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. Let's consider the hyperplane $H: ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2 + dx_3 = 0$.\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection points of $V$ and $H$. Since $V$ is defined as the intersection of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1. $x_0x_2 + x_1x_3 = 0$\n2. $x_0x_1 + x_2x_3 = 0$\n3. $ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2 + dx_3 = 0$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: From equation (3), express $x_3$ in terms of the other variables:\n$x_3 = -\\frac{ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2}{d}$\n\nStep 2: Substitute the expression for $x_3$ into equations (1) and (2):\n1. $x_0x_2 - x_1\\left(-\\frac{ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2}{d}\\right) = 0$\n2. $x_0x_1 - x_2\\left(-\\frac{ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2}{d}\\right) = 0$\n\nStep 3: Clear the denominators in both equations:\n1. $dx_0x_2 + x_1(ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2) = 0$\n2. $dx_0x_1 + x_2(ax_0 + bx_1 + cx_2) = 0$\n\nStep 4: Rearrange the equations to get a homogeneous system of equations:\n1. $(ad)x_0x_1 + (bd)x_1^2 + (cd)x_1x_2 = (d^2)x_0x_2$\n2. $(ad)x_0x_1 + (bd)x_0x_2 + (cd)x_2^2 = (d^2)x_0x_1$\n\nNow, we can see that both equations are homogeneous of degree 2. Since the intersection of two quadrics in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is a curve of degree 4, we can conclude that the degree of the projective variety $V$ is 4."
