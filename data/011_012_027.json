    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many men are in the company. Since there are 25 women, there must be 50 - 25 = 25 men.\n\nNow, we know that 35 employees are married, and 15 of those are women. So, there must be 35 - 15 = 20 married men.\n\nSince there are 25 men in total and 20 of them are married, there must be 25 - 20 = 5 unmarried men."
