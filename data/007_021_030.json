    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of the number 12345678910111213141516, we will use Pollard's rho algorithm. The algorithm is an efficient method for finding non-trivial factors of large composite numbers.\n\nPollard's rho algorithm:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) and an initial value x.\n2. Iterate the function and find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between the iterates and the given number.\n3. If the GCD is not 1 or the given number, it is a non-trivial factor.\n\nWe will use the function f(x) = x^2 + 1 and start with x = 2.\n\n1. f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. GCD(5 - 2, 12345678910111213141516) = GCD(3, 12345678910111213141516) = 1\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we continue with the next iteration.\n\n1. f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n2. GCD(26 - 5, 12345678910111213141516) = GCD(21, 12345678910111213141516) = 3\n\nThe GCD is 3, which is a non-trivial factor of the given number. Therefore, the smallest prime factor of 12345678910111213141516 is 3."
