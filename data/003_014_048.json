    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function y = 2sin(3x - pi/4), we can analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sine function: y = A*sin(B(x - C)).\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 2, so the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which is B. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π)/|B|. In this case, B = 3, so the period is (2π)/3.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C in the general form of the sine function. In this case, C = pi/4. Since the equation is in the form y = A*sin(B(x - C)), the phase shift is positive, so the phase shift is pi/4 units to the right.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, and the phase shift is pi/4 units to the right."
