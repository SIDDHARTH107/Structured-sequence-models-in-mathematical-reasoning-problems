    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be determined using the formula:\n\nLength of curve = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations.\n\nLength of curve = 1 * (2^10)\nLength of curve = 1 * 1024\nLength of curve = 1024\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024."
