    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular pentagon with a side length of 8 cm, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * √(5(5 + 2√5)) * (side length)^2\n\nPlugging in the side length of 8 cm:\n\nArea = (1/4) * √(5(5 + 2√5)) * (8)^2\nArea = (1/4) * √(5(5 + 2√5)) * 64\nArea ≈ 110.11 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular pentagon is approximately 110.11 cm²."
