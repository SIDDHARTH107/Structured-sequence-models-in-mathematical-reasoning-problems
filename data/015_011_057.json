    "message_2": "The maximum angle that the lower pendulum of a double pendulum can reach is a complex problem that cannot be solved analytically using basic trigonometry or classical mechanics. This is because the motion of a double pendulum is chaotic and highly sensitive to initial conditions.\n\nHowever, we can approximate the maximum angle that the lower pendulum can reach using a numerical simulation or by considering the conservation of energy.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the gravitational potential energy and the kinetic energy of both pendulums. Initially, both pendulums are at rest, so the kinetic energy is zero. The gravitational potential energy can be calculated as:\n\nPE = m * g * (h1 + h2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of each pendulum (0.5 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h1 and h2 are the vertical heights of the center of mass of the first and second pendulums, respectively, relative to their lowest points.\n\nFor the initial angle of 45 degrees, we can calculate the heights as follows:\n\nh1 = L * (1 - cos(45°))\nh2 = L * (1 - cos(45°)) + L * (1 - cos(45°))\n\nwhere L is the length of each pendulum (1 m).\n\nh1 = 1 * (1 - cos(45°)) ≈ 0.293 m\nh2 = 1 * (1 - cos(45°)) + 1 * (1 - cos(45°)) ≈ 0.586 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the initial potential energy:\n\nPE_initial = 0.5 * 9.81 * (0.293 + 0.586) ≈ 4.32 J\n\nAt the maximum angle, the lower pendulum will have the maximum potential energy, and the upper pendulum will have zero kinetic energy. Therefore, the total mechanical energy will be equal to the initial potential energy:\n\nPE_max = 0.5 * 9.81 * (h1_max + h2_max) = 4.32 J\n\nSince the maximum height for the second pendulum is when it is vertically aligned with the first pendulum, we have:\n\nh1_max = L = 1 m\nh2_max = 2 * L = 2 m\n\nNow, we can solve for the maximum angle:\n\n4.32 J = 0.5 * 9.81 * (1 + 2)\n4.32 J ≈ 14.715 J\n\nThis result indicates that our initial assumption of the maximum angle is not correct, as the energy would be higher than the initial energy. The actual maximum angle will be lower than the angle that would result in the lower pendulum being vertically aligned with the first pendulum.\n\nTo find the exact maximum angle, a numerical simulation or more advanced analytical methods would be required. However, we can conclude that the maximum angle will be less than the angle that would result in the lower pendulum being vertically aligned with the first pendulum (180 degrees from the vertical)."
