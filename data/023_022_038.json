    "message_1": "A company's stock price can be modeled using the function:\n\nf(t) = 10*sin(2πt/12) + 15*sin(2πt/6) + 5*sin(2πt/4)\n\nwhere t is the time in months. Use Fourier Analysis to determine the frequency components of the stock price and evaluate the 12-month periodicity amplitude.",
    "message_2": "The given function is already in the form of a sum of sinusoids, which is the result of a Fourier series. We can directly identify the frequency components and their amplitudes from the function:\n\nf(t) = 10*sin(2πt/12) + 15*sin(2πt/6) + 5*sin(2πt/4)\n\nThe frequency components are determined by the coefficients of 't' inside the sine functions. Let's identify them:\n\n1. 2πt/12 -> This frequency component has a period of 12 months (T1 = 12), and its frequency is f1 = 1/T1 = 1/12 cycles per month.\n2. 2πt/6 -> This frequency component has a period of 6 months (T2 = 6), and its frequency is f2 = 1/T2 = 1/6 cycles per month.\n3. 2πt/4 -> This frequency component has a period of 4 months (T3 = 4), and its frequency is f3 = 1/T3 = 1/4 cycles per month.\n\nNow, let's identify the amplitudes associated with each frequency component:\n\n1. The amplitude of the 12-month periodicity component (f1) is 10.\n2. The amplitude of the 6-month periodicity component (f2) is 15.\n3. The amplitude of the 4-month periodicity component (f3) is 5.\n\nSo, the 12-month periodicity amplitude is 10."
