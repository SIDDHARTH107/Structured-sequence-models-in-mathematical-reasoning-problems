    "message_1": "Consider the system of equations:\n```\n2x - y = 4\n4x - 2y = 8\n```\nFind the solution to the system of equations using a numerical method, and state the type of solution that the system has (unique, infinite or no solution).",
    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n```\n2x - y = 4\n2x - y = 4\n```\n\nNow we can see that both equations are the same. This means that the two lines represented by these equations are the same line, and they have an infinite number of points in common. Therefore, the system has an infinite number of solutions."
