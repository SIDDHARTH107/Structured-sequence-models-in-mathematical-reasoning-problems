    "message_2": "There are a total of 14 students (8 boys and 6 girls) competing for 3 positions. We can use the combination formula to find the total number of ways to choose 3 students out of 14:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(14, 3) = 14! / (3!(14-3)!) = 14! / (3! * 11!) = 364\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 8:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56\n\nTo find the probability that all 3 positions will be held by boys, we divide the number of ways to choose 3 boys by the total number of ways to choose 3 students:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 3 boys) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 students)\nProbability = 56 / 364\nProbability = 14 / 91\n\nSo, the probability that all 3 positions will be held by boys is 14/91 or approximately 0.1538 (rounded to four decimal places)."
