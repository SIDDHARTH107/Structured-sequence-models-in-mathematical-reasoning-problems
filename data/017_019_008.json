    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36. We know that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, so by the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 or 9, and n_3 = 1 or 4.\n2. n_2 = 1 or 9, and n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\nWe will analyze these cases and show that G is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. Also, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3, which is isomorphic to C4 × C9. Since C4 × C9 is isomorphic to C36, G is isomorphic to C36.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Then, the action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S4. The kernel of this homomorphism contains P_2, and the image is a subgroup of S4 of order 9. The only such subgroup is A4, the alternating group of degree 4. Therefore, G is an extension of A4 by C2 × C2. This extension can be either a direct product A4 × C2 × C2 or a semidirect product A4 ⋊ (C2 × C2). The direct product is isomorphic to A4 × C3, and the semidirect product is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the same argument shows that G is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has nine Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S9, and the action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups gives a homomorphism from G to S4. By analyzing the possible orders of the images of these homomorphisms, we can show that G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C36, A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
