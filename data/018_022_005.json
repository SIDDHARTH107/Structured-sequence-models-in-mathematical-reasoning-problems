    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the cartesian product of the symmetric difference of A and B and the set {5}. Show that the result is not equal to the cartesian product of {5} and the symmetric difference of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case, the intersection of A and B is {2, 3}. So, the symmetric difference of A and B is {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the cartesian product of the symmetric difference of A and B and the set {5}. The cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set. In this case, the cartesian product of {1, 4} and {5} is {(1, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nNext, let's find the cartesian product of {5} and the symmetric difference of A and B. The cartesian product of {5} and {1, 4} is {(5, 1), (5, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's compare the two cartesian products we found:\n\n1. The cartesian product of the symmetric difference of A and B and the set {5}: {(1, 5), (4, 5)}\n2. The cartesian product of {5} and the symmetric difference of A and B: {(5, 1), (5, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the two cartesian products are not equal, since the ordered pairs are different. The first cartesian product has the pairs (1, 5) and (4, 5), while the second cartesian product has the pairs (5, 1) and (5, 4)."
