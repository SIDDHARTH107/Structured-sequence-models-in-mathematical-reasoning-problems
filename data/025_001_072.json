    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of C1 and C2, we can substitute the expression for y from C2 into C1:\n\nC2: y = 3 - x\n\nNow substitute this into C1:\n\nC1: x^2 + (3 - x)^2 - 4 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 9 - 6x + x^2 - 4 = 0\n2x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for x:\n\nx = (6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 2 * 5)) / (2 * 2)\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 40)) / 4\nx = (6 ± √(-4)) / 4\nx = (6 ± 2i) / 4\n\nSo, we have two complex solutions for x:\n\nx1 = (6 + 2i) / 4 = 3/2 + 1/2i\nx2 = (6 - 2i) / 4 = 3/2 - 1/2i\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y values using the expression y = 3 - x:\n\ny1 = 3 - x1 = 3 - (3/2 + 1/2i) = 3/2 - 1/2i\ny2 = 3 - x2 = 3 - (3/2 - 1/2i) = 3/2 + 1/2i\n\nThus, we have two distinct intersection points in the complex plane:\n\nP1 = (3/2 + 1/2i, 3/2 - 1/2i)\nP2 = (3/2 - 1/2i, 3/2 + 1/2i)\n\nIn the complex projective plane, these points remain distinct, so there are 2 distinct intersection points of C1 and C2 when considered in the complex projective plane."
