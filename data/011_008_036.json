    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find S(10, 4).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(10, 4), we need to calculate the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k. We can use a table to keep track of the values:\n\nn\\k | 1   2    3    4\n----------------------\n1   | 1\n2   | 1   1\n3   | 1   3    1\n4   | 1   7    6    1\n5   | 1  15   25   10\n6   | 1  31   90   65\n7   | 1  63  301  350\n8   | 1 127  966 1701\n9   | 1 255 3025 7770\n10  | 1 511 9330 29224\n\nUsing the formula and filling in the table, we find that S(10, 4) = 29,224. So, there are 29,224 ways to divide a set of 10 identical objects into 4 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
