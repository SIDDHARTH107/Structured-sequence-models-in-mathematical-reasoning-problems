    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 over the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given interval.\n\nThe antiderivative of f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 is F(x) = (1/3)x^3 + x^2 + x + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since we are evaluating a definite integral, we don't need to worry about the constant C.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate F(x) at the interval [0, 2]:\n\nF(2) = (1/3)(2)^3 + (2)^2 + (2)\nF(2) = (1/3)(8) + 4 + 2\nF(2) = 8/3 + 6\n\nF(0) = (1/3)(0)^3 + (0)^2 + (0)\nF(0) = 0\n\nNow, subtract F(0) from F(2) to find the definite integral:\n\nDefinite integral = F(2) - F(0) = (8/3 + 6) - 0 = 8/3 + 6 = 8/3 + 18/3 = 26/3\n\nSo, the value of the definite integral of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 over the interval [0, 2] is 26/3."
