    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k successful free throw shots\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of free throw shots (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful free throw shots (7 in this case)\n- p is the probability of making a successful free throw shot (0.85 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 successful free throw shots out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / (5040 * 6)\nC(10, 7) = 3628800 / 30240\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.85^7 * (1-0.85)^(10-7)\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.85^7 * 0.15^3\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.39135393 * 0.003375\nP(X = 7) â‰ˆ 0.2014\n\nSo, the probability that Player A will make exactly 7 out of 10 free throw shots is approximately 0.2014 or 20.14%."
