    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal, also known as the Vicsek snowflake, is a self-similar fractal that can be generated using an iterative process. The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of the fractal's complexity and can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor r is related to the parameter α by the equation:\n\nr = (1 + α) / 2\n\nAs α tends to 0, the scaling factor r tends to 1/2:\n\nr = (1 + 0) / 2 = 1/2\n\nNow we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension D:\n\nD = log(5) / log(1/2)\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal S(α) when α tends to 0 is approximately 1.465."
