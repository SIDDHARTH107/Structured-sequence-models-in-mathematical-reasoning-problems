    "message_1": "Let's say we have the following implicit function:\n\n(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 25x^2 + 25y^2\n\nUsing the chain rule, find the derivative of y with respect to x, when x = 3.",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, and then solve for dy/dx.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx [(x^2 + y^2)^2] = d/dx [25x^2 + 25y^2]\n\nUsing the chain rule on the left side:\n\n2(x^2 + y^2) * d/dx [x^2 + y^2] = 50x + 50y * dy/dx\n\nNow, differentiate the inside of the left side with respect to x:\n\n2(x^2 + y^2) * (2x + 2y * dy/dx) = 50x + 50y * dy/dx\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 3. We can do this by plugging x = 3 into the original equation:\n\n(3^2 + y^2)^2 = 25(3^2) + 25y^2\n\n(9 + y^2)^2 = 225 + 25y^2\n\nNow, we need to solve for y. Let's first simplify the equation:\n\n81 + 18y^2 + y^4 = 225 + 25y^2\n\ny^4 - 7y^2 - 144 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of y^2. Let's substitute z = y^2:\n\nz^2 - 7z - 144 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for z using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nz = (7 ± √(49 + 576)) / 2\n\nz = (7 ± √625) / 2\n\nz = (7 ± 25) / 2\n\nThe two possible values for z are:\n\nz = 16 or z = -9\n\nSince z = y^2, we cannot have a negative value for z. Therefore, z = 16, and y^2 = 16, so y = ±4. \n\nNow, we can plug x = 3 and y = 4 (or y = -4) into the equation we derived for the derivative:\n\n2(3^2 + 4^2) * (2(3) + 2(4) * dy/dx) = 50(3) + 50(4) * dy/dx\n\n2(9 + 16) * (6 + 8 * dy/dx) = 150 + 200 * dy/dx\n\n50 * (6 + 8 * dy/dx) = 150 + 200 * dy/dx\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx:\n\n300 + 400 * dy/dx = 150 + 200 * dy/dx\n\n200 * dy/dx = -150\n\ndy/dx = -150 / 200\n\ndy/dx = -3/4\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 3 is -3/4. Note that this is the same for both y = 4 and y = -4, as the derivative only depends on the x-value in this case."
