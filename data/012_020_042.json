    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of a graph, we need to find all the possible ways to relabel the vertices such that the graph remains unchanged. In other words, we need to find all the isomorphisms from the graph to itself.\n\nSince the graph has 6 vertices and 7 edges, it must be a tree, as a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. The only tree with 6 vertices and 7 edges is a tree with one vertex of degree 5 and the other five vertices of degree 1 (i.e., a star graph).\n\nNow, let's find the automorphism group of this star graph. The center vertex must always be mapped to itself, as it is the only vertex with degree 5. The other five vertices are indistinguishable, as they all have degree 1. Therefore, any permutation of these five vertices will result in an automorphism of the graph.\n\nThe automorphism group of this star graph is the symmetric group on the five degree-1 vertices, which is denoted as S5. The order of S5 is 5! = 120, so there are 120 automorphisms in the automorphism group of this graph."
