    "message_1": "Unfortunately, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for the topic of Non-monotonic logic in mathematics as it typically involves reasoning about uncertain or incomplete information, rather than solving numerical problems. However, I can provide a sample question that demonstrates the concept of Non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose you believe that all birds can fly. However, you come across a penguin, which cannot fly. Does this contradict your belief that all birds can fly? If not, how can you modify your belief to accommodate the existence of non-flying birds?",
    "message_2": "Yes, encountering a penguin, which cannot fly, contradicts the belief that all birds can fly. Non-monotonic logic allows us to modify our beliefs when new information is presented. In this case, we can update our belief to accommodate the existence of non-flying birds.\n\nOne way to modify the belief is to say that \"most birds can fly, but there are exceptions, such as penguins and ostriches.\" This updated belief takes into account the new information about penguins and allows for the possibility of other non-flying birds. This demonstrates the concept of non-monotonic logic, where our beliefs and conclusions can change as new information becomes available."
