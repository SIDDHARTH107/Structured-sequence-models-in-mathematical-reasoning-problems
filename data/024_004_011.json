    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface defined by the equation F(x, y, z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 6 = 0 at the point (1, 1, 1), we first need to compute the first and second partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nFx = 2x\nFy = 4y\nFz = 6z\n\nFxx = 2\nFyy = 4\nFzz = 6\n\nFxy = Fyx = 0\nFxz = Fzx = 0\nFyz = Fzy = 0\n\nNow, we compute the unit normal vector N at the point (1, 1, 1) using the gradient of F:\n\nN = ∇F / ||∇F||\n\n∇F = (Fx, Fy, Fz) = (2, 4, 6)\n\n||∇F|| = sqrt(Fx^2 + Fy^2 + Fz^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(56)\n\nN = (2/sqrt(56), 4/sqrt(56), 6/sqrt(56))\n\nNext, we compute the shape operator matrix S:\n\nS = | Fxx  Fxy  Fxz |\n      | Fyx  Fyy  Fyz |\n      | Fzx  Fzy  Fzz |\n\nS = |  2    0    0  |\n      |  0    4    0  |\n      |  0    0    6  |\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of the shape operator matrix, which are the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\n\nk1 = 2\nk2 = 4\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nH = (2 + 4) / 2\n\nH = 3\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 1) is 3."
