    "message_2": "Cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. Here's a simplified version of the algorithm to maximize the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 15 over the interval [-2, 7]:\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoos (solutions) randomly within the interval [-2, 7].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo (the value of the function f(x) for each solution).\n3. Select the best cuckoo (the one with the highest fitness value).\n4. Generate a new cuckoo by modifying the best cuckoo using a random walk (Levy flight).\n5. If the new cuckoo's position is outside the interval [-2, 7], bring it back within the interval.\n6. Evaluate the fitness of the new cuckoo.\n7. If the new cuckoo's fitness is better than the worst cuckoo in the population, replace the worst cuckoo with the new one.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the maximum fitness value does not change for a certain number of iterations).\n\nAfter the algorithm is completed, the best cuckoo (solution) found will be the one that maximizes the function f(x) within the given interval.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the cuckoo search algorithm involves more parameters and steps, such as the probability of discovering a cuckoo's egg by the host bird, which affects the replacement strategy. The simplified version provided here is just an illustration of the main idea behind the algorithm."
