    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and how it is applied to digital images. The DFT is a mathematical technique used to transform a discrete signal (in this case, the pixel values of a digital image) from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. The frequency domain representation allows us to analyze the image in terms of its frequency components.\n\nFor a 2D image, the 2D DFT is defined as follows:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ[Σ[f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))]], where the summations are from x = 0 to M-1 and y = 0 to N-1.\n\nHere, f(x, y) represents the pixel values of the image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (in this case, 512 x 512), and F(u, v) is the Fourier transform of the image at frequency (u, v). The term e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N)) is the complex exponential that represents the basis functions of the Fourier transform.\n\nTo find the amplitudes of the first 5 non-zero frequencies, we need to compute the magnitude of F(u, v) for the frequencies (u, v) = (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (0, 2). The amplitude is given by the magnitude of the complex number F(u, v):\n\nAmplitude = |F(u, v)|\n\nHowever, without the actual pixel values of the image, we cannot compute the exact amplitudes for these frequencies. In practice, you would use a programming language like Python with libraries such as NumPy and SciPy to perform the DFT on the given image and calculate the amplitudes of the desired frequencies.\n\nIn summary, to determine the amplitudes of the first 5 non-zero frequencies in the Fourier domain, you would apply the 2D DFT to the given image and calculate the magnitude of F(u, v) for the specified frequencies. However, without the actual pixel values, we cannot provide the exact amplitudes."
