    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, and it has the shape of a cardioid. The area of the main cardioid can be calculated using the formula for the area of a cardioid: A = (1/2)πa^2, where 'a' is the length of the cardioid's major axis.\n\nIn the Mandelbrot set, the length of the major axis of the main cardioid is 1. Therefore, the area of the main cardioid is:\n\nA = (1/2)π(1)^2\nA = (1/2)π\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.57 square units."
