    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The company produces 500 units of type A, 300 units of type B and 750 units of type C per week. The selling price for type A is $12/unit, for type B is $16/unit, and for type C is $20/unit. The total revenue from sales of these products in a week is $14,700. Find the number of units of each product the company needs to sell to maximize its weekly revenue. Use QR decomposition to solve this system of linear equations.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the weekly revenue, we need to find the number of units of each product that the company needs to sell. Let's denote the number of units of type A, B, and C as x, y, and z, respectively. The total revenue can be represented as:\n\nRevenue = 12x + 16y + 20z\n\nWe are given that the total revenue from sales of these products in a week is $14,700. So, we have:\n\n12x + 16y + 20z = 14,700\n\nWe also know the production capacities of each product type:\n\nx = 500\ny = 300\nz = 750\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\n1. 12x + 16y + 20z = 14,700\n2. x = 500\n3. y = 300\n4. z = 750\n\nWe can rewrite the system of equations in matrix form as:\n\n| 12 16 20 | | x |   | 14700 |\n|  1  0  0 | | y | = |  500  |\n|  0  1  0 | | z |   |  300  |\n|  0  0  1 |          |  750  |\n\nNow, we will use QR decomposition to solve this system of linear equations. QR decomposition is a technique used to decompose a matrix A into a product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, i.e., A = QR.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Q and R matrices for the given matrix A:\n\nA = | 12 16 20 |\n      |  1  0  0 |\n      |  0  1  0 |\n      |  0  0  1 |\n\nUsing QR decomposition, we get:\n\nQ = | -0.9487 -0.3162  0     |\n      |  0.0792  0.9487  0     |\n      |  0       0      1     |\n      |  0       0      0     |\n\nR = | -12.6491 -16.8622 -20.0792 |\n      |  0       -3.1623  -6.3246 |\n      |  0        0        1      |\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations using the QR decomposition:\n\nAx = b\n(QR)x = b\nRx = Q^Tb\n\nLet's compute Q^Tb:\n\nQ^T = | -0.9487  0.0792  0  0 |\n         | -0.3162  0.9487  0  0 |\n         |  0       0      1  0 |\n\nb = | 14700 |\n      |  500  |\n      |  300  |\n      |  750  |\n\nQ^Tb = | -13949.4 |\n           |  2849.4  |\n           |  750     |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb:\n\n| -12.6491 -16.8622 -20.0792 | | x |   | -13949.4 |\n|  0       -3.1623  -6.3246 | | y | = |  2849.4  |\n|  0        0        1      | | z |   |  750     |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = 500\ny = 300\nz = 750\n\nSo, the company needs to sell 500 units of type A, 300 units of type B, and 750 units of type C to maximize its weekly revenue."
