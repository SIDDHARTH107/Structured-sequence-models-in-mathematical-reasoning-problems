    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 10 elements, i.e., A = {a1, a2, ..., a10}. To find the complement of A, we need to know the universal set U that contains A. Let's assume U contains all the elements that we are considering in this problem.\n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. In other words, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. Mathematically, A ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}.\n\nHowever, by definition, A' contains all elements that are not in A. Therefore, there cannot be any element that is both in A and A'. In other words, there is no element x that satisfies the condition x ∈ A and x ∈ A'.\n\nHence, the intersection of A and its complement A' is the empty set, which can be denoted as ∅ or {}. That is, A ∩ A' = ∅."
