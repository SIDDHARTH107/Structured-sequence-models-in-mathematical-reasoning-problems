    "message_2": "To find the number of different topologies that can be defined on a set X with exactly 5 elements, we can use the concept of \"partitions\" and the Bell number.\n\nA topology on a set X is a collection of subsets of X, called open sets, such that:\n\n1. The empty set and X itself are open sets.\n2. The intersection of any finite number of open sets is an open set.\n3. The union of any collection of open sets is an open set.\n\nFor a set with n elements, the number of different topologies is given by the nth Bell number, denoted B(n). Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets.\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, there are 52 different topologies that can be defined on a set X with exactly 5 elements."
