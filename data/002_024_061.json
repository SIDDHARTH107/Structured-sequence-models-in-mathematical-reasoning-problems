    "message_1": "A trapezium has parallel sides of length 8 cm and 12 cm, and two non-parallel sides of length 5 cm and 6 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply add the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm + 12 cm + 5 cm + 6 cm = 31 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 31 centimeters."
