    "message_2": "To find all integral points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x - 2 over the field F_7, we will plug in all possible values of x from 0 to 6 (since F_7 has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) and check if there is a corresponding y value in F_7 that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 2*0 - 2 = -2 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\nThere is no y in F_7 such that y^2 ≡ 5 (mod 7).\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 2*1 - 2 = 1\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\nSo, we have two points: (1, 1) and (1, 6).\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 2*2 - 2 = 12 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\nThere is no y in F_7 such that y^2 ≡ 5 (mod 7).\n\nFor x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 2*3 - 2 = 31 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\ny = ±5 (mod 7)\nSo, we have two points: (3, 5) and (3, 2).\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 2*4 - 2 = 66 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\ny = ±5 (mod 7)\nSo, we have two points: (4, 5) and (4, 2).\n\nFor x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 2*5 - 2 = 127 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\nSo, we have two points: (5, 1) and (5, 6).\n\nFor x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 2*6 - 2 = 218 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\ny = ±2 (mod 7)\nSo, we have two points: (6, 2) and (6, 5).\n\nIn summary, the integral points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x - 2 over the field F_7 are:\n(1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), and (6, 5)."
