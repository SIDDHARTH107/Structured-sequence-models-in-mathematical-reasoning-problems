    "message_2": "To solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition, we can use the inverse scattering transform method. However, this method is quite involved and requires a deep understanding of the subject. Instead, we can use a known soliton solution to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation that satisfies the given initial condition.\n\nA soliton solution to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = \\sqrt{2\\eta} \\mathrm{sech}(\\eta(x-x_0-4\\eta^2t))e^{i(\\eta^2t-\\eta x + \\theta_0)},$$\n\nwhere $\\eta$, $x_0$, and $\\theta_0$ are constants. In our case, the initial condition is $\\psi(x,0) = \\mathrm{sech}(x)$. Comparing this with the soliton solution, we can see that $\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $x_0 = 0$, and $\\theta_0 = 0$. Thus, the soliton solution that satisfies the given initial condition is:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = \\mathrm{sech}(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}-2t)e^{i(\\frac{t}{2}-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}})}.$$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $\\psi(0,5)$:\n\n$$\\psi(0,5) = \\mathrm{sech}(\\frac{0}{\\sqrt{2}}-2(5))e^{i(\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{0}{\\sqrt{2}})}.$$\n\n$$\\psi(0,5) = \\mathrm{sech}(-10)e^{i\\frac{5}{2}}.$$\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\n$$\\psi(0,5) \\approx 0.0000 + 0.0000i.$$\n\nSo, the value of $\\psi(0,5)$ correct to 4 decimal places is approximately 0.0000 + 0.0000i."
