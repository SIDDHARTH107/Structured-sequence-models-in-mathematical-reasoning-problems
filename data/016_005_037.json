    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set constructed by removing the middle third of a line segment repeatedly can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the magnification factor.\n\nIn this case, the Cantor set is formed by removing the middle third of a line segment, leaving two segments of equal length. So, N = 2. The magnification factor is 1/3, so M = 3.\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3)\n\nHence, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309."
