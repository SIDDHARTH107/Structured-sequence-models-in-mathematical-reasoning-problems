    "message_2": "To find the particular solution to the given first-order differential equation y' = 2xy with the initial condition y(0) = 3, we first need to solve the differential equation.\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. We can solve it using separation of variables:\n\ndy/dx = 2xy\n\nRearrange the equation to separate variables:\n\ndy/y = 2x dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫(2x) dx\n\nln|y| = x^2 + C₁\n\nTo remove the natural logarithm, use exponentiation:\n\ny = e^(x^2 + C₁)\n\ny = e^(x^2) * e^C₁\n\nSince e^C₁ is a constant, let's denote it as C:\n\ny = Ce^(x^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution using the initial condition y(0) = 3:\n\n3 = Ce^(0^2)\n\n3 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = 3e^(x^2)"
