    "message_2": "The intersection of set A and set B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, the intersection is {10}, since 10 is the only element that appears in both sets.\n\nNow, let's prove that this intersection is a subset of set A and a subset of set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. To prove that the intersection is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the intersection is also an element of set A. The intersection contains only one element, 10, which is also an element of set A. Therefore, the intersection is a subset of set A.\n\nSimilarly, to prove that the intersection is a subset of set B, we need to show that every element in the intersection is also an element of set B. The intersection contains only one element, 10, which is also an element of set B. Therefore, the intersection is a subset of set B."
