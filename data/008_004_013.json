    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. The augmented matrix of the system is:\n\n| 3 -1  2 | 0 |\n| 2  1 -3 | 0 |\n| 1  2 -1 | 0 |\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the x term from the second and third rows:\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1\n\n|  3  -1   2  |  0  |\n|  0   5  -7  |  0  |\n|  0   5  -5  |  0  |\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the y term from the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 - R2\n\n|  3  -1   2  |  0  |\n|  0   5  -7  |  0  |\n|  0   0   2  |  0  |\n\nNow, we'll solve for z, y, and x:\n\nz = 0 (since 2z = 0)\ny = 0 (since 5y - 7z = 5y = 0)\nx = 0 (since 3x - y + 2z = 3x = 0)\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
