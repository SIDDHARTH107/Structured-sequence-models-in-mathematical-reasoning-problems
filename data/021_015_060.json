    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products- A and B. The company has a total of 300 units of raw material and 400 units of labor available for production. Each A product requires 2 units of raw material and 4 units of labor, and each B product requires 3 units of raw material and 5 units of labor. The profit per unit of A and B products are $20 and $30 respectively.\n\nUsing particle swarm optimization, find the optimal production level of both A and B products that maximizes the profit of the company.\n\n(Note: The answer should include the optimal production level of both A and B products and the maximum profit attainable)",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can provide you with a solution using linear programming, but I cannot perform particle swarm optimization as it requires a computer program to run multiple iterations. Here's the linear programming solution:\n\nLet x be the number of A products and y be the number of B products.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material: 2x + 3y <= 300\n2. Labor: 4x + 5y <= 400\n3. Non-negativity: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we'll analyze the feasible region determined by the constraints. The corner points of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 100)\n3. (150, 0)\n4. (50, 80)\n\nNow, we'll calculate the profit at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 100) = 20(0) + 30(100) = $3000\n3. P(150, 0) = 20(150) + 30(0) = $3000\n4. P(50, 80) = 20(50) + 30(80) = $3400\n\nThe maximum profit is attained at the production level of 50 A products and 80 B products, with a maximum profit of $3400."
