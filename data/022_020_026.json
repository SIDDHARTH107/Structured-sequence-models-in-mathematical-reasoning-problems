    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we first find the general solution to the homogeneous equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dz^2} + 2iy = 0$$\n\nWe propose a solution of the form $y(z) = e^{mz}$, where $m$ is a complex constant. Substituting this into the homogeneous equation, we get:\n\n$$m^2e^{mz} + 2ie^{mz} = 0$$\n\nDividing both sides by $e^{mz}$, we obtain the characteristic equation:\n\n$$m^2 + 2i = 0$$\n\nSolving for $m$, we get:\n\n$$m = \\pm \\sqrt{-2i}$$\n\nTo find the square root of a complex number, we can use the polar form. First, we convert $-2i$ to polar form:\n\n$$-2i = 2e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{2}}$$\n\nNow, we can find the square root:\n\n$$\\sqrt{-2i} = \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}, \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}$$\n\nThus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is:\n\n$$y_h(z) = C_1e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}z} + C_2e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}z}$$\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dz^2} + 2iy = 2ze^z$$\n\nWe propose a particular solution of the form:\n\n$$y_p(z) = (Az^2 + Bz)e^z$$\n\nTaking the first derivative:\n\n$$y_p'(z) = (2Az + B)e^z + (Az^2 + Bz)e^z$$\n\nAnd the second derivative:\n\n$$y_p''(z) = 2Ae^z + 2(Az + B)e^z + (Az^2 + Bz)e^z$$\n\nSubstituting $y_p(z)$ and $y_p''(z)$ into the inhomogeneous equation:\n\n$$2Ae^z + 2(Az + B)e^z + (Az^2 + Bz)e^z + 2i(Az^2 + Bz)e^z = 2ze^z$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $z$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$2A = 0$$\n$$2A + 2B = 0$$\n$$A + B + 2iA = 2$$\n\nSolving this system, we find:\n\n$$A = 0, \\quad B = 0, \\quad 2iA = 2$$\n\nThis system has no solution, which means our proposed form for the particular solution is incorrect. We need to modify our proposed form to include a cubic term:\n\n$$y_p(z) = (Az^3 + Bz^2 + Cz)e^z$$\n\nTaking the first derivative:\n\n$$y_p'(z) = (3Az^2 + 2Bz + C)e^z + (Az^3 + Bz^2 + Cz)e^z$$\n\nAnd the second derivative:\n\n$$y_p''(z) = (6Az + 2B)e^z + (3Az^2 + 2Bz + C)e^z + (Az^3 + Bz^2 + Cz)e^z$$\n\nSubstituting $y_p(z)$ and $y_p''(z)$ into the inhomogeneous equation:\n\n$$(6Az + 2B)e^z + (3Az^2 + 2Bz + C)e^z + (Az^3 + Bz^2 + Cz)e^z + 2i(Az^3 + Bz^2 + Cz)e^z = 2ze^z$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $z$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$6A = 0$$\n$$2B + 6A = 0$$\n$$3A + 2B + C + 2iC = 2$$\n\nSolving this system, we find:\n\n$$A = 0, \\quad B = 0, \\quad C = 1 - i$$\n\nThus, the particular solution is:\n\n$$y_p(z) = (1 - i)ze^z$$\n\nThe general solution to the boundary value problem is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\n$$y(z) = C_1e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}z} + C_2e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}z} + (1 - i)ze^z$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) $y(0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = C_1 + C_2$$\n\n2) $y(1) + y'(1) = 0$:\n\n$$y(1) = C_1e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}} + C_2e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}} + (1 - i)e$$\n\n$$y'(1) = \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}C_1e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}} - \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}C_2e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}} + (1 - i)e$$\n\nAdding $y(1)$ and $y'(1)$:\n\n$$0 = (1 + \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}})C_1e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}} + (1 - \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}})C_2e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}}} + 2(1 - i)e$$\n\nUsing the first boundary condition, $C_1 = -C_2$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$0 = (1 + \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}} - 1 + \\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{-\\pi}{4}})C_1e^{\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}} + 2(1 - i)e$$\n\nThis equation does not have a unique solution for $C_1$ and $C_2$, which means the boundary value problem does not have a unique solution."
