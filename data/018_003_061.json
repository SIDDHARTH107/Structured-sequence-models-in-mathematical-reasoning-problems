    "message_2": "The union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all elements of A and all elements of B, without any duplicates. \n\nSo, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nFor A: Every element in A (1, 3, 5, 7) is also present in A ∪ B. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nFor B: Every element in B (2, 4, 6, 8) is also present in A ∪ B. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nThus, we have shown that the union of sets A and B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, is a superset of both A and B."
