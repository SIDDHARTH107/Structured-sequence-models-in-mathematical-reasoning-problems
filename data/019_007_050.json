    "message_1": "In a non-monotonic logic system, there are 8 premises P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8. Each premise can either be true (T) or false (F). The system uses a default logic system where all premises are assumed to be true unless proven otherwise. Given that P1, P3, P4, P6, and P7 are true, determine whether the conclusion C is true or false, where C is as follows:\n\nC: If P2 is true, then P5 is true. \n\nWhat is the truth value of C?",
    "message_2": "Since the system uses a default logic system where all premises are assumed to be true unless proven otherwise, we can assume that P2 and P5 are true. Therefore, the conclusion C, which states \"If P2 is true, then P5 is true,\" is also true. The truth value of C is true (T)."
