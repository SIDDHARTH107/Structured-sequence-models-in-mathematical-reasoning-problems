    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The smallest Mersenne prime is when n = 2, since n = 1 results in a non-prime number (1).\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime is:\n\n2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n\nThe value of the smallest Mersenne prime is 3."
