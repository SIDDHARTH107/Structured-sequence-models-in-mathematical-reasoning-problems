    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order as the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders.\n\nSince 5 and 7 are prime and coprime (meaning their greatest common divisor is 1), a group of order 35 must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7. In other words, the structure of a group of order 35 is Z_5 Ã— Z_7, where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\nSo, the group of order 35 is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
