    "message_1": "A chemical company produces two types of fertilizers (A and B). The production cost of fertilizer A is $100 per ton and the production cost of fertilizer B is $150 per ton. The company has a daily production capacity of 100 tons and has to meet the following demands:\n\n- Fertilizer A must be at least 40% of the total production.\n- Fertilizer B must be at least 20% of the total production.\n\nThe company wants to minimize the production cost while meeting the demand constraints. How much of each fertilizer should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of fertilizer A produced and y be the amount of fertilizer B produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 100 (total production capacity)\n2. x >= 0.4 * (x + y) (fertilizer A must be at least 40% of the total production)\n3. y >= 0.2 * (x + y) (fertilizer B must be at least 20% of the total production)\n\nWe want to minimize the production cost, which is given by the objective function:\n\nCost = 100x + 150y\n\nNow, we'll solve the constraints:\n\nFrom constraint 1:\ny = 100 - x\n\nFrom constraint 2:\nx >= 0.4 * (x + y)\nx >= 0.4 * (x + 100 - x)\nx >= 40\n\nFrom constraint 3:\ny >= 0.2 * (x + y)\ny >= 0.2 * (x + 100 - x)\ny >= 20\n\nNow we have the following system of inequalities:\n\nx >= 40\ny >= 20\ny = 100 - x\n\nSince we want to minimize the cost, we'll start by checking the lowest possible values for x and y that satisfy the constraints:\n\nIf x = 40, then y = 100 - 40 = 60. This satisfies all the constraints.\n\nNow we'll calculate the cost for this production plan:\n\nCost = 100x + 150y\nCost = 100(40) + 150(60)\nCost = 4000 + 9000\nCost = $13,000\n\nSo, the company should produce 40 tons of fertilizer A and 60 tons of fertilizer B to minimize the production cost while meeting the demand constraints. The minimum production cost will be $13,000."
