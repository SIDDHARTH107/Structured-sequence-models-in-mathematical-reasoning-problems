    "message_1": "A graph has 10 vertices, and the maximum degree of any vertex is 3. For this graph, how many ways can we color the vertices using 4 different colors so that no two adjacent vertices are colored the same?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G. However, finding the chromatic polynomial for an arbitrary graph is a difficult task, and we don't have enough information about the specific graph in question.\n\nInstead, we can consider an upper bound on the number of colorings. In the worst case, we would have a complete graph with 10 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic polynomial would be P(K10, 4) = 4! * (4-1)^(10-4) = 24 * 3^6 = 186624.\n\nHowever, the given graph has a maximum degree of 3, which means it cannot be a complete graph. Therefore, the actual number of 4-colorings for the given graph will be less than 186624. Without more information about the specific graph, we cannot determine the exact number of 4-colorings."
