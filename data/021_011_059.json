Use a tolerance of 1e-6 and maximum number of iterations equal to 1000. Show the values of x at each iteration, the gradient at each iteration, and the objective function value at each iteration.",
    "message_2": "To apply the conjugate gradient method, we first need to compute the gradient of the function f(x):\n\n∇f(x) = (df/dx, df/dy) = (2x - 2y - 2, 4y - 2x - 6)\n\nNow, let's start the conjugate gradient method with the initial point x0 = (-1, 1):\n\nIteration 0:\nx = (-1, 1)\nGradient: ∇f(x) = (0, 0)\nObjective function value: f(x) = 6\n\nSince the gradient is already zero at the initial point, the conjugate gradient method has found the minimum of the function f(x) in the first iteration itself. The minimum value of the function is 6, and it occurs at the point x = (-1, 1)."
