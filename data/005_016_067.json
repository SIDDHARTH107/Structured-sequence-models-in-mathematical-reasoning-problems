    "message_1": "Suppose we have a dataset with 50 observations and 2 variables. We want to perform linear discriminant analysis to classify the observations into two groups. The first group has a mean of (3, 5) and a covariance matrix of \n\n```\n[4  0]\n[0 16]\n```\n\nThe second group has a mean of (8, 11) and a covariance matrix of \n\n```\n[9  3]\n[3 16]\n```\n\nAssuming that the two groups have equal prior probabilities, find the linear discriminant function and use it to classify a new observation with values (6, 8) into one of the two groups.",
    "message_2": "To perform linear discriminant analysis, we first need to find the pooled covariance matrix, which is the weighted average of the individual covariance matrices. Since the two groups have equal prior probabilities, the pooled covariance matrix is simply the average of the two covariance matrices:\n\nPooled covariance matrix:\n```\n[ (4+9)/2  (0+3)/2 ]\n[ (0+3)/2  (16+16)/2 ]\n```\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n```\n[ 6.5  1.5 ]\n[ 1.5  16 ]\n```\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse of the pooled covariance matrix. Using a matrix inversion calculator or calculating by hand, we get:\n\nInverse of pooled covariance matrix:\n```\n[ 0.12371134 -0.01159794 ]\n[-0.01159794  0.05025773 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can find the linear discriminant function. The linear discriminant function is given by:\n\ng(x) = W^T * x + w_0\n\nWhere W is the weight vector, x is the input vector, and w_0 is the bias term. The weight vector W is given by:\n\nW = Σ^(-1) * (μ1 - μ2)\n\nWhere Σ^(-1) is the inverse of the pooled covariance matrix, and μ1 and μ2 are the means of the two groups. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nW = [ 0.12371134 -0.01159794 ] * ( [3, 5] - [8, 11] )\n   = [ 0.12371134 -0.01159794 ] * [-5, -6]\n\nW = [ 0.6185567, 0.06951872 ]\n\nNow, we need to find the bias term w_0. The bias term is given by:\n\nw_0 = -0.5 * μ1^T * Σ^(-1) * μ1 + 0.5 * μ2^T * Σ^(-1) * μ2\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nw_0 = -0.5 * [3, 5] * [ 0.12371134 -0.01159794 ] * [3, 5]^T + 0.5 * [8, 11] * [ 0.12371134 -0.01159794 ] * [8, 11]^T\n   ≈ -0.5 * 2.06185567 + 0.5 * 9.27835052\n   ≈ -1.03092784 + 4.63917526\n   ≈ 3.60824742\n\nNow we have the linear discriminant function:\n\ng(x) = [ 0.6185567, 0.06951872 ] * x + 3.60824742\n\nTo classify the new observation (6, 8), we plug it into the linear discriminant function:\n\ng([6, 8]) = [ 0.6185567, 0.06951872 ] * [6, 8] + 3.60824742\n          ≈ 3.71134021 + 0.55670103 + 3.60824742\n          ≈ 7.87628866\n\nSince the result is positive, the new observation (6, 8) is classified into the second group."
