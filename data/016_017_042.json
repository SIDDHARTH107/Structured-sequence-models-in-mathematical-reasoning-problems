    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * 2^n\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we have:\n\nLength = 1 * 2^10\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024."
