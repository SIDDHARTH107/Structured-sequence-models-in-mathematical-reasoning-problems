    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Koch curve with the given substitution rule, each segment is divided into 4 equal parts, and the middle two are replaced with equilateral triangles. This results in a curve with 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4) and a scaling factor of 3 (s = 3), as each segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original.\n\nUsing the formula, we have:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve generated by five iterations of the given substitution rule is approximately 1.2619. Note that the number of iterations does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself and not dependent on the level of detail."
