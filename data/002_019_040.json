    "message_1": "A cone has a base radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 13 cm. What is the surface area of the cone? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the area of the lateral surface (a sector of a circle). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = πr² + πrL\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and L is the slant height.\n\nGiven, r = 5 cm and L = 13 cm.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)² + π(5)(13)\nSurface Area = 25π + 65π\nSurface Area = 90π\n\nNow, we'll approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 90 × 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 282.6 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 282.6 cm², rounded to two decimal places."
