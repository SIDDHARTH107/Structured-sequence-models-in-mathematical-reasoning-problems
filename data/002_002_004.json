    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 centimeters, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)³\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV = (500/3)π\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.1416, we get:\n\nV ≈ (500/3) * 3.1416\nV ≈ 1666.4 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 centimeters is approximately 1666.4 cubic centimeters."
