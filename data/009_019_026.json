    "message_2": "To find the expected value of X(3), we will first solve the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) using Ito's formula. Let's define Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Then, we can apply Ito's formula to Y(t):\n\ndY(t) = (1/X(t)) dX(t) - (1/2X(t)^2) (2^2) dt\n\nNow, substitute the given SDE into the equation:\n\ndY(t) = (1/X(t)) (3X(t)dt + 2dW(t)) - 2 dt\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ndY(t) = 3 dt + (2/X(t)) dW(t) - 2 dt\ndY(t) = dt + (2/X(t)) dW(t)\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to t from 0 to 3:\n\n∫(dY(t)) = ∫(dt) + ∫((2/X(t)) dW(t)) from 0 to 3\n\nY(3) - Y(0) = 3 - 0 + ∫((2/X(t)) dW(t)) from 0 to 3\n\nSince Y(t) = ln(X(t)), we have Y(0) = ln(2). Now, we can solve for Y(3):\n\nY(3) = ln(2) + 3 + ∫((2/X(t)) dW(t)) from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we need to find the expected value of X(3). Recall that Y(3) = ln(X(3)). We can use the property of expected values:\n\nE[ln(X(3))] = ln(2) + 3 + E[∫((2/X(t)) dW(t)) from 0 to 3]\n\nSince the expected value of the stochastic integral is zero, we have:\n\nE[ln(X(3))] = ln(2) + 3\n\nNow, we can find the expected value of X(3) by exponentiating both sides:\n\nE[X(3)] = e^(ln(2) + 3)\n\nE[X(3)] = e^3 * e^(ln(2))\n\nE[X(3)] = e^3 * 2\n\nSo, the expected value of X(3) is 2e^3."
