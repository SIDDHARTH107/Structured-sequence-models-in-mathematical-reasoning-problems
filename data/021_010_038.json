Find the local minimum of this function by iterating Newton's method until the absolute error between two successive approximations is less than or equal to 0.001. Use an initial guess of x0 = 1.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5 using Newton's Method, we first need to find the critical points of the function by setting its derivative equal to zero. The derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nNow we apply Newton's Method to find the root of f'(x) = 0. The iteration formula for Newton's Method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nThe second derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf''(x) = 6\n\nNow we can start iterating using the initial guess x0 = 1:\n\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0) = 1 - (6(1) + 4) / 6 = 1 - 10/6 = -1/2\n\nNow we continue iterating until the absolute error between two successive approximations is less than or equal to 0.001:\n\nx2 = x1 - f'(x1) / f''(x1) = -1/2 - (6(-1/2) + 4) / 6 = -1/2 - (-2/6) = -1/3\n\nThe absolute error between x1 and x2 is:\n\n| x2 - x1 | = |-1/3 - (-1/2)| = |1/6| = 1/6 ≈ 0.167\n\nSince the error is still greater than 0.001, we continue iterating:\n\nx3 = x2 - f'(x2) / f''(x2) = -1/3 - (6(-1/3) + 4) / 6 = -1/3 - (-2/6) = -2/3\n\nThe absolute error between x2 and x3 is:\n\n| x3 - x2 | = |-2/3 - (-1/3)| = |1/3| ≈ 0.333\n\nSince the error is still greater than 0.001, we continue iterating:\n\nx4 = x3 - f'(x3) / f''(x3) = -2/3 - (6(-2/3) + 4) / 6 = -2/3 - (-4/6) = -1/3\n\nThe absolute error between x3 and x4 is:\n\n| x4 - x3 | = |-1/3 - (-2/3)| = |1/3| ≈ 0.333\n\nSince the error is still greater than 0.001, we continue iterating:\n\nx5 = x4 - f'(x4) / f''(x4) = -1/3 - (6(-1/3) + 4) / 6 = -1/3 - (-2/6) = -2/3\n\nThe absolute error between x4 and x5 is:\n\n| x5 - x4 | = |-2/3 - (-1/3)| = |1/3| ≈ 0.333\n\nIt seems that the iteration is not converging to the desired precision. However, we can notice that the sequence of approximations is oscillating between -1/3 and -2/3. The root of f'(x) = 0 is actually:\n\nx = -4/6 = -2/3\n\nSo, the local minimum of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5 occurs at x = -2/3."
