    "message_1": "Consider a Morse-Smale complex with 7 critical points on a surface. The index of critical points are as follows: 1 index-0 point, 3 index-1 points, and 3 index-2 points. What is the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a Morse-Smale complex can be computed using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index. In this case, we have:\n\nχ = (# of index-0 points) - (# of index-1 points) + (# of index-2 points)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nχ = (1) - (3) + (3)\n\nχ = 1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex is 1."
