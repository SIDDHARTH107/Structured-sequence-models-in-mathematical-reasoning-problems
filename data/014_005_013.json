    "message_2": "To determine the valid digital signature, we need to use the RSA algorithm. The given public key is (n, e) = (15, 8). We need to find the private key (n, d) to generate the digital signature.\n\n1. Factorize n: n = 15 = 3 * 5, so p = 3 and q = 5.\n2. Compute φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (3-1)(5-1) = 2 * 4 = 8.\n3. Find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)): d ≡ e^(-1) (mod φ(n)) = 8^(-1) (mod 8). However, since 8 and 8 are not coprime, we cannot find a modular inverse for this given public key.\n\nThe given public key (15, 8) is not valid for the RSA algorithm, as the modular inverse cannot be found. Therefore, we cannot determine a valid digital signature from the given options."
