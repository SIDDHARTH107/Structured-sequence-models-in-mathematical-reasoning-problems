    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x on the interval [-3, 1], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 + 2x) = 2x + 2\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x + 2 = 0\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nSo, we have one critical point at x = -1. Now, we need to check the endpoints of the interval and the critical point to find the maximum and minimum values of the function.\n\nf(-3) = (-3)^2 + 2(-3) = 9 - 6 = 3\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1\nf(1) = (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical point and the endpoints, we find that the minimum value is -1 at x = -1, and the maximum value is 3 at both x = -3 and x = 1."
