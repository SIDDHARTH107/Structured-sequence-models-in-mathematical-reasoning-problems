    "message_1": "Suppose two companies, A and B, are the only suppliers of a product in a market. Each company must decide how much quantity of the product to produce. If both companies produce the same quantity, they will split the market share equally. However, if one company produces more, it will gain a larger market share, but will also have to bear higher production costs. The profit earned by each company is directly proportional to its market share. \n\nCompany A has a constant marginal cost of $5 per unit, while company B has a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit. The market demand for the product is given by the equation P = 80-Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both companies. \n\nWhat is the Nash Equilibrium of this Cournot competition, and what is the corresponding profit earned by each company at this equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction functions for both companies. The reaction function shows the best response of one company to the quantity produced by the other company. \n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by companies A and B, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB. The price is given by the demand function P = 80 - Q.\n\nThe profit functions for both companies are:\n\nπA = (P - MC_A) * qA = (80 - Q - 5) * qA = (75 - qA - qB) * qA\nπB = (P - MC_B) * qB = (80 - Q - 10) * qB = (70 - qA - qB) * qB\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to each company's quantity produced. We do this by taking the first-order derivative of the profit functions with respect to qA and qB and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂πA/∂qA = 75 - 2qA - qB = 0\n∂πB/∂qB = 70 - qA - 2qB = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n\n2qA + qB = 75\nqA + 2qB = 70\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find the Nash Equilibrium quantities:\n\nqA = 35\nqB = 17.5\n\nNow we can find the total quantity produced, Q = qA + qB = 35 + 17.5 = 52.5. The market price at this equilibrium is P = 80 - Q = 80 - 52.5 = 27.5.\n\nThe profits for each company at the Nash Equilibrium are:\n\nπA = (27.5 - 5) * 35 = 22.5 * 35 = 787.5\nπB = (27.5 - 10) * 17.5 = 17.5 * 17.5 = 306.25\n\nSo, the Nash Equilibrium of this Cournot competition is (qA, qB) = (35, 17.5), and the corresponding profits are πA = 787.5 and πB = 306.25."
