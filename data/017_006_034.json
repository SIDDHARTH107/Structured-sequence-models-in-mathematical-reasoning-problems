    "message_2": "To find two non-isomorphic groups of order 35, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 35 = 5 * 7, we can look for Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (denoted n_5) and the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (denoted n_7) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom these conditions, we can see that n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 1. Therefore, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup (denoted P_5) and a unique Sylow 7-subgroup (denoted P_7). Since these subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G.\n\nNow, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 35, Z_35. This group is generated by an element of order 35, and its structure is given by:\n\nZ_35 = {0, 1, 2, ..., 34}\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_5 and P_7, which are both cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. The structure of this group is given by:\n\nG ≅ P_5 × P_7 ≅ Z_5 × Z_7\n\nSince P_5 and P_7 are normal in G and their intersection is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), G is the internal direct product of P_5 and P_7.\n\nNow, we need to show that these two groups are non-isomorphic. Suppose, for contradiction, that they are isomorphic. Then there exists an isomorphism φ: Z_35 → Z_5 × Z_7. Let g be a generator of Z_35, so g has order 35. Then φ(g) must have order 35 in Z_5 × Z_7. However, the maximum order of an element in Z_5 × Z_7 is lcm(5, 7) = 35, which is achieved only by the element (1, 1). But φ is a group homomorphism, and φ(g^35) = φ(1) = (0, 0), not (1, 1). This contradiction implies that the two groups are not isomorphic.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found two non-isomorphic groups of order 35: the cyclic group Z_35 and the direct product of two cyclic groups Z_5 × Z_7."
