    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 24: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order: n(G) = (p^(k-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(l-1) * (q-1)), where p and q are distinct prime factors of the order, and k and l are their respective multiplicities.\n\nIn our case, p = 2, k = 3, q = 3, and l = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nn(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1))\nn(G) = (2^2 * 1) * (3^0 * 2)\nn(G) = (4 * 1) * (1 * 2)\nn(G) = 4 * 2\nn(G) = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
