    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\nNumerator: 5x^2 - 10x = 5x(x - 2)\nDenominator: 10x - 20 = 10(x - 2)\n\nNow the expression looks like this:\n\n(5x(x - 2)) / (10(x - 2))\n\nSince (x - 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(5x) / (10)\n\nNow, we can simplify the remaining expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n\n(5x) / (10) = x / 2\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\nx / 2"
