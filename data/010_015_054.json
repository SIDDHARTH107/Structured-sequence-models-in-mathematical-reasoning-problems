    "message_2": "To show that $H^k_{DR}(M)$ and $H^{n-k}_{DR}(M)$ are isomorphic, we will use the Hodge star operator, which is an isomorphism between the spaces of $k$-forms and $(n-k)$-forms on an oriented Riemannian manifold. Let $M$ be equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$. The Hodge star operator is defined as follows:\n\nFor a $k$-form $\\omega$, the $(n-k)$-form $*\\omega$ is given by\n$$(*\\omega)_{i_1 \\dots i_{n-k}} = \\frac{1}{k!} \\sqrt{|\\det g|} \\epsilon_{i_1 \\dots i_{n-k} j_1 \\dots j_k} \\omega^{j_1 \\dots j_k},$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the Levi-Civita symbol and $|\\det g|$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor.\n\nNow, let $d$ be the exterior derivative on $M$. We have the following properties of the Hodge star operator and the exterior derivative:\n\n1. $**\\omega = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\\omega$ for any $k$-form $\\omega$.\n2. $d(*\\omega) = *d\\omega$ for any $k$-form $\\omega$.\n\nUsing these properties, we can define a linear map $P: H^k_{DR}(M) \\to H^{n-k}_{DR}(M)$ by $P([\\omega]) = [*d*\\omega]$, where $[\\omega]$ denotes the cohomology class of $\\omega$. We will show that $P$ is an isomorphism.\n\nFirst, we need to show that $P$ is well-defined. If $[\\omega_1] = [\\omega_2]$, then $\\omega_1 - \\omega_2 = d\\eta$ for some $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$. Then,\n$$*d*\\omega_1 - *d*\\omega_2 = *d(*\\omega_1 - *\\omega_2) = *d(*d\\eta) = *d^2*\\eta = 0,$$\nso $[*d*\\omega_1] = [*d*\\omega_2]$ and $P$ is well-defined.\n\nNext, we show that $P$ is injective. Suppose $P([\\omega]) = 0$, i.e., $*d*\\omega$ is exact. Then there exists a $(n-k-1)$-form $\\eta$ such that $*d*\\omega = d\\eta$. Applying the Hodge star operator and using the properties above, we get\n$$d*\\eta = *d\\omega \\implies d^2*\\eta = d(*d\\omega) = *d^2\\omega = 0.$$\nSince $d*\\eta$ is closed and exact, it is a coboundary. Thus, $[\\omega] = 0$ and $P$ is injective.\n\nFinally, we show that $P$ is surjective. Let $[\\eta]$ be an element of $H^{n-k}_{DR}(M)$. Then $d\\eta = 0$. Applying the Hodge star operator and using the properties above, we get\n$$0 = *0 = *d\\eta = d(*\\eta).$$\nThus, $*\\eta$ is closed. Let $\\omega = *d*\\eta$. Then $d\\omega = d(*d*\\eta) = *d\\eta = 0$, so $\\omega$ is closed. Moreover, $P([\\omega]) = [*d*\\omega] = [\\eta]$. Thus, $P$ is surjective.\n\nSince $P$ is a well-defined, injective, and surjective linear map, it is an isomorphism between $H^k_{DR}(M)$ and $H^{n-k}_{DR}(M)$.\n\nNow, let $M$ be compact. We will show that $H^0_{DR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The $0$-forms on $M$ are just smooth functions, and the exterior derivative of a $0$-form is its gradient. A $0$-form $\\omega$ is closed if and only if $d\\omega = 0$, i.e., its gradient is zero everywhere. This means that $\\omega$ is a constant function. Thus, the space of closed $0$-forms is the space of constant functions, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $M$ is compact, any exact $0$-form must also be constant. To see this, let $\\omega = df$ for some smooth function $f$ on $M$. Then, for any smooth curve $c: [0, 1] \\to M$, we have\n$$\\int_0^1 \\omega(c'(t)) dt = \\int_0^1 df(c'(t)) dt = f(c(1)) - f(c(0)).$$\nSince $M$ is compact, it is also path-connected, so for any two points $p, q \\in M$, there exists a smooth curve $c$ connecting them. Thus, $\\omega$ must be zero everywhere, and so the space of exact $0$-forms is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $H^0_{DR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$."
