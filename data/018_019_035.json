    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A △ B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} - {4, 6, 8} = {2, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and C, which is ((A △ B) △ C).\n\n(A △ B) △ C = ({2, 10} ∪ {6, 8, 10, 12}) - ({2, 10} ∩ {6, 8, 10, 12}) = {2, 6, 8, 12} - {10} = {2, 6, 8, 12}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C (B △ C).\n\nB △ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = {4, 6, 8, 10, 12} - {6, 8, 10} = {4, 12}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B △ C), which is (A △ (B △ C)).\n\nA △ (B △ C) = (A ∪ {4, 12}) - (A ∩ {4, 12}) = {2, 4, 6, 8, 12} - {4} = {2, 6, 8, 12}\n\nWe can see that ((A △ B) △ C) = {2, 6, 8, 12} and (A △ (B △ C)) = {2, 6, 8, 12}. Since both expressions result in the same set, we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative.\n\nTo prove this more formally, let X, Y, and Z be arbitrary sets.
