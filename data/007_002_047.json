    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer value that needs to be added to 6233 to make it divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. The rule states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits at odd positions and the sum of its digits at even positions is divisible by 11.\n\nFor the number 6233:\nSum of digits at odd positions = 6 + 3 = 9\nSum of digits at even positions = 2 + 3 = 5\nDifference = 9 - 5 = 4\n\nSince 4 is not divisible by 11, we need to find the smallest positive integer that, when added to 4, results in a multiple of 11. The smallest multiple of 11 greater than 4 is 11, so we need to add 7 to 4 to get 11.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer value that needs to be added to 6233 to make it divisible by 11 is 7."
