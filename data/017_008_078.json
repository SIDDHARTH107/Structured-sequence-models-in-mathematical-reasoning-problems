If G is isomorphic to one of these groups, provide the isomorphism between G and the corresponding group. If G is not isomorphic to any of these groups, prove why that is the case.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we can examine the properties of these groups and compare them to the properties of G.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to C8. To check this, we can look for an element g in G such that g^8 = e (identity element) and g^k ≠ e for 1 ≤ k < 8. If such an element exists, then G is isomorphic to C8, and the isomorphism can be defined as φ(g^k) = k for 0 ≤ k ≤ 7.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: The quaternion group has the following presentation: Q8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. If G has elements a, b, c, and d such that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e, and ab = c, ba = -c, ac = -b, ca = b, bc = d, and cb = -d, then G is isomorphic to Q8. The isomorphism can be defined as φ(±1) = ±a, φ(±i) = ±b, φ(±j) = ±c, and φ(±k) = ±d.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: The dihedral group of order 8 has the following presentation: D4 = {r, s | r^4 = s^2 = e, srs = r^(-1)}. If G has elements a and b such that a^4 = b^2 = e, and bab = a^(-1), then G is isomorphic to D4. The isomorphism can be defined as φ(r^k * s^l) = a^k * b^l for 0 ≤ k ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ l ≤ 1.\n\nIf G does not satisfy any of the above conditions, then it is not isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4. To prove this, we can show that none of the properties of these groups hold for G. For example, if G has no element of order 8, then it cannot be cyclic. If G does not have elements satisfying the relations of the quaternion group, then it cannot be isomorphic to Q8. Similarly, if G does not have elements satisfying the relations of the dihedral group, then it cannot be isomorphic to D4."
