    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 9, and 11, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. \n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of each number:\n7 = 7^1\n9 = 3^2\n11 = 11^1\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\nLCM = 7^1 * 3^2 * 11^1 = 7 * 9 * 11 = 63 * 11 = 693\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 9, and 11 is 693."
