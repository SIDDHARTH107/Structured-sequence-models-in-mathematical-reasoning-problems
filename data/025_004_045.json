    "message_2": "To find the tangent line to the curve at the point $(2, \\sqrt{4})$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. We can do this using implicit differentiation.\n\nGiven the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x$, differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 4x)$$\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n$$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 4$$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point $(2, \\sqrt{4})$. Plug in the coordinates of the point into the equation:\n\n$$2(\\sqrt{4})\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(2)^2 - 4$$\n\nSolve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n\n$$4\\frac{dy}{dx} = 8$$\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2$$\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$\n\nPlug in the coordinates of the point $(2, \\sqrt{4})$ and the slope $m = 2$:\n\n$$y - \\sqrt{4} = 2(x - 2)$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$y - 2 = 2x - 4$$\n\n$$y = 2x - 2$$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(2, \\sqrt{4})$ is $y = 2x - 2$."
