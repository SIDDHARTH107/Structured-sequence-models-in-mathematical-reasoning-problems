    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a presidential candidate winning a popular election, we need to consider both the incumbent party and the challenger party. Since there are only two parties in this scenario, the sum of their winning probabilities should equal 100%.\n\nLet P(I) be the probability of the incumbent party winning, and P(C) be the probability of the challenger party winning. We are given:\n\nP(I) = 0.62 (62% winning rate for the incumbent party)\nP(C) = 0.45 (45% winning rate for challengers)\n\nHowever, these probabilities do not add up to 1 (100%). To make them add up to 1, we can normalize them by dividing each probability by the sum of both probabilities:\n\nNormalized P(I) = P(I) / (P(I) + P(C)) = 0.62 / (0.62 + 0.45) ≈ 0.5794\nNormalized P(C) = P(C) / (P(I) + P(C)) = 0.45 / (0.62 + 0.45) ≈ 0.4206\n\nNow, the sum of the normalized probabilities is 1 (100%):\n\nNormalized P(I) + Normalized P(C) = 0.5794 + 0.4206 = 1\n\nSo, the probability of a presidential candidate winning a popular election in this particular country is:\n\n- Approximately 57.94% for a candidate from the incumbent party\n- Approximately 42.06% for a challenger candidate"
