    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color its edges, i.e., no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 22 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 22 = 44. The maximum possible degree for a vertex in a graph with 9 vertices is 8 (connected to all other vertices). Let's check if it's possible for a vertex to have a degree of 8.\n\nIf there is a vertex with a degree of 8, the remaining 8 vertices have a total degree of 44 - 8 = 36. The maximum degree for the remaining vertices is 7 (connected to all other vertices except the one with degree 8). However, we can't have all 8 vertices with a degree of 7, as that would result in a total degree of 8 * 7 = 56, which is greater than 36. Therefore, the maximum degree of G is at most 7.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\n1. Δ(G) = 7: In this case, by Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) is either Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1, i.e., either 7 or 8. Since there are 22 edges, it's possible to have a 7-regular graph with 9 vertices (each vertex has a degree of 7, and the total degree is 2 * 22 = 44). In this case, χ'(G) = 7.\n\n2. Δ(G) < 7: If the maximum degree is less than 7, then by Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) is at most Δ(G). However, we know that a 7-regular graph with 9 vertices and 22 edges is possible, so the chromatic index must be at least 7.\n\nCombining both cases, we conclude that the chromatic index of G is χ'(G) = 7."
