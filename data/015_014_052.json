Assuming that the temperature increase follows a logistic function with a growth rate of 0.05, what will be the temperature of the weather system after 24 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the logistic function formula:\n\nT(t) = K / (1 + (K - T0) / T0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere:\nT(t) is the temperature at time t\nK is the carrying capacity (maximum temperature)\nT0 is the initial temperature\nr is the growth rate\nt is the time in hours\n\nWe are given:\nT0 = 10°C (initial temperature)\nT(6) = 15°C (temperature after 6 hours)\nr = 0.05 (growth rate)\nt = 24 hours (time we want to find the temperature for)\n\nFirst, we need to find the carrying capacity (K). We can do this by plugging in the values for T(6), T0, r, and t=6 into the logistic function formula:\n\n15 = K / (1 + (K - 10) / 10 * e^(-0.05*6))\n\nNow, we need to solve for K:\n\n15 = K / (1 + (K - 10) / 10 * e^(-0.3))\n15 * (1 + (K - 10) / 10 * e^(-0.3)) = K\n15 + 15 * (K - 10) / 10 * e^(-0.3) = K\n15 + 1.5 * (K - 10) * e^(-0.3) = K\n\nLet x = e^(-0.3), then:\n\n15 + 1.5 * (K - 10) * x = K\n15 + 1.5 * K * x - 15 * x = K\n15 * x = K - 1.5 * K * x\n15 * x = K * (1 - 1.5 * x)\n\nNow, we can solve for K:\n\nK = 15 * x / (1 - 1.5 * x)\n\nPlugging in the value of x:\n\nK = 15 * e^(-0.3) / (1 - 1.5 * e^(-0.3))\n\nK ≈ 20.97°C (approximately)\n\nNow that we have the carrying capacity (K), we can find the temperature after 24 hours (T(24)) using the logistic function formula:\n\nT(24) = 20.97 / (1 + (20.97 - 10) / 10 * e^(-0.05*24))\n\nT(24) ≈ 20.57°C (approximately)\n\nSo, the temperature of the weather system after 24 hours will be approximately 20.57°C."
