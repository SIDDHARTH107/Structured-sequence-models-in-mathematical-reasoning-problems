    "message_2": "Given that the order of the elliptic curve E is 31, and E is defined over the finite field Fp with p = 11, we can use Hasse's theorem to find the number of rational points on E(Fp).\n\nHasse's theorem states that for an elliptic curve E defined over a finite field Fp, the number of rational points N satisfies the following inequality:\n\n|N - (p + 1)| ≤ 2√p\n\nIn our case, p = 11, so the inequality becomes:\n\n|N - 12| ≤ 2√11\n\nNow, we know that the order of E is 31, which means that there are 31 points in total, including the point at infinity. Therefore, the number of rational points on E(Fp) is:\n\nN = 31 - 1 (subtracting the point at infinity)\nN = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 rational points on the elliptic curve E(Fp)."
