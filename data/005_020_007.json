We can do this by generating random points within a square with side length of 2 units, and determining what fraction of those points lie within the inscribed circle (with radius 1 unit). If we repeat this process many times, the estimated value of pi will converge to the true value. \n\nSo, the question for the math student is: Using Monte Carlo simulation, generate 10,000 random (x,y) coordinates within a square with side length of 2 units. Determine how many of these points lie within the inscribed circle (with radius 1 unit). Based on this fraction, provide an estimate for the value of pi.",

The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is equal to the ratio of the number of points inside the circle to the total number of points.\n\nArea of the square = side^2 = 2^2 = 4 square units\nArea of the circle = pi * radius^2 = pi * 1^2 = pi square units\n\nLet's generate 10,000 random (x, y) coordinates within the square and count the number of points that lie within the inscribed circle.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ntotal_points = 10000\npoints_inside_circle = 0\n\nfor _ in range(total_points):\n    x = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n    y = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n    \n    distance_from_origin = x**2 + y**2\n    \n    if distance_from_origin <= 1:\n        points_inside_circle += 1\n```\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points and use that to estimate the value of pi.\n\nRatio = (points inside circle) / (total points)\npi = 4 * Ratio\n\n```python\nratio = points_inside_circle / total_points\nestimated_pi = 4 * ratio\n```\n\nThis will give us an estimate for the value of pi based on the Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 random (x, y) coordinates."
