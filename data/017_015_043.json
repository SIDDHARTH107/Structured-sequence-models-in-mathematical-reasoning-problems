Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups: \n\n   For 2^3, there are three possibilities: 2^3, 2^2 * 2, and 2 * 2 * 2.\n   For 3^1, there is only one possibility: 3.\n   Combining these possibilities, we have the following abelian groups: (2^3, 3), (2^2 * 2, 3), and (2 * 2 * 2, 3).\n\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups:\n\n   We can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^aq^b: n(p^aq^b) = (n(p^a) * n(q^b)) / gcd(p^a - 1, q^b - 1)\n   In our case, p = 2, a = 3, q = 3, and b = 1.\n   n(2^3) = 5 (from Sylow's Theorem)\n   n(3^1) = 1 (trivial)\n   gcd(2^3 - 1, 3^1 - 1) = gcd(7, 2) = 1\n\n   So, n(2^3 * 3^1) = (5 * 1) / 1 = 5\n\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups:\n\n   Total non-isomorphic groups of order 24 = Total groups - Abelian groups = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nTherefore, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
