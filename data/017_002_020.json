    "message_2": "A cyclic group of order 15 has subgroups of orders 1, 3, 5, and 15. We can find the generators for each of these subgroups by raising the generator g of G to the appropriate power.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: This subgroup contains only the identity element. The generator is g^15 = e, where e is the identity element.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 3: To find a generator for this subgroup, we need to raise g to a power that divides 15 but is not equal to 15. The smallest such power is 5 (since 15/3 = 5). The generator for this subgroup is g^5.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 5: Similarly, to find a generator for this subgroup, we need to raise g to a power that divides 15 but is not equal to 15. The smallest such power is 3 (since 15/5 = 3). The generator for this subgroup is g^3.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 15: This is the entire group G itself, and its generator is g.\n\nIn summary, the generators for the subgroups of G are:\n- Order 1: g^15 = e\n- Order 3: g^5\n- Order 5: g^3\n- Order 15: g"
