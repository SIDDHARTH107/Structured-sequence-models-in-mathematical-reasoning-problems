    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition a set of 5 distinct elements, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of different ways to partition a set with n elements.\n\nFor a set with 5 distinct elements, we are looking for B(5). The Bell numbers can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(n+1) = Î£[k=0 to n] C(n, k) * B(k)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the first few Bell numbers:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\n\nNow, we can calculate B(5):\n\nB(5) = C(4, 0) * B(0) + C(4, 1) * B(1) + C(4, 2) * B(2) + C(4, 3) * B(3) + C(4, 4) * B(4)\nB(5) = 1 * 1 + 4 * 1 + 6 * 2 + 4 * 5 + 1 * 15\nB(5) = 1 + 4 + 12 + 20 + 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct elements."
