    "message_2": "To solve the cubic equation 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, 2) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 2).\n\nThe factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±1/2.\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n2(1)^3 - 7(1)^2 + 3(1) + 2 = 2 - 7 + 3 + 2 = 0\nSo, x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow that we have found one root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n1 |  2  -7   3   2\n  |     2  -5  -2\n  ----------------\n      2  -5  -2   0\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is 2x^2 - 5x - 2. Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -2:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)^2 - 4(2)(-2))) / (2(2))\nx = (5 ± √(25 + 16)) / 4\nx = (5 ± √41) / 4\n\nSo, the three roots of the cubic equation are x = 1, x = (5 + √41) / 4, and x = (5 - √41) / 4."
