    "message_2": "A simple connected graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges is not a tree, since a tree with 7 vertices would have 6 edges (n-1 edges for a tree with n vertices). Therefore, there must be at least one cycle in the graph.\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nLet's use the following properties to determine the number of cut vertices and bridges:\n\n1. A vertex of degree 1 (a leaf) cannot be a cut vertex, since its removal will not disconnect the graph.\n2. A vertex of degree 2 in a cycle cannot be a cut vertex, since its removal will not disconnect the graph.\n3. A vertex of degree 3 or more can be a cut vertex if its removal disconnects the graph.\n4. An edge in a cycle cannot be a bridge, since its removal will not disconnect the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the graph G:\n\nSince G has 9 edges and 7 vertices, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 9) / 7 â‰ˆ 2.57. This means that there must be some vertices with a degree of at least 3.\n\nLet's assume there is one vertex with a degree of 4, and the remaining vertices have a degree of 2. In this case, the graph would have a cycle, and the vertex with a degree of 4 would be a cut vertex. The graph would look like this:\n\n```\n   1---2\n   |   |\n   7---3---4\n       |\n       5\n       |\n       6\n```\n\nIn this graph, vertex 3 is a cut vertex, and there are no bridges, since all edges are part of a cycle.\n\nHowever, if there are two vertices with a degree of 3, the graph would look like this:\n\n```\n   1---2\n   |   |\n   7---3---4\n       |\n       5---6\n```\n\nIn this graph, vertex 3 is still a cut vertex, and edge (5, 6) is a bridge.\n\nIn conclusion, there is at least 1 cut vertex in the graph G, and there can be 0 or 1 bridge, depending on the specific configuration of the graph."
