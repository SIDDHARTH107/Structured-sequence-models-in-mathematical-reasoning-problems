    "message_2": "The total probability of all possible outcomes (in this case, the stock price increasing or decreasing) must equal 1. If the probability of the stock price increasing is 0.60, then the probability of the stock price decreasing can be found by subtracting the probability of the stock price increasing from 1:\n\nProbability of stock price decreasing = 1 - Probability of stock price increasing\nProbability of stock price decreasing = 1 - 0.60\nProbability of stock price decreasing = 0.40\n\nSo, the probability of the stock price decreasing is 0.40 or 40%."
