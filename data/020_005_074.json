    "message_1": "A company wants to transport 1200 boxes with a maximum capacity of 50 kg per truck. They have 2 types of trucks available: Truck A which has a capacity of 75 boxes and can carry up to 3500 kg, and Truck B which has a capacity of 50 boxes and can carry up to 2500 kg. The transportation fees for Truck A and Truck B are $1500 and $1000 per trip, respectively. The company wants to use the minimum number of trucks while fulfilling their transport needs. How many trips of each type of truck should the company use to minimize transportation costs?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of trips made by Truck A and y be the number of trips made by Truck B. We need to minimize the transportation cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 1500x + 1000y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. The total number of boxes transported should be at least 1200:\n75x + 50y >= 1200\n\n2. The total weight capacity of the trucks should be sufficient for the boxes:\n3500x + 2500y >= 50 * 1200 (since each box weighs 50 kg)\n\nNow we need to find the values of x and y that minimize the cost function while satisfying the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the weight constraint:\n3500x + 2500y >= 60000\n7x + 5y >= 1200\n\nNow, we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and the optimal solution. We can start by finding the intersection points of the constraints:\n\n1. When x = 0:\n50y >= 1200\ny >= 24\n\n2. When y = 0:\n75x >= 1200\nx >= 16\n\n3. Intersection of 75x + 50y >= 1200 and 7x + 5y >= 1200:\n75x + 50y = 1200\n7x + 5y = 1200\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n68x = 400\nx = 400/68 ≈ 5.88\ny = (1200 - 75 * 5.88) / 50 ≈ 10.35\n\nSince x and y must be integers, we can round up the values to the nearest integers that satisfy the constraints. In this case, we can round up x to 6 and y to 11. This gives us:\n\n75 * 6 + 50 * 11 = 1200 (satisfying the box constraint)\n7 * 6 + 5 * 11 = 1210 >= 1200 (satisfying the weight constraint)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost for this solution:\nCost = 1500 * 6 + 1000 * 11 = $21,000\n\nTherefore, the company should use 6 trips of Truck A and 11 trips of Truck B to minimize the transportation cost, which will be $21,000."
