    "message_1": "A student is trying to find the length of a side in an equilateral triangle with a perimeter of 48 cm. What is the length, in centimeters, of one side of the equilateral triangle?",
    "message_2": "An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of one side, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nLength of one side = Perimeter / Number of sides\nLength of one side = 48 cm / 3\nLength of one side = 16 cm\n\nThe length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 16 cm."
