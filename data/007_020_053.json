Also, find the private key d, such that d is the modular multiplicative inverse of the encryption exponent e, where e = 11.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the modulus n, where n = pq.\n\nn = p * q = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nNow, we need to find the totient of n, denoted as φ(n). Since p and q are prime numbers, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = (5 - 1)(7 - 1) = 4 * 6 = 24\n\nNext, we are given the encryption exponent e = 11. To encrypt the plaintext M = 10 using the RSA encryption algorithm, we compute the ciphertext C using the formula:\n\nC = M^e mod n = 10^11 mod 35\n\nC = 100000000000 mod 35 = 15\n\nSo, the encrypted ciphertext C is 15.\n\nNow, we need to find the private key d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod φ(n)). In other words, we need to find a number d such that:\n\nd * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\nd * 11 ≡ 1 (mod 24)\n\nTo find d, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, for simplicity, we can just try different values of d until we find one that satisfies the equation:\n\nd = 1: 1 * 11 ≡ 11 (mod 24)\nd = 2: 2 * 11 ≡ 22 (mod 24)\nd = 3: 3 * 11 ≡ 33 ≡ 9 (mod 24)\n...\nd = 11: 11 * 11 ≡ 121 ≡ 1 (mod 24)\n\nSo, the private key d is 11."
