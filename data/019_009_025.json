    "message_2": "To prove that ¬¬(p→p) is not provable intuitionistically, we can use the fact that intuitionistic logic is sound with respect to the Kripke semantics. In Kripke semantics, a formula is true at a world in a Kripke model if it can be forced in that world. A formula is provable intuitionistically if and only if it is true at every world in every Kripke model.\n\nConsider a Kripke model M with two worlds w1 and w2, where w1 is a predecessor of w2 (i.e., w1 < w2). Let's define the forcing relation ⊩ as follows:\n\n1. w1 ⊩ ¬p\n2. w2 ⊩ p\n\nNow, let's analyze the formula ¬¬(p→p) in this model:\n\n1. In world w1, since w1 ⊩ ¬p, we have w1 ⊮ p. Therefore, w1 ⊮ p→p. However, w1 ⊩ ¬(p→p) does not hold, because there is a world w2 (a successor of w1) where w2 ⊩ p→p. Hence, w1 ⊮ ¬¬(p→p).\n\n2. In world w2, since w2 ⊩ p, we have w2 ⊩ p→p. Therefore, w2 ⊩ ¬¬(p→p).\n\nSince ¬¬(p→p) is not true at every world in the Kripke model M (specifically, it is not true in world w1), it is not provable intuitionistically."
