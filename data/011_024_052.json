What is the maximum flow that can be sent from city A to city D? \n\nA --- (8) --- B --- (6) --- D \n |                   |  \n(5)                (3) \n |                   |  \n C --- (9) --- D",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from city A to city D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will look for augmenting paths and update the capacities of the roads accordingly.\n\n1. First, we can send 6 units of flow through the path A -> B -> D. The capacities of the roads will be updated as follows:\n\nA -- (2) -- B -- (0) -- D\n |                |\n(5)              (3)\n |                |\n C -- (9) -- D\n\n2. Next, we can send 2 units of flow through the path A -> B -> C -> D. The capacities of the roads will be updated as follows:\n\nA -- (0) -- B -- (0) -- D\n |                |\n(3)              (5)\n |                |\n C -- (7) -- D\n\n3. Finally, we can send 3 units of flow through the path A -> C -> D. The capacities of the roads will be updated as follows:\n\nA -- (0) -- B -- (0) -- D\n |                |\n(0)              (5)\n |                |\n C -- (4) -- D\n\nNow, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. The maximum flow from city A to city D is the sum of the flows we sent through the paths, which is 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 units."
