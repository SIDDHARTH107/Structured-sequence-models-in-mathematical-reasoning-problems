    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide the order of the group, and n_p â‰¡ 1 (mod p) for p = 2, 5.\n\nFor n_2, the possible divisors of 40 that are congruent to 1 mod 2 are 1 and 5. For n_5, the possible divisors of 40 that are congruent to 1 mod 5 are 1 and 8.\n\nNow let's consider the structure of the Sylow 2-subgroup. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which must be normal in G. The possible structures for a group of order 8 are Z_8 (cyclic) and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 (elementary abelian). If n_2 = 5, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and each has 7 elements of order 2 (since the identity element is not of order 2). In this case, there are 5 * 7 = 35 elements of order 2 in G.\n\nFor the Sylow 5-subgroup, if n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which must be normal in G. This subgroup is cyclic, isomorphic to Z_5, and has 4 elements of order 5. If n_5 = 8, then there are 8 Sylow 5-subgroups, and each has 4 elements of order 5. In this case, there are 8 * 4 = 32 elements of order 5 in G.\n\nNow we can classify the groups of order 40 up to isomorphism based on this information:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. G is the direct product of P_2 and P_5, so G is isomorphic to either Z_8 x Z_5 (cyclic) or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_5 (elementary abelian).\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 8, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8, but no normal Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since there are only two possible actions of P_5 on P_2 (trivial and nontrivial), there are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: Z_8 x Z_5 (cyclic) and a nonabelian group of order 40.\n\n3. If n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1, then G has no normal Sylow 2-subgroup but has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. In this case, G is a semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and P_5. However, this case is not possible because it would require 35 elements of order 2 and 4 elements of order 5, which would sum to 39 elements, leaving no room for the identity element.\n\nIn conclusion, there are four groups of order 40 up to isomorphism: Z_40 (cyclic), Z_8 x Z_5 (cyclic), Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_5 (elementary abelian), and a nonabelian group of order 40."
