    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinants. Let's denote the main determinant as D, the determinant for x as Dx, and the determinant for y as Dy.\n\nThe main determinant D is calculated using the coefficients of x and y in the given equations:\n\nD = | 2  3 |\n      | 4 -5 |\n\nD = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4)\nD = -10 - 12\nD = -22\n\nNow, let's find the determinant Dx by replacing the coefficients of x in the main determinant with the constants on the right side of the equations:\n\nDx = |  7  3 |\n         | -8 -5 |\n\nDx = (7 * -5) - (3 * -8)\nDx = -35 + 24\nDx = -11\n\nNext, we find the determinant Dy by replacing the coefficients of y in the main determinant with the constants on the right side of the equations:\n\nDy = | 2  7 |\n         | 4 -8 |\n\nDy = (2 * -8) - (7 * 4)\nDy = -16 - 28\nDy = -44\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = Dx / D\nx = -11 / -22\nx = 1/2\n\ny = Dy / D\ny = -44 / -22\ny = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1/2 and y = 2."
