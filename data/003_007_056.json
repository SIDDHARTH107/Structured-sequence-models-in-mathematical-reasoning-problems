    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C respectively. In this case, we have:\n\na = 4\nb = 6\nc = 8\n\nWe want to find the smallest angle, which will be the angle opposite to the shortest side (a). So, we want to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for cos(A):\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2bc)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ncos(A) = (6^2 + 8^2 - 4^2) / (2 * 6 * 8)\ncos(A) = (36 + 64 - 16) / 96\ncos(A) = 84 / 96\ncos(A) = 7 / 8\n\nNow, we need to find the angle A using the inverse cosine function:\n\nA = arccos(7/8)\n\nA ≈ 28.955°\n\nSo, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 28.955°."
