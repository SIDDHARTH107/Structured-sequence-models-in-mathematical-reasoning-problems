    "message_2": "Since P and Q are points on the abelian variety A(F) and P + Q = 0, we have that Q = -P. Now, let's find the order of Q.\n\nThe order of a point R on an abelian variety is the smallest positive integer m such that mR = 0. In our case, we want to find the smallest positive integer k such that kQ = 0.\n\nSince Q = -P, we have kQ = k(-P) = -kP. We know that nP = 0, as the order of P is n. Now, we want to find the smallest positive integer k such that -kP = nP.\n\nNotice that if k = n, then -kP = -nP, and since the characteristic of the field F is not equal to 2, we have -1 ≠ 1 in F. Therefore, -nP ≠ nP, and we have -kP = nP = 0.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer k that satisfies this condition is k = n. Hence, the order of Q is also n."
