    "message_1": "A train leaves station A at 9:00 AM and travels to station B at a speed of 60 km/hr. At 10:00 AM, another train leaves station B and travels to station A at a speed of 75 km/hr. If the stations are 450 km apart, at what time do the two trains pass each other? Use temporal logic to solve.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the time it takes for the two trains to pass each other as t hours. We know that the first train has a 1-hour head start since it leaves at 9:00 AM and the second train leaves at 10:00 AM. \n\nThe distance covered by the first train in t hours is 60(t + 1) km (since it has a 1-hour head start). The distance covered by the second train in t hours is 75t km. When the two trains pass each other, the sum of the distances covered by both trains will be equal to the total distance between the stations, which is 450 km.\n\nUsing this information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n60(t + 1) + 75t = 450\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\n60t + 60 + 75t = 450\n135t + 60 = 450\n135t = 390\nt = 390 / 135\nt = 2.8889 hours (approximately)\n\nSince the second train leaves at 10:00 AM, the two trains will pass each other at approximately:\n\n10:00 AM + 2.8889 hours = 12:53 PM (approximately)\n\nSo, the two trains will pass each other at approximately 12:53 PM."
