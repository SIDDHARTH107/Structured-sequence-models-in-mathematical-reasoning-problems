    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to bring the matrix to its row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nLet's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Add the first row to the second row to eliminate the -1 in the second row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n2. Subtract 2 times the first row from the fourth row to eliminate the 2 in the fourth row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are 2 non-zero rows. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is 2."
