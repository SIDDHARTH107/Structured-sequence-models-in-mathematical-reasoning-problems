    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling 120 km from point A to point B in 2 hours. We can represent the position of the car as a function of time, s(t), where s(t) is the position of the car at time t.\n\nThe average speed of the car during the journey can be calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nAverage speed = 120 km / 2 hours\nAverage speed = 60 km/h\n\nNow, we want to find a point in time during the journey when the car's instantaneous speed is equal to the average speed. According to the Mean Value Theorem, there must exist at least one point c in the time interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function s'(c) is equal to the average speed:\n\ns'(c) = 60 km/h\n\nSince s'(t) represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time t, this means that there exists at least one point in time c during the journey when the car's instantaneous speed is equal to the average speed of 60 km/h."
