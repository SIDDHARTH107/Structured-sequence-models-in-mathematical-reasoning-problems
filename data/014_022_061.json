Decrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix.\n\nStep 1: Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix\n\nThe keyword \"MATHS\" is used to create the matrix. We remove any duplicate letters from the keyword and fill in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" since \"I\" and \"J\" are combined in the Playfair cipher).\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nStep 2: Break the ciphertext into digraphs\n\nQP TE FD UF MN FK YF EM\n\nStep 3: Decrypt each digraph using the Playfair matrix\n\nFor each digraph, we follow these rules:\n\n- If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n- If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n- If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nQP -> HE\nTE -> LL\nFD -> O\nUF -> W\nMN -> O\nFK -> R\nYF -> L\nEM -> D\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is: HELLO WORLD"
