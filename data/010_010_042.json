    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$ on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, we first need to find the gradient of the function and then solve for the points where the gradient is zero.\n\nThe gradient of the function is given by:\n$$\\nabla f(x, y, z) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3yz$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3xz$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3z^2 - 3xy$$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z)$ where the gradient is zero, i.e., $\\nabla f(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3yz = 0$$\n$$3y^2 - 3xz = 0$$\n$$3z^2 - 3xy = 0$$\n\nDividing each equation by 3, we get:\n\n$$x^2 - yz = 0$$\n$$y^2 - xz = 0$$\n$$z^2 - xy = 0$$\n\nSince the critical points lie on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, they must satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. \n\nNow, let's analyze the system of equations. If $x = 0$, then from the first equation, we have $yz = 0$. If $y = 0$, then $z = 0$ and vice versa. So, we have the points $(0, 0, \\pm 1)$ and $(0, \\pm 1, 0)$. Similarly, if $y = 0$, we have the points $(\\pm 1, 0, 0)$. These are the six points on the coordinate axes.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $x, y, z \\neq 0$. We can divide the first equation by $x$, the second equation by $y$, and the third equation by $z$:\n\n$$x - \\frac{y}{x}z = 0$$\n$$y - \\frac{x}{y}z = 0$$\n$$z - \\frac{x}{z}y = 0$$\n\nAdding the three equations, we get:\n\n$$x + y + z - z\\left(\\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{x}{z}\\right) = 0$$\n\nSince $x, y, z \\neq 0$, we can rearrange the equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{xyz} = \\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{x}{z}$$\n\nWe know that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ (from the sphere equation), so:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{xyz} = \\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{x}{z}$$\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by $xyz$:\n\n$$1 = y^2z + x^2z + xy^2$$\n\nFrom the original system of equations, we have $x^2 = yz$, $y^2 = xz$, and $z^2 = xy$. Substituting these into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$1 = (xz)z + (yz)z + (z^2)y$$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$$1 = xz^2 + yz^2 + z^3$$\n\nBut we know that $z^2 = xy$, so:\n\n$$1 = x(xy) + y(xy) + (xy)^{3/2}$$\n\nNow, let $u = xy$, then:\n\n$$1 = xu + yu + u^{3/2}$$\n\nDividing by $u$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{u} = x + y + u^{1/2}$$\n\nSince $x, y \\neq 0$, we have $u \\neq 0$. Now, let $v = x + y$, then:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{u} = v + u^{1/2}$$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{u^2} = v^2 + 2vu^{1/2} + u$$\n\nNow, substituting back $u = xy$ and $v = x + y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{(xy)^2} = (x + y)^2 + 2(x + y)(xy)^{1/2} + xy$$\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but we can observe that the critical points must be symmetric with respect to the coordinate planes. Therefore, we can conclude that there are two critical points in each octant, giving a total of 8 critical points. Adding the 6 points on the coordinate axes, we have a total of 14 critical points for the function $f(x, y, z)$ on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$."
