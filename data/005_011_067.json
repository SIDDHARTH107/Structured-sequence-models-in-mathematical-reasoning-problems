The store decides to conduct an experiment by randomly selecting 25 watermelons and weighing them. The weights in pounds are as follows:\n\n 10.5, 12.3, 11.8, 13.2, 11.5, 12.1, 14.5, 12.8, 12.6, 13.8, 11.9, 14.2, 13.4, 10.9, 12.4, 15.1, 13.7, 11.3, 12.7, 13.1, 11.6, 12.0, 14.2, 12.9, 13.3\n\nWhat is the sample mean weight of a watermelon from this supplier?",
    "message_2": "To find the sample mean weight of a watermelon from this supplier, we need to add up the weights of all the watermelons and then divide by the total number of watermelons.\n\nMean = (Sum of weights) / (Number of watermelons)\n\nMean = (10.5 + 12.3 + 11.8 + 13.2 + 11.5 + 12.1 + 14.5 + 12.8 + 12.6 + 13.8 + 11.9 + 14.2 + 13.4 + 10.9 + 12.4 + 15.1 + 13.7 + 11.3 + 12.7 + 13.1 + 11.6 + 12.0 + 14.2 + 12.9 + 13.3) / 25\n\nMean = (325.7) / 25\n\nMean = 13.028\n\nThe sample mean weight of a watermelon from this supplier is approximately 13.03 pounds."
