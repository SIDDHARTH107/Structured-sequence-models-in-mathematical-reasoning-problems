    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\nAntiderivative of 3x^2:\nn = 2\n(3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\nAntiderivative of 5x:\nn = 1\n(5x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (5x^2)/2 = (5/2)x^2\n\nAntiderivative of -2:\nn = 0\n(-2x^(0+1))/(0+1) = -2x\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + (5/2)x^2 - 2x + C"
