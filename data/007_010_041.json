    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. First, let's find the product of the moduli:\n\nM = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105\n\nNow, we'll compute the partial products:\n\nM1 = M/3 = 105/3 = 35\nM2 = M/5 = 105/5 = 21\nM3 = M/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 ≡ M1^(-1) (mod 3) => 35y1 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\ny2 ≡ M2^(-1) (mod 5) => 21y2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\ny3 ≡ M3^(-1) (mod 7) => 15y3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSolving these congruences, we get:\n\ny1 = 2 (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\ny2 = 1 (since 21 * 1 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny3 = 1 (since 15 * 1 = 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nNow, we can find the solution for x:\n\nx = (2 * 35 * 2) + (4 * 21 * 1) + (3 * 15 * 1)\nx = 140 + 84 + 45\nx = 269\n\nHowever, since x should be within the range of the product of the moduli (0 < x < 105), we need to find the smallest positive integer solution:\n\nx = 269 % 105 = 59\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer solution for x is 59."
