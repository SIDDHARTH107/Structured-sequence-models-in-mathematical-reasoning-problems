    "message_2": "The approximate value of the Feigenbaum constant in the logistic map is 4.6692. This constant is a fundamental number in the study of chaotic systems and is named after the mathematician Mitchell Feigenbaum. It describes the ratio of the parameter intervals between successive bifurcations in the logistic map, which is a mathematical model for population growth and other dynamical systems."
