    "message_2": "Let's use the following symbols to represent the statements:\n\nR: It is raining outside.\nW: The ground is wet.\nF: The flowers are blooming.\n\nThe given statements can be represented as:\n\n1. R → W (If it is raining outside, then the ground is wet.)\n2. W → F (If the ground is wet, then the flowers will bloom.)\n3. ¬R (It is not raining outside.)\n\nWe are asked to determine if the flowers are blooming (F).\n\nFrom statement 1 and 3, we have R → W and ¬R. However, we cannot conclude anything about W from these statements alone. It is possible that the ground is wet due to other reasons, such as someone watering the plants or a broken pipe.\n\nSince we cannot determine the truth value of W, we cannot determine the truth value of F using statement 2 (W → F).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nc) Cannot be determined"
