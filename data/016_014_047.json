    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, it is constructed by replacing each line segment with two segments, each 1/sqrt(2) times the length of the original segment. Therefore, the scaling factor s is sqrt(2), and the number of self-similar pieces N is 2.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Lévy C curve is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(sqrt(2))\n\nD ≈ 2\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 2."
