    "message_2": "To find the steady-state solution, we set $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = 0$. This gives us the following ordinary differential equation:\n\n$0 = 0.05\\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2} + u - 3u^2$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2} = \\frac{1}{0.05}(3u^2 - u)$\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: $v = \\frac{du}{dx}$. Then, $\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{1}{0.05}(3u^2 - u)$. This is a first-order differential equation in $v$ and $u$. We can rewrite it as:\n\n$\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{1}{0.05}(3u^2 - u)\\frac{1}{v}$\n\nNow, we can separate variables and integrate:\n\n$\\int v dv = \\int \\frac{1}{0.05}(3u^2 - u) du$\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}v^2 = \\frac{1}{0.05}\\left(u^3 - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\right) + C_1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $v$:\n\n$v = \\frac{du}{dx} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{0.05}\\left(u^3 - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\right) + 2C_1}$\n\nNow, we need to find the constant $C_1$ using the boundary conditions. At $x = 0$, $u = 1$:\n\n$0 = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{0.05}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 2C_1}$\n\nSolving for $C_1$, we get $C_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$v = \\frac{du}{dx} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{0.05}\\left(u^3 - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\right) - 1}$\n\nWe can integrate this equation again to find $u(x)$, but it's a non-elementary integral, so we'll need to use numerical methods to find the solution. \n\nUsing the boundary condition $u(L) = 0$, we can find the value of $x$ at which $u(x) = 0$:\n\n$0 = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{0.05}\\left(0 - \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2\\right) - 1}$\n\nThis gives us $L \\approx 1.63$.\n\nNow, we can use numerical methods to find the concentration of the chemical substance for $x = 0.5L$. Using a numerical solver, we find that $u(0.5L) \\approx 0.39$.\n\nSo, the concentration of the chemical substance at $x = 0.5L$ is approximately $0.39$."
