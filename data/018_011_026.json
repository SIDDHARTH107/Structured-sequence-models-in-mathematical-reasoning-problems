    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which is denoted as A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets contains all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {4, 5}\n\nThere are no common elements between A and B, so the intersection is an empty set:\n\nA ∩ B = {}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of the intersection (A ∩ B) and set C, denoted as (A ∩ B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nC = {6, 7}\n\nHowever, since the intersection (A ∩ B) is an empty set, there will be no ordered pairs formed with elements from the empty set and set C. Therefore, the Cartesian product (A ∩ B) x C is also an empty set:\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {}"
