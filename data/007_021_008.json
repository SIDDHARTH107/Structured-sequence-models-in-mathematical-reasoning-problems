    "message_2": "To find the smallest factor of 8281 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function, f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 8281\n2. Choose a random starting point, x = 2\n3. Calculate the sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the starting point x\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between two numbers in the sequence and the number 8281\n5. If the GCD is not 1 or 8281, it is a factor of 8281\n\nLet's start with the sequence:\n\nx0 = 2\nx1 = f(x0) = (2^2 + 1) mod 8281 = 5\nx2 = f(x1) = (5^2 + 1) mod 8281 = 26\nx3 = f(x2) = (26^2 + 1) mod 8281 = 677\nx4 = f(x3) = (677^2 + 1) mod 8281 = 3362\nx5 = f(x4) = (3362^2 + 1) mod 8281 = 3362\n\nNow, let's calculate the GCD of the differences:\n\nGCD(x1 - x0, 8281) = GCD(5 - 2, 8281) = GCD(3, 8281) = 1\nGCD(x2 - x1, 8281) = GCD(26 - 5, 8281) = GCD(21, 8281) = 1\nGCD(x3 - x2, 8281) = GCD(677 - 26, 8281) = GCD(651, 8281) = 1\nGCD(x4 - x3, 8281) = GCD(3362 - 677, 8281) = GCD(2685, 8281) = 13\n\nWe found a GCD that is not 1 or 8281, which is 13. Therefore, the smallest factor of 8281 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 13."
