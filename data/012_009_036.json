    "message_2": "No, it is not possible to draw a simple undirected graph G with the given degree sequence {3,3,2,1,1,0}. Here's why:\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words, the sum of the degree sequence must be an even number.\n\nIn the given degree sequence {3,3,2,1,1,0}, the sum of the degrees is 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 10, which is an even number. So far, this condition is satisfied.\n\nHowever, the Havel-Hakimi theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a degree sequence to be graphical (i.e., for it to be the degree sequence of a simple undirected graph). The theorem states that a non-increasing degree sequence (a sequence sorted in non-increasing order) is graphical if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first element (d1) and subtracting 1 from the next d1 elements is graphical.\n\nLet's apply the Havel-Hakimi theorem to the given degree sequence:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order: {3,3,2,1,1,0}\n2. Remove the first element (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 elements: {2,1,0,1,0}\n3. Sort the new sequence in non-increasing order: {2,1,1,0,0}\n4. Remove the first element (2) and subtract 1 from the next 2 elements: {0,0,0,0}\n\nAt this point, we have reached an all-zero sequence, which means that the original degree sequence is not graphical. Therefore, it is not possible to draw a simple undirected graph G with the given degree sequence {3,3,2,1,1,0}."
