    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (6x - 5)(x^2 + 3), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. \n\nLet u(x) = 6x - 5 and v(x) = x^2 + 3. Then, f(x) = u(x)v(x).\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(6x - 5)/dx = 6\nv'(x) = d(x^2 + 3)/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (6)(x^2 + 3) + (6x - 5)(2x)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 18 + 12x^2 - 10x\nf'(x) = 18x^2 - 10x + 18\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (6x - 5)(x^2 + 3) is f'(x) = 18x^2 - 10x + 18."
