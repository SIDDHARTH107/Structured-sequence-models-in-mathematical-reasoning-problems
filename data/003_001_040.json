    "message_2": "To find the length of the other leg of the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we know the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm) and the length of one leg (a = 6 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe can plug in the values we know:\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n\nNow, we can solve for b^2:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of 64:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 8 cm."
