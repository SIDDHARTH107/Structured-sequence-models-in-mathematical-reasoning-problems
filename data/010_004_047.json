    "message_2": "To show that A is a compact space, we need to show that every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's consider an arbitrary open cover of A, which we'll call {U_i}, where i is an index in some index set I. That is, for every x in A, there exists some U_i that contains x.\n\nNow, let's consider the set S = {x in A | [0, x] has a finite subcover from {U_i}}. Clearly, 0 is in S since we can find some U_i that contains 0 (since {U_i} is an open cover of A). Therefore, S is non-empty.\n\nLet x* be the supremum of S. We want to show that x* = 1, which would imply that A has a finite subcover from {U_i}. Since x* is the supremum of S, there must exist a sequence {x_n} in S that converges to x*. For each x_n, there exists a finite subcover {U_i_n} that covers [0, x_n]. \n\nSince x* is the supremum of S, there exists some U_i* that contains x*. Since U_i* is open, there exists an open interval (x* - ε, x* + ε) contained in U_i* for some ε > 0. Now, consider the point x* - ε/2. Since {x_n} converges to x*, there exists an N such that for all n > N, x_n > x* - ε/2. Let x_N be one such element in the sequence. Then, [0, x_N] has a finite subcover {U_i_N} from {U_i}.\n\nNow, we claim that {U_i_N} together with U_i* form a finite subcover of A. Let x be an arbitrary element in A. If x <= x_N, then x is covered by {U_i_N}. If x > x_N, then x must be in the interval (x* - ε, x* + ε) since x <= 1 and x* - ε/2 < x_N < x* < x* + ε. Therefore, x is covered by U_i*. Thus, every element in A is covered by {U_i_N} and U_i*, which is a finite subcover of {U_i}.\n\nSince we've shown that every open cover of A has a finite subcover, A is a compact space."
