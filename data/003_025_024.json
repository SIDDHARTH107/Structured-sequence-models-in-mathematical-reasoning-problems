    "message_1": "A car is traveling at a velocity of 60 km/h towards East. If there is also a wind blowing towards the North at a velocity of 10 km/h, what is the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the car? Round off the answer to one decimal place.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet Vc be the velocity of the car (60 km/h) and Vw be the velocity of the wind (10 km/h). The resultant velocity Vr can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr^2 = Vc^2 + Vw^2\nVr^2 = (60)^2 + (10)^2\nVr^2 = 3600 + 100\nVr^2 = 3700\nVr = √3700\nVr ≈ 60.8 km/h (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nNow, to find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nθ = arctan(Vw/Vc)\nθ = arctan(10/60)\nθ ≈ 0.165 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees:\n\nθ = 0.165 * (180/π)\nθ ≈ 9.5° (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity is approximately 60.8 km/h, and the direction is approximately 9.5° North of East."
