    "message_2": "To evaluate the contour integral of the function $f(z) = \\frac{e^z}{z}$ counterclockwise around the unit circle centered at the origin in the complex plane using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if the function is analytic within and on the contour.\n\nThe function $f(z) = \\frac{e^z}{z}$ has a singularity at $z = 0$. However, since the contour is the unit circle centered at the origin, the singularity lies on the contour. Therefore, we cannot directly apply Cauchy's theorem.\n\nInstead, we can use the Cauchy integral formula, which states that for a function $f(z)$ analytic within and on a simple closed contour $C$ and $z_0$ inside $C$:\n\n$$f(z_0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz$$\n\nIn our case, we want to evaluate the integral:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{e^z}{z} dz$$\n\nWe can rewrite this integral as:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{e^z}{z - 0} dz$$\n\nNow, we can apply the Cauchy integral formula with $f(z) = e^z$ and $z_0 = 0$. Since $f(z) = e^z$ is analytic everywhere, the conditions of the Cauchy integral formula are satisfied. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{e^z}{z} dz = 2\\pi i f(0) = 2\\pi i e^0 = 2\\pi i$$\n\nSo, the contour integral of the function $f(z) = \\frac{e^z}{z}$ counterclockwise around the unit circle centered at the origin in the complex plane is $2\\pi i$."
