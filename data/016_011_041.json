    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor is s = 3 (each side of the square is divided into three equal parts). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497."
