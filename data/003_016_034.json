    "message_1": "A water wave can be represented by the equation y = 2sin(5x - π/4). Find the phase shift of the wave.",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a sine wave is given by y = A*sin(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 2sin(5x - π/4), we can see that A = 2, B = 5, and C = π/4.\n\nThe phase shift is C, which is π/4 in this case. Therefore, the phase shift of the wave is π/4."
