    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that differ by 2. To find the first twin prime pair greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if their neighbors (either 2 less or 2 more) are also prime.\n\nThe prime numbers greater than 100 are: 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, ...\n\nNow let's check for twin prime pairs:\n\n- 101 and 103: Both are prime numbers, and they differ by 2.\n\nSo, the first twin prime pair greater than 100 is (101, 103)."
