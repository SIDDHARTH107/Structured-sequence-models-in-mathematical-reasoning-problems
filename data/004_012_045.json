    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x + 5) / (2x - 3), we will use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2.\n\nIn this case, g(x) = 3x + 5 and h(x) = 2x - 3. We first need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x).\n\ng'(x) = d(3x + 5)/dx = 3\nh'(x) = d(2x - 3)/dx = 2\n\nNow we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = (3(2x - 3) - (3x + 5)(2)) / (2x - 3)^2\nf'(x) = (6x - 9 - 6x - 10) / (4x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf'(x) = (-19) / (4x^2 - 12x + 9)\n\nSo the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x + 5) / (2x - 3) is f'(x) = -19 / (4x^2 - 12x + 9)."
