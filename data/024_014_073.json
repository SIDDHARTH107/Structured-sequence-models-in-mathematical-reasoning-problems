    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a three-dimensional manifold and let $f:\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. Consider the vector field on $M$ given by $X = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ and the function $f(x,y,z) = x^2y^3z^4$. What is the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to the vector field $X$, we need to apply the action of $X$ on $f$. This is given by the following expression:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f) = x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $y$ and $z$. We have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (x^2y^3z^4)}{\\partial y} = 3x^2y^2z^4$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial (x^2y^3z^4)}{\\partial z} = 4x^2y^3z^3$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the formula for the Lie derivative:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = x\\left(3x^2y^2z^4\\right) + y\\left(4x^2y^3z^3\\right) = 3x^3y^2z^4 + 4x^2y^4z^3$$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$ is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = 3x^3y^2z^4 + 4x^2y^4z^3$$"
