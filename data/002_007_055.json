    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a base of 8 centimeters and a height of 5 centimeters. The shorter base measures 3 centimeters. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 (the longer base) is 8 centimeters, base2 (the shorter base) is 3 centimeters, and the height is 5 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (8 + 3) * 5\n\nArea = (1/2) * 11 * 5\n\nArea = 5.5 * 5\n\nArea = 27.5 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 27.5 square centimeters."
