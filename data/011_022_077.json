    "message_1": "A student has a knapsack with a capacity of 10kg. They want to pack the knapsack with items of different weights, subject to the constraint that the total weight of the items packed cannot exceed the capacity of the knapsack. The items they have weigh 2kg, 3kg, 4kg, 5kg, and 6kg respectively. \n\nWhat is the maximum weight of items that the student can pack in their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum weight of items that the student can pack in their knapsack, we need to determine the combination of items that add up to the closest value to 10kg without exceeding it.\n\nHere are some possible combinations:\n\n1. 2kg + 3kg = 5kg\n2. 2kg + 4kg = 6kg\n3. 2kg + 5kg = 7kg\n4. 2kg + 6kg = 8kg\n5. 3kg + 4kg = 7kg\n6. 3kg + 5kg = 8kg\n7. 3kg + 6kg = 9kg\n8. 4kg + 5kg = 9kg\n9. 4kg + 6kg (exceeds the capacity)\n10. 5kg + 6kg (exceeds the capacity)\n\nFrom the combinations above, the maximum weight of items that the student can pack in their knapsack is 9kg, which can be achieved by packing either the 3kg and 6kg items or the 4kg and 5kg items."
