    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase of each harmonic component, we can rewrite the given function in the form of a Fourier series. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = A_0 + Σ[A_n * cos(nωt + φ_n)]\n\nwhere A_0 is the constant term, A_n is the amplitude of the nth harmonic, ω is the angular frequency, and φ_n is the phase angle of the nth harmonic.\n\nThe given function is:\n\nf(t) = 2sin(3t) + 3cos(5t) + 4sin(7t) + 5cos(11t)\n\nWe can rewrite the sine terms as cosine terms using the trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(x) = cos(x - π/2)\n\nSo, the function becomes:\n\nf(t) = 2cos(3t - π/2) + 3cos(5t) + 4cos(7t - π/2) + 5cos(11t)\n\nNow, we can see that the function is already in the form of a Fourier series with A_0 = 0. The amplitudes and phase angles of each harmonic component are:\n\n1st harmonic (n = 3):\nA_3 = 2\nφ_3 = -π/2\n\n2nd harmonic (n = 5):\nA_5 = 3\nφ_5 = 0\n\n3rd harmonic (n = 7):\nA_7 = 4\nφ_7 = -π/2\n\n4th harmonic (n = 11):\nA_11 = 5\nφ_11 = 0\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase of each harmonic component are:\n\n1st harmonic: Amplitude = 2, Phase = -π/2\n2nd harmonic: Amplitude = 3, Phase = 0\n3rd harmonic: Amplitude = 4, Phase = -π/2\n4th harmonic: Amplitude = 5, Phase = 0"
