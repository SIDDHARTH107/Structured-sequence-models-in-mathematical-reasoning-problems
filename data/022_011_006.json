    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero. The numerator is given by:\n\nz^3 - 1 = 0\n\nWe can factor this expression using the difference of cubes formula:\n\n(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us the following zeros:\n\nz = 1 (from the first factor)\n\nThe second factor is a quadratic equation with complex roots. We can find the roots using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nFor the quadratic equation z^2 + z + 1, we have a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nz = (-1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(1))) / 2(1)\nz = (-1 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nThe two complex roots are:\n\nz = (-1 + √(-3)) / 2\nz = (-1 - √(-3)) / 2\n\nSo the zeros of the function f(z) are:\n\nz = 1 (order 1)\nz = (-1 + √(-3)) / 2 (order 1)\nz = (-1 - √(-3)) / 2 (order 1)\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function f(z). The poles are the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero. The denominator is given by:\n\nz^2 - 3z + 2 = 0\n\nWe can factor this expression:\n\n(z - 1)(z - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us the following poles:\n\nz = 1 (from the first factor)\nz = 2 (from the second factor)\n\nHowever, since z = 1 is also a zero of the function, it cancels out the pole at z = 1. Therefore, the only pole of the function f(z) is:\n\nz = 2 (order 1)\n\nIn summary, the zeros and poles of the function f(z) are:\n\nZeros:\nz = 1 (order 1)\nz = (-1 + √(-3)) / 2 (order 1)\nz = (-1 - √(-3)) / 2 (order 1)\n\nPoles:\nz = 2 (order 1)"
