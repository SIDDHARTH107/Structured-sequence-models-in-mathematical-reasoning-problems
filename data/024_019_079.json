    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface S, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms. Let's parameterize the surface S by the following parameterization:\n\nΦ(u, v) = (u*cos(v), u*sin(v), u^2) for 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ v ≤ 2π.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\nΦ_u = (∂Φ/∂u) = (cos(v), sin(v), 2u)\nΦ_v = (∂Φ/∂v) = (-u*sin(v), u*cos(v), 0)\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <Φ_u, Φ_u> = cos^2(v) + sin^2(v) + 4u^2 = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <Φ_u, Φ_v> = -u*cos(v)*sin(v) + u*sin(v)*cos(v) = 0\nG = <Φ_v, Φ_v> = u^2*sin^2(v) + u^2*cos^2(v) = u^2\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nΦ_uu = (∂²Φ/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nΦ_uv = (∂²Φ/∂u∂v) = (-sin(v), cos(v), 0)\nΦ_vv = (∂²Φ/∂v²) = (-u*cos(v), -u*sin(v), 0)\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <Φ_uu, N> = 2\nM = <Φ_uv, N> = 0\nN = <Φ_vv, N> = 0\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface S, which can be computed as the cross product of Φ_u and Φ_v:\n\nN = Φ_u × Φ_v = (2u*cos(v), 2u*sin(v), -u)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the following formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nK = (2*0 - 0^2) / ((1 + 4u^2)*u^2 - 0^2) = 0 / (u^2(1 + 4u^2))\n\nThus, the Gaussian curvature K = 0 everywhere on the surface S.\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature is 0 everywhere on the surface, the total Gaussian curvature of S is also 0."
