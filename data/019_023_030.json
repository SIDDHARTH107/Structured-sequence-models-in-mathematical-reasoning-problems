    "message_1": "A farmer has counted his chickens for 100 days in a row and every time he has found that the number of chickens was greater than the day before. Based on this observation, what is the minimum number of days that the farmer can be sure that the next day will also have more chickens than the previous day?",
    "message_2": "The farmer cannot be sure that the next day will also have more chickens than the previous day. The number of chickens increasing for 100 days in a row is an observation, but it does not guarantee that the pattern will continue indefinitely. There could be external factors, such as disease, predators, or other unforeseen circumstances, that could cause the number of chickens to decrease or remain the same on any given day."
