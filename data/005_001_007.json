    "message_1": "A factory producing light bulbs claims that the average lifespan of its bulbs is 700 hours. However, a consumer group suspects that the average lifespan of the bulbs is less than 700 hours. To test this claim, the group randomly selects 50 bulbs and records their lifespans. The data shows that the sample mean lifespan is 680 hours with a standard deviation of 40 hours. \n\nUsing a 5% level of significance, can the consumer group reject the factory's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the factory's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average lifespan of the bulbs is 700 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average lifespan is less than 700 hours.\n\nH0: μ = 700\nH1: μ < 700\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 680 hours\nSample standard deviation (s) = 40 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is greater than 30, we can use the t-distribution to perform the t-test. First, we need to calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (680 - 700) / (40 / √50)\nt = -20 / (40 / 7.071)\nt = -20 / 5.656\nt ≈ -3.54\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a 5% level of significance and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.677\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.54) is less than the critical t-value (-1.677), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. \n\nAt a 5% level of significance, the consumer group can reject the factory's claim that the average lifespan of its bulbs is 700 hours. The evidence suggests that the average lifespan is less than 700 hours."
