    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the metal sphere is 6 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(6)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(216)\n\nV = (4*216*π)/3\n\nV = (864*π)/3\n\nV = 288π cubic centimeters\n\nTherefore, the volume of the metal sphere is 288π cubic centimeters."
