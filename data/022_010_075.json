    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = 1/z centered at z = 2, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-2). We have:\n\nf(z) = 1/z = 1/(z-2+2) = 1/[(z-2) + 2].\n\nNow, we want to express the function as a series of the form:\n\nf(z) = Σ a_n (z-2)^n.\n\nTo do this, we perform a geometric series expansion on the term 1/[(z-2) + 2]:\n\n1/[(z-2) + 2] = 1/2 * 1/[1 - (-(z-2)/2)].\n\nUsing the geometric series formula, where |x| < 1:\n\n1/(1-x) = Σ x^n (from n=0 to ∞),\n\nwe can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = 1/2 * Σ [(-1)^n * (z-2)^n / 2^n] (from n=0 to ∞).\n\nNow, we have the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z = 2:\n\nf(z) = Σ (-1)^n * (z-2)^n / 2^(n+1) (from n=0 to ∞).\n\nTo determine the range of z-values for which the series converges, we look at the condition for the geometric series convergence:\n\n|-(z-2)/2| < 1.\n\nSolving for z, we get:\n\n-1 < (z-2)/2 < 1,\n-2 < z-2 < 2,\n0 < z < 4.\n\nThus, the Laurent series converges for z-values in the range 0 < z < 4."
