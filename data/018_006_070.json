    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 6 elements, i.e., |A| = 6. Let A' be the complement of A, which has 4 elements, i.e., |A'| = 4. The universal set, U, contains all the elements in both A and A'. \n\nAccording to the principle of set theory, the number of elements in the union of two sets is equal to the sum of the number of elements in each set minus the number of elements in their intersection. Since A and A' are complements, their intersection is an empty set, i.e., A ∩ A' = ∅ and |A ∩ A'| = 0.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the universal set U is:\n\n|U| = |A ∪ A'| = |A| + |A'| - |A ∩ A'| = 6 + 4 - 0 = 10\n\nSo, the universal set U has 10 elements.\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of A and its complement A' is the universal set U using set theory.\n\nLet x be an element in the universal set U. Since A and A' are complements, x must be either in A or in A'. Therefore, x is in the union of A and A', i.e., x ∈ A ∪ A'. This shows that U ⊆ A ∪ A'.\n\nNow, let x be an element in the union of A and A', i.e., x ∈ A ∪ A'. This means that x is either in A or in A'. Since A and A' are subsets of the universal set U, x must also be in U. This shows that A ∪ A' ⊆ U.\n\nSince U ⊆ A ∪ A' and A ∪ A' ⊆ U, we can conclude that the union of A and its complement A' is the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U"
