    "message_1": "A math student is given the equation y = sin(x) to graph. In what quadrant is the graph of this equation located, and what is the period of the function?",
    "message_2": "The graph of the equation y = sin(x) is located in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane. This is because the sine function oscillates between positive and negative values as x increases or decreases.\n\nThe period of the function y = sin(x) is 2π. This means that the function repeats its pattern every 2π units along the x-axis."
