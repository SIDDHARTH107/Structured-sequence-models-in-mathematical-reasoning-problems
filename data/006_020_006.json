    "message_2": "First, we need to find out how many people own a dog, a cat, and both a dog and a cat.\n\nNumber of dog owners = 40% of 500 = 0.4 * 500 = 200 people\nNumber of cat owners = 25% of 500 = 0.25 * 500 = 125 people\nNumber of people who own both a dog and a cat = 15% of dog owners = 0.15 * 200 = 30 people\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected person from the community owns both a dog and a cat.\n\nProbability = (Number of people who own both a dog and a cat) / (Total number of people in the community)\nProbability = 30 / 500 = 0.06\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person from the community owns both a dog and a cat is 0.06 or 6%."
