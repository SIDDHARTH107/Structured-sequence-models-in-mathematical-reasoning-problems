    "message_1": "In a restaurant, there are 8 different main dishes and 5 different desserts available. If a customer wants to order 1 main dish and 1 dessert, how many different combinations of meal choices are possible?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of different combinations of meal choices, we can use the counting principle, which states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m × n ways to do both.\n\nIn this case, there are 8 different main dishes and 5 different desserts. So, there are 8 × 5 = 40 different combinations of meal choices possible."
