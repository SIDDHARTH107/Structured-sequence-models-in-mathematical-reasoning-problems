    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 4, we first need to find its derivative f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 4)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n6x^2 - 6x - 12 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by 6:\n\nx^2 - x - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = -1."
