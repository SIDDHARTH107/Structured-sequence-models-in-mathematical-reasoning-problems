    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners can be selected from a group of 8 people, we can use the concept of permutations. \n\nFor the 1st place, there are 8 choices (since there are 8 people in the group). Once the 1st place winner is selected, there are 7 choices left for the 2nd place. Finally, after the 1st and 2nd place winners are selected, there are 6 choices left for the 3rd place.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select the top 3 winners is:\n\n8 (choices for 1st place) × 7 (choices for 2nd place) × 6 (choices for 3rd place) = 336 different ways."
