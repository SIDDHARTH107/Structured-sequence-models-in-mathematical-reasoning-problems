    "message_2": "To determine the graph's diameter, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. Let's first analyze the possible degrees of the vertices in the graph.\n\nSince there are 6 vertices and 7 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 7 = 14. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible degree sequences for the graph. If all vertices have a degree of 2, the sum of the degrees would be 12, which is less than 14. Therefore, at least one vertex must have a degree of 3 or more.\n\nLet's assume the graph has a vertex A with a degree of 3. Then, the remaining 5 vertices must have a sum of degrees equal to 14 - 3 = 11. If all of these vertices have a degree of 2, the sum of their degrees would be 10, which is less than 11. Therefore, at least one of these vertices must have a degree of 3 or more.\n\nNow, let's assume there are two vertices A and B with degrees of 3. The remaining 4 vertices must have a sum of degrees equal to 11 - 2 * 3 = 5. If all of these vertices have a degree of 1, the sum of their degrees would be 4, which is less than 5. Therefore, at least one of these vertices must have a degree of 2 or more.\n\nSo, we have a graph with vertices A and B having degrees of 3, vertex C having a degree of 2, and the remaining 3 vertices having degrees of 1. This graph can be represented as follows:\n\nA -- B -- C -- D\n \\      |\n  \\     E\n   \\\n    F\n\nIn this graph, the longest shortest path between any two vertices is 3, which occurs between vertices D and F (D -> C -> B -> F). Therefore, the graph's diameter is 3."
