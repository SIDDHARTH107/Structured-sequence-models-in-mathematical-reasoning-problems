    "message_2": "To approximate the value of y(0.4) using a fourth order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.1, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(t, y) = 3y - 2.\n2. Initialize the variables: t0 = 0, y0 = 1, h = 0.1, and n = 4 (since we want to find y(0.4) and we're taking steps of 0.1).\n3. Perform the Runge-Kutta method for n steps.\n\nThe Runge-Kutta method consists of the following steps:\n\nFor i = 1 to n:\n  a. Calculate k1 = h * f(t0, y0)\n  b. Calculate k2 = h * f(t0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2)\n  c. Calculate k3 = h * f(t0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2)\n  d. Calculate k4 = h * f(t0 + h, y0 + k3)\n  e. Update y0 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n  f.
