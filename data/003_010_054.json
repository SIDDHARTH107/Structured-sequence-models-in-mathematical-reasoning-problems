    "message_1": "A tree of 25 meters stands on level ground. An observer standing some distance away finds that the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 40 degrees. How far is the observer standing from the base of the tree, correct to two decimal places?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance from the observer to the base of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the distance from the observer to the base of the tree as x. We have a right triangle with the tree as the side opposite the angle, and the distance from the observer to the base of the tree as the side adjacent to the angle.\n\ntan(40°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(40°) = 25 meters / x\n\nTo find x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 25 meters / tan(40°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of tan(40°) and solve for x:\n\nx ≈ 25 meters / 0.8391\nx ≈ 29.81 meters\n\nSo, the observer is approximately 29.81 meters away from the base of the tree, correct to two decimal places."
