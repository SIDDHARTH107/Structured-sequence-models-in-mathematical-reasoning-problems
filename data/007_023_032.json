    "message_1": "A cryptographic hash function produces a fixed-length output based on an input message of any length. Suppose a particular cryptographic hash function produces a 256-bit output. How many possible hash values can this function produce?",
    "message_2": "A 256-bit output means there are 256 binary digits (bits), each of which can be either a 0 or a 1. To find the total number of possible hash values, we calculate the number of combinations for each bit position. Since there are 2 options (0 or 1) for each of the 256 positions, the total number of possible hash values is:\n\n2^256\n\nThis is approximately 1.1579209 x 10^77 different hash values."
