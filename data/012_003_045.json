    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set of vertices in G, we need to identify the largest set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent. Let's analyze the graph:\n\n1. If we include vertex A, we cannot include vertices B, C, and D, since they are adjacent to A. In this case, we can include vertices E and F. The independent set would be {A, E, F} with a size of 3.\n\n2. If we include vertex B, we cannot include vertices A, D, and E, since they are adjacent to B. In this case, we can include vertices C and F. The independent set would be {B, C, F} with a size of 3.\n\n3. If we include vertex C, we cannot include vertices A and D, since they are adjacent to C. In this case, we can include vertices B, E, and F. The independent set would be {C, B, E, F} with a size of 4.\n\n4. If we include vertex D, we cannot include vertices A, B, and C, since they are adjacent to D. In this case, we can include vertices E and F. The independent set would be {D, E, F} with a size of 3.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the maximum independent set of vertices in G is {C, B, E, F} with a size of 4."
