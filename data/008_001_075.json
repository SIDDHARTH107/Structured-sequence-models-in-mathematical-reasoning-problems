    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first write the system in matrix form, then find the inverse of the coefficient matrix, and finally multiply the inverse with the constant matrix to find the values of x and y.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n3x + y = 10\n2x - 4y = -2\n\nWe can write this system in matrix form as:\n\n[3  1] [x]   [10]\n[2 -4] [y] = [-2]\n\nLet A be the coefficient matrix, X be the variable matrix, and B be the constant matrix:\n\nA = [3  1]\n    [2 -4]\n\nX = [x]\n    [y]\n\nB = [10]\n    [-2]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * [d  -b]\n                      [-c  a]\n\nwhere det(A) = ad - bc\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 1, c = 2, and d = -4. So, det(A) = (3 * -4) - (1 * 2) = -12 - 2 = -14.\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = (1/-14) * [-4 -1]\n                 [-2  3]\n\nA_inv = [2/7  1/14]\n        [1/7 -3/14]\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A_inv with B:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = [2/7  1/14] [10]\n    [1/7 -3/14] [-2]\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nx = (2/7 * 10) + (1/14 * -2) = 20/7 - 1/7 = 19/7\ny = (1/7 * 10) + (-3/14 * -2) = 10/7 + 3/7 = 13/7\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 19/7 and y = 13/7."
