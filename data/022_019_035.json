    "message_1": "A math student needs to evaluate the following integral equation using complex analysis:\n\n∫(0 -> 2π) e^(3iθ)/(5 - 4cosθ) dθ\n\nThe solution involves using the Residue Theorem and evaluating the residues of the function e^(3iz)/(5-4cos(z)) at its singular points. The final answer should be a complex number.",
    "message_2": "To solve the integral using complex analysis, we first rewrite the integral in terms of complex variables. We can use the substitution z = e^(iθ), so dz = ie^(iθ)dθ, and dθ = dz/(iz). Then, cosθ = (z + 1/z)/2. The integral becomes:\n\n∫(0 -> 2π) e^(3iθ)/(5 - 4cosθ) dθ = ∫(∂D) e^(3iz)/(5 - 2(z + 1/z)) (dz/iz)\n\nwhere ∂D is the boundary of the unit disk, D.\n\nNow, we simplify the integrand:\n\ne^(3iz)/(5 - 2(z + 1/z)) (dz/iz) = e^(3iz)/(5z - 2z^2 - 2) (dz/iz) = e^(3iz)/(2z^2 - 5z + 2) (dz/iz)\n\nNow, we find the singular points of the integrand by finding the roots of the denominator:\n\n2z^2 - 5z + 2 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation has two roots, z1 = 2 and z2 = 1/2. However, only z2 = 1/2 is inside the unit disk D. Thus, we only need to consider the residue at z2.\n\nTo find the residue at z2, we can use the formula:\n\nRes(f(z), z2) = lim(z->z2) [(z - z2) f(z)]\n\nRes(f(z), 1/2) = lim(z->1/2) [(z - 1/2) e^(3iz)/(2z^2 - 5z + 2)]\n\nWe can use L'Hopital's rule to evaluate the limit:\n\nRes(f(z), 1/2) = lim(z->1/2) [e^(3iz) (4z - 5)/(4z)]\n\nRes(f(z), 1/2) = e^(3i(1/2)) (4(1/2) - 5)/(4(1/2)) = e^(3i/2) (-1)/2\n\nNow, we can use the Residue Theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\n∫(∂D) e^(3iz)/(2z^2 - 5z + 2) (dz/iz) = 2πi * Res(f(z), 1/2) = 2πi * e^(3i/2) (-1)/2 = -πi * e^(3i/2)\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n-πi * e^(3i/2)"
