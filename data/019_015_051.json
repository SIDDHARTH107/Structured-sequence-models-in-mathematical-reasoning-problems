    "message_2": "To prove that $\\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite type, we will use proof by contradiction. We will assume that there exists a natural number that has all other natural numbers as its successors and show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that there exists a natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m$ is a successor of $n$. This means that there exists a natural number $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $n = Sk$.\n\nNow, consider the natural number 0. By our assumption, 0 must be a successor of $n$. So, there exists a natural number $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $n = Sp$. Since $n = Sk = Sp$, we have $Sk = Sp$.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. According to the definition of natural numbers, the successor function is injective, which means that if $Sk = Sp$, then $k = p$. But if $k = p$, then $n = Sk = Sp = 0$, which contradicts the fact that 0 is a successor of $n$.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a natural number that has all other natural numbers as its successors is false. Hence, $\\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite type."
