    "message_2": "To find the factors of the integer 637086552791 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) and an initial value x0.\n2. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of values.\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between two values in the sequence and the given integer.\n4. If the GCD is not 1 or the given integer, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = x^2 + 1 and x0 = 2.\n\nNow, we will iterate the function and calculate the GCD:\n\n1. x1 = f(x0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. x2 = f(x1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n3. GCD(x2 - x1, 637086552791) = GCD(21, 637086552791) = 1 (no factor found)\n\nContinue iterating:\n\n4. x3 = f(x2) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n5. x4 = f(x3) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330\n6. GCD(x4 - x2, 637086552791) = GCD(458304, 637086552791) = 1 (no factor found)\n\nContinue iterating:\n\n7. x5 = f(x4) = 458330^2 + 1 = 210066588900\n8. x6 = f(x5) = 210066588900^2 + 1 = 441279947829\n9. GCD(x6 - x4, 637086552791) = GCD(183050641071, 637086552791) = 239 (factor found)\n\nNow we have found a non-trivial factor, 239. To find the other factor, divide the given integer by the found factor:\n\n637086552791 รท 239 = 2667913191\n\nSo, the factors of 637086552791 are 239 and 2667913191."
