    "message_1": "A topological quantum field theory associates a finite-dimensional vector space to each closed oriented surface, and a linear operator to each oriented cobordism between surfaces. Suppose you have a topological quantum field theory that associates a 3-dimensional vector space of dimension 5 to a closed oriented 2-sphere, and a linear operator of trace 2 to an oriented cobordism from the 2-sphere to itself. Calculate the dimension of the vector space associated to a closed oriented surface which can be obtained by gluing two 2-spheres together along a common circle.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the topological quantum field theory as TQFT, the closed oriented 2-sphere as S^2, and the closed oriented surface obtained by gluing two 2-spheres together along a common circle as S.\n\nAccording to the TQFT, a 3-dimensional vector space of dimension 5 is associated with S^2. Let's denote this vector space as V(S^2), so dim(V(S^2)) = 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the surface S. It can be obtained by gluing two 2-spheres together along a common circle. Topologically, this operation corresponds to the connected sum of two 2-spheres, which is denoted as S^2 # S^2. The connected sum of two 2-spheres is topologically equivalent to a single 2-sphere, i.e., S^2 # S^2 â‰… S^2.\n\nSince the TQFT associates a vector space to each closed oriented surface, we have a vector space V(S) associated with the surface S. Since S is topologically equivalent to S^2, the dimension of the vector space associated with S should be the same as the dimension of the vector space associated with S^2.\n\nTherefore, dim(V(S)) = dim(V(S^2)) = 5."
