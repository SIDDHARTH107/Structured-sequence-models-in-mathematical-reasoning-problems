    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon with n+2 sides (n triangles) is given by the nth Catalan number, which is defined as:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nIn this case, we have a convex polygon with 8 sides, so n = 6. Now, we can calculate the 6th Catalan number:\n\nC(6) = (1/(6+1)) * (2*6 choose 6)\nC(6) = (1/7) * (12 choose 6)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient (12 choose 6):\n\n(12 choose 6) = 12! / (6! * (12-6)!)\n(12 choose 6) = 12! / (6! * 6!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479001600\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the binomial coefficient:\n\n(12 choose 6) = 479001600 / (720 * 720)\n(12 choose 6) = 924\n\nFinally, we can plug this value back into the Catalan number formula:\n\nC(6) = (1/7) * 924\nC(6) = 132\n\nSo, there are 132 ways to triangulate a convex polygon with 8 sides such that no two diagonals intersect except at the vertices of the polygon."
