    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, car accidents) that occur in a fixed interval of time (one week) given a known average rate (2 accidents per week).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (car accidents), k is the number of events we are interested in (at least one accident), λ is the average rate of events (2 accidents per week), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the probability of at least one car accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring (k = 0) and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = (2^0 * e^(-2)) / 0! = (1 * e^(-2)) / 1 = e^(-2)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one accident:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-2) ≈ 1 - 0.1353 ≈ 0.8647\n\nSo, the probability of at least one car accident occurring on the stretch of highway in a week is approximately 0.8647 or 86.47%."
