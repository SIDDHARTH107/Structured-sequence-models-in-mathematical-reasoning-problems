    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (s+1)/(s^2 + 6s + 8), we first need to perform partial fraction decomposition on F(s).\n\nF(s) = (s+1)/(s^2 + 6s + 8)\n\nWe factor the denominator:\n\nF(s) = (s+1)/((s+2)(s+4))\n\nNow we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nF(s) = A/(s+2) + B/(s+4)\n\nTo find A and B, we clear the denominators:\n\n(s+1) = A(s+4) + B(s+2)\n\nNow we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for s:\n\n1. Let s = -2:\n(-1) = A(2) => A = -1/2\n\n2. Let s = -4:\n(-3) = B(-2) => B = 3/2\n\nNow we have:\n\nF(s) = (-1/2)/(s+2) + (3/2)/(s+4)\n\nNow we can find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) using the linearity property of the Laplace transform and the known inverse Laplace transforms of 1/(s+a):\n\nL^(-1){F(s)} = L^(-1){(-1/2)/(s+2)} + L^(-1){(3/2)/(s+4)}\n\nf(t) = (-1/2)e^(-2t) + (3/2)e^(-4t)\n\nSo, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is f(t) = (-1/2)e^(-2t) + (3/2)e^(-4t)."
