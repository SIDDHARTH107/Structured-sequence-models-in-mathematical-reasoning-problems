    "message_2": "To find the wavelength of the signal, we first need to determine the frequency components present in the signal. We can do this by applying the Fourier transform to the given function f(t) = sin(2πt) + 2cos(4πt).\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of the given function:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(sin(2πt) + 2cos(4πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt + 2∫[cos(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of each part separately:\n\n1) For sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt):\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, sin(2πt) = (e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) / 2j\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫[(e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) / 2j * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\n= (1/2j) ∫[e^(j(2π-ω)t) - e^(-j(2π+ω)t)] dt\n\nThe Fourier transform of e^(j(2π-ω)t) is 2πδ(ω - 2π) and the Fourier transform of e^(-j(2π+ω)t) is 2πδ(ω + 2π), where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of sin(2πt) * e^(-jωt) is:\n\n(1/2j) [2πδ(ω - 2π) - 2πδ(ω + 2π)]\n\n= πδ(ω - 2π) - πδ(ω + 2π)\n\n2) For cos(4πt) * e^(-jωt):\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, cos(4πt) = (e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) / 2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n∫[(e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) / 2 * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\n= (1/2) ∫[e^(j(4π-ω)t) + e^(-j(4π+ω)t)] dt\n\nThe Fourier transform of e^(j(4π-ω)t) is 2πδ(ω - 4π) and the Fourier transform of e^(-j(4π+ω)t) is 2πδ(ω + 4π).\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of cos(4πt) * e^(-jωt) is:\n\n(1/2) [2πδ(ω - 4π) + 2πδ(ω + 4π)]\n\n= πδ(ω - 4π) + πδ(ω + 4π)\n\nNow, we can combine the Fourier transforms of both parts:\n\nF(ω) = πδ(ω - 2π) - πδ(ω + 2π) + πδ(ω - 4π) + πδ(ω + 4π)\n\nFrom the Fourier transform, we can see that there are two frequency components present in the signal: ω1 = 2π and ω2 = 4π.\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding linear frequencies:\n\nf1 = ω1 / (2π) = 2π / (2π) = 1 Hz\nf2 = ω2 / (2π) = 4π / (2π) = 2 Hz\n\nSince the signal propagates through the medium with a velocity of 4 m/s, we can find the wavelengths of the two frequency components:\n\nλ1 = v / f1 = 4 m/s / 1 Hz = 4 meters\nλ2 = v / f2 = 4 m/s / 2 Hz = 2 meters\n\nSo, the signal has two wavelength components: 4 meters and 2 meters."
