    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch snowflake curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch snowflake curve, after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original. So, N = 4 and S = 3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch snowflake curve after its third iteration is approximately 1.2619. Note that the dimension remains the same regardless of the number of iterations, as the fractal nature of the curve is consistent across all iterations."
