    "message_1": "An online bookstore has 300 books in stock and wants to allocate its inventory to two different categories: history and science. The history books sell for $25 each, and the science books sell for $30. The bookstore's marketing team has estimated that they can sell a maximum of 200 history books and 150 science books. The bookstore's management wants to maximize its revenue. What is the optimal number of books the bookstore should allocate to each category to maximize its revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of history books and y be the number of science books. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 300 (total number of books)\n2. x ≤ 200 (maximum number of history books)\n3. y ≤ 150 (maximum number of science books)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the revenue, which is given by:\n\nRevenue = 25x + 30y\n\nWe can rewrite constraint 1 as y = 300 - x and substitute it into the objective function:\n\nRevenue = 25x + 30(300 - x) = 25x + 9000 - 30x\n\nSimplifying the objective function, we get:\n\nRevenue = -5x + 9000\n\nSince we want to maximize the revenue, we need to minimize the number of history books (x). However, we also need to consider the constraints 2 and 3.\n\nIf x = 200 (maximum number of history books), then y = 300 - 200 = 100. This satisfies constraint 3 (y ≤ 150).\n\nSo, the optimal number of books the bookstore should allocate to each category to maximize its revenue is 200 history books and 100 science books."
