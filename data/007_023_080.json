Let H be a cryptographic hash function that takes an input message of length n bits and outputs a hash value of m bits. If n = 16 and m = 8, compute the hash value of the message using the SHA-256 algorithm.",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can help you understand the process, but I cannot compute the hash value directly as it requires a computer program to perform the calculations. However, I can guide you through the steps to compute the hash value using the SHA-256 algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's convert the decimal number 1234 to its binary representation. 1234 in binary is 10011010010. Since we need a 16-bit input message, we will pad it with zeros at the beginning: 000010011010010.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps of the SHA-256 algorithm:\n\n1. Preprocessing:\n   a. Pad the message: Since our message is already 16 bits long, we don't need to pad it further.\n   b. Parse the message into 512-bit blocks: Our message is only 16 bits long, so we have only one block.\n\n2. Process each 512-bit block:\n   a. Initialize the working variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) with the initial hash value.\n   b. For each round (0 to 63), perform the following operations:\n      i. Calculate the round constants.\n      ii. Calculate the majority and choose functions.\n      iii. Update the working variables using the message schedule, round constants, and bitwise operations.\n\n3. Add the compressed chunk to the current hash value.\n\n4. Output the final hash value.\n\nSince we need an 8-bit output, we will take the first 8 bits of the final 256-bit hash value.\n\nTo compute the hash value, you can use a programming language like Python with a library that supports SHA-256, or you can use an online SHA-256 calculator. Keep in mind that the output will be 256 bits, and you will need to truncate it to 8 bits as specified in the problem."
