    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the punctured torus $T - \\{p\\}$, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we need to cover the punctured torus with open sets whose fundamental groups are easy to compute. Let $U$ be an open set containing $p$ that deformation retracts onto a small loop around $p$, and let $V = T - \\{p\\}$. Then $U \\cap V$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$, the circle.\n\nNow, we compute the fundamental groups of $U$, $V$, and $U \\cap V$. Since $U$ deformation retracts onto a small loop around $p$, we have $\\pi_1(U) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The space $V$ is homotopy equivalent to the torus with one hole, which is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of two circles, so $\\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$, the free product of two copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, since $U \\cap V$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$, we have $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Let $i: U \\cap V \\to U$ and $j: U \\cap V \\to V$ be the inclusion maps. Then the fundamental group of $T - \\{p\\}$ is given by the amalgamated product:\n\n$$\\pi_1(T - \\{p\\}) \\cong \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} *_{\\mathbb{Z}} (\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}).$$\n\nTo compute this amalgamated product, we need to understand the homomorphisms induced by $i$ and $j$. Since $U \\cap V$ is a loop around $p$, the homomorphism $i_*: \\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\to \\pi_1(U)$ is an isomorphism. On the other hand, the homomorphism $j_*: \\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\to \\pi_1(V)$ is the inclusion of the loop around $p$ into the wedge sum of two circles, so it is injective.\n\nNow we can compute the amalgamated product:\n\n$$\\pi_1(T - \\{p\\}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} *_{\\mathbb{Z}} (\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\langle a, b, c \\mid ac = bc \\rangle \\cong \\langle a, b \\mid ab = ba \\rangle.$$\n\nHere, $a$ and $b$ are the generators of the two copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in $\\pi_1(V)$, and $c$ is the generator of $\\pi_1(U)$. The relation $ac = bc$ comes from the fact that the loop around $p$ is identified with both $a$ and $b$ in the amalgamated product.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the punctured torus $T - \\{p\\}$ is isomorphic to the free abelian group of rank 2, $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$."
