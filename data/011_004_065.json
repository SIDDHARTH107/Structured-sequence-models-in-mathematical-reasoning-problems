    "message_1": "In a mathematics class, there are 10 students. The teacher wants to divide them into 3 groups for a group project. If each group must have at least 2 students, how many ways can the teacher divide the students into groups?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of students in each group as A, B, and C. Since there are 10 students in total and each group must have at least 2 students, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. A=2, B=2, C=6\n2. A=2, B=3, C=5\n3. A=2, B=4, C=4\n4. A=3, B=3, C=4\n\nNow, we will calculate the number of ways to divide the students into groups for each possibility using combinations:\n\n1. A=2, B=2, C=6: C(10,2) * C(8,2) * C(6,6) = 45 * 28 * 1 = 1260\n2. A=2, B=3, C=5: C(10,2) * C(8,3) * C(5,5) = 45 * 56 * 1 = 2520\n3. A=2, B=4, C=4: C(10,2) * C(8,4) * C(4,4) = 45 * 70 * 1 = 3150\n4. A=3, B=3, C=4: C(10,3) * C(7,3) * C(4,4) = 120 * 35 * 1 = 4200\n\nNow, we sum up the number of ways for each possibility:\n\nTotal ways = 1260 + 2520 + 3150 + 4200 = 11130\n\nSo, the teacher can divide the 10 students into 3 groups in 11,130 different ways."
