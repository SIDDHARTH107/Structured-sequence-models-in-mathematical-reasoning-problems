    "message_1": "A company manufactures two different products, A and B. It has a production capacity of 300 units of A and 400 units of B per week. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor while each unit of B requires 1 hour of machine time and 2 hours of labor. The company makes a profit of $5 on each unit of A and $8 on each unit of B. What is the maximum weekly profit that the company can make under these restrictions?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced per week and y be the number of units of product B produced per week.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint for product A: x ≤ 300\n2. Production capacity constraint for product B: y ≤ 400\n3. Machine time constraint: 2x + y ≤ M (where M is the total machine hours available per week)\n4. Labor time constraint: x + 2y ≤ L (where L is the total labor hours available per week)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is given by:\n\nProfit = 5x + 8y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and maximize the profit function.\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of M and L (total machine hours and labor hours available per week) from the given information.\n\nLet's assume the company uses all its production capacity for product A:\n\n300 units of A * 2 hours of machine time = 600 machine hours\n300 units of A * 1 hour of labor = 300 labor hours\n\nNow, let's assume the company uses all its production capacity for product B:\n\n400 units of B * 1 hour of machine time = 400 machine hours\n400 units of B * 2 hours of labor = 800 labor hours\n\nSince the company can produce both products, the total machine hours (M) and labor hours (L) available per week must be at least the sum of the maximum hours required for each product:\n\nM = 600 + 400 = 1000 machine hours\nL = 300 + 800 = 1100 labor hours\n\nNow we can rewrite the constraints with the values of M and L:\n\n1. x ≤ 300\n2. y ≤ 400\n3. 2x + y ≤ 1000\n4. x + 2y ≤ 1100\n\nNow we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and the optimal solution.\n\n1. Plot the constraint lines on a graph with x-axis representing product A and y-axis representing product B.\n2. Identify the feasible region (the area where all constraints are satisfied).\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the profit function at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest profit value.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (0, 400), (300, 0), (300, 200), and (200, 300).\n\nNow we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 400) = 5(0) + 8(400) = $3200\n2. Profit at (300, 0) = 5(300) + 8(0) = $1500\n3. Profit at (300, 200) = 5(300) + 8(200) = $3100\n4. Profit at (200, 300) = 5(200) + 8(300) = $3400\n\nThe maximum profit is $3400 per week, which occurs when the company produces 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B."
