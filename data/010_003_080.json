    "message_2": "To prove that X is a normal space, we need to show that for any two disjoint closed sets A and B in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nSince X is regular and Hausdorff, for each point x in A and y in B, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U_x and V_y such that x ∈ U_x and y ∈ V_y. Now, let's consider the open sets {U_x} and {V_y} for all x ∈ A and y ∈ B.\n\nSince X has a finite basis for its topology, let's denote this basis as B_1, B_2, ..., B_n. For each open set U_x and V_y, we can write them as a union of basis elements:\n\nU_x = ⋃_{i ∈ I_x} B_i and V_y = ⋃_{j ∈ J_y} B_j,\n\nwhere I_x and J_y are finite index sets for each x ∈ A and y ∈ B.\n\nNow, for each x ∈ A, let's choose one basis element B_x from the union that forms U_x, such that x ∈ B_x ⊆ U_x. Similarly, for each y ∈ B, choose one basis element C_y from the union that forms V_y, such that y ∈ C_y ⊆ V_y.\n\nDefine the open sets U = ⋃_{x ∈ A} B_x and V = ⋃_{y ∈ B} C_y. Since A and B are disjoint, and each B_x and C_y are disjoint, it follows that U and V are disjoint as well.\n\nFurthermore, for each x ∈ A, we have x ∈ B_x ⊆ U, so A ⊆ U. Similarly, for each y ∈ B, we have y ∈ C_y ⊆ V, so B ⊆ V.\n\nThus, we have found disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, which proves that X is a normal space."
