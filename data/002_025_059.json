    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the two congruent sides is 8 cm each, and the length of the base is 10 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn perpendicular to the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, with A being the vertex angle, and B and C being the base angles. Let's also call the midpoint of the base D. Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that AD is the altitude drawn perpendicular to the base.\n\nWe can now split the isosceles triangle into two right triangles, ABD and ADC. In both right triangles, the hypotenuse is one of the congruent sides (8 cm) and one leg is half of the base (5 cm).\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude (AD).\n\nIn right triangle ABD:\n\nAD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2\n\nAD^2 + 5^2 = 8^2\n\nAD^2 + 25 = 64\n\nAD^2 = 64 - 25\n\nAD^2 = 39\n\nAD = √39\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn perpendicular to the base is √39 cm."
