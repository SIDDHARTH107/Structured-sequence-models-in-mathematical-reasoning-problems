    "message_2": "To find the residue of the given function at the pole z = 1 + i, we first need to rewrite the function in terms of (z - (1 + i)). Let's denote w = z - (1 + i). Then, z = w + (1 + i). Now, we rewrite the function f(z) in terms of w:\n\nf(w) = ((w + (1 + i))^3 + (w + (1 + i))^2 + 1) / ((w + (1 + i))^2 - 2(w + (1 + i)) + 3)\n\nNow, we expand the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n(w^3 + 3(1+i)w^2 + 3(1+i)^2w + (1+i)^3) + (w^2 + 2(1+i)w + (1+i)^2) + 1\n\nDenominator:\n(w^2 + 2(1+i)w + (1+i)^2) - 2(w + (1+i)) + 3\n\nNow, we simplify the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n(w^3 + 3(1+i)w^2 + 3(2+2i)w + (2+2i)) + (w^2 + 2(1+i)w + (2+2i)) + 1\n\nDenominator:\n(w^2 + 2(1+i)w + (2+2i)) - 2(w + (1+i)) + 3\n\nNow, we combine like terms:\n\nNumerator:\nw^3 + 4(1+i)w^2 + 8(1+i)w + 5\n\nDenominator:\nw^2\n\nNow, we have the function f(w) = (w^3 + 4(1+i)w^2 + 8(1+i)w + 5) / w^2. Since the pole is at w = 0, we can find the residue by taking the coefficient of the term w^(-1) in the Laurent series expansion of f(w). In this case, the Laurent series expansion of f(w) is:\n\nf(w) = (w^3 + 4(1+i)w^2 + 8(1+i)w + 5) / w^2 = w + 4(1+i) + 8(1+i)/w + 5/w^2\n\nThe residue is the coefficient of the term 1/w, which is 8(1+i). Therefore, the residue of the complex function f(z) at the pole z = 1 + i is 8(1+i)."
