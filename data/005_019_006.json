If it is rainy today, there is a 70% chance that tomorrow will also be rainy. What is the probability that it will be sunny three days from now, given that it is sunny today?",
    "message_2": "Let S represent a sunny day and R represent a rainy day. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(S) = 0.7\nP(R) = 0.3\nP(S|S) = 0.6\nP(R|R) = 0.7\n\nWe want to find the probability P(S_3|S_1), where S_1 represents that it is sunny today, and S_3 represents that it is sunny three days from now.\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(S_3|S_1):\n\nP(S_3|S_1) = P(S_3|S_1, S_2) * P(S_2|S_1) + P(S_3|S_1, R_2) * P(R_2|S_1)\n\nWe know the following probabilities:\n\nP(S_2|S_1) = 0.6 (given)\nP(R_2|S_1) = 1 - P(S_2|S_1) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\nP(S_3|S_1, S_2) = P(S_3|S_2) = 0.6 (given)\nP(S_3|S_1, R_2) = P(S_3|R_2) = 1 - P(R_3|R_2) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n\nNow we can plug these probabilities into the equation:\n\nP(S_3|S_1) = P(S_3|S_1, S_2) * P(S_2|S_1) + P(S_3|S_1, R_2) * P(R_2|S_1)\nP(S_3|S_1) = (0.6 * 0.6) + (0.3 * 0.4)\nP(S_3|S_1) = 0.36 + 0.12\nP(S_3|S_1) = 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that it will be sunny three days from now, given that it is sunny today, is 0.48 or 48%."
