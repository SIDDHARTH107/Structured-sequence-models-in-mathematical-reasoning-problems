    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph of the original graph. The size of a clique is the number of vertices it contains.\n\nIn a graph with 7 vertices, the maximum clique size that can be formed is 7. This is because a complete graph with 7 vertices (K7) has every vertex connected to every other vertex, forming a clique of size 7."
