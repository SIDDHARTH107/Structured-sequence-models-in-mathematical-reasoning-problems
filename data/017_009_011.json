    "message_2": "First, we will prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 9, the only possible value for n_3 is 1. This means that there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which we will denote by P. Since P is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\n\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. This is because the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G is isomorphic to C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then it must have an element a of order 3 and an element b of order 9. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, the product of two elements from different cosets of P will also be in G. Let c = ab. Then, c is not in P, since a and b are not in the same coset of P.\n\nNow, we will show that G is generated by a and c. Since the order of G is 9, there are only 9 possible elements in G. We know that the identity element e, a, and a^2 are in G. We also know that c, ca, and ca^2 are in G, since they are in the coset of P generated by c. Finally, we know that c^2, c^2a, and c^2a^2 are in G, since they are in the coset of P generated by c^2. Thus, G is generated by a and c.\n\nNow, we will find the operation table of G. The elements of G are {e, a, a^2, c, ca, ca^2, c^2, c^2a, c^2a^2}. We can compute the product of any two elements using the following rules:\n\n1. a^3 = e\n2. c^3 = e\n3. ca = ac^2\n\nUsing these rules, we can compute the operation table of G:\n\n```\n   | e  a  a^2  c  ca  ca^2  c^2  c^2a  c^2a^2\n---+----------------------------------------\n e | e  a  a^2  c  ca  ca^2  c^2  c^2a  c^2a^2\n a | a  a^2 e   ca ca^2 c    c^2a c^2a^2 c^2\n a^2| a^2 e  a   ca^2 c  ca   c^2a^2 c^2 c^2a\n c | c  ca ca^2  c^2 c^2a c^2a^2 e  a   a^2\n ca| ca ca^2 c   c^2a c^2a^2 c^2  a^2 e   a\n ca^2|ca^2 c  ca  c^2a^2 c^2 c^2a a   a^2 e\n c^2| c^2 c^2a c^2a^2 e  a   a^2  c   ca  ca^2\n c^2a|c^2a c^2a^2 c^2  a^2 e   a   ca  ca^2 c\n c^2a^2|c^2a^2 c^2 c^2a a   a^2 e   ca^2 c  ca\n```\n\nThus, if G is non-abelian, it is isomorphic to the group with the above operation table.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9 with the operation table shown above."
