    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangles in each layer of the Sierpinski pyramid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the layer number.\n\nFor the 7th layer of the Sierpinski pyramid:\n\nNumber of triangles = 4^7 = 16,384\n\nSo, there are 16,384 triangles in the 7th layer of the Sierpinski pyramid."
