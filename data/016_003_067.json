    "message_2": "Calculating the exact area of the Mandelbrot set is an unsolved problem in mathematics. However, we can estimate the area of the Mandelbrot set within the given zoom box.\n\nThe zoom box is centered at the point (-0.745428, 0.113009) with a size of 0.02. This means that the box extends 0.01 units in each direction from the center point. The box's corners will be:\n\nTop-left: (-0.755428, 0.123009)\nTop-right: (-0.735428, 0.123009)\nBottom-left: (-0.755428, 0.103009)\nBottom-right: (-0.735428, 0.103009)\n\nTo estimate the area of the Mandelbrot set within this box, we can use a grid of points and check if each point is in the Mandelbrot set. The more points we use, the more accurate our estimate will be. However, this method can be computationally intensive.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined by the iterative function:\n\nz_n+1 = z_n^2 + c\n\nwhere z is a complex number, c is a complex constant, and n is the iteration number. A point (x, y) in the complex plane is in the Mandelbrot set if the sequence of complex numbers generated by this function remains bounded (i.e., does not go to infinity) as n goes to infinity.\n\nTo check if a point is in the Mandelbrot set, we can iterate the function a certain number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations) and see if the magnitude of z stays below a certain threshold (e.g., 2). If it does, we can consider the point to be in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nAfter checking all the points in the grid, we can count the number of points in the Mandelbrot set and divide it by the total number of points in the grid. This will give us an estimate of the proportion of the area of the Mandelbrot set within the zoom box. We can then multiply this proportion by the area of the zoom box (0.02 * 0.02 = 0.0004) to get an estimate of the area of the Mandelbrot set within the zoom box.\n\nPlease note that this method only provides an estimate, and the actual area of the Mandelbrot set within the zoom box may be different."
