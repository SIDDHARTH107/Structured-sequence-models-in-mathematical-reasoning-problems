    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(4,4) is the smallest integer n such that any graph with n vertices will contain either a clique of 4 vertices (a complete subgraph with 4 vertices) or an independent set of 4 vertices (a subgraph with 4 vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge). \n\nR(4,4) is known to be 18. This means that in any graph with 18 vertices, there will always be either a clique of 4 vertices or an independent set of 4 vertices."
