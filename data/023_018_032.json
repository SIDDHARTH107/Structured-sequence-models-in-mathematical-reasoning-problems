    "message_1": "A control engineer is designing a system and has determined the transfer function to be G(s) = (s+1)/(s^2 + 4s + 5). The engineer wants to analyze the system's frequency response using the Fourier transform. Using the Fourier transform, what is the value of the system's gain and phase shift at the input frequency of 2 Hz?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the system's frequency response, we need to replace \"s\" in the transfer function G(s) with \"jω\", where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1). The angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by ω = 2πf. In this case, the input frequency is 2 Hz, so ω = 2π(2) = 4π rad/s.\n\nNow, let's replace \"s\" with \"jω\" in the transfer function G(s):\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 1) / (ω^2 + 4jω + 5)\n\nSubstitute ω = 4π:\n\nG(j4π) = (j4π + 1) / ((4π)^2 + 4j(4π) + 5)\n\nG(j4π) = (j4π + 1) / (16π^2 + 16jπ + 5)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude (gain) and phase shift of G(j4π):\n\nGain = |G(j4π)| = sqrt(Real^2 + Imaginary^2)\nPhase shift = arctan(Imaginary / Real)\n\nReal part of G(j4π) = (1 * 5 - 16π^2) / (16π^2 + 5)\nImaginary part of G(j4π) = (j4π * 5 + j4π * 16π^2) / (16π^2 + 5)\n\nReal part of G(j4π) = -80π^2 / (16π^2 + 5)\nImaginary part of G(j4π) = 20π / (16π^2 + 5)\n\nGain = sqrt((-80π^2 / (16π^2 + 5))^2 + (20π / (16π^2 + 5))^2)\nPhase shift = arctan((20π / (16π^2 + 5)) / (-80π^2 / (16π^2 + 5)))\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\nGain ≈ 0.0197\nPhase shift ≈ -1.768 radians (≈ -101.34 degrees)\n\nSo, the system's gain at the input frequency of 2 Hz is approximately 0.0197, and the phase shift is approximately -1.768 radians or -101.34 degrees."
