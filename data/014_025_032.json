    "message_1": "Suppose you need to create a cryptographic hash function for a password database that accepts passwords with a maximum length of 10 characters. Each character can be any lowercase letter from a to z, and digits from 0 to 9. How many different possible passwords can be created?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of possible passwords, we need to consider the number of available characters and the maximum length of the password.\n\nThere are 26 lowercase letters (a to z) and 10 digits (0 to 9), so there are a total of 26 + 10 = 36 available characters.\n\nSince the maximum length of the password is 10 characters, we can have passwords of length 1 to 10. We need to calculate the number of possible passwords for each length and then sum them up.\n\nFor a password of length 1, there are 36 possibilities (1 character chosen from 36 available characters).\nFor a password of length 2, there are 36 * 36 = 36^2 possibilities.\nFor a password of length 3, there are 36 * 36 * 36 = 36^3 possibilities.\n...\nFor a password of length 10, there are 36^10 possibilities.\n\nSo, the total number of possible passwords is the sum of the possibilities for each length:\n\nTotal = 36^1 + 36^2 + 36^3 + ... + 36^10\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = 36, the common ratio r = 36, and n = 10 terms. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal = 36 * (1 - 36^10) / (1 - 36)\n\nTotal = 36 * (1 - 36^10) / (-35)\n\nTotal = 3,656,158,440,062,976 different possible passwords."
