    "message_2": "A group of order 10 has a size that is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 2 and 5. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since 10 = 2 * 5, there are two possibilities for the structure of an abelian group of order 10:\n\n1. A direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 5, respectively: C_2 x C_5. This group is isomorphic to the additive group Z_2 x Z_5, where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\n2. A single cyclic group of order 10: C_10. This group is isomorphic to the additive group Z_10.\n\nNow, we need to consider non-abelian groups of order 10. By Sylow's theorems, we know that there must be a subgroup of order 2 and a subgroup of order 5. Since both 2 and 5 are prime, these subgroups are cyclic and areomorphic to Z_2 and Z_5, respectively. Let H be the subgroup of order 2 and K be the subgroup of order 5.\n\nSince the index of H in the group G is 5 (which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G), H must be a normal subgroup of G. Therefore, we can form the semi-direct product of H and K, denoted as H ⋊ K. The semi-direct product depends on a homomorphism φ: K → Aut(H), where Aut(H) is the group of automorphisms of H.\n\nIn this case, H ≅ Z_2 and K ≅ Z_5. The group Aut(H) has only one non-trivial automorphism since H is of prime order. However, since |K| and |Aut(H)| are coprime (gcd(5, 2) = 1), the only homomorphism φ: K → Aut(H) is the trivial homomorphism, which maps all elements of K to the identity automorphism of H. This means that the semi-direct product H ⋊ K is actually a direct product, which is the abelian group Z_2 x Z_5 that we already considered.\n\nThus, there are only two distinct isomorphism classes for groups of order 10:\n\n1. The abelian group Z_2 x Z_5 (or C_2 x C_5).\n2. The cyclic group Z_10 (or C_10)."
