    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of a cylinder, we need to calculate the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) first. For a cylinder with radius R, the principal curvatures are given by:\n\nk1 = 1/R (curvature in the direction of the meridians)\nk2 = 0 (curvature in the direction of the parallels, since they are straight lines)\n\nIn this case, the radius of the cylinder is 4 units. However, we are interested in the curvature at a point located 3 units away from the central axis. This means that we need to consider a smaller cylinder with a radius of 3 units that is concentric with the original cylinder.\n\nSo, for the smaller cylinder with a radius of 3 units, the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = 1/3\nk2 = 0\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature (H) using the formula:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nH = (1/3 + 0) / 2\nH = (1/3) / 2\nH = 1/6\n\nThe mean curvature of the surface at a point located 3 units away from the cylinder's central axis is 1/6."
