    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. In this case, it is given that the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G is 4. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph G with 12 vertices is 4."
