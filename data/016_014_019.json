    "message_1": "What is the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve? \n\nHint: The Lévy C curve is formed by starting with a line segment and recursively replacing each line segment with four line segments of the same length, forming a pattern of connected squares. The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of the \"fractality\" of the curve.",
    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, each line segment is replaced by 4 line segments of the same length, so N = 4. The scaling factor r is the ratio of the length of the original line segment to the length of the new line segments. Since the new line segments form connected squares, the scaling factor r is 2 (each new segment is half the length of the original segment).\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(2) = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is 2."
