    "message_1": "A building is 60 meters tall. An observer stands 20 meters away from the building. If the observer sees the top of the building at an angle of elevation of 45 degrees, what is the height of the observer's eye from the ground?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle formed by the observer, the top of the building, and the base of the building. The angle of elevation is 45 degrees, the distance from the observer to the base of the building is 20 meters, and the height of the building is 60 meters.\n\nLet h be the height of the observer's eye from the ground. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the height of the building, and the distance from the observer to the building:\n\ntan(45) = (60 - h) / 20\n\nSince tan(45) = 1, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1 = (60 - h) / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\n20 = 60 - h\nh = 60 - 20\nh = 40 meters\n\nSo, the height of the observer's eye from the ground is 40 meters."
