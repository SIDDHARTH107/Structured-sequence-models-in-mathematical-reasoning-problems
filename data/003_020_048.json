    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the ladder forms a right-angled triangle with the wall and the ground.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall as a (a = 6 feet), the height where the ladder touches the wall as b, and the length of the ladder as c (c = 10 feet). According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n6^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n36 + b^2 = 100\n\nNext, we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\nb = √64\nb = 8\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all three sides of the triangle (a = 6, b = 8, and c = 10), we can find the angle between the ladder and the ground using the inverse tangent function (arctan):\n\nangle = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nangle = arctan(b/a)\nangle = arctan(8/6)\nangle ≈ 53.13°\n\nSo, the angle between the ladder and the ground is approximately 53.13°."
