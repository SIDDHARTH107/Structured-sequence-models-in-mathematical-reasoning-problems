    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1, we need to find the points where the second derivative changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative f'(x):\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative f''(x):\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to solve f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nNow we need to check the sign of f''(x) to the left and right of x = 2 to see if it changes sign:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6 (negative)\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6 (positive)\n\nSince the second derivative changes its sign at x = 2, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug x = 2 into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 1 = 8 - 24 + 18 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (2, 3)."
