    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of G, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the adjacency matrix and identifying the highest degree vertex. In this case, vertex 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have a degree of 3. We can assign the first color to vertex 1. Since vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, we need to assign a different color to vertex 2. Similarly, vertex 3 is adjacent to both vertex 1 and 2, so it needs a third color. Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 1, 2, and 3, so it can be colored with the first color.\n\nNow, vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 1, so it needs a different color. We can assign the second color to vertex 5. Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 2 and 5, so it needs a third color. Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 3 and 6, so it can be colored with the first color. Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 4 and 7, so it can be colored with the second color. Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 5, 6, 7, and 8, so it needs a fourth color. Finally, vertex 10 is adjacent to vertex 5 and 6, so it can be colored with the first color.\n\nThus, the chromatic number of G is 4."
