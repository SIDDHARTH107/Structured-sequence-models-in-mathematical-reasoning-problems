    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector that includes one-fourth of the pizza, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then divide it by 4.\n\nThe diameter of the pizza is 16 inches, so the radius (r) is half of that, which is 8 inches.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr².\n\nA = π(8²) = π(64) ≈ 201.06 square inches (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, to find the area of one-fourth of the pizza, we divide the total area by 4:\n\nArea of sector = 201.06 / 4 ≈ 50.27 square inches (rounded to two decimal places)"
