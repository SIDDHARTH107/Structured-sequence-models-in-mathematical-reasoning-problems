    "message_2": "To find the electromagnetic field on the curve, we need to first find the current distribution along the wire. Since the wire is bent into the curve y = sin(x), we can assume that the current distribution is proportional to the sine function. Let's denote the current distribution as I(x) = I_0 * sin(x), where I_0 is the amplitude of the current.\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to find the electromagnetic field. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] dx\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the current distribution I(x):\n\nI(k) = ∫[I_0 * sin(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] dx, where the integral is taken over the interval [0, 2π].\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = sin(x), dv = e^(-i*k*x) dx\ndu = cos(x) dx, v = -1/(i*k) * e^(-i*k*x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nI(k) = uv |[0, 2π] - ∫[v * du]\n\nI(k) = [-I_0/(i*k) * sin(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] |[0, 2π] + (I_0/(k^2)) * ∫[cos(x) * e^(-i*k*x) dx]\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero because sin(0) = sin(2π) = 0. Now we need to solve the integral in the second term. We can use integration by parts again:\n\nu = cos(x), dv = e^(-i*k*x) dx\ndu = -sin(x) dx, v = -1/(i*k) * e^(-i*k*x)\n\nApplying integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[cos(x) * e^(-i*k*x) dx] = uv |[0, 2π] - ∫[v * du]\n\n= [-1/(i*k) * cos(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] |[0, 2π] + (1/(k^2)) * ∫[sin(x) * e^(-i*k*x) dx]\n\nThe second term in this expression is the same as the original integral we wanted to solve. Let's denote this integral as J(k):\n\nJ(k) = [-1/(i*k) * cos(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] |[0, 2π] + (1/(k^2)) * J(k)\n\nNow we can solve for J(k):\n\nJ(k) * (1 - 1/(k^2)) = [-1/(i*k) * cos(x) * e^(-i*k*x)] |[0, 2π]\n\nJ(k) = [-1/(i*k) * cos(x) * e^(-i*k*x) * (k^2 / (k^2 - 1))] |[0, 2π]\n\nEvaluating the expression at the limits:\n\nJ(k) = [-1/(i*k) * (cos(2π) * e^(0) - cos(0) * e^(0)) * (k^2 / (k^2 - 1))]\n\nJ(k) = [-1/(i*k) * (1 - 1) * (k^2 / (k^2 - 1))] = 0\n\nSince J(k) = 0, the Fourier transform of the current distribution I(k) is:\n\nI(k) = (I_0/(k^2)) * J(k) = 0\n\nThis result indicates that the electromagnetic field on the curve is zero. This is because the current distribution is symmetric and the positive and negative contributions to the field cancel each other out."
