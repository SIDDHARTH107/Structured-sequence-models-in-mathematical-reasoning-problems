    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (7x - 5)/(4x + 3) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function (u) and the denominator function (v). In this case, u(x) = 7x - 5 and v(x) = 4x + 3.\n\nThe quotient rule states that if f(x) = u(x)/v(x), then the derivative f'(x) = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x))/[v(x)]^2.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(7x - 5)/dx = 7\nv'(x) = d(4x + 3)/dx = 4\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = [(4x + 3) * 7 - (7x - 5) * 4]/(4x + 3)^2\n\nf'(x) = [(28x + 21) - (28x - 20)]/(4x + 3)^2\n\nf'(x) = (28x + 21 - 28x + 20)/(4x + 3)^2\n\nf'(x) = (41)/(4x + 3)^2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (7x - 5)/(4x + 3) is f'(x) = 41/(4x + 3)^2."
