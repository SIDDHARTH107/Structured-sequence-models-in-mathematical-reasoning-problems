Differentiate 3x^4:\n   d/dx(3x^4) = 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3\n\n2. Differentiate -2x^3:\n   d/dx(-2x^3) = 3 * (-2)x^(3-1) = -6x^2\n\n3. Differentiate 5x^2:\n   d/dx(5x^2) = 2 * 5x^(2-1) = 10x\n\n4. Differentiate -6x:\n   d/dx(-6x) = -6x^(1-1) = -6\n\n5. Differentiate 2 (constant term):\n   d/dx(2) = 0 (since the derivative of a constant is 0)\n\nNow, we will combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 6"
