    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. Find its surface area.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 5 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(5^2) = 25π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 * 25π = 50π square centimeters\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 12 cm:\n\nA = 2π(5)(12) = 120π square centimeters\n\nNow, we add the area of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cylinder:\n\nTotal surface area = 50π + 120π = 170π square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is 170π square centimeters."
