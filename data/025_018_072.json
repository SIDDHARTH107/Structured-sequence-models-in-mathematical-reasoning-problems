What is the geometric intersection number C.D?",
    "message_2": "To show that C.(C-K_X) ≥ 0, we will use the Hodge Index Theorem. The Hodge Index Theorem states that for a smooth complex projective surface X with ample divisor H, the intersection form on the Néron-Severi group NS(X) is negative definite on the orthogonal complement of H. Since C.H > 0, C is not orthogonal to H, so we can apply the Hodge Index Theorem.\n\nLet L = C - K_X. Then, we have:\n\nC.(C-K_X) = C.L = (C+K_X).L = C.L + K_X.L\n\nBy the Hodge Index Theorem, we have:\n\nC.L * H.L - (C.H)^2 < 0\n\nSince H is ample, H.L > 0. Thus, we have:\n\nC.L > (C.H)^2 / H.L\n\nSince C.H > 0, it follows that C.L > 0. Therefore, C.(C-K_X) = C.L > 0.\n\nNow, we will prove that C.(C-K_X) > 0 if and only if C is in the Mori chamber determined by the pair (H, K_X). By definition, a curve C is in the Mori chamber determined by the pair (H, K_X) if and only if C.H > 0 and C.(K_X - C) > 0. We have already shown that C.H > 0, so we only need to show that C.(K_X - C) > 0.\n\nC.(K_X - C) = C.K_X - C^2 = K_X.C - C^2 = (C - K_X).C = C.(C - K_X)\n\nThus, C.(C-K_X) > 0 if and only if C is in the Mori chamber determined by the pair (H, K_X).\n\nFinally, let X be a cubic surface in P^3, and let C be a line on X. Since X is a cubic surface, its canonical divisor K_X is given by K_X = -3H, where H is the hyperplane section divisor. We want to find a curve D on X such that D.(D-K_X) = 0.\n\nLet D = aC, where a is a positive integer. Then, we have:\n\nD.(D-K_X) = aC.(aC + 3H) = a^2C^2 + 3aCH\n\nSince C is a line on a cubic surface, we have C^2 = 0 and C.H = 1. Thus, D.(D-K_X) = 3a. To satisfy D.(D-K_X) = 0, we must have a = 0, but this would mean D is the zero divisor, which is not a curve. Therefore, there is no such curve D on X that satisfies D.(D-K_X) = 0.\n\nHowever, we can find a unique curve D' on X such that D'.(D'-K_X) = 1. Let D' = C + H. Then, we have:\n\nD'.(D'-K_X) = (C+H).(C+H+3H) = C.(C+4H) + H.(C+4H) = 4CH + 4H^2 = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSince D'.(D'-K_X) = 8, D' intersects C transversely at a single point. The geometric intersection number C.D' is given by the intersection product C.D' = C.(C+H) = CH = 1."
