    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 17, where 17 is a prime number. We want to show that G is a cyclic group.\n\nSince the order of G is 17, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element a in G must divide 17. Since 17 is prime, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 17. The identity element e of G has order 1, so any other element a in G must have order 17.\n\nNow, let's take any non-identity element a in G. Since a has order 17, the subgroup generated by a, denoted by ⟨a⟩, has 17 elements. Recall that ⟨a⟩ = {a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^16}, where a^0 = e.\n\nSince G has 17 elements and ⟨a⟩ has 17 elements, we can conclude that G = ⟨a⟩. This means that G is generated by a single element a, and therefore, G is a cyclic group.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of prime order (in this case, order 17) is cyclic."
