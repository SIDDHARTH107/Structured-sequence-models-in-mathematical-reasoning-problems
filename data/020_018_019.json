    "message_1": "Two companies, A and B, are competing in a market with demand expressed as Q = 1000 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. Each company can produce at a cost of $300 per unit. Company A's marginal cost is constant at $300, while company B's marginal cost is $100 at low levels of production (less than or equal to 200), and $500 at high levels of production (greater than 200). What should the price be and what should the production levels of both companies be in order to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, each company should produce at the level where its marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR). Since both companies are competing in the same market, they face the same demand curve, Q = 1000 - P. First, we need to find the inverse demand function, which gives us the price as a function of quantity:\n\nP = 1000 - Q\n\nNow, we can find the marginal revenue (MR) by taking the derivative of the total revenue (TR) with respect to Q. Total revenue is given by the product of price and quantity:\n\nTR = P * Q = (1000 - Q) * Q = 1000Q - Q^2\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to Q, we get:\n\nMR = d(TR)/dQ = 1000 - 2Q\n\nNow, we need to find the production levels for each company where their marginal cost equals the marginal revenue.\n\nFor Company A, the marginal cost is constant at $300. Setting MC equal to MR, we get:\n\n300 = 1000 - 2Q_A\n2Q_A = 700\nQ_A = 350\n\nFor Company B, we have two cases to consider: low levels of production (MC = $100) and high levels of production (MC = $500).\n\nCase 1: Low levels of production (MC = $100)\n100 = 1000 - 2Q_B\n2Q_B = 900\nQ_B = 450\n\nHowever, this solution is not valid because it exceeds the low production level limit of 200 units. So, we need to consider the second case.\n\nCase 2: High levels of production (MC = $500)\n500 = 1000 - 2Q_B\n2Q_B = 500\nQ_B = 250\n\nNow, we have the production levels for both companies: Q_A = 350 and Q_B = 250. The total quantity produced in the market is:\n\nQ_total = Q_A + Q_B = 350 + 250 = 600\n\nUsing the inverse demand function, we can find the market price:\n\nP = 1000 - Q_total = 1000 - 600 = $400\n\nSo, the price should be $400, with Company A producing 350 units and Company B producing 250 units to maximize their profits."
