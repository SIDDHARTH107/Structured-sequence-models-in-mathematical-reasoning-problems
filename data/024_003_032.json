    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to u and v.\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = 2uv\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = u^2\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = 1\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = -2v\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 1\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = 3v^2\n\nNow, let's compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_u, y_u, z_u)> = (2uv)^2 + 1^2 + 1^2\nF = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = 2uv*u^2 + 1*(-2v) + 1*(3v^2)\nG = <(x_v, y_v, z_v), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = u^4 + (-2v)^2 + (3v^2)^2\n\nNext, we need to compute the second fundamental form coefficients. We'll find the second partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to u and v:\n\nx_uu = ∂²x/∂u² = 2v\nx_uv = ∂²x/∂u∂v = 2u\nx_vv = ∂²x/∂v² = 0\ny_uu = ∂²y/∂u² = 0\ny_uv = ∂²y/∂u∂v = 0\ny_vv = ∂²y/∂v² = -2\nz_uu = ∂²z/∂u² = 0\nz_uv = ∂²z/∂u∂v = 0\nz_vv = ∂²z/∂v² = 6v\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <(x_uu, y_uu, z_uu), (x_u, y_u, z_u)> = 2v*(2uv) + 0*1 + 0*1\nM = <(x_uv, y_uv, z_uv), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = 2u*u^2 + 0*(-2v) + 0*(3v^2)\nN = <(x_vv, y_vv, z_vv), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = 0*u^4 + (-2)*(-2v) + 6v*(3v^2)\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1), we have:\n\nE(1,1) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6\nF(1,1) = 2 - 2 + 3 = 3\nG(1,1) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14\nL(1,1) = 2\nM(1,1) = 2\nN(1,1) = -4 + 6 = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1,1):\n\nK(1,1) = (2*2 - 2^2) / (6*14 - 3^2) = (4 - 4) / (84 - 9) = 0 / 75 = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1,1) is 0."
