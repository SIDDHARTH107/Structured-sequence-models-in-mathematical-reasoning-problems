    "message_1": "Consider the language of arithmetic which consists of the usual symbols of arithmetic, \"+\", \"×\", \"=\", the constant \"0\", and variables for all natural numbers. Let L be the language of arithmetic and T the set of all true statements in L. \n\nLet S be a sentence given by the formula ∀x∃y(x + y = 1), where ∀ denotes for all and ∃ denotes there exists. Determine if S is true or false in the standard interpretation.",
    "message_2": "In the standard interpretation, the sentence S states that for every natural number x, there exists a natural number y such that their sum is equal to 1. Let's examine this statement.\n\nIf x = 0, then we can find a natural number y = 1, such that x + y = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nHowever, if x = 1 (or any other natural number greater than 0), we cannot find a natural number y such that x + y = 1. This is because the smallest natural number greater than 0 is 1, and 1 + 1 = 2, which is not equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, the sentence S is false in the standard interpretation, as there does not exist a natural number y for every natural number x such that x + y = 1."
