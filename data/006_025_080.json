    "message_1": "What is the probability that at least 5 out of the 10 songs played in a concert will be from the audience's top 10 favorite list, assuming there are 20 songs total in the playlist and the top 10 favorite songs have been pre-selected by the organizers?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations and the binomial coefficient. We want to find the probability of having at least 5 favorite songs out of the 10 played, which means we need to consider the cases where there are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 favorite songs played.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 10 songs out of the 20-song playlist. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(20, 10) = 20! / (10! * 10!) = 184,756\n\nNow, let's find the probabilities for each case:\n\n1. 5 favorite songs and 5 non-favorite songs:\nC(10, 5) * C(10, 5) / C(20, 10) = (252 * 252) / 184,756 = 0.3022\n\n2. 6 favorite songs and 4 non-favorite songs:\nC(10, 6) * C(10, 4) / C(20, 10) = (210 * 210) / 184,756 = 0.2393\n\n3. 7 favorite songs and 3 non-favorite songs:\nC(10, 7) * C(10, 3) / C(20, 10) = (120 * 120) / 184,756 = 0.0776\n\n4. 8 favorite songs and 2 non-favorite songs:\nC(10, 8) * C(10, 2) / C(20, 10) = (45 * 45) / 184,756 = 0.0109\n\n5. 9 favorite songs and 1 non-favorite song:\nC(10, 9) * C(10, 1) / C(20, 10) = (10 * 10) / 184,756 = 0.0005\n\n6. 10 favorite songs and 0 non-favorite songs:\nC(10, 10) * C(10, 0) / C(20, 10) = (1 * 1) / 184,756 = 0.00001\n\nNow, we add up the probabilities for each case:\n\n0.3022 + 0.2393 + 0.0776 + 0.0109 + 0.0005 + 0.00001 â‰ˆ 0.6305\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 out of the 10 songs played in the concert will be from the audience's top 10 favorite list is approximately 63.05%."
