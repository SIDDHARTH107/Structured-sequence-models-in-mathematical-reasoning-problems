    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs knows that 2% of the bulbs produced are defective. If a store orders 500 light bulbs, what is the probability that 10 or more of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective bulbs from n total bulbs, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the total number of bulbs (in this case, 500)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs (in this case, we want to find the probability of having 10 or more defective bulbs)\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (in this case, 0.02)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a bulb not being defective (in this case, 0.98)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having 10 or more defective bulbs, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 10 to k = 500:\n\nP(X >= 10) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + ... + P(X = 500)\n\nCalculating this sum directly would be computationally intensive, so we can use the complement rule to simplify the calculation:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to k = 9 using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.815\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having 10 or more defective bulbs:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.815 ≈ 0.185\n\nSo, the probability that 10 or more bulbs will be defective is approximately 0.185 or 18.5%."
