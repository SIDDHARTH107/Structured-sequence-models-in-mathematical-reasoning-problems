    "message_2": "To find the volume of water in the cone, we can use the method of integration. First, we need to find the equation for the radius of the cone at any given height.\n\nSince the height and radius of the cone are proportional, we can set up the following proportion:\n\nr / h = 4 / 10\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr(h) = (2/5)h\n\nNow, we can find the volume of a thin disk at height h with thickness dh:\n\ndV = π[r(h)]^2 dh\n\nSubstitute the expression for r(h):\n\ndV = π[(2/5)h]^2 dh\n\ndV = (4π/25)h^2 dh\n\nNow, we can integrate this expression with respect to h from 0 to 8 (since the water fills the cone up to a height of 8 cm):\n\nV = ∫(4π/25)h^2 dh from 0 to 8\n\nV = (4π/25) ∫h^2 dh from 0 to 8\n\nNow, integrate h^2 with respect to h:\n\nV = (4π/25) * (1/3)h^3 | from 0 to 8\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = (4π/25) * (1/3) * (8^3 - 0^3)\n\nV = (4π/25) * (1/3) * 512\n\nV = (4π/75) * 512\n\nV = 1024π/25\n\nSo, the volume of water in the cone is (1024π/25) cm³."
