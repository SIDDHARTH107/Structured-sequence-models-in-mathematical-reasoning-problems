    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 in the interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 6, which occurs at x = 1 and x = 4, and the minimum value is 2, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 3."
