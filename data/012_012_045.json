    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of G, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum number of edges in a graph with 10 vertices without any cycles (i.e., a tree). This can be done using the formula: E = V - 1, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. In this case, E = 10 - 1 = 9.\n\n2. Since G has 14 edges, which is 5 more than the maximum number of edges in a tree with 10 vertices, there must be at least one cycle in G.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the shortest cycle. The shortest possible cycle in an undirected graph is a triangle, which has a length of 3. Let's check if G can have a triangle.\n\n4. In a graph with 10 vertices, the maximum number of triangles can be formed using the Tur√°n's theorem, which states that for a graph with n vertices and no complete subgraph with r+1 vertices, the maximum number of edges is given by:\n\nE(T(n,r)) = (r-1)n^2 / (2r)\n\nFor a triangle-free graph, r = 2. So, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with 10 vertices is:\n\nE(T(10,2)) = (2-1) * 10^2 / (2*2) = 25\n\n5. Since G has 14 edges, which is less than 25, it is possible that G does not have any triangles. However, we cannot conclude this for sure without more information about the specific graph G.\n\nIn conclusion, the girth of G is either 3 (if there is a triangle) or greater than 3 (if there is no triangle). Without more information about the specific graph G, we cannot determine the exact girth."
