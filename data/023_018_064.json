    "message_1": "Given a control system with a transfer function H(s) = (5s^2 + 10s + 7)/(s^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4), use the Fourier transform to determine the frequency response of the system at a frequency of 10Hz.",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency response of the system at a frequency of 10 Hz, we need to substitute s = jω into the transfer function H(s), where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit. The angular frequency ω is related to the frequency f by the equation ω = 2πf.\n\nGiven the frequency f = 10 Hz, we can calculate the angular frequency ω:\n\nω = 2πf = 2π(10) = 20π rad/s\n\nNow, we substitute s = jω into the transfer function H(s):\n\nH(jω) = (5(jω)^2 + 10(jω) + 7)/((jω)^3 + 2(jω)^2 + 3(jω) + 4)\n\nH(j20π) = (5(j20π)^2 + 10(j20π) + 7)/((j20π)^3 + 2(j20π)^2 + 3(j20π) + 4)\n\nNow, we need to simplify the expression:\n\nH(j20π) = (5(-400π^2) + 10(j20π) + 7)/((-8000π^3j) + 2(-400π^2) + 3(j20π) + 4)\n\nH(j20π) = (-2000π^2 + 200πj + 7)/(4 - 800π^2 - 8000π^3j + 60πj)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude and phase of the frequency response:\n\nMagnitude: |H(j20π)| = sqrt((real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2)\n\n|H(j20π)| = sqrt(((-2000π^2 + 7)/(4 - 800π^2))^2 + ((200π + 60π)/(-8000π^3))^2)\n\nPhase: θ = arctan(imaginary part / real part)\n\nθ = arctan(((200π + 60π)/(-8000π^3))/((-2000π^2 + 7)/(4 - 800π^2)))\n\nNow, you can use a calculator to find the numerical values for the magnitude and phase of the frequency response at 10 Hz."
