    "message_2": "To evaluate the product of theta functions, we first need to find the half-periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 2$. The half-periods are related to the periods of the curve, which are the integrals of the differential form $\\frac{dx}{y}$ over the homology basis of the curve.\n\nLet's first find the invariants $g_2$ and $g_3$ of the curve. We can rewrite the given equation as $y^2 = 4x^3 - 12x - 16$, which is in the Weierstrass normal form $y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2x - g_3$. Comparing the coefficients, we have $g_2 = 12$ and $g_3 = 16$.\n\nNow, we can use the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function to find the half-periods. The $\\wp$-function satisfies the differential equation $\\left(\\frac{d\\wp}{dz}\\right)^2 = 4\\wp^3 - g_2\\wp - g_3$. The half-periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are the solutions to the equation $\\wp(\\omega_i) = 0$.\n\nTo find the half-periods, we need to compute the integrals of the form $\\int_{\\infty}^x \\frac{dx}{y}$, where $x$ is a point on the curve. These integrals can be computed numerically, but they are generally difficult to compute analytically. For the purpose of this problem, we will denote the half-periods by $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ without computing them explicitly.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the theta function $\\theta(z|\\tau)$, where $\\tau = \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}$ is the modular parameter of the curve. The theta function is defined as:\n\n$$\\theta(z|\\tau) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\tau + 2\\pi i n z}$$\n\nWe want to evaluate $\\theta(1+i|\\tau)\\cdot\\theta(2-i|\\tau)$. Using the definition of the theta function, we have:\n\n$$\\theta(1+i|\\tau)\\cdot\\theta(2-i|\\tau) = \\left(\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\tau + 2\\pi i n (1+i)}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i m^2 \\tau + 2\\pi i m (2-i)}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can expand the product of the two sums:\n\n$$\\theta(1+i|\\tau)\\cdot\\theta(2-i|\\tau) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i (n^2+m^2) \\tau + 2\\pi i n (1+i) + 2\\pi i m (2-i)}$$\n\nThis expression represents the product of the theta functions $\\theta(1+i|\\tau)$ and $\\theta(2-i|\\tau)$. Note that the expression is still in terms of the half-periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, which we did not compute explicitly. In general, the product of theta functions can be quite complicated, and further simplification may not be possible without more information about the curve or the specific values of $\\tau$."
