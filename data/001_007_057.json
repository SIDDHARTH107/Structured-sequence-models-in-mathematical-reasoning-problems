    "message_2": "To solve the inequality -4x + 5 > 13, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality.\n-4x + 5 - 5 > 13 - 5\n-4x > 8\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by -4. Since we are dividing by a negative number, we need to reverse the inequality sign.\nx < -2\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < -2."
