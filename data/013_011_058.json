    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition with identical cost structures, both firms will set their prices equal to their marginal costs to maximize profits. Since the firms have identical cost structures, they will choose the same price. Let's denote the marginal cost as MC.\n\nThe market demand function is given by P = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the quantity demanded. Since both firms set their prices equal to MC, we can write the demand function as:\n\nMC = 100 - Q\n\nNow, we need to find the equilibrium quantity (Q) and price (P). Since both firms have the same price, the total quantity demanded in the market will be split equally between the two firms. Let's denote the quantity produced by each firm as q1 and q2. Then, Q = q1 + q2.\n\nIn equilibrium, both firms will produce the same quantity, so q1 = q2. Therefore, Q = 2q1 or Q = 2q2.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for Q back into the demand function:\n\nMC = 100 - 2q1\n\nTo find the equilibrium quantity (q1) and price (MC), we need information about the firms' cost structures. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact values for the equilibrium price and quantity. However, we can say that the equilibrium price will be equal to the marginal cost, and the equilibrium quantity will be determined by the demand function and the firms' cost structures."
