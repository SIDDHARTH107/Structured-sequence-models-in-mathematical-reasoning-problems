    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first five perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 33,550,336.\n\nThe sixth perfect number can be found using the formula for even perfect numbers, which is given by (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers (these primes are called Mersenne primes).\n\nThe first five pairs of (p, 2^p - 1) that produce perfect numbers are:\n(2, 3), (3, 7), (5, 31), (7, 127), and (13, 8191).\n\nThe next Mersenne prime is 2^17 - 1 = 131071, where p = 17. So, the sixth perfect number is (2^(17-1)) * (2^17 - 1) = 131,072 * 131,071 = 8,589,869,056."
