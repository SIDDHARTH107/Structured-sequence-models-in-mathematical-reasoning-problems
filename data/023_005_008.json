    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the bar at any time t using Fourier transform, we need to solve the heat equation with the given initial condition. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u(x,t)/∂t = k * ∂²u(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution along the bar at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity of the metal.\n\nThe initial condition is:\n\nu(x,0) = sin((πx)/L)\n\nSince the bar is held at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = u(2L,t) = 0\n\nNow, we will use the method of separation of variables to solve the heat equation. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * dT(t)/dt = k * T(t) * d²X(x)/dx²\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t)) * dT(t)/dt = k * (1/X(x)) * d²X(x)/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/T(t)) * dT(t)/dt = -λ\nk * (1/X(x)) * d²X(x)/dx² = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. dT(t)/dt = -λT(t)\n2. d²X(x)/dx² = -(λ/k)X(x)\n\nThe general solution to the first equation is:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = X(2L) = 0. The general solution to this equation is:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(ωx) + B * cos(ωx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and ω² = λ/k.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = B = 0\nX(2L) = A * sin(2ωL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(2ωL) = 0. This implies that:\n\n2ωL = nπ\n\nwhere n is an integer. Thus, the eigenvalues are:\n\nλ_n = (n²π²k)/(4L²)\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\nX_n(x) = sin((nπx)/(2L))\n\nNow, we can write the general solution to the heat equation as a sum of these eigenfunctions:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[C_n * sin((nπx)/(2L)) * e^(-(n²π²kt)/(4L²))]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = sin((πx)/L) = ∑[C_n * sin((nπx)/(2L))]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and we can find the coefficients using the orthogonality of the sine functions:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[sin((πx)/L) * sin((nπx)/(2L)) dx] from 0 to 2L\n\nFor n = 1, we have:\n\nC_1 = (2/L) * ∫[sin((πx)/L) * sin((πx)/L) dx] from 0 to 2L\nC_1 = 1\n\nFor n > 1, we have:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[sin((πx)/L) * sin((nπx)/(2L)) dx] from 0 to 2L\nC_n = 0\n\nSo, the temperature distribution along the bar at any time t is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin((πx)/L) * e^(-(π²kt)/(4L²))"
