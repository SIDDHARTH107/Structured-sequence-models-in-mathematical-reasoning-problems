    "message_1": "A steel rod with a length of 1 meter and a diameter of 5 cm is initially at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. If the rod is suddenly immersed in 0 degree Celsius water, how long will it take for the temperature at the center of the rod to reach 50 degrees Celsius? Use Fourier transform to solve the heat transfer problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the Fourier transform method. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material (for steel, α ≈ 1.2 x 10⁻⁵ m²/s).\n\nThe initial condition is T(x, 0) = 100°C for 0 < x < L (L = 1 m is the length of the rod). The boundary conditions are T(0, t) = T(L, t) = 0°C for t > 0.\n\nWe will use the Fourier transform method to solve the heat equation. First, we will apply the Fourier sine transform to the heat equation and the initial condition:\n\nT(x, s) = ∫₀^L T(x, t) sin(kx) dt\n\nwhere k = nπ/L, and n is an integer.\n\nNow, we will solve the transformed equation for T(x, s) and then apply the inverse Fourier sine transform to obtain the solution T(x, t):\n\nT(x, t) = (2/L) ∑(T(x, s) sin(kx) e^(-αk²t))\n\nWe want to find the time t when the temperature at the center of the rod (x = L/2) reaches 50°C:\n\n50 = (2/L) ∑(T(x, s) sin(kx) e^(-αk²t))\n\nNow, we will find T(x, s) by applying the Fourier sine transform to the initial condition:\n\nT(x, s) = (2/L) ∫₀^L 100 sin(kx) dx = (200/k) (1 - cos(kL))\n\nNow, we can substitute T(x, s) into the equation for T(x, t) and solve for t when x = L/2:\n\n50 = (2/L) ∑((200/k) (1 - cos(kL)) sin(kx) e^(-αk²t))\n\n50 = ∑((200/nπ) (1 - cos(nπ)) sin(nπ/2) e^(-α(nπ/L)²t))\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ/2) is nonzero only for odd n, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n50 = ∑((400/(nπ))((-1)^(n-1)/2) e^(-α(nπ/L)²t))\n\nNow, we can solve for t numerically using a suitable convergence criterion for the sum. Using a computer or calculator, we find that it takes approximately t ≈ 565 seconds for the temperature at the center of the rod to reach 50°C."
