    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a set of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the behavior of a dynamical system. The equations are:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to analyze the stability of the system. This can be done numerically using various algorithms, such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm. Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform these numerical calculations directly.\n\nHowever, I can tell you that for the given parameters (a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7), the Rössler system exhibits chaotic behavior. The maximum Lyapunov exponent is positive, which indicates the presence of chaos. To find the exact value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent, you would need to use a numerical method or software that can perform the calculations."
