    "message_1": "Suppose that the current stock price of XYZ company is $100 and the probability of its stock price increasing tomorrow is 40%. What is the probability that the stock price of XYZ company will increase by 10% tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the distribution of possible stock price increases. The given information only tells us the probability of the stock price increasing, but not the specific probability of it increasing by 10%. \n\nIf we had information about the distribution of possible stock price increases, we could calculate the probability of a 10% increase. For example, if we knew that the stock price increases were uniformly distributed between 1% and 20%, we could calculate the probability of a 10% increase. However, without this additional information, we cannot determine the probability of a 10% increase in the stock price of XYZ company tomorrow."
