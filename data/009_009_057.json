    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the wave function of the particle in its lowest energy state (n=1) using the Schrödinger equation. Then, we will use the wave function to find the probability of finding the particle in the middle of the box.\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box, the wave function is given by:\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere L is the width of the box, n is the energy level, and x is the position.\n\nIn this case, L = 5 nm = 5 * 10^-9 m, and n = 1 (lowest energy state).\n\nSo, the wave function for the particle in its lowest energy state is:\n\nΨ(x) = √(2/5 * 10^-9) * sin(πx/(5 * 10^-9))\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of finding the particle in the middle of the box, which corresponds to x = L/2 = 2.5 * 10^-9 m.\n\nTo find the probability, we need to square the wave function:\n\n|Ψ(x)|^2 = (2/5 * 10^-9) * sin^2(πx/(5 * 10^-9))\n\nNow, we plug in x = 2.5 * 10^-9 m:\n\n|Ψ(2.5 * 10^-9)|^2 = (2/5 * 10^-9) * sin^2(π(2.5 * 10^-9)/(5 * 10^-9))\n\n|Ψ(2.5 * 10^-9)|^2 = (2/5 * 10^-9) * sin^2(π/2)\n\nSince sin(π/2) = 1:\n\n|Ψ(2.5 * 10^-9)|^2 = (2/5 * 10^-9)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the middle of the box is:\n\nP(x = 2.5 * 10^-9) = 2/5 * 10^-9 = 4 * 10^-10\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle in the middle of the box is 4 * 10^-10."
