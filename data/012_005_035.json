Given a graph with n = 7 vertices and the following edge set E = {(1,2), (1,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,6), (5,7)}, determine the diameter of the graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices. Let's first list the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices:\n\n1.

Therefore, the diameter of the graph d(G) is 4."
