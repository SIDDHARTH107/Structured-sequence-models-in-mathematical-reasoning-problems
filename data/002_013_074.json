    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 5 meters by 8 meters and has a height of 12 meters. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base_area is the area of the rectangular base, which can be found by multiplying the length and width:\n\nbase_area = 5 meters * 8 meters = 40 square meters\n\nNow, we can plug the base_area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 40 square meters * 12 meters = (40/3) * 12 cubic meters = 160 cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic meters."
