    "message_1": "Suppose a company's network has 50 computers and the probability of a cyber attack occurring on any one of these computers on a given day is 0.06. What is the probability that at least 3 computers will be attacked on a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 3 computers will be attacked on a given day, we can use the complementary probability, which means we will find the probability that 0, 1, or 2 computers are attacked and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet X be the number of computers attacked. We can model this situation using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of computers (50), k is the number of computers attacked, p is the probability of a cyber attack on a single computer (0.06), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, we'll find the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 computers being attacked:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.06)^0 * (1-0.06)^(50-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.94)^50 ≈ 0.000002\n\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.06)^1 * (1-0.06)^(50-1)\nP(X = 1) = 50 * 0.06 * (0.94)^49 ≈ 0.000104\n\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.06)^2 * (1-0.06)^(50-2)\nP(X = 2) = 1225 * 0.0036 * (0.94)^48 ≈ 0.0024\n\nNow, we'll find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2)\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - 0.000002 - 0.000104 - 0.0024\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.997494\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 computers will be attacked on a given day is approximately 0.9975 or 99.75%."
