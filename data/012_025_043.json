    "message_2": "To determine whether there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in G, we can use Dirac's theorem as a sufficient condition. Dirac's theorem states that if a graph G has n vertices (n â‰¥ 3) and the degree of each vertex is at least n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nIn our case, G has 10 vertices, so n = 10. Therefore, n/2 = 5. Now, we need to check if the degree of each vertex is at least 5.\n\nSince G has 25 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 25 = 50. The average degree of a vertex in G is 50/10 = 5. This means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 5 or more. However, this does not guarantee that all vertices have a degree of at least 5.\n\nWithout more information about the specific structure of G, we cannot definitively determine whether there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in G or not. If G does have a Hamiltonian cycle, we would need more information about the connections between vertices to provide a specific Hamiltonian cycle."
