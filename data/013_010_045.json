    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve, based on Cournot Competition:\n\nSuppose there are two firms, A and B, producing identical products. The inverse demand function for the product is P = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The marginal cost for Firm A is MCa = 20 and the marginal cost for Firm B is MCb = 30. Assuming that both firms act as Cournot competitors (that is, they simultaneously choose their quantities), what will be the quantity produced by each firm and the resulting price in equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot equilibrium, we need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity a firm should produce given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by Firm A and Firm B, respectively. The total quantity produced, Q, is given by Q = qA + qB.\n\nThe revenue for Firm A is given by R_A = P * qA = (100 - Q) * qA = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qA.\nThe cost for Firm A is given by C_A = MCa * qA = 20 * qA.\n\nThe profit for Firm A is given by π_A = R_A - C_A = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 20 * qA.\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm A will choose qA such that the derivative of its profit with respect to qA is equal to zero:\n\nd(π_A)/dqA = (100 - 2*qA - qB) - 20 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the reaction function for Firm B. The revenue for Firm B is given by R_B = P * qB = (100 - Q) * qB = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qB.\nThe cost for Firm B is given by C_B = MCb * qB = 30 * qB.\n\nThe profit for Firm B is given by π_B = R_B - C_B = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 30 * qB.\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm B will choose qB such that the derivative of its profit with respect to qB is equal to zero:\n\nd(π_B)/dqB = (100 - qA - 2*qB) - 30 = 0.\n\nNow we have the reaction functions for both firms:\n\nFirm A: qA = (80 - qB)/2\nFirm B: qB = (70 - qA)/2\n\nTo find the Cournot equilibrium, we need to solve this system of equations:\n\nqA = (80 - qB)/2\nqB = (70 - qA)/2\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n2*qA = 80 - qB\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\nqB = (70 - (80 - qB))/2\nqB = (70 - 80 + qB)/2\nqB = (-10 + qB)/2\n\nMultiplying by 2, we get:\n\n2*qB = -10 + qB\n\nSolving for qB, we find:\n\nqB = 10\n\nNow, substitute qB back into the first equation:\n\nqA = (80 - 10)/2\nqA = 70/2\nqA = 35\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, Firm A produces 35 units, Firm B produces 10 units, and the total quantity produced is Q = qA + qB = 35 + 10 = 45.\n\nThe resulting price in equilibrium can be found using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - 45 = 55\n\nThus, the Cournot equilibrium quantities are qA = 35, qB = 10, and the resulting price is P = 55."
