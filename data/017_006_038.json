    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has the order as the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders.\n\nSince 35 = 5 * 7, the group of order 35 can be expressed as the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 7. In other words, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, which can be denoted as Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nMoreover, if the group is cyclic, it must have an element of order 35. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an element in the group Z_5 × Z_7 whose order is the least common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35. Therefore, the group is also cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, the group of order 35 is both cyclic and isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
