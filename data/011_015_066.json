    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person in the party, say person A. There are 5 other people in the party, and each of them either knows A or doesn't know A. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of them must be in the same category (either they all know A or they all don't know A).\n\nCase 1: If at least 3 people know A, then we need to check if any of those 3 people know each other. If any pair among those 3 people knows each other, then we have a group of 3 friends who all know each other (A and the pair). If none of the pairs among those 3 people know each other, then we have a group of 3 friends who all don't know each other.\n\nCase 2: If at least 3 people don't know A, then we need to check if any of those 3 people know each other. If any pair among those 3 people knows each other, then we have a group of 3 friends who all know each other (the pair and the person who knows both of them). If none of the pairs among those 3 people know each other, then we have a group of 3 friends who all don't know each other.\n\nIn either case, we can form a group of 3 friends who all know each other or all don't know each other. Therefore, the minimum number of pairs of friends who must already know each other in order to ensure that such a group can be formed is 0."
