    "message_1": "What is the smallest angle (in degrees) between the two rods of a double pendulum where the system shows chaotic behavior? Assume the length of each rod is 1 meter and the mass of each ball is 1 kilogram.",
    "message_2": "The chaotic behavior of a double pendulum is not determined by a specific angle between the two rods. Instead, it is influenced by the initial conditions, such as the initial angles and velocities of the rods. Even a small change in these initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes, which is a characteristic of chaotic systems.\n\nIn general, the double pendulum can exhibit chaotic behavior for a wide range of angles between the two rods. There isn't a specific smallest angle that guarantees the onset of chaos. The chaotic behavior depends on the combination of initial conditions and the system's parameters, such as the lengths and masses of the rods."
