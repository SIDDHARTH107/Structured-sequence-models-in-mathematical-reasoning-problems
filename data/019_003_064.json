    "message_1": "One possible question in modal logic for a math student to solve is:\n\nLet S be the set of all possible worlds and P(x) be the proposition \"x is a prime number\". Consider the modal formula □∃xP(x), which means \"it is necessarily true that there exists a prime number\". \n\nSuppose we have a Kripke frame (S,R) such that for any two worlds w, w' ∈ S, wRw' if and only if w' = w + 1 (where addition is done modulo some fixed positive integer N). \n\nDetermine whether the formula □∃xP(x) is true in this frame or not. If it is true, give an example of a world where there exists a prime number. If it is false, explain why.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the formula □∃xP(x) is true in this frame, we need to check if it is true in every world of the frame. Recall that □∃xP(x) means \"it is necessarily true that there exists a prime number.\" In other words, for every world w in S, there must exist a prime number in the next world w' = w + 1 (modulo N).\n\nLet's consider some examples:\n\n1. If N = 2, then S = {0, 1}. In this case, wRw' for w = 0 and w' = 1. There is a prime number in world 1 (the prime number 2), but there is no prime number in world 0. Therefore, □∃xP(x) is false in this frame.\n\n2. If N = 3, then S = {0, 1, 2}. In this case, wRw' for w = 0 and w' = 1, w = 1 and w' = 2, and w = 2 and w' = 0 (modulo 3). There is a prime number in world 1 (the prime number 2) and in world 2 (the prime number 3), but there is no prime number in world 0. Therefore, □∃xP(x) is false in this frame.\n\nIn general, for any N, there will always be a world w = 0 in the frame, and there is no prime number in this world since 0 is not a prime number. Therefore, the formula □∃xP(x) is false in this frame, regardless of the value of N."
