    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive carbon-14 initially contains 400 grams of the substance. The decay rate of carbon-14 is approximately 5,700 years. How much radioactive carbon-14 will remain after 17,100 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nwhere:\n- Final Amount is the amount of radioactive carbon-14 remaining after the given time\n- Initial Amount is the initial amount of radioactive carbon-14 (400 grams)\n- time elapsed is the time that has passed (17,100 years)\n- half-life is the half-life of carbon-14 (5,700 years)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFinal Amount = 400 * (1/2)^(17,100 / 5,700)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of half-lives that have passed:\n\n17,100 / 5,700 = 3\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal Amount = 400 * (1/2)^3\n\nNext, we need to calculate (1/2)^3:\n\n(1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nFinally, we can multiply the initial amount by this value:\n\nFinal Amount = 400 * 1/8 = 50\n\nSo, after 17,100 years, there will be 50 grams of radioactive carbon-14 remaining."
