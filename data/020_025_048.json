The company wants to minimize the total distance traveled by their delivery truck. The distances between the locations are given below:\n\nLocation A to B: 10 miles\nLocation A to C: 15 miles\nLocation A to D: 12 miles\nLocation A to E: 8 miles\nLocation B to C: 9 miles\nLocation B to D: 11 miles\nLocation B to E: 7 miles\nLocation C to D: 14 miles\nLocation C to E: 6 miles\nLocation D to E: 10 miles\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the delivery truck can travel to deliver packages to all five locations?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible routes and choose the one with the minimum distance.\n\nThere are 5! (5 factorial) ways to visit the 5 locations, which is 120 possible routes. However, since the delivery truck has to return to the starting point, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 24 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the 24 unique routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 10+9+14+10+8 = 51 miles\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 10+9+6+10+12 = 47 miles\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 10+11+14+6+8 = 49 miles\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A: 10+11+10+6+15 = 52 miles\n5.
