    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is given by:\n\n$ln[C] = -kt + ln[C]_0$\n\nWe are given that at time $t=0$, the concentration $[C]_0 = 1$ M, and after 10 minutes ($t=10$), the concentration decreases to $[C] = 0.5$ M. We can use this information to determine the rate constant $k$.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given values into the integrated rate law:\n\n$ln(0.5) = -k(10) + ln(1)$\n\nSince $ln(1) = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$ln(0.5) = -10k$\n\nNow, we can solve for the rate constant $k$:\n\n$k = -\\frac{ln(0.5)}{10}$\n\n$k \\approx 0.0693$ min$^{-1}$\n\nSo, the rate constant for the reaction is approximately $0.0693$ min$^{-1}$."
