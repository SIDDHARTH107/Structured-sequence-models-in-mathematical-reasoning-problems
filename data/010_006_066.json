Let A be the subset of X consisting of the edges of the square except the bottom edge. Calculate the fundamental group π₁(X, a) for some point a in the interior of A.",
    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group π₁(X, a) for some point a in the interior of A, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if X is the union of two open, path-connected sets U and V such that their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X is given by the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_U(γ) * i_V(γ)^{-1}, where γ is an element of π₁(U ∩ V, a) and i_U and i_V are the inclusion maps.\n\nLet U be the interior of the square X, and let V be the square X with the bottom edge removed. Then, U and V are both open and path-connected, and their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected. The fundamental group of U is trivial, as U is contractible, and the fundamental group of V is isomorphic to the integers, as V is homotopy equivalent to a circle.\n\nNow, we need to compute the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_U(γ) * i_V(γ)^{-1}. Since the fundamental group of U is trivial, i_U(γ) is the identity for all γ in π₁(U ∩ V, a). Therefore, the normal subgroup is generated by the elements of the form i_V(γ)^{-1}, which are just the inverses of the elements of π₁(V, a).\n\nSince π₁(V, a) is isomorphic to the integers, its elements are just integer multiples of a generator, say g. The inverses of these elements are the integer multiples of the inverse of g, say g^{-1}. Thus, the normal subgroup is generated by the elements of the form g^{-n} for n in the integers.\n\nThe fundamental group of X is then given by the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, modulo this normal subgroup. Since the fundamental group of U is trivial, the free product is just π₁(V, a), which is isomorphic to the integers. Modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form g^{-n}, the fundamental group of X is still isomorphic to the integers.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group π₁(X, a) is isomorphic to the integers, denoted as Z."
