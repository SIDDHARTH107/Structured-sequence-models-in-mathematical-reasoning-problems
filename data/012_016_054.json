Find the Tutte polynomial of the graph.\n\n```\n1---2---3\n|\\      |\n|  \\    |\n|     \\ |\n4---5---6\n```\n\nNote: The Tutte polynomial is a polynomial in two variables x and y that encodes a lot of information about a graph. It is used in various mathematical applications, including the analysis of electrical networks, statistical physics, and knot theory.",
    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we will use the recursive formula for the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G - e denotes the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e denotes the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nThe given graph G has the following edges: e1 = (1, 2), e2 = (2, 3), e3 = (1, 4), e4 = (2, 5), e5 = (3, 6), e6 = (4, 5), e7 = (5, 6), and e8 = (1, 5).\n\nWe will start by removing the edge e1 = (1, 2):\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e1; x, y) + T(G/e1; x, y)\n\nNow, we will remove the edge e2 = (2, 3) from G - e1:\n\nT(G - e1; x, y) = T(G - e1 - e2; x, y) + T((G - e1)/e2; x, y)\n\nSimilarly, we will remove the edge e3 = (1, 4) from G - e1 - e2:\n\nT(G - e1 - e2; x, y) = T(G - e1 - e2 - e3; x, y) + T((G - e1 - e2)/e3; x, y)\n\nNow, we have a graph G - e1 - e2 - e3 with no more edges to remove. This graph has 3 connected components, each with one edge. So, the Tutte polynomial of this graph is:\n\nT(G - e1 - e2 - e3; x, y) = (x - 1)^3\n\nContinuing with the recursion, we have:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)^3 + T((G - e1 - e2)/e3; x, y) + T((G - e1)/e2; x, y) + T(G/e1; x, y)\n\nAfter computing the Tutte polynomials for the remaining terms, we get:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)^3 + (x - 1)(x^2 - x + 1) + (x - 1)(x^2 - x + 1) + x(x - 1)(x^2 - x + 1)\n\nCombining the terms, we get the Tutte polynomial of the given graph:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1"
