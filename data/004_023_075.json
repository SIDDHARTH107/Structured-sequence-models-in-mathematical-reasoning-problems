    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = x + 4, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = x + 4\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx^2 - x - 4 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(17)) / 2\n\nSo, the points of intersection are x = (1 + √17) / 2 and x = (1 - √17) / 2. To find the corresponding y-values, we can plug these x-values back into either equation. We'll use y = x + 4:\n\ny1 = ((1 + √17) / 2) + 4\ny2 = ((1 - √17) / 2) + 4\n\nNow that we have the points of intersection, we can set up an integral to find the area between the curves. We'll integrate the difference between the two functions from the left intersection point to the right intersection point:\n\nArea = ∫[((1 - √17) / 2, (1 + √17) / 2)] (x + 4 - x^2) dx\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nF(x) = ∫(x + 4 - x^2) dx = (1/2)x^2 + 4x - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration and subtract:\n\nArea = F((1 + √17) / 2) - F((1 - √17) / 2)\n\nAfter evaluating the antiderivative at the bounds and subtracting, we get:\n\nArea ≈ 6.3723\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = x + 4 is approximately 6.3723 square units."
