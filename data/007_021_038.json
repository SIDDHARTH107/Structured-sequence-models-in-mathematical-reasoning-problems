    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of 1729 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we first need to define a polynomial function, usually f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n, where n is the number we want to factorize (in this case, 1729).\n\nNow, we will initialize two variables x and y, both initially set to a random number, say 2. We will also set the greatest common divisor (GCD) to 1.\n\nNext, we will iterate the following steps until GCD is not 1:\n\n1. Update x using the polynomial function: x = f(x) mod n\n2. Update y using the polynomial function twice: y = f(f(y)) mod n\n3. Calculate the GCD of |x - y| and n\n\nLet's perform the steps:\n\n1. First iteration:\n   x = f(2) = (2^2 + 1) mod 1729 = 5\n   y = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 1729 = 26\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 1729) = GCD(21, 1729) = 1\n\n2. Second iteration:\n   x = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 1729 = 26\n   y = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 1729 = 937\n   GCD(|26 - 937|, 1729) = GCD(911, 1729) = 7\n\nNow we have found a non-trivial factor of 1729, which is 7. To find the other factor, we can divide 1729 by 7:\n\n1729 / 7 = 247\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 1729 is 7 * 247. Since 247 is also a prime number, we have now found the complete prime factorization of 1729 using Pollard's rho algorithm."
