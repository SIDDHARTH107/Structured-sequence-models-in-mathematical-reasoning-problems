    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 5cos(3x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = 5cos(3x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [5cos(3x)]\nf'(x) = -5sin(3x) * d/dx [3x]\nf'(x) = -5sin(3x) * 3\nf'(x) = -15sin(3x)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = -15sin(3(π/4))\nf'(π/4) = -15sin(3π/4)\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = 5cos(3x) at x = π/4 is -15sin(3π/4)."
