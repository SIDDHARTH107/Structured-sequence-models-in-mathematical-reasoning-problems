    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial 6x^2 - 11x - 10, we can use the \"ac method\":\n\n1. Multiply the leading coefficient (6) by the constant term (-10) to get -60.\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to -60 and add up to the middle coefficient (-11). These numbers are -15 and 4.\n3. Rewrite the middle term as the sum of these two numbers: 6x^2 - 15x + 4x - 10.\n4. Factor by grouping:\n   (6x^2 - 15x) + (4x - 10)\n   3x(2x - 5) + 2(2x - 5)\n5. Factor out the common binomial factor (2x - 5):\n   (3x + 2)(2x - 5)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 6x^2 - 11x - 10 is (3x + 2)(2x - 5)."
