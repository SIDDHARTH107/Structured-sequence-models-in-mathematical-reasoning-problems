    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (2x - 1) using the quotient rule, we first need to identify the numerator function u(x) and the denominator function v(x):\n\nu(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2\nv(x) = 2x - 1\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(3x^2 - 5x + 2)/dx = 6x - 5\nv'(x) = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule, which states that the derivative of a function f(x) = u(x) / v(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\n\nSubstituting the expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x) into the formula, we get:\n\nf'(x) = ((6x - 5)(2x - 1) - (3x^2 - 5x + 2)(2)) / (2x - 1)^2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (12x^2 - 10x - 6x + 5 - 6x^2 + 10x) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nf'(x) = (6x^2 - 6x + 5) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (2x - 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = (6x^2 - 6x + 5) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)"
