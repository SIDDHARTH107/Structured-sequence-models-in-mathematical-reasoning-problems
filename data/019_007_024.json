From A, they can go directly to B or C, from B they can go directly to C, and from C they can go directly to A or B. John plans to visit all three cities in any order. But his wife, Alice, will join him on his trip only if they don't visit city C first. If John plans his itinerary using non-monotonic logic, what is the maximum number of different possible plans he can make for him and Alice to visit all three cities together?",
    "message_2": "Since John wants to visit all three cities and Alice will only join him if they don't visit city C first, we can analyze the possible routes they can take together.\n\n1. They can start at city A, then go to city B, and finally visit city C. (Route: A → B → C)\n2. They can start at city A, then go to city C, and finally visit city B. (Route: A → C → B)\n3. They can start at city B, then go to city A, and finally visit city C. (Route: B → A → C)\n4. They can start at city B, then go to city C, and finally visit city A. (Route: B → C → A)\n\nSince they cannot visit city C first, there are a maximum of 4 different possible plans for John and Alice to visit all three cities together."
