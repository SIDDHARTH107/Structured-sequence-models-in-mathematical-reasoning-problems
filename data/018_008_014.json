    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of two sets, we form ordered pairs with the elements of the first set as the first component and the elements of the second set as the second component.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n\nUsing the given sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, we can find A × B as follows:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find B × A:\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow let's compare A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of A × B and B × A are different. The ordered pairs in A × B have elements from set A as the first component and elements from set B as the second component, while the ordered pairs in B × A have elements from set B as the first component and elements from set A as the second component.\n\nSince A × B ≠ B × A, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
