    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 9x + 7, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 - 9x + 7, we have:\n\nAntiderivative of 3x^2: (3/3) * (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3\nAntiderivative of -9x: (-9/1) * (x^(1+1))/(1+1) = -9x^2/2\nAntiderivative of 7: 7x (since the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x)\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - (9/2)x^2 + 7x + C"
