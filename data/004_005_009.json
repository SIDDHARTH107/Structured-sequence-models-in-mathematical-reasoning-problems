    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 100 liters of water with 5 kg of salt dissolved in it. Water containing 1 kg of salt per liter enters the tank at a rate of 2 L/min, while the mixture leaves the tank at a rate of 3 L/min. Assuming that the tank is well-mixed, find the amount of salt in the tank after 10 minutes using the method of solving differential equations.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t) (in kg). We are given that initially, S(0) = 5 kg. We are also given that the saltwater solution enters the tank at a rate of 2 L/min with a concentration of 1 kg/L, and the mixture leaves the tank at a rate of 3 L/min.\n\nSince the tank is well-mixed, the concentration of salt in the tank at any time t is S(t)/V(t), where V(t) is the volume of the mixture in the tank at time t. The volume of the mixture in the tank decreases at a rate of 3 L/min - 2 L/min = 1 L/min. Therefore, V(t) = 100 - t.\n\nNow, we can set up a differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank. The rate of change of salt in the tank is equal to the rate at which salt enters the tank minus the rate at which salt leaves the tank:\n\ndS/dt = (rate of salt entering) - (rate of salt leaving)\ndS/dt = (2 L/min * 1 kg/L) - (3 L/min * (S(t)/V(t)))\n\nNow we can substitute V(t) = 100 - t:\n\ndS/dt = 2 - (3 * (S(t)/(100 - t)))\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)):\n\ne^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) * dS/dt + 3 * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) * (S(t)/(100 - t)) = 2 * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt))\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of S(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (S(t) * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt))) = 2 * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt))\n\nNow we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(S(t) * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt))) = ∫2 * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) dt\n\nS(t) * e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) = 2 * ∫e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) dt + C\n\nNow we can solve for S(t):\n\nS(t) = e^(-∫(3/(100-t) dt)) * (2 * ∫e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) dt + C)\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition S(0) = 5 kg:\n\n5 = e^(0) * (2 * ∫e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) dt + C)\nC = 3\n\nNow we can find S(10):\n\nS(10) = e^(-∫(3/(100-t) dt)) * (2 * ∫e^(∫(3/(100-t) dt)) dt + 3)\n\nS(10) ≈ 4.61 kg\n\nSo after 10 minutes, there are approximately 4.61 kg of salt in the tank."
