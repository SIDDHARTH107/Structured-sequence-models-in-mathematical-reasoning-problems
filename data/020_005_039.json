    "message_1": "Suppose that a company produces two products, A and B, by using two types of machines, X and Y. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of machine X time and 2 hours of machine Y time. Each unit of product B requires 1 hour of machine X time and 4 hours of machine Y time. Due to availability constraints, the company has 120 hours of machine X time and 80 hours of machine Y time available per week. If the company makes a profit of $5 for each unit of product A and $7 for each unit of product B, how many units of each product should be produced each week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for machine X and Y time can be written as:\n\n3x + y ≤ 120 (machine X constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (machine Y constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem graphically.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + y ≤ 120\ny ≤ -3x + 120\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 80\ny ≤ -0.5x + 20\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. Now, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -3x + 120 and y = -0.5x + 20:\n-3x + 120 = -0.5x + 20\n2.5x = 100\nx = 40\ny = -3(40) + 120 = 0\n\nCorner point (40, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of y = -0.5x + 20 and x-axis (y = 0):\n0 = -0.5x + 20\nx = 40\n\nCorner point (40, 0) (already found)\n\n3. Intersection of y = -3x + 120 and y-axis (x = 0):\ny = -3(0) + 120\ny = 120\n\nCorner point (0, 120) (not feasible because it doesn't satisfy the machine Y constraint)\n\n4. Intersection of y = -0.5x + 20 and y-axis (x = 0):\ny = -0.5(0) + 20\ny = 20\n\nCorner point (0, 20)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 7y at each of the corner points:\n\nP(40, 0) = 5(40) + 7(0) = 200\nP(0, 20) = 5(0) + 7(20) = 140\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the corner point (40, 0), with a profit of $200. Therefore, the company should produce 40 units of product A and 0 units of product B each week to maximize their profit."
