    "message_1": "A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 500 meters above the ground. It spots a car on the ground at an angle of depression of 30 degrees. Find the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the car. (Round your answer to the nearest meter)",
    "message_2": "To find the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the car, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is the same as the angle of elevation from the car to the helicopter.\n\nLet x be the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the car. We have:\n\ntan(30°) = (500 meters) / x\n\nUsing the tangent of 30 degrees (tan(30°) ≈ 0.577), we can solve for x:\n\n0.577 = 500 / x\n\nx ≈ 500 / 0.577\n\nx ≈ 866.55\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the car is approximately 867 meters."
