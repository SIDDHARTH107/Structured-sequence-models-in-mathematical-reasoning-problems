    "message_2": "To find the least non-negative number x such that the formula ψ(x) is true on the set S, we need to analyze the formula.\n\nψ(x) states that for every property P, if P holds for 0 and for every y, P(y) implies P(y + x), then P holds for every z.\n\nLet's consider x = 0. In this case, the formula becomes:\n\nψ(0) = ∀P (P(0) ∧ ∀y(P(y) → P(y + 0)) → ∀z P(z))\n\nSince y + 0 = y, the formula simplifies to:\n\nψ(0) = ∀P (P(0) ∧ ∀y(P(y) → P(y)) → ∀z P(z))\n\nNow, the statement \"∀y(P(y) → P(y))\" is always true, as it's a tautology (a statement that is true by its logical form). Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nψ(0) = ∀P (P(0) → ∀z P(z))\n\nThis formula states that for every property P, if P holds for 0, then P holds for every z. This is true for the set of all real numbers S.\n\nSo, the least non-negative number x such that the formula ψ(x) is true on the set S is x = 0."
