An isomorphism between G1 and G2 can be defined as follows:\n\nf(a) = 1\nf(b) = 2\nf(c) = 3\nf(d) = 4\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of vertices, as the edges in G1 and G2 are the same when vertices are replaced according to the mapping:\n\n(a,b) in G1 corresponds to (1,2) in G2\n(b,c) in G1 corresponds to (2,3) in G2\n(c,d) in G1 corresponds to (3,4) in G2\n(d,a) in G1 corresponds to (4,1) in G2\n(a,c) in G1 corresponds to (1,3) in G2\n\nSince there exists an isomorphism between G1 and G2 that preserves adjacency, the two graphs are isomorphic."
