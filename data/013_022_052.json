    "message_1": "In a class of 25 students, the teacher decides to play a Dictator Game. The dictator (Player 1) is given $50 and is asked to offer a portion to the receiver (Player 2). If the receiver accepts the offer, both players get the respective amounts, but if the receiver rejects the offer, both players get zero. What is the minimum amount that Player 1 can offer to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer? Assume that Player 2 is rational in their decision-making.",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, since Player 2 is rational, they will accept any offer that is greater than zero, as receiving any amount of money is better than receiving nothing. Therefore, the minimum amount that Player 1 can offer to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer is $1. This would leave Player 1 with $49 and Player 2 with $1."
