    "message_2": "The total number of squares in the nth iteration of the Sierpinski carpet can be found using the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (3^(n-1))^2\n\nFor example:\n\n1st iteration: (3^(1-1))^2 = (3^0)^2 = 1^2 = 1 square\n2nd iteration: (3^(2-1))^2 = (3^1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 squares (1 original square + 8 smaller squares)\n3rd iteration: (3^(3-1))^2 = (3^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81 squares (1 original square + 80 smaller squares)\n\nSo, in the nth iteration, there will be (3^(n-1))^2 squares in the Sierpinski carpet."
