    "message_2": "To find the average height of the pendulum over one full swing, we need to integrate the function over one period and then divide by the length of that period.\n\nThe period of a sinusoidal function is given by the formula T = 2π/ω, where ω is the angular frequency. In this case, ω = 2, so the period T = 2π/2 = π.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the function y = 4sin(2x) over one period and divide by the length of the period:\n\nAverage height = (1/π) * ∫[4sin(2x)] dx from 0 to π\n\nTo integrate, we use the substitution method. Let u = 2x, so du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2.\n\nAverage height = (1/π) * ∫[4sin(u)] (du/2) from 0 to 2π\n\nAverage height = (1/π) * (1/2) * ∫[4sin(u)] du from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, integrate 4sin(u) with respect to u:\n\n∫[4sin(u)] du = -4cos(u) + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from 0 to 2π:\n\n-4cos(2π) - (-4cos(0)) = -4(1) - (-4(1)) = 0\n\nAverage height = (1/π) * (1/2) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the average height of the pendulum over one full swing is 0. This makes sense because the pendulum spends equal amounts of time above and below the horizontal axis, so the average height is 0."
