    "message_1": "Consider the following elementary chemical reaction A $\\rightarrow$ B with the rate law given by $\\frac{d[A]}{dt}$ = -k[A].\n\nIf the initial concentration of A is [A]$_0$ = 5.0 M and the rate constant k = 0.01 s$^{-1}$, what is the concentration of A after 2.5 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to integrate the rate law equation to find the concentration of A as a function of time. The integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is:\n\n[A] = [A]$_0$ × e^(-kt)\n\nGiven the initial concentration [A]$_0$ = 5.0 M, the rate constant k = 0.01 s$^{-1}$, and the time t = 2.5 minutes, we can find the concentration of A after 2.5 minutes.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds:\n\nt = 2.5 minutes × (60 seconds/minute) = 150 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\n[A] = 5.0 M × e^(-0.01 s$^{-1}$ × 150 s)\n\n[A] = 5.0 M × e^(-1.5)\n\n[A] ≈ 5.0 M × 0.2231\n\n[A] ≈ 1.1155 M\n\nSo, the concentration of A after 2.5 minutes is approximately 1.1155 M."
