    "message_2": "The Cantor set is created by successively removing the middle third of each interval. After each iteration, the remaining intervals have a total length of 2/3 of the previous iteration's total length. \n\nLet's calculate the total length after each iteration:\n\n1. Initial interval: 3\n2. First iteration: 3 * (2/3) = 2\n3. Second iteration: 2 * (2/3) = 4/3\n4. Third iteration: (4/3) * (2/3) = 8/9\n5. Fourth iteration: (8/9) * (2/3) = 16/27\n\nSo, after the first 4 iterations, the total length of the Cantor set is 16/27."
