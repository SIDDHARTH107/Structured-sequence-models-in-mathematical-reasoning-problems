    "message_2": "To compute the order of the Jacobian J of the curve C, we first need to find the number of points on the curve over a finite field. Let's consider the curve C over the finite field F_p, where p is a prime number.\n\nUsing Hasse's theorem, we can estimate the number of points on the curve over F_p as follows:\n\np + 1 - 2*sqrt(p) <= #C(F_p) <= p + 1 + 2*sqrt(p)\n\nThe order of the Jacobian J is equal to the number of points on the curve C over the finite field F_p, denoted by #C(F_p).\n\nTo find the exact value of #C(F_p), we can use the Schoof-Elkies-Atkin (SEA) algorithm, which is an efficient method to compute the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field.\n\nHowever, without specifying a particular finite field F_p, we cannot compute the exact order of the Jacobian J. If you provide a specific prime number p, we can proceed with the computation using the SEA algorithm."
