    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = [[3, 2, -1], [2, -4, 5], [1, 0.5, -1]], X = [[x], [y], [z]], and B = [[6], [-7], [2.5]].\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\nWe will use the Doolittle's method for LU decomposition, which states that the diagonal elements of L are 1.\n\n1. For the first row of U, we have:\nu11 = a11 = 3\nu12 = a12 = 2\nu13 = a13 = -1\n\n2. For the first column of L, we have:\nl11 = 1 (by Doolittle's method)\nl21 = a21 / u11 = 2 / 3\nl31 = a31 / u11 = 1 / 3\n\n3. For the second row of U, we have:\nu22 = a22 - l21 * u12 = -4 - (2/3) * 2 = -16/3\nu23 = a23 - l21 * u13 = 5 - (2/3) * (-1) = 17/3\n\n4. For the second column of L, we have:\nl22 = 1 (by Doolittle's method)\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * u12) / u22 = (0.5 - (1/3) * 2) / (-16/3) = -1/8\n\n5. For the third row of U, we have:\nu33 = a33 - l31 * u13 - l32 * u23 = -1 - (1/3) * (-1) - (-1/8) * (17/3) = -35/24\n\nNow, we have L = [[1, 0, 0], [2/3, 1, 0], [1/3, -1/8, 1]] and U = [[3, 2, -1], [0, -16/3, 17/3], [0, 0, -35/24]].\n\nStep 2: Forward substitution\nWe will solve the equation L * Y = B for Y.\n\n1. y1 = b1 / l11 = 6 / 1 = 6\n2. y2 = (b2 - l21 * y1) / l22 = (-7 - (2/3) * 6) / 1 = -11\n3. y3 = (b3 - l31 * y1 - l32 * y2) / l33 = (2.5 - (1/3) * 6 - (-1/8) * (-11)) / 1 = -1\n\nSo, Y = [[6], [-11], [-1]].\n\nStep 3: Backward substitution\nWe will solve the equation U * X = Y for X.\n\n1. z = y3 / u33 = -1 / (-35/24) = 24/35\n2. y = (y2 - u23 * z) / u22 = (-11 - (17/3) * (24/35)) / (-16/3) = 3/5\n3. x = (y1 - u12 * y - u13 * z) / u11 = (6 - 2 * (3/5) + 1 * (24/35)) / 3 = 1\n\nSo, the solution is X = [[1], [3/5], [24/35]], which means x = 1, y = 3/5, and z = 24/35."
