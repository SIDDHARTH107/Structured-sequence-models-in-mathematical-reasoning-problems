    "message_2": "The fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree n will have exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. In this case, the given equation is a polynomial of degree 4:\n\n$z^4 + 6z^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nTherefore, according to the fundamental theorem of algebra, this equation has exactly 4 roots in the complex plane."
