    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: length × width = 5 cm × 3 cm = 15 cm²\n2. Front and back faces: length × height = 5 cm × 4 cm = 20 cm²\n3. Left and right faces: width × height = 3 cm × 4 cm = 12 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\n\nSurface area = (2 × 15 cm²) + (2 × 20 cm²) + (2 × 12 cm²) = 30 cm² + 40 cm² + 24 cm² = 94 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 cm²."
