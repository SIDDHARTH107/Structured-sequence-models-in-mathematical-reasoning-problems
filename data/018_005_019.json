    "message_1": "Let A be a set containing the integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Determine the complement of A and find the intersection of the set A and its complement. Show that the resulting set is the empty set: A ∩ A^c = {}.",
    "message_2": "To determine the complement of A, we first need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted as A^c, contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Since the problem does not provide a specific universal set, we can assume a reasonable one, such as the set of integers from 1 to 10: U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A by listing all the elements in U that are not in A:\n\nA^c = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of the set A and its complement, A ∩ A^c. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no elements that are common to both A and A^c, as A contains the integers from 1 to 5, and A^c contains the integers from 6 to 10.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the set A and its complement is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A^c = {}"
