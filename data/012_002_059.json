    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of the graph, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the degree of vertices.\n\nIn a simple graph, the maximum number of edges is given by the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, with 7 vertices, the maximum number of edges is 7(7-1)/2 = 21. Since we have 10 edges, it is not a complete graph.\n\nThe minimum number of colors needed to properly color a graph is one more than the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph. The maximum degree of a vertex in a simple graph with n vertices is n-1. In this case, the maximum degree is 7-1 = 6.\n\nHowever, since we have only 10 edges, it is not possible for all vertices to have a degree of 6. Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where one vertex has the maximum possible degree given the number of edges. In this case, one vertex would have a degree of 5 (connected to 5 other vertices), and the other 5 vertices would have a degree of 1 (connected only to the central vertex). The last vertex would not be connected to any other vertex.\n\nIn this scenario, we would need at least 3 colors to properly color the graph: one for the central vertex, one for the vertices connected to it, and one for the isolated vertex. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of the graph is 3."
