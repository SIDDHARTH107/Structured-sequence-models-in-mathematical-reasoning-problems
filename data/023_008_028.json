    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x² over the interval 0 ≤ x < 2, we will use the Fourier series formula for non-periodic functions:\n\nf(x) ≈ a₀/2 + Σ [aₙcos(2πnx/L) + bₙsin(2πnx/L)]\n\nwhere a₀, aₙ, and bₙ are the Fourier coefficients, L is half of the interval length (in this case, L = 1), and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ using the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (2/L) ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to L\naₙ = (2/L) ∫[f(x)cos(2πnx/L)dx] from 0 to L\nbₙ = (2/L) ∫[f(x)sin(2πnx/L)dx] from 0 to L\n\nFor a₀:\n\na₀ = 2 ∫[x²dx] from 0 to 1\na₀ = 2 * [(1/3)x³] from 0 to 1\na₀ = 2 * (1/3) = 2/3\n\nFor aₙ:\n\naₙ = 2 ∫[x²cos(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nIntegration by parts:\nLet u = x², dv = cos(2πnx)dx\ndu = 2xdx, v = (1/(2πn))sin(2πnx)\n\naₙ = 2 * [(1/(2πn))x²sin(2πnx) - ∫(1/(2πn))2xsin(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate by parts again:\nLet u = x, dv = sin(2πnx)dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/(2πn))cos(2πnx)\n\naₙ = 2 * [(1/(2πn))x²sin(2πnx) + (1/(2πn))²∫cos(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\naₙ = 2 * [(1/(2πn))x²sin(2πnx) + (1/(2πn))²[(1/(2πn))sin(2πnx)] from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\naₙ = 2 * [(1/(2πn)) - 0 + 0 - 0]\naₙ = 2/(2πn)\n\nFor bₙ:\n\nbₙ = 2 ∫[x²sin(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nIntegration by parts:\nLet u = x², dv = sin(2πnx)dx\ndu = 2xdx, v = -(1/(2πn))cos(2πnx)\n\nbₙ = 2 * [-(1/(2πn))x²cos(2πnx) - ∫-(1/(2πn))2xcos(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate by parts again:\nLet u = x, dv = cos(2πnx)dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/(2πn))sin(2πnx)\n\nbₙ = 2 * [-(1/(2πn))x²cos(2πnx) - (1/(2πn))²∫sin(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\nbₙ = 2 * [-(1/(2πn))x²cos(2πnx) - (1/(2πn))²[-(1/(2πn))cos(2πnx)] from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nbₙ = 2 * [0 - 0 + 0 - (1/(2πn))²]\nbₙ = -(2/(2πn)²)\n\nNow we have the Fourier coefficients:\n\na₀ = 2/3\naₙ = 2/(2πn)\nbₙ = -(2/(2πn)²)\n\nSo the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x² over the interval 0 ≤ x < 2 is:\n\nf(x) ≈ (2/3)/2 + Σ [(2/(2πn))cos(2πnx) - (2/(2πn)²)sin(2πnx)]"
