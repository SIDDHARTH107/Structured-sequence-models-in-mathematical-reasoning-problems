    "message_2": "To find the number of linearly independent holomorphic maps from X to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, the dimension of the space of holomorphic functions associated with D is given by:\n\n$l(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D)$,\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor on X and l(K - D) is the dimension of the space of holomorphic functions associated with the divisor K - D.\n\nIn this case, X is a smooth projective curve of genus 3, and we want to find the number of linearly independent holomorphic maps from X to $\\mathbb{P}^1$. A holomorphic map from X to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ corresponds to a divisor D of degree 1 on X. \n\nUsing the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D) = 1 + 1 - 3 + l(K - D) = -1 + l(K - D)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the dimension of the space of holomorphic functions associated with the divisor K - D. Since K is the canonical divisor on X, we have:\n\n$deg(K) = 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\n\nThus, the degree of the divisor K - D is:\n\n$deg(K - D) = deg(K) - deg(D) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nSince the degree of K - D is positive, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem again:\n\n$l(K - D) = deg(K - D) + 1 - g + l(D - K) = 3 + 1 - 3 + l(D - K) = 1 + l(D - K)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the dimension of the space of holomorphic functions associated with the divisor D - K. Since the degree of D - K is negative, we have:\n\n$l(D - K) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$l(K - D) = 1 + l(D - K) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for l(D), we get:\n\n$l(D) = -1 + l(K - D) = -1 + 1 = 0$.\n\nThus, there are 0 linearly independent holomorphic maps from X to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$."
