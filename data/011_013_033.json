    "message_2": "When arranging beads in a circle, we can fix one bead as a reference point and arrange the remaining beads around it. Since there are 10 distinct beads, we can arrange the other 9 beads in 9! ways. However, since rotations are considered the same, we need to divide by the number of possible rotations, which is 10 (one for each bead).\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange 10 distinct beads in a circle is:\n\n(9!)/10 = (362,880)/10 = 36,288 ways."
