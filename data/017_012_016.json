    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and the properties of p-groups.\n\nSince G has order 16, it is a p-group with p = 2. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we know that n_2 must divide the order of G, and n_2 â‰¡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 16. If n_2 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. In this case, G would be a cyclic group of order 16, i.e., G would be isomorphic to C16.\n\nIf n_2 = 16, then G has 16 Sylow 2-subgroups, and each of them has order 8. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 2-subgroups is trivial, the union of all Sylow 2-subgroups covers 15 * 8 = 120 elements, which is impossible since G has only 16 elements. Therefore, n_2 cannot be 16.\n\nThus, G must have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which implies that G is a cyclic group of order 16, i.e., G is isomorphic to C16.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, and not the dihedral group D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16."
