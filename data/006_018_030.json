    "message_1": "A company has 100 employees, and the probability of any one of them committing financial fraud is 0.02. What is the probability that at least 3 employees commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 3 employees commit financial fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that either 0, 1, or 2 employees commit financial fraud. We can calculate the probabilities of these three events and then subtract their sum from 1 to find the probability of at least 3 employees committing financial fraud.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of employees (100), k is the number of employees committing fraud, p is the probability of an employee committing fraud (0.02), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\n1. Probability of 0 employees committing fraud (k=0):\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (1-0.02)^(100-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.98)^100 ≈ 0.133979\n\n2. Probability of 1 employee committing fraud (k=1):\n\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (1-0.02)^(100-1)\nP(X = 1) = 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99 ≈ 0.270671\n\n3. Probability of 2 employees committing fraud (k=2):\n\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (1-0.02)^(100-2)\nP(X = 2) = 4950 * 0.0004 * (0.98)^98 ≈ 0.271994\n\nNow, we'll find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 3 employees commit fraud) = 1 - P(0 employees) - P(1 employee) - P(2 employees)\nP(at least 3 employees commit fraud) = 1 - 0.133979 - 0.270671 - 0.271994 ≈ 0.323356\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 employees commit financial fraud is approximately 0.323356 or 32.34%."
