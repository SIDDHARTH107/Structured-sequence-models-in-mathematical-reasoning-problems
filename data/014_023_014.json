    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a Rail Fence Cipher that has been encrypted using a key depth of 4. The plaintext message is \"ATTACKATDAWN\". Determine the decrypted message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt a Rail Fence Cipher with a key depth of 4, we need to arrange the ciphertext \"ATTACKATDAWN\" in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows and then read the plaintext message row by row. Here's the arrangement:\n\nA . . . . C . . . . T . . . . N\n. T . . A . K . . D . W . . .\n. . T . . . . A . . . . A . .\n. . . A . . . . T . . . . . .\n\nNow, we read the message row by row:\n\nACTNTAKDWTAATA\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"ACTNTAKDWTAATA\"."
