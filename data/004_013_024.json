    "message_1": "A water tank in the shape of a rectangular prism with length 6 meters, width 4 meters, and height 8 meters is being drained. The water level is currently 5 meters high. Let V(x) be the volume of water in the tank as a function of the height x (in meters) of the water level. What is the maximum volume of water in the tank? At what height is the water level to achieve this maximum volume?",
    "message_2": "Since the water tank is in the shape of a rectangular prism, the volume of the water in the tank can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV(x) = length × width × height\n\nIn this case, the length and width are fixed at 6 meters and 4 meters, respectively, while the height is variable (x). So, the volume function V(x) is:\n\nV(x) = 6 × 4 × x\nV(x) = 24x\n\nThe maximum volume of water in the tank occurs when the tank is completely full, which means the height x is equal to the maximum height of the tank, which is 8 meters.\n\nSo, the maximum volume of water in the tank is:\n\nV(8) = 24 × 8\nV(8) = 192 cubic meters\n\nTo achieve this maximum volume, the water level must be at the maximum height of 8 meters."
