    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x - 9 using the power rule, we will apply the power rule to each term individually. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\n1. For the term 5x^3:\n   The power rule gives us (3) * 5x^(3-1) = 15x^2\n\n2. For the term -7x^2:\n   The power rule gives us (2) * (-7)x^(2-1) = -14x\n\n3. For the term 2x:\n   The power rule gives us (1) * 2x^(1-1) = 2\n\n4. For the constant term -9:\n   The derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^2 - 14x + 2"
