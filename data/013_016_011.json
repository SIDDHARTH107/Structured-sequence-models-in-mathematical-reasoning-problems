    "message_1": "Suppose two players are involved in a game where each player can choose to either invest their money or not invest. If both players invest, they both receive a payoff of $10. If only one of them invests, the one who invests receives a payoff of $15 while the other player receives a payoff of $5. However, if neither of them invests, they both receive a payoff of $0. Given that Player A invested, what is the probability that Player B will also invest?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that Player B will also invest given that Player A invested, we need to analyze the payoffs for Player B in this situation.\n\nSince Player A invested, Player B has two options:\n\n1. Invest: In this case, Player B will receive a payoff of $10.\n2. Not invest: In this case, Player B will receive a payoff of $5.\n\nPlayer B will choose the option with the higher payoff, which is to invest. Therefore, the probability that Player B will also invest given that Player A invested is 1, or 100%."
