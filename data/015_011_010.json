    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle of displacement of the second pendulum in a double pendulum system, we need to consider the equations of motion for the system. The equations of motion for a double pendulum system are quite complex and involve solving a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations. \n\nHowever, we can provide a qualitative answer to the problem. In the given initial conditions, both pendulums have an angle of 45 degrees. Since the total energy of the system is conserved, the second pendulum can potentially reach a maximum angle of displacement when the first pendulum is at its lowest point (angle = 0 degrees) and all the potential energy is transferred to the second pendulum.\n\nIn this case, the maximum angle of displacement for the second pendulum can be calculated using the conservation of energy principle:\n\nm1 * g * L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + m2 * g * L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial)) = m2 * g * L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max))\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the first and second pendulums (both 1 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), L1 and L2 are the lengths of the first and second pendulums, and θ1_initial, θ2_initial, and θ2_max are the initial angles of the first and second pendulums and the maximum angle of the second pendulum, respectively.\n\nSince m1 = m2 and L1 = L2, we can simplify the equation:\n\ng * L * (1 - cos(45°)) + g * L * (1 - cos(45°)) = g * L * (1 - cos(θ2_max))\n\n2 * (1 - cos(45°)) = 1 - cos(θ2_max)\n\nSolving for θ2_max, we get:\n\ncos(θ2_max) = 1 - 2 * (1 - cos(45°))\n\nθ2_max = arccos(1 - 2 * (1 - cos(45°)))\n\nθ2_max ≈ 120.52°\n\nSo, the maximum angle of displacement of the second pendulum in this double pendulum system is approximately 120.52 degrees. Keep in mind that this is a simplified analysis and the actual maximum angle could be different due to the complex dynamics of the double pendulum system."
