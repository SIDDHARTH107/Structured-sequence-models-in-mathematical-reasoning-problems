    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to produce rectangular metal frames with a perimeter of 60 cm. What dimensions should the manufacturer use to maximize the area of the frame?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the perimeter is 60 cm, we have:\n\n60 = 2L + 2W\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n30 = L + W\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can express W in terms of L using the perimeter equation:\n\nW = 30 - L\n\nNow substitute this expression for W in the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (30 - L)\n\nArea = 30L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to L and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 30 - 2L = 0\n\nSolve for L:\n\n2L = 30\nL = 15\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 30 - 15\nW = 15\n\nSo, the dimensions that will maximize the area of the rectangular frame are length L = 15 cm and width W = 15 cm, which is a square frame. The maximum area will be 15 * 15 = 225 square centimeters."
