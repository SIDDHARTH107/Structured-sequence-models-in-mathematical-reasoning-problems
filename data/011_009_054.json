    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees and wants to organize a team-building event. They want to split the employees into smaller groups of 4, such that each employee is in only one group. How many different group configurations are possible? (Hint: Use the Bell number formula for B(10)).",
    "message_2": "The Bell number formula is not applicable in this situation, as it is used to count the number of ways to partition a set into any number of subsets. In this case, we want to specifically divide the 10 employees into groups of 4.\n\nInstead, we can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 4 employees out of 10. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of elements (employees), k is the number of elements in each group, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo there are 210 different ways to choose a group of 4 employees out of 10. However, this does not account for the remaining 6 employees. Since we cannot form another group of 4 from the remaining 6 employees, the company would need to reconsider the group sizes or the total number of groups for the team-building event."
