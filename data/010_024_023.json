    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle can be determined using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ is:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angles from degrees to radians:\n\n80 degrees = 80 * (π/180) = 4π/9 radians\n70 degrees = 70 * (π/180) = 7π/18 radians\n30 degrees = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = π - (4π/9 + 7π/18 + π/6)\nArea = π - (8π/18 + 7π/18 + 3π/18)\nArea = π - (18π/18)\nArea = π - π\nArea = 0\n\nThe hyperbolic area of the triangle is 0."
