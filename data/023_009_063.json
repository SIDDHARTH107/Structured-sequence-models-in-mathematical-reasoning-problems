    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using Fourier series, we first need to rewrite the problem in a more suitable form. Since the given differential equation is homogeneous, we can rewrite the boundary conditions as follows:\n\n$$\ny(0) - y(\\pi) = -1\n$$\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier sine series representation of the function $f(x) = y(x) - y(\\pi)$ on the interval $[0, \\pi]$. The Fourier sine series of a function $f(x)$ is given by:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $L = \\pi$ in our case, and the coefficients $b_n$ are given by:\n\n$$\nb_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L f(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\n$$\n\nFor our problem, we have:\n\n$$\nf(x) = y(x) - y(\\pi) \\implies y(x) = f(x) + y(\\pi)\n$$\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the given differential equation:\n\n$$\n(f''(x) + y(\\pi)) + 4(f(x) + y(\\pi)) = 0\n$$\n\nSince $y(\\pi)$ is a constant, its second derivative is zero, and we get:\n\n$$\nf''(x) + 4f(x) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier sine series representation of $f(x)$:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx)\n$$\n\nSubstitute this into the differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-n^2 b_n \\sin(nx)) + 4 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (b_n \\sin(nx)) = 0\n$$\n\nSince this equation must hold for all $x$, the coefficients of the sine functions must be equal:\n\n$$\n(-n^2 + 4) b_n = 0 \\implies b_n = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad n \\neq 2\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient $b_2$. Using the boundary condition $y(0) - y(\\pi) = -1$, we have:\n\n$$\nf(0) - f(\\pi) = -1\n$$\n\nSubstitute the Fourier sine series representation of $f(x)$:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(n\\pi) - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(0) = -1\n$$\n\nSince $\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ for all integer values of $n$, and $\\sin(0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$\n-1 = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the given boundary value problem has no solution."
