    "message_2": "To determine whether R ∧ S necessarily follows from the given statements, we can use proof theory and the rules of inference. We are given:\n\n1. P ∧ Q (Premise)\n2. R → ¬P (Premise)\n3. Q ∨ S (Premise)\n\nOur goal is to show that R ∧ S follows from these premises. Let's break down the given statements and use the rules of inference:\n\nFrom statement 1 (P ∧ Q), we can use the simplification rule to get:\n\n4. P (Simplification from 1)\n5. Q (Simplification from 1)\n\nNow, let's use statement 2 (R → ¬P) and statement 4 (P) to apply the Modus Tollens rule:\n\n6. ¬R (Modus Tollens from 2 and 4)\n\nAt this point, we have ¬R, which means R is false. Since we are trying to prove R ∧ S, and we already know R is false, it is impossible for R ∧ S to necessarily follow from the given statements.\n\nTherefore, R ∧ S does not necessarily follow from the given statements."
