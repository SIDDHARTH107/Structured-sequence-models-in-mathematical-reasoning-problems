    "message_2": "To find the output signal using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the Fourier Transform of the input signal f(t). The input signal f(t) consists of two sinusoidal functions, so we can find the Fourier Transform of each function separately and then add them together.\n\nThe Fourier Transform of a cosine function is given by:\nF{cos(ωt)} = (1/2)[δ(ω - ω0) + δ(ω + ω0)]\n\nThe Fourier Transform of a sine function is given by:\nF{sin(ωt)} = (j/2)[-δ(ω - ω0) + δ(ω + ω0)]\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier Transform of the input signal f(t) = 2cos(3t) + 4sin(5t).\n\nF{2cos(3t)} = 2(1/2)[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] = [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\nF{4sin(5t)} = 4(j/2)[-δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)] = 2j[-δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]\n\nSo, the Fourier Transform of the input signal is:\nF{f(t)} = [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] + 2j[-δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]\n\nNow, we need to find the output signal's Fourier Transform by multiplying the input signal's Fourier Transform with the transfer function H(jω).\n\nF{y(t)} = H(jω)F{f(t)} = (jω + 2)/(jω + 4) * {[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] + 2j[-δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]}\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier Transform of F{y(t)} to get the output signal y(t).\n\ny(t) = F^{-1}{F{y(t)}}\n\nSince the inverse Fourier Transform is a linear operation, we can find the inverse Fourier Transform of each term separately and then add them together.\n\ny(t) = F^{-1}{(jω + 2)/(jω + 4) * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]} + F^{-1}{(jω + 2)/(jω + 4) * 2j[-δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]}\n\nLet's find the inverse Fourier Transform of each term:\n\n1. F^{-1}{(jω + 2)/(jω + 4) * [δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]}\nWhen ω = 3, H(jω) = (3j + 2)/(3j + 4) = 1/2 - (1/2)j\nWhen ω = -3, H(jω) = (-3j + 2)/(-3j + 4) = 1/2 + (1/2)j\n\nSo, the first term becomes:\ny1(t) = F^{-1}{(1/2 - (1/2)j)δ(ω - 3) + (1/2 + (1/2)j)δ(ω + 3)}\ny1(t) = (1/2 - (1/2)j)cos(3t) + (1/2 + (1/2)j)cos(-3t)\n\n2. F^{-1}{(jω + 2)/(jω + 4) * 2j[-δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]}\nWhen ω = 5, H(jω) = (5j + 2)/(5j + 4) = 2/3 + (1/3)j\nWhen ω = -5, H(jω) = (-5j + 2)/(-5j + 4) = 2/3 - (1/3)j\n\nSo, the second term becomes:\ny2(t) = F^{-1}{(2/3 + (1/3)j)2jδ(ω - 5) - (2/3 - (1/3)j)2jδ(ω + 5)}\ny2(t) = (2/3 + (1/3)j)sin(5t) - (2/3 - (1/3)j)sin(-5t)\n\nNow, we can add y1(t) and y2(t) to get the output signal y(t):\n\ny(t) = [(1/2 - (1/2)j)cos(3t) + (1/2 + (1/2)j)cos(-3t)] + [(2/3 + (1/3)j)sin(5t) - (2/3 - (1/3)j)sin(-5t)]\n\nSince cos(-x) = cos(x) and sin(-x) = -sin(x), we can simplify the expression:\n\ny(t) = [(1/2 - (1/2)j)cos(3t) + (1/2 + (1/2)j)cos(3t)] + [(2/3 + (1/3)j)sin(5t) + (2/3 - (1/3)j)sin(5t)]\n\ny(t) = [cos(3t) + jcos(3t)] + [(4/3)sin(5t)]\n\nThe output signal y(t) is a complex function, which means it has both real and imaginary parts. In most practical applications, we are interested in the real part of the output signal. So, the real part of the output signal is:\n\ny(t)_real = cos(3t) + (4/3)sin(5t)"
