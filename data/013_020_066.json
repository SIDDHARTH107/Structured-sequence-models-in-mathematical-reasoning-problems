    "message_1": "A game involves 5 players who all have to choose a number between 1 and 100. The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should each player choose to maximize their chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. First, let's find the maximum possible average of the numbers chosen by the players.\n\nSince the maximum number each player can choose is 100, the maximum possible sum of the numbers chosen by all players is 5 * 100 = 500. Therefore, the maximum possible average is 500 / 5 = 100.\n\nNow, let's find 2/3 of this maximum average: (2/3) * 100 = 200 / 3 ≈ 66.67.\n\nSince the winner is the one whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average, it would be rational for each player to choose a number close to 66.67. However, since all players are trying to maximize their chances of winning, they will also assume that other players will choose numbers close to 66.67.\n\nIn this case, the actual average of the numbers chosen will be lower than the maximum possible average. Therefore, to maximize their chances of winning, each player should choose a number slightly lower than 66.67.\n\nTo find the optimal number, we can apply the same logic iteratively. If all players choose a number close to 66.67, the new average will be close to 66.67, and 2/3 of this new average will be (2/3) * 66.67 ≈ 44.44. Players should then choose a number close to 44.44.\n\nWe can continue this process until the chosen numbers converge to a stable value. In practice, this process converges to a value close to 0. However, since players can only choose integers between 1 and 100, they should choose the integer closest to the final value obtained through this iterative process.\n\nIn conclusion, to maximize their chances of winning, each player should choose a number close to the final value obtained through the iterative process described above. In practice, this number is close to 0, so each player should choose 1, the smallest possible number."
