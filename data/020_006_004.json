    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, and has contract obligations to produce at least 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B each month. It takes 2 hours to make one unit of product A and 3 hours to make one unit of product B. The company has 600 hours of labor available per month. Product A sells for $5 per unit, and product B sells for $8 per unit. Using mixed-integer programming, find the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize its monthly revenue.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe company needs to produce at least 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B, so we have the following constraints:\n\nx ≥ 200\ny ≥ 150\n\nIt takes 2 hours to make one unit of product A and 3 hours to make one unit of product B, and the company has 600 hours of labor available per month. Therefore, we have the following constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 600\n\nThe company wants to maximize its monthly revenue, which is given by the following objective function:\n\nRevenue = 5x + 8y\n\nWe can now set up the mixed-integer programming problem:\n\nMaximize: 5x + 8y\nSubject to:\nx ≥ 200\ny ≥ 150\n2x + 3y ≤ 600\n\nNow, we can solve this problem graphically or by using a mixed-integer programming solver.\n\nGraphically, we can plot the constraints and find the feasible region. Then, we can find the corner points of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each corner point to find the maximum revenue.\n\nUsing a mixed-integer programming solver, we can input the objective function and constraints and obtain the optimal solution.\n\nThe optimal solution is x = 200 units of product A and y = 150 units of product B. This will maximize the monthly revenue, which will be:\n\nRevenue = 5(200) + 8(150) = 1000 + 1200 = $2200"
