    "message_1": "Consider a chemical reaction where the rate of formation of a product is proportional to the concentration of a reactant. Suppose that the initial concentration of the reactant is $5$ moles/liter and after $2$ hours, its concentration decreases to $2$ moles/liter. \n\n(a) Find the rate constant $k$ of the reaction. \n\n(b) Write the rate equation for the reaction.\n\n(c) How long will it take for the reactant to decrease to $1$ mole/liter?",
    "message_2": "(a) Since the rate of formation of the product is proportional to the concentration of the reactant, we can write the rate equation as:\n\n$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k[A]$\n\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of the reactant, $t$ is time, and $k$ is the rate constant. To find the rate constant, we need to solve this differential equation.\n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\n$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = -k dt$\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A]} \\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = -k \\int_0^t dt$\n\nwhere $[A]_0$ is the initial concentration of the reactant. After integrating, we get:\n\n$\\ln \\frac{[A]}{[A]_0} = -kt$\n\nNow, we can solve for $k$ using the given information. At $t=0$, the initial concentration is $5$ moles/liter, and at $t=2$ hours, the concentration is $2$ moles/liter:\n\n$\\ln \\frac{2}{5} = -2k$\n\nSolving for $k$, we get:\n\n$k = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{5}{2} \\approx 0.4581$\n\n(b) The rate equation for the reaction is:\n\n$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k[A]$\n\n(c) To find the time it takes for the reactant to decrease to $1$ mole/liter, we can use the equation we derived earlier:\n\n$\\ln \\frac{[A]}{[A]_0} = -kt$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$\\ln \\frac{1}{5} = -0.4581t$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t = \\frac{\\ln \\frac{1}{5}}{-0.4581} \\approx 3.218$\n\nSo, it will take approximately $3.218$ hours for the reactant to decrease to $1$ mole/liter."
