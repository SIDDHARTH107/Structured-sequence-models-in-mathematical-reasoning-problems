    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 5 cm and a hypotenuse of length 13 cm. What is the length of the third side using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let the base be a, the third side be b, and the hypotenuse be c. The theorem can be written as:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given the values of a and c:\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\n\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 12 cm."
