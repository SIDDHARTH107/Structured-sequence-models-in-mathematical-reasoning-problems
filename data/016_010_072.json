    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by the process of repeatedly filling the interstices between three mutually tangent circles with new circles that are also tangent to the original three. The curvatures of the circles in an Apollonian gasket follow a specific pattern.\n\nGiven three starting circles with curvatures k1, k2, and k3, the curvature of the new circle that is tangent to all three is given by the formula:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 + 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nIn this case, the starting curvatures are 1, 2, and 3. Applying the formula:\n\nk4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 * sqrt(1 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 1) = 6 + 2 * sqrt(11)\n\nNow, the Apollonian gasket is an infinite fractal, meaning that the process of adding new circles can be repeated infinitely. Therefore, there is an infinite number of circles in the Apollonian gasket constructed using three starting circles with curvatures of 1, 2, and 3."
