    "message_2": "A topological space X is called a T1-space if for every pair of distinct points x and y in X, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V. In other words, every pair of distinct points can be separated by open sets.\n\nLet's check if this property holds for the given space X with the topology τ.\n\n1. For points a and b:\n   Open set {a} contains a and not b, and open set {a, b} contains b and not c, d. So, a and b can be separated by open sets.\n\n2. For points a and c:\n   Open set {a} contains a and not c, but there is no open set in τ that contains c and not a. So, a and c cannot be separated by open sets.\n\nSince we found a pair of points (a and c) that cannot be separated by open sets, the space X with the given topology τ is not a T1-space."
