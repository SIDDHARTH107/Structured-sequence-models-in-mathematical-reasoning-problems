    "message_1": "A hospital wants to measure the survival time of patients who have undergone a certain heart surgery. The data collected shows that out of 100 patients, 20 patients died within the first year after the surgery. \n\nWhat is the probability that a patient who undergoes the surgery will survive at least two years?",
    "message_2": "Based on the information provided, we only know the number of patients who died within the first year after the surgery. To determine the probability of a patient surviving at least two years, we would need additional information about the number of patients who died in the second year or survived beyond that.\n\nWithout this information, it is not possible to calculate the probability of a patient surviving at least two years after the surgery."
