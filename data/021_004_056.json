Also, use the three-point forward difference formula with h = 0.5 to approximate f'(1.5). Finally, use the midpoint rule with n = 4 to approximate the definite integral of f(x) from x = -1.0 to x = 2.0.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the backward and forward difference approximations for f'(1.5).\n\nThree-point backward difference formula:\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x) - 4f(x - h) + 3f(x - 2h)) / (2h)\n\nUsing h = 0.5, x = 1.5:\nf'(1.5) ≈ (f(1.5) - 4f(1) + 3f(0.5)) / (2 * 0.5)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of f(x) for each x:\nf(1.5) = 2(1.5)^3 + 4(1.5)^2 - 6(1.5) + 1 = 6.75\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 + 4(1)^2 - 6(1) + 1 = 1\nf(0.5) = 2(0.5)^3 + 4(0.5)^2 - 6(0.5) + 1 = -0.25\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\nf'(1.5) ≈ (6.75 - 4(1) + 3(-0.25)) / 1 = 1.25\n\nNow, for the three-point forward difference formula:\nf'(x) ≈ (-3f(x) + 4f(x + h) - f(x + 2h)) / (2h)\n\nUsing h = 0.5, x = 1.5:\nf'(1.5) ≈ (-3f(1.5) + 4f(2) - f(2.5)) / (2 * 0.5)\n\nWe need to find the values of f(x) for each x:\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 + 4(2)^2 - 6(2) + 1 = 17\nf(2.5) = 2(2.5)^3 + 4(2.5)^2 - 6(2.5) + 1 = 40.25\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\nf'(1.5) ≈ (-3(6.75) + 4(17) - 40.25) / 1 = 1.75\n\nNow, let's approximate the definite integral using the midpoint rule with n = 4.\n\nThe interval is from -1.0 to 2.0, so the width of each subinterval is:\nΔx = (2 - (-1)) / 4 = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n\nThe midpoints of each subinterval are:\nx1 = -0.625, x2 = 0.125, x3 = 0.875, x4 = 1.625\n\nNow, we need to find the values of f(x) for each midpoint:\nf(-0.625) = 2(-0.625)^3 + 4(-0.625)^2 - 6(-0.625) + 1 = 3.380859375\nf(0.125) = 2(0.125)^3 + 4(0.125)^2 - 6(0.125) + 1 = 0.515625\nf(0.875) = 2(0.875)^3 + 4(0.875)^2 - 6(0.875) + 1 = 2.380859375\nf(1.625) = 2(1.625)^3 + 4(1.625)^2 - 6(1.625) + 1 = 10.380859375\n\nNow, we can use the midpoint rule to approximate the definite integral:\n∫f(x)dx ≈ Δx * (f(x1) + f(x2) + f(x3) + f(x4))\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.75 * (3.380859375 + 0.515625 + 2.380859375 + 10.380859375) = 12.5390625\n\nSo, the backward difference approximation for f'(1.5) is 1.25, the forward difference approximation is 1.75, and the midpoint rule approximation for the definite integral is 12.5390625."
