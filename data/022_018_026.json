    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using complex analysis methods, we will employ the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. The PDE is:\n\n∂u/∂t = i(∂²u/∂x²)\n\nwith the boundary conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = sin(x)\nu(0, t) = u(π, t) = 0\n\nFirst, we assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the PDE and divide by u(x, t):\n\n(1/T)∂T/∂t = i(1/X)∂²X/∂x²\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/T)∂T/∂t = -λ²\ni(1/X)∂²X/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1. (1/T)∂T/∂t = -λ²\n2. i(1/X)∂²X/∂x² = -λ²\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\n∂T/∂t = -λ²T\nT(t) = Ce^(-iλ²t)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nSolving the second ODE, we get:\n\ni∂²X/∂x² = -λ²X\nX''(x) = -λ²/i X(x)\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = X(π) = 0. The eigenvalues λ_n and eigenfunctions X_n(x) are:\n\nλ_n = n\nX_n(x) = sin(nx)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of the product of the eigenfunctions and time-dependent functions:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ[C_n sin(nx) e^(-in²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(x):\n\nsin(x) = Σ[C_n sin(nx)]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and we can find the coefficients using the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nC_n = (2/π) ∫[sin(x)sin(nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nFor n = 1, C_1 = 1, and for n ≠ 1, C_n = 0. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(x)e^(-it)"
