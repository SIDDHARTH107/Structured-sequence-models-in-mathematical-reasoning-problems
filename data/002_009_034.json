    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the total surface area of the cylinder in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area (the area around the cylinder). \n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of one circular base:\nA = π(5 cm)^2\nA = 25π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, we need to multiply this area by 2:\n2 * 25π = 50π square centimeters\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area:\nA = 2π(5 cm)(12 cm)\nA = 120π square centimeters\n\nFinally, let's add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 50π + 120π = 170π square centimeters\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 170π square centimeters."
