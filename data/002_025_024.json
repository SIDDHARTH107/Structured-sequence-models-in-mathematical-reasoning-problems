    "message_2": "This is an isosceles triangle with two equal sides and the angle between them given. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side.\n\nLet the two equal sides be a and b (both 8 cm), and the angle between them be C (45 degrees). Let the third side be c.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nc² = 8² + 8² - 2 * 8 * 8 * cos(45°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 45 degrees. In a right-angled triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. For a 45-degree angle, the adjacent and opposite sides are equal, so the cosine is 1/√2 or √2/2.\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the equation:\nc² = 64 + 64 - 2 * 8 * 8 * (√2/2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\nc² = 128 - 64√2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\nc = √(128 - 64√2)\n\nc ≈ 3.3137 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 3.3137 cm."
