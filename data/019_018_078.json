    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd numbers, a and b. By definition, an odd number can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let a = 2n1 + 1 and b = 2n2 + 1, where n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a and b:\n\na + b = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\na + b = 2n1 + 2n2 + 2\n\nFactor out the common factor of 2:\n\na + b = 2(n1 + n2 + 1)\n\nLet's define a new integer, n3 = n1 + n2 + 1. Since the sum of integers is also an integer, n3 is an integer.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\na + b = 2n3\n\nThis is the definition of an even number (a number that can be represented as 2 times an integer). Therefore, the sum of two odd numbers, a and b, is always even."
