    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph and find its automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself, is always present in the automorphism group. In this case, it is (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)(G).\n\n2. We can swap vertices B and E, and also swap vertices C and G. This automorphism is (BE)(CG)(A)(D)(F).\n\n3. We can swap vertices C and F, and also swap vertices D and G. This automorphism is (CF)(DG)(A)(B)(E).\n\n4. We can combine the automorphisms from points 2 and 3, resulting in the automorphism (BE)(CF)(A)(DG).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms for the given graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph is:\n\n{ (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)(G), (BE)(CG)(A)(D)(F), (CF)(DG)(A)(B)(E), (BE)(CF)(A)(DG) }"
