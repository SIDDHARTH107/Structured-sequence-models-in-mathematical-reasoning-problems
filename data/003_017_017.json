    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2sin(x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 2sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(x) with respect to x from 0 to π:\n\n∫ 2sin(x) dx = -2cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\n[-2cos(π) - (-2cos(0))] = [-2(-1) - (-2(1))] = [2 - (-2)] = 4\n\nNow, we plug this value back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 4 = 4/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is 4/π."
