    "message_1": "Suppose that a certain type of cyber attack occurs on a network with a probability of 0.05 in any given year. If the network has been in operation for 3 years, what is the probability that this type of cyber attack has occurred at least once during that period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least one cyber attack occurring, we can find the probability of no cyber attacks occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no cyber attack occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no cyber attacks to occur in all 3 years, the probabilities must be multiplied together: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability by subtracting the probability of no cyber attacks from 1: 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one cyber attack has occurred during the 3-year period is approximately 0.142625 or 14.26%."
