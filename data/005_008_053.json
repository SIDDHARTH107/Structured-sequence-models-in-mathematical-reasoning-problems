The data is given in the table below:\n\n| Month | Sales |\n|-------|-------|\n| Jan   | 100   |\n| Feb   | 120   |\n| Mar   | 90    |\n| Apr   | 110   |\n| May   | 150   |\n| Jun   | 130   |\n| Jul   | 140   |\n| Aug   | 120   |\n| Sep   | 110   |\n| Oct   | 100   |\n| Nov   | 90    |\n| Dec   | 95    |\n\nCalculate the following:\n\n1. Monthly moving average for the last 3 months.\n2. Monthly moving average for the last 6 months.\n3. Seasonal indices for each month.\n4. Forecast the sales for January 2020 using the seasonal indices.",
    "message_2": "1. Monthly moving average for the last 3 months:\n\nTo calculate the moving average for the last 3 months, we will take the average of the sales for October, November, and December.\n\n(100 + 90 + 95) / 3 = 285 / 3 = 95\n\nThe monthly moving average for the last 3 months is 95.\n\n2. Monthly moving average for the last 6 months:\n\nTo calculate the moving average for the last 6 months, we will take the average of the sales for July, August, September, October, November, and December.\n\n(140 + 120 + 110 + 100 + 90 + 95) / 6 = 655 / 6 ≈ 109.17\n\nThe monthly moving average for the last 6 months is approximately 109.17.\n\n3. Seasonal indices for each month:\n\nTo calculate the seasonal indices, we first need to find the average sales for the entire year.\n\nTotal sales for the year = 100 + 120 + 90 + 110 + 150 + 130 + 140 + 120 + 110 + 100 + 90 + 95 = 1355\n\nAverage sales per month = 1355 / 12 ≈ 112.92\n\nNow, we will calculate the seasonal index for each month by dividing the sales for that month by the average sales per month.\n\nJanuary: 100 / 112.92 ≈ 0.885\nFebruary: 120 / 112.92 ≈ 1.063\nMarch: 90 / 112.92 ≈ 0.797\nApril: 110 / 112.92 ≈ 0.974\nMay: 150 / 112.92 ≈ 1.328\nJune: 130 / 112.92 ≈ 1.151\nJuly: 140 / 112.92 ≈ 1.240\nAugust: 120 / 112.92 ≈ 1.063\nSeptember: 110 / 112.92 ≈ 0.974\nOctober: 100 / 112.92 ≈ 0.885\nNovember: 90 / 112.92 ≈ 0.797\nDecember: 95 / 112.92 ≈ 0.841\n\n4. Forecast the sales for January 2020 using the seasonal indices:\n\nTo forecast the sales for January 2020, we will use the seasonal index for January and multiply it by the moving average for the last 6 months (which is a more stable estimate than the last 3 months).\n\nJanuary 2020 forecast = Seasonal index for January * Moving average for the last 6 months\n= 0.885 * 109.17 ≈ 96.62\n\nThe forecasted sales for January 2020 are approximately 96.62 units."
