    "message_2": "Let's consider the person entering through each entrance one by one and count the number of ways they can exit.\n\n1. If the person enters through entrance 1, they have 4 exits to choose from (since they cannot exit through entrance 1).\n2. If the person enters through entrance 2, they have 4 exits to choose from (since they cannot exit through entrance 2).\n3. If the person enters through entrance 3, they have 4 exits to choose from (since they cannot exit through entrance 3).\n4. If the person enters through entrance 4, they have 4 exits to choose from (since they cannot exit through entrance 4).\n5. If the person enters through entrance 5, they have 4 exits to choose from (since they cannot exit through entrance 5).\n\nSo, for each of the 5 entrances, there are 4 possible exits. Therefore, there are a total of 5 entrances Ã— 4 exits = 20 ways for a person to enter and exit the park without using the same entrance and exit."
