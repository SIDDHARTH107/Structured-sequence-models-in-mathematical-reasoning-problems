    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one machine breaks down, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the machines break down and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single machine does not break down is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nSince there are 11 machines, the probability that none of them break down is 0.97^11 ≈ 0.716.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one machine breaks down, we subtract the probability that none of them break down from 1:\n\n1 - 0.716 ≈ 0.284.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one machine breaks down today is approximately 28.4%."
