    "message_2": "First, we need to represent the system of linear equations as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 -1 |\n    | 1 -4  6 |\n    | 2  1 -3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  5 |\n    | -2 |\n    |  4 |\n\nNow we need to find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we'll first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 3((-4)(-3) - (6)(1)) - 2((1)(-3) - (6)(2)) - 1((1)(1) - (2)(-4))\n       = 3(12 - 6) - 2(-3 - 12) - 1(1 + 8)\n       = 3(6) + 2(15) + 9\n       = 18 + 30 + 9\n       = 57\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now we'll find the inverse of A, denoted as A_inv.\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = | (-4)(-3) - (6)(1)  (1)(-3) - (6)(2)  (1)(1) - (2)(-4) |\n         | (2)(-3) - (1)(1)   (3)(-3) - (1)(-1)  (3)(2) - (1)(1)  |\n         | (2)(6) - (1)(-4)   (3)(6) - (1)(2)    (3)(1) - (1)(2)  |\n\nadj(A) = | 12   15   9  |\n         | -5   -8   5  |\n         | 16   16   1  |\n\nNow, we'll multiply (1/det(A)) by adj(A) to get A_inv.\n\nA_inv = (1/57) * | 12   15   9  |\n                | -5   -8   5  |\n                | 16   16   1  |\n\nNow we can find the values of x, y, and z by multiplying A_inv by B.\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = (1/57) * | 12   15   9  | * |  5 |\n             | -5   -8   5  |   | -2 |\n             | 16   16   1  |   |  4 |\n\nX = (1/57) * | (12)(5) + (15)(-2) + (9)(4)  |\n             | (-5)(5) + (-8)(-2) + (5)(4)  |\n             | (16)(5) + (16)(-2) + (1)(4)  |\n\nX = (1/57) * | 60 - 30 + 36 |\n             | -25 + 16 + 20 |\n             | 80 - 32 + 4   |\n\nX = (1/57) * | 66 |\n             | 11 |\n             | 52 |\n\nX = | 66/57 |\n    | 11/57 |\n    | 52/57 |\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = 66/57\ny = 11/57\nz = 52/57"
