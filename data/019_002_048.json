    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in Predicate logic:\n\nThere are 3 boxes in a room. Box 1 contains 7 white balls and 2 black balls, Box 2 contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls, and Box 3 contains 4 white balls and 3 black balls. Write a predicate logic statement to represent the following condition: \"Box 1 contains more white balls than black balls.\"\n\nOnce you have written the predicate logic statement, determine whether it is true or false.",
    "message_2": "Let W(x) represent the number of white balls in box x, and B(x) represent the number of black balls in box x. We can write the predicate logic statement for the given condition as:\n\nMoreWhiteThanBlack(1) = W(1) > B(1)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values for W(1) and B(1):\n\nMoreWhiteThanBlack(1) = 7 > 2\n\nSince 7 is greater than 2, the predicate logic statement MoreWhiteThanBlack(1) is true."
