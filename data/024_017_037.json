Find the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}$ along the curve $C$ from $(1,2,-3)$ to $(0,1,-1)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}$ along the curve $C$, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{D\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\vec{r}'(t)} \\vec{v} = 0$\n\nwhere $\\frac{D\\vec{v}}{dt}$ is the covariant derivative of the vector $\\vec{v}$ along the curve $C$ and $\\nabla_{\\vec{r}'(t)}$ is the covariant derivative along the tangent vector $\\vec{r}'(t)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\vec{r}'(t)$:\n\n$\\vec{r}'(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = -\\sin(t)\\hat{i} + \\cos(t)\\hat{j} + \\hat{k}$\n\nNow, we need to find the covariant derivative of $\\vec{v}$ along $\\vec{r}'(t)$:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\vec{r}'(t)} \\vec{v} = \\vec{r}'(t) \\cdot \\nabla \\vec{v} = -\\sin(t)\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial x} + \\cos(t)\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial z}$\n\nSince $\\vec{v}$ is a constant vector, its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial z} = 0$\n\nTherefore, the covariant derivative of $\\vec{v}$ along $\\vec{r}'(t)$ is also zero:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\vec{r}'(t)} \\vec{v} = 0$\n\nThis means that the vector $\\vec{v}$ is parallel transported along the curve $C$. Since the vector $\\vec{v}$ does not change along the curve, the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}$ from $(1,2,-3)$ to $(0,1,-1)$ is the same vector:\n\n$\\vec{v}_{\\text{parallel transported}} = 3\\hat{i} - 4\\hat{j} + 12\\hat{k}$"
