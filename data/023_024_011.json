    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x - 1 for -π ≤ x < π, we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nWhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x - 1, we can compute the Fourier coefficients as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x - 1) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x - 1) * cos(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x - 1) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nCalculating a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2/2 - x] | [-π, π] = (1/π) * [(π^2/2 - π) - (-π^2/2 + π)] = 0\n\nCalculating a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [x * cos(n * x) / n + sin(n * x) / n^2 - cos(n * x) / n] | [-π, π]\na_n = (1/π) * [(π * cos(n * π) / n + sin(n * π) / n^2 - cos(n * π) / n) - (-π * cos(-n * π) / n + sin(-n * π) / n^2 - cos(-n * π) / n)]\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and sin(n * π) = 0, we have:\na_n = (1/π) * [(π * (-1)^n / n - (-1)^n / n) - (-π * (-1)^n / n + (-1)^n / n)] = 0\n\nCalculating b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [x * sin(n * x) / n - cos(n * x) / n^2] | [-π, π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(π * sin(n * π) / n - cos(n * π) / n^2) - (-π * sin(-n * π) / n + cos(-n * π) / n^2)]\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, we have:\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1)^n / n^2 - (-1)^n / n^2] = (2 * (-1)^n) / (n * π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x - 1:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2 * (-1)^n) / (n * π) * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo evaluate the Fourier series at x = π/2:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ [(2 * (-1)^n) / (n * π) * sin(n * π/2)]\n\nNotice that sin(n * π/2) = 0 for even n, and sin(n * π/2) = 1 for odd n. Therefore, we can rewrite the summation for odd n only:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ [(2 * (-1)^n) / (n * π)] (for odd n)\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the series:\n\nn = 1: (2 * (-1)) / (π) = -2/π\nn = 3: (2 * (-1)^3) / (3 * π) = 2/(3 * π)\nn = 5: (2 * (-1)^5) / (5 * π) = -2/(5 * π)\n\nf(π/2) ≈ -2/π + 2/(3 * π) - 2/(5 * π) + ...\n\nThe Fourier series converges to the value of the function at x = π/2, so:\n\nf(π/2) = π/2 - 1 ≈ -2/π + 2/(3 * π) - 2/(5 * π) + ..."
