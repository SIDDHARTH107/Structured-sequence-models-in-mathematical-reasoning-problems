    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the length of its diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal length (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(L² + W² + H²)\n\nwhere L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism are:\nLength (L) = 6 cm\nWidth (W) = 4 cm\nHeight (H) = 5 cm\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = √(6² + 4² + 5²)\nD = √(36 + 16 + 25)\nD = √77\n\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √77 cm."
