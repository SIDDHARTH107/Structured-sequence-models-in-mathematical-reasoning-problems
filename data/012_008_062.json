    "message_2": "Kuratowski's theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to either K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nTo determine if the given graph with 9 vertices and 13 edges is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, v = 9 and e = 13. We can rearrange the formula to solve for f:\n\nf = 2 - v + e = 2 - 9 + 13 = 6\n\nNow, let's consider the number of edges in a planar graph. Each face must have at least 3 edges, and each edge can be part of at most 2 faces. Therefore, we have:\n\ne ≤ 3f/2\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\n13 ≤ 3(6)/2\n13 ≤ 9\n\nThis inequality is false, which means that the given graph cannot be planar. Therefore, according to Kuratowski's theorem, the graph must contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to either K5 or K3,3."
