Assume the initial stock price is $S_0 = 100$, $\\mu = 0.05$, $\\sigma = 0.25$, and the time interval is $T = 1$ year.\n\nWhat is the probability that the stock price will be between $110$ and $120$ at the end of the year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the properties of the geometric Brownian motion, which is the solution to the given stochastic differential equation. The stock price at time $t$ follows a log-normal distribution:\n\n$$S_t = S_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$$\\ln(S_t) = \\ln(S_0) + (\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t + \\sigma W_t$$\n\nNow, we can see that $\\ln(S_t)$ follows a normal distribution with mean $(\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t$ and variance $\\sigma^2 t$. In our case, $t = T = 1$ year. So, the mean and variance are:\n\n$$\\text{Mean} = \\ln(S_0) + (\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}) = \\ln(100) + (0.05 - \\frac{0.25^2}{2}) = 4.60517 + 0.03125 = 4.63642$$\n\n$$\\text{Variance} = \\sigma^2 = 0.25^2 = 0.0625$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the stock price will be between $110$ and $120$ at the end of the year. We can rewrite this in terms of the natural logarithm:\n\n$$\\ln(110) \\leq \\ln(S_t) \\leq \\ln(120)$$\n\nNow, we can standardize the normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\ln(110) - 4.63642}{\\sqrt{0.0625}} \\leq \\frac{\\ln(S_t) - 4.63642}{\\sqrt{0.0625}} \\leq \\frac{\\ln(120) - 4.63642}{\\sqrt{0.0625}}$$\n\nCalculating the values:\n\n$$-0.43068 \\leq Z \\leq 1.15132$$\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability:\n\n$$P(-0.43068 \\leq Z \\leq 1.15132) = \\Phi(1.15132) - \\Phi(-0.43068)$$\n\nUsing a calculator or a standard normal distribution table:\n\n$$P(-0.43068 \\leq Z \\leq 1.15132) = 0.87493 - 0.3336 = 0.54133$$\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will be between $110$ and $120$ at the end of the year is approximately $54.13\\%$."
