    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(s). A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts. \n\nFirst, let's find the poles of the transfer function by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 3s + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots (the poles) using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-3 ± √(3^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\ns = (-3 ± √(9 - 8)) / 2\ns = (-3 ± √1) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible values for s:\n\ns1 = (-3 + 1) / 2 = -1\ns2 = (-3 - 1) / 2 = -2\n\nBoth poles have negative real parts (-1 and -2), which means the system is stable."
