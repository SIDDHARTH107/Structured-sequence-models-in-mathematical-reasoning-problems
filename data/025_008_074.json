    "message_2": "(a) To determine the degree of the curve, we look at the highest total degree of the terms in the equation. In this case, the equation is $y^2 = x^3 - x + 1$. The highest total degree is $3$ (from the term $x^3$), so the degree of the curve is $3$.\n\n(b) The Hodge numbers of a curve are given by the Hodge diamond, which for a curve of genus $g$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n & & h^{0,0} & & \\\\\n & h^{1,0} & & h^{0,1} & \\\\\nh^{2,0} & & h^{1,1} & & h^{0,2} \\\\\n & h^{2,1} & & h^{1,2} & \\\\\n & & h^{2,2} & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFor an algebraic curve, the Hodge diamond simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n & h^{0,0} & \\\\\nh^{1,0} & & h^{0,1} \\\\\n & h^{1,1} & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe genus $g$ of a curve of degree $d$ is given by the formula $g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$. In this case, $d = 3$, so $g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$. Thus, the Hodge numbers are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n & 1 & \\\\\n1 & & 1 \\\\\n & 1 & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n(c) The dimensions of the spaces of holomorphic differentials and harmonic forms on the curve are given by the Hodge numbers $h^{1,0}$ and $h^{1,1}$, respectively. In this case, both are equal to $1$.\n\n(d) To show that the curve admits a non-constant meromorphic function $f(z)$ such that $df(z)$ is a holomorphic differential on the curve, we can construct such a function explicitly. Consider the function $f(z) = x(z)$. Then, $df(z) = dx(z)$, which is a holomorphic differential on the curve.\n\nTo see that $f(z)$ is non-constant, note that the curve is of genus $1$, which means it is an elliptic curve. Elliptic curves are non-singular, and any non-singular curve of genus $1$ is an elliptic curve. Since $f(z) = x(z)$ takes on different values for different points on the curve, it is a non-constant meromorphic function."
