    "message_2": "To calculate the sectional curvature of the surface given by the equation z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1,1,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's denote the surface as S.\n\n1. Parametrize the surface S:\nLet's use the parametrization φ(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2), where x = u, y = v, and z = u^2 - v^2.\n\n2. Compute the first fundamental form:\nCalculate the tangent vectors:\nφ_u = ∂φ/∂u = (1, 0, 2u)\nφ_v = ∂φ/∂v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nCompute the metric tensor (dot products of tangent vectors):\nE = <φ_u, φ_u> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <φ_u, φ_v> = 0\nG = <φ_v, φ_v> = 1 + 4v^2\n\n3. Compute the second fundamental form:\nCalculate the normal vector N (cross product of tangent vectors, then normalize):\nN = (φ_u × φ_v) / ||φ_u × φ_v|| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 4(u^2 + v^2))\n\nCompute the shape operator S (matrix of second derivatives of φ with respect to N):\nS = (S_ij) = (∂^2φ/∂u∂v) • N\nS_11 = ∂^2φ/∂u^2 • N = -4u\nS_12 = ∂^2φ/∂u∂v • N = 0\nS_21 = S_12 = 0\nS_22 = ∂^2φ/∂v^2 • N = -4v\n\n4. Compute the Gaussian curvature K:\nK = (S_11 * S_22 - S_12 * S_21) / (E * G - F^2)\nK = (-4u * -4v) / ((1 + 4u^2) * (1 + 4v^2))\n\n5. Evaluate K at the point (1,1,0):\nK(1,1,0) = (-4 * 1 * -4 * 1) / ((1 + 4 * 1^2) * (1 + 4 * 1^2)) = 16 / (5 * 5) = 16/25\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1,1,0) is 16/25 in terms of the Gaussian curvature."
