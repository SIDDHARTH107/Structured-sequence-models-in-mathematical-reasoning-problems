    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change with iterations. It remains constant at every stage of the construction. To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, the curve is divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 3 (M = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the fourth iteration (or any iteration) is approximately 1.2619."
