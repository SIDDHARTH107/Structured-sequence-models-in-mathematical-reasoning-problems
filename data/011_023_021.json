    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nIn a complete graph with 6 vertices, the minimum number of colors needed is 6. This is because each vertex is connected to every other vertex, and to ensure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, each vertex must have a unique color.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete and has a different structure, the minimum number of colors needed might be less than 6. For example, if the graph is a cycle with 6 vertices, then the minimum number of colors needed is 2 (alternating colors around the cycle).\n\nIn general, the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph with 6 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure and can range from 2 to 6."
