    "message_1": "Let $C$ be the curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$ and let $P = (-1, 0)$ be a point on $C$. Find the equation of the tangent to $C$ at $P$ and the equation of the normal to $C$ at $P$. Then, find the coordinates of the point $Q$ where the tangent and the normal intersect.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent to the curve $C$ at point $P$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. Implicitly differentiating the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 4$\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the tangent at point $P(-1, 0)$ by plugging in the coordinates of $P$ into the equation above:\n\n$2(0)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(-1)^2 - 4$\n\n$0 = 3 - 4$\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at point $P$ is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$. Since the tangent has a slope of $0$, it must be a horizontal line. Therefore, the equation of the tangent to the curve $C$ at point $P$ is:\n\n$y = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the normal to the curve $C$ at point $P$. Since the tangent is a horizontal line, the normal must be a vertical line. Therefore, the equation of the normal to the curve $C$ at point $P$ is:\n\n$x = -1$\n\nFinally, we need to find the coordinates of the point $Q$ where the tangent and the normal intersect. Since the tangent is a horizontal line with equation $y = 0$ and the normal is a vertical line with equation $x = -1$, the point $Q$ must have coordinates:\n\n$Q = (-1, 0)$\n\nSo, the tangent and the normal intersect at point $Q(-1, 0)$."
