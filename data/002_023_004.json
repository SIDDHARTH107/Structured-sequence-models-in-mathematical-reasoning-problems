    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (4 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 16 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 64 * π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere with a radius of 4 cm is approximately 201.06 cm^2 (rounded to two decimal places)."
