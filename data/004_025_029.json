    "message_1": "A car is traveling with a velocity of 30 m/s and is decelerating at a rate of 5 m/s². What distance will the car cover before coming to a complete stop?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following equation from classical mechanics:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity (0 m/s, since the car comes to a complete stop)\nu = initial velocity (30 m/s)\na = acceleration (deceleration in this case, so -5 m/s²)\ns = distance covered\n\nWe need to find the value of s. Plugging in the given values:\n\n0 = (30)^2 + 2(-5)s\n\n0 = 900 - 10s\n\n10s = 900\n\ns = 900 / 10\n\ns = 90 meters\n\nThe car will cover a distance of 90 meters before coming to a complete stop."
