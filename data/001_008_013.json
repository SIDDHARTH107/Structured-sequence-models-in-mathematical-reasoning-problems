    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 4 > 10, we need to isolate x. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality.\n3x + 4 - 4 > 10 - 4\n3x > 6\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3.\n3x/3 > 6/3\nx > 2\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x > 2. This means that any real number greater than 2 will satisfy the inequality."
