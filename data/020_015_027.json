    "message_1": "A sheet of paper needs to be transformed into a rectangular-shaped flyer with a maximum area of 250 square cm. One of the sides of the flyer needs to be 5 cm longer than the other. What should be the dimensions of the flyer to achieve the maximum area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the shorter side of the flyer be x cm. Then the length of the longer side will be (x + 5) cm. The area of the flyer can be represented as A = x(x + 5).\n\nWe are given that the maximum area is 250 square cm. So, we have the inequality:\n\nx(x + 5) â‰¤ 250\n\nTo find the dimensions that give the maximum area, we can first try to find when the area is equal to 250:\n\nx(x + 5) = 250\n\nx^2 + 5x - 250 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring works:\n\n(x - 10)(x + 25) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x: x = 10 and x = -25. Since the length cannot be negative, we discard the second solution. So, the shorter side of the flyer should be 10 cm long. The longer side will be 10 + 5 = 15 cm long.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the flyer should be 10 cm by 15 cm to achieve the maximum area of 250 square cm."
