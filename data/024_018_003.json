    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface defined by the equation z = x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (2, 3, 4), we first need to find the first and second partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2. Then:\n\nf_x = ∂f/∂x = 2x\nf_y = ∂f/∂y = 4y\nf_xx = ∂²f/∂x² = 2\nf_yy = ∂²f/∂y² = 8\nf_xy = ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H of the surface at the point (2, 3, 4). To do this, we need to compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet's denote the given surface as S: S(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 + 2y^2). Then, the tangent vectors are:\n\nT_x = ∂S/∂x = (1, 0, 2x)\nT_y = ∂S/∂y = (0, 1, 4y)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <T_x, T_x> = 1 + 0 + 4x^2\nF = <T_x, T_y> = 0 + 0 + 8xy\nG = <T_y, T_y> = 0 + 1 + 16y^2\n\nAt the point (2, 3, 4), we have:\n\nE(2, 3) = 1 + 0 + 4(2^2) = 17\nF(2, 3) = 0 + 0 + 8(2)(3) = 48\nG(2, 3) = 0 + 1 + 16(3^2) = 145\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <∂²S/∂x², N> = f_xx = 2\nM = <∂²S/∂x∂y, N> = f_xy = 0\nN = <∂²S/∂y², N> = f_yy = 8\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (2 * 8 - 0^2) / (17 * 145 - 48^2) = 16 / (2495 - 2304) = 16 / 191\n\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / 2(EG - F^2) = (2 * 145 + 17 * 8 - 2 * 0) / 2(191) = (290 + 136) / 382 = 426 / 382 = 213 / 191\n\nThe sectional curvature at the point (2, 3, 4) is equal to the Gaussian curvature K, which is:\n\nK = 16 / 191"
