    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (central angle / 360) * π * radius^2\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (60 / 360) * π * 8^2\nArea = (1/6) * π * 64\nArea = 64π/6\n\nThe area of the sector is approximately 33.51 square centimeters."
