    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also in A and in B.\n\nRecall that the intersection of two sets, A ∩ B, is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x in A ∩ B. Since x is in A ∩ B, it must be in both A and B by the definition of intersection.\n\nFor our specific example, let's examine each element in A ∩ B:\n\n1. 3 is in A ∩ B, and it is also in A and in B.\n2. 4 is in A ∩ B, and it is also in A and in B.\n3. 5 is in A ∩ B, and it is also in A and in B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also in A and in B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A and a subset of B."
