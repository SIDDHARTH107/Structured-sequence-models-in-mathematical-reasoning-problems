    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To minimize the number of vertices in the vertex cover, we want to select vertices that cover as many edges as possible.\n\nIn the worst case, we might have a graph where the maximum degree of any vertex is 2 (i.e., each vertex is connected to at most two other vertices). In this case, we would need to select at least half of the vertices to form a vertex cover. Since there are 8 vertices, we would need to select at least 4 vertices in this case.\n\nHowever, we know that there are 10 edges in the graph. If the maximum degree of any vertex is 2, then the total number of edges would be at most 8, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with a degree greater than 2.\n\nLet's consider the case where there is a vertex with a degree of 3. In this case, we can select this vertex and cover 3 edges. We are then left with 7 edges to cover. In the worst case, we would need to select one vertex for each of the remaining edges, which would give us a total of 4 vertices in the vertex cover (1 for the vertex with degree 3, and 3 for the remaining edges).\n\nHowever, it is possible that there are more vertices with a degree greater than 2. In this case, we can select these vertices to cover even more edges, potentially reducing the number of vertices needed in the vertex cover.\n\nIn the best case, we might have a graph where there are two vertices with a degree of 5, and these vertices are connected to all other vertices in the graph. In this case, we can select these two vertices to form a vertex cover, as they cover all 10 edges.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices that need to be selected to form a vertex cover for this graph is 2."
