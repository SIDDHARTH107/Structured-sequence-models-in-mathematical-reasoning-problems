    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 4 > 7x - 5, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Move all the terms with x to one side of the inequality and the constants to the other side.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n3x - 3x + 4 > 7x - 3x - 5\n4 > 4x - 5\n\n2. Now, add 5 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n4 + 5 > 4x - 5 + 5\n9 > 4x\n\n3. Finally, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:\n9/4 > 4x/4\n9/4 > x\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < 9/4."
