    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 10 \\\\\n6 & 3 & 15\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to try to get the matrix into row-echelon form. We'll start by dividing the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0.5 & 2.5 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 10 \\\\\n6 & 3 & 15\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the leading terms in the second and third rows. To do this, we'll subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0.5 & 2.5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations is dependent and has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express the remaining equation in terms of one variable:\n\n$$\nx + 0.5y = 2.5\n$$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$$\nx = 2.5 - 0.5y\n$$\n\nSince there is no unique solution for x and y, we can express the general solution as:\n\n$$\nx = 2.5 - 0.5y, y = y\n$$\n\nThis means that there are infinitely many solutions for this system of linear equations, and they can be found by substituting any value for y into the equation for x."
