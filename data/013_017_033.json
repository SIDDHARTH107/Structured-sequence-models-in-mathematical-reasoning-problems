    "message_1": "Suppose there are two sellers of used cars in a market with only two types of cars, High Quality (HQ) and Low Quality (LQ). The values of a perfect car are $14,000 and $9,000 respectively, but the cost of production is the same for both types and is equal to $7,000. The probability that a seller has an HQ car is 0.6, while the probability of having an LQ car is 0.4.\n\na) If both sellers ask for the same price, what will that price be?\n\nb) If one of the sellers knows the quality of their car, while the other does not, what is the minimum price that the informed seller should ask for their HQ car to avoid adverse selection?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the price that both sellers will ask for, we need to calculate the expected value of a car in this market. The expected value is the sum of the probabilities of each type of car multiplied by their respective values.\n\nExpected value = (probability of HQ car * value of HQ car) + (probability of LQ car * value of LQ car)\n\nExpected value = (0.6 * $14,000) + (0.4 * $9,000)\nExpected value = ($8,400) + ($3,600)\nExpected value = $12,000\n\nSo, if both sellers ask for the same price, that price will be $12,000.\n\nb) If one of the sellers knows the quality of their car (HQ) and wants to avoid adverse selection, they should ask for a price higher than the expected value of a car in the market. This is because if they ask for the same price as the expected value, buyers may assume that their car is of lower quality (LQ) since they are not asking for a higher price for an HQ car.\n\nThe minimum price that the informed seller should ask for their HQ car is any price higher than the expected value of $12,000. For example, they could ask for $12,001 or any other price above $12,000 to signal that their car is of higher quality and avoid adverse selection."
