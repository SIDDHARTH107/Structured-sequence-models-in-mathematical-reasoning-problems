    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix, and then find the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2 -3  4 |\n| 3  2  5 |\n| 1  4 -2 |\n\nLet's find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (denoted as D):\nD = 2((2 * -2) - (5 * 4)) - (-3)((3 * -2) - (5 * 1)) + 4((3 * 4) - (2 * 1))\nD = 2(-4 - 20) - (-3)(-6 - 5) + 4(12 - 2)\nD = 2(-24) - (-3)(-11) + 4(10)\nD = -48 + 33 + 40\nD = 25\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column with the constants (denoted as Dx):\n| 10  -3  4 |\n|  7   2  5 |\n| -1   4 -2 |\n\nDx = 10((2 * -2) - (5 * 4)) - (-3)((7 * -2) - (5 * -1)) + 4((-1 * 4) - (2 * -1))\nDx = 10(-4 - 20) - (-3)(-14 - 5) + 4(-4 + 2)\nDx = 10(-24) - (-3)(-19) + 4(-2)\nDx = -240 + 57 - 8\nDx = -191\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column with the constants (denoted as Dy):\n|  2  10  4 |\n|  3   7  5 |\n|  1  -1 -2 |\n\nDy = 2((7 * -2) - (5 * -1)) - 10((3 * -2) - (5 * 1)) + 4((3 * -1) - (7 * 1))\nDy = 2(-14 + 5) - 10(-6 - 5) + 4(-3 - 7)\nDy = 2(-9) - 10(-11) + 4(-10)\nDy = -18 + 110 - 40\nDy = 52\n\nFinally, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the third column with the constants (denoted as Dz):\n|  2  -3  10 |\n|  3   2   7 |\n|  1   4  -1 |\n\nDz = 2((2 * -1) - (7 * 4)) - (-3)((3 * -1) - (7 * 1)) + 10((3 * 4) - (2 * 1))\nDz = 2(-2 - 28) - (-3)(-3 - 7) + 10(12 - 2)\nDz = 2(-30) - (-3)(-10) + 10(10)\nDz = -60 + 30 + 100\nDz = 70\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z using the determinants:\n\nx = Dx / D = -191 / 25\ny = Dy / D = 52 / 25\nz = Dz / D = 70 / 25\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -191/25\ny = 52/25\nz = 70/25"
