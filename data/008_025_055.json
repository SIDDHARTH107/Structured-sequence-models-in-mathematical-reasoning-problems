    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n4x + 6y = 8\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 8\n4x + 6y = 7\n\nWe can subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 7 - 8\n0 = -1\n\nSince 0 â‰  -1, the system of linear equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution."
