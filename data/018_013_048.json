    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B, which is the Cartesian product of sets A and B. This means that we will create ordered pairs with the elements of A as the first element and the elements of B as the second element.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∪ {5}. This is the union of the set A × B and the set {5}, which means we will combine the elements of both sets without repeating any elements.\n\n(A × B) ∪ {5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5}\n\nNext, let's find {5} × A, which is the Cartesian product of sets {5} and A. This means that we will create ordered pairs with the element 5 as the first element and the elements of A as the second element.\n\n{5} × A = {(5, 1), (5, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find ({5} × A) ∪ B. This is the union of the set {5} × A and the set B, which means we will combine the elements of both sets without repeating any elements.\n\n({5} × A) ∪ B = {(5, 1), (5, 2), 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets (A × B) ∪ {5} and ({5} × A) ∪ B:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5}\n({5} × A) ∪ B = {(5, 1), (5, 2), 3, 4}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as they have different elements. Specifically, the set (A × B) ∪ {5} has the ordered pairs (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), and (2, 4), while the set ({5} × A) ∪ B has the ordered pairs (5, 1) and (5, 2)."
