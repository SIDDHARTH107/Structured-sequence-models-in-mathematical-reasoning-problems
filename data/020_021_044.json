    "message_1": "A factory has a production line that operates for 10 hours a day. It produces two types of products: A and B. Product A takes 2 hours to produce and sells for $100 per unit, while product B takes 1 hour and sells for $75 per unit. For each day, the factory can produce a maximum of 400 units of product A and 500 units of product B. The factory wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the factory produce per day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced per day and y be the number of units of product B produced per day. The profit function P(x, y) can be represented as:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 75y\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Time constraint: 2x + y <= 10 * 60 (10 hours a day, converted to minutes)\n2. Maximum units of product A: x <= 400\n3. Maximum units of product B: y <= 500\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nWe can rewrite the time constraint as y <= -2x + 600.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of P(x, y) subject to these constraints. We can use the graphical method to solve this linear programming problem. First, we plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. y = -2x + 600 (boundary of the feasible region)\n2. x = 400 (vertical line)\n3. y = 500 (horizontal line)\n4. x = 0 (y-axis)\n5. y = 0 (x-axis)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points (0, 0), (0, 500), (200, 200), (300, 0), and (400, 0). We will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 100(0) + 75(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 500) = 100(0) + 75(500) = $37,500\n3. P(200, 200) = 100(200) + 75(200) = $35,000\n4. P(300, 0) = 100(300) + 75(0) = $30,000\n5. P(400, 0) = 100(400) + 75(0) = $40,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $40,000, which occurs when the factory produces 400 units of product A and 0 units of product B per day."
