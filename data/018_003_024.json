    "message_2": "To show that the union of Set A and Set B is a superset of Set A and Set B individually, we first need to find the union of Set A and Set B.\n\nThe union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either Set A or Set B or in both. So, the union of Set A and Set B, denoted as A ∪ B, can be found as follows:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of both Set A and Set B.\n\nA set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C. In other words, if D ⊆ C.\n\n1. Checking if A ∪ B is a superset of Set A:\n\nEvery element in Set A (2, 4, 6, 8) is also present in A ∪ B. Therefore, A ⊆ (A ∪ B).\n\n2. Checking if A ∪ B is a superset of Set B:\n\nEvery element in Set B (1, 3, 5, 7) is also present in A ∪ B. Therefore, B ⊆ (A ∪ B).\n\nSince A ⊆ (A ∪ B) and B ⊆ (A ∪ B), we can conclude that the union of Set A and Set B (A ∪ B) is a superset of Set A and Set B individually."
