    "message_2": "To select a committee of 3 members from 20 members without considering the order, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of members (20 in this case), k is the number of members to be selected (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20-3)!)\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!17!)\n\nC(20, 3) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17!)/(3 × 2 × 1 × 17!)\n\nC(20, 3) = (20 × 19 × 18) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(20, 3) = 6840 / 6\n\nC(20, 3) = 1140\n\nTherefore, there are 1140 ways to select a committee of 3 members from a club of 20 members when the order of selection doesn't matter."
