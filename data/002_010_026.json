    "message_2": "An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the side length, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides:\n\nSide length of equilateral triangle = Perimeter / 3 = 30 cm / 3 = 10 cm\n\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides. Since the hexagon has the same side length as the equilateral triangle, each side of the hexagon is also 10 cm long.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the hexagon, we can multiply the side length by the number of sides:\n\nPerimeter of hexagon = Side length × 6 = 10 cm × 6 = 60 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular hexagon is 60 cm."
