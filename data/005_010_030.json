    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces computer chips, and it is known that approximately 5% of the chips are defective. A quality control manager wants to select a random sample of 100 chips to estimate the proportion of defective chips. Using Bayesian statistics, what is the probability that the proportion of defective chips in the sample will be greater than 10%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to define a prior distribution for the proportion of defective chips, update it with the data from the sample, and then calculate the probability of interest.\n\nLet's assume a Beta distribution as the prior for the proportion of defective chips, with parameters α and β. Since the company knows that approximately 5% of the chips are defective, we can set α = 5 and β = 95, which gives a mean of α / (α + β) = 5 / (5 + 95) = 0.05.\n\nNow, let's consider the sample of 100 chips. Let X be the number of defective chips in the sample. We want to find the probability P(X > 10 | n = 100), where n is the sample size.\n\nUsing the Beta-binomial conjugate model, the posterior distribution for the proportion of defective chips given the data is also a Beta distribution, with parameters α' = α + X and β' = β + n - X.\n\nTo find the probability P(X > 10 | n = 100), we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the posterior Beta distribution:\n\nP(X > 10 | n = 100) = 1 - P(X <= 10 | n = 100) = 1 - CDF(Beta(α' = α + X, β' = β + n - X); x = 10/100)\n\nWe can calculate this probability using a numerical method or software that computes the CDF of the Beta distribution. For example, using Python's scipy.stats package:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import beta\n\nalpha = 5\nbeta_param = 95\nn = 100\nx = 10\n\n# Calculate the CDF of the posterior Beta distribution at x = 10/100\ncdf_value = beta.cdf(x / n, alpha + x, beta_param + n - x)\n\n# Calculate the probability P(X > 10 | n = 100)\nprob = 1 - cdf_value\n\nprint(prob)\n```\n\nThis will give you the probability that the proportion of defective chips in the sample will be greater than 10% using Bayesian statistics."
