    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 7x - 3, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, for the given function:\n\n∫(4x^3 - 6x^2 + 7x - 3) dx = ∫(4x^3) dx - ∫(6x^2) dx + ∫(7x) dx - ∫(3) dx\n\nNow, we apply the power rule for each term:\n\n∫(4x^3) dx = (4x^(3+1))/(3+1) = x^4\n∫(6x^2) dx = (6x^(2+1))/(2+1) = 2x^3\n∫(7x) dx = (7x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (7/2)x^2\n∫(3) dx = 3x\n\nNow, we combine the results and add the constant of integration (C):\n\nF(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 + (7/2)x^2 + 3x + C"
