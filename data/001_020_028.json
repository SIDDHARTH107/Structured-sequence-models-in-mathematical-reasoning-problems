    "message_2": "To find the intersection points, we need to first find the equations for both graphs.\n\nFor |x + 3| = 4, there are two possibilities:\n1. x + 3 = 4, which gives x = 1\n2. -(x + 3) = 4, which gives x = -7\n\nSo, the two equations for the first graph are x = 1 and x = -7.\n\nFor |y - 2| = 3, there are also two possibilities:\n1. y - 2 = 3, which gives y = 5\n2. -(y - 2) = 3, which gives y = -1\n\nSo, the two equations for the second graph are y = 5 and y = -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points between these equations:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 1 and y = 5:\nThe point is (1, 5).\n\n2. Intersection of x = 1 and y = -1:\nThe point is (1, -1).\n\n3. Intersection of x = -7 and y = 5:\nThe point is (-7, 5).\n\n4. Intersection of x = -7 and y = -1:\nThe point is (-7, -1).\n\nSo, the coordinates of the points where the two graphs intersect are (1, 5), (1, -1), (-7, 5), and (-7, -1)."
