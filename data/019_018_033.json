Implication Introduction (→I)\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. p (AS) - We assume p is true.\n2. p ∧ q (AS) - We assume q is true.\n3. p ∧ q (∧I 1,2) - From 1 and 2, we can introduce the conjunction p ∧ q.\n4. p → (p ∧ q) (→I 1-3) - From the assumption of p in step 1, we can introduce the implication p → (p ∧ q).\n\nTherefore, we have proven the propositional formula p → p ∧ q using natural deduction."
