Using frequency analysis, determine the most likely plaintext letter corresponding to each of the ciphertext letters.",
    "message_2": "Frequency analysis is a technique used to break substitution ciphers by analyzing the frequency of letters in the ciphertext and comparing them to the frequency of letters in the plaintext language (in this case, English).\n\nIn English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D, in that order. Since we are given the frequency of three ciphertext letters (E, D, and G), we can make an educated guess as to which plaintext letters they might correspond to.\n\nCiphertext letter E appears 50 times, which is the highest frequency. Therefore, it is most likely to correspond to the most common letter in English, which is \"E\" in plaintext.\n\nCiphertext letter D appears 30 times, which is the second-highest frequency. Therefore, it is most likely to correspond to the second most common letter in English, which is \"T\" in plaintext.\n\nCiphertext letter G appears 20 times, which is the third-highest frequency. Therefore, it is most likely to correspond to the third most common letter in English, which is \"A\" in plaintext.\n\nFor the other letters that appear less than 10 times each, we do not have enough information to make a confident guess about their corresponding plaintext letters. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the remaining common letters in English (O, I, N, S, H, R, and D)."
