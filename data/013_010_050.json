    "message_1": "Suppose two companies, A and B, are the only producers in a market for a certain product. Both companies can produce the product at a constant marginal cost of $25 per unit. The market demand for the product is given by the inverse demand function p = 200 - Q, where p is the price (in dollars) and Q is the total output in the market. Using the Cournot model, what will be the output, profits and price for each company if they choose their quantities simultaneously?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Cournot model, we need to find the reaction functions for both companies A and B, and then find the Nash equilibrium where both companies' strategies are optimal given the other company's strategy.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by companies A and B, respectively. The total output in the market is Q = qA + qB. The inverse demand function is p = 200 - Q = 200 - (qA + qB).\n\nThe revenue for each company is given by the product of the price and the quantity produced: R_A = p * qA and R_B = p * qB. The cost for each company is given by the product of the marginal cost and the quantity produced: C_A = 25 * qA and C_B = 25 * qB.\n\nThe profit for each company is the difference between the revenue and the cost: π_A = R_A - C_A and π_B = R_B - C_B.\n\nSubstituting the inverse demand function and the cost functions into the profit functions, we get:\n\nπ_A = (200 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 25 * qA\nπ_B = (200 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 25 * qB\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the first-order conditions by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to the quantities produced and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂π_A/∂qA = 200 - 2qA - qB - 25 = 0\n∂π_B/∂qB = 200 - 2qB - qA - 25 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nqA = 50 - (1/2)qB\nqB = 50 - (1/2)qA\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nqB = 50 - (1/2)(50 - (1/2)qB)\nqB = 50 - 25 + (1/4)qB\n(3/4)qB = 25\nqB = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\nSubstituting qB back into the first equation, we get:\n\nqA = 50 - (1/2)(100/3)\nqA = 50 - 50/3\nqA = 100/3 ≈ 33.33\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantities for both companies A and B are approximately 33.33 units each.\n\nNow, we can find the market price by substituting the equilibrium quantities into the inverse demand function:\n\np = 200 - (qA + qB)\np = 200 - (100/3 + 100/3)\np = 200 - 200/3\np = 400/3 ≈ 133.33\n\nFinally, we can find the profits for each company by substituting the equilibrium quantities and price into the profit functions:\n\nπ_A = (133.33)(100/3) - 25(100/3) ≈ 108.33(100/3) ≈ 3611.11\nπ_B = (133.33)(100/3) - 25(100/3) ≈ 108.33(100/3) ≈ 3611.11\n\nIn summary, under the Cournot model, both companies A and B will produce approximately 33.33 units each, the market price will be approximately $133.33, and both companies will have profits of approximately $3611.11."
