    "message_2": "Mori theory is a mathematical concept used in algebraic geometry and is not applicable for computing the slope of the tangent line of a curve of degree 5 in the plane. Instead, we can use calculus to find the slope of the tangent line at the given point.\n\nLet the curve be represented by the equation y = f(x) = ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f, where a, b, c, d, e, and f are constants.\n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 3), we need to compute the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nf'(x) = 5ax^4 + 4bx^3 + 3cx^2 + 2dx + e\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(2):\n\nf'(2) = 5a(2)^4 + 4b(2)^3 + 3c(2)^2 + 2d(2) + e\n      = 80a + 32b + 12c + 4d + e\n\nSince the point (2, 3) lies on the curve, we can plug the coordinates into the equation of the curve:\n\n3 = a(2)^5 + b(2)^4 + c(2)^3 + d(2)^2 + e(2) + f\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific coefficients a, b, c, d, e, and f, we cannot compute the exact slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 3). If you provide the coefficients, we can compute the slope."
