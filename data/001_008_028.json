    "message_2": "To solve the inequality -5x + 3 > 18, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality.\n-5x + 3 - 3 > 18 - 3\n-5x > 15\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by -5. Remember to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number.\n-5x / -5 < 15 / -5\nx < -3\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x < -3."
