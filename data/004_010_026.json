    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative F(x) of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nn = 2, so using the power rule, the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\nFor the second term, -4x:\nn = 1, so using the power rule, the antiderivative is (-4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-4x^2)/2 = -2x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 1:\nn = 0, so using the power rule, the antiderivative is (1x^(0+1))/(0+1) = x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration C:\n\nF(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + C"
