    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to Stag Hunt in Game Theory:\n\nIn a game of Stag Hunt, two players can either choose to hunt stag together or hunt rabbit separately. Hunting a stag together yields a payoff of 3 units each, while hunting rabbit separately yields a payoff of 1 unit each. If each player believes the other will hunt stag, they both do. However, if one player believes the other will hunt rabbit, they too will hunt rabbit. What is the Nash Equilibrium of the game?",
    "message_2": "In the Stag Hunt game, there are two possible strategies for each player: hunt stag (S) or hunt rabbit (R). We can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          S    R\n        --------\nP S | (3, 3) (0, 1)\nl\na R | (1, 0) (1, 1)\ny\ne\nr\n1\n```\n\nTo find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the strategy profiles where no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\n1. (S, S): If Player 1 hunts stag and Player 2 hunts stag, both players receive a payoff of 3. If either player deviates to hunting rabbit, their payoff will decrease to 0. Thus, neither player has an incentive to deviate, and (S, S) is a Nash Equilibrium.\n\n2. (R, R): If Player 1 hunts rabbit and Player 2 hunts rabbit, both players receive a payoff of 1. If either player deviates to hunting stag, their payoff will remain the same (1). Thus, neither player has an incentive to deviate, and (R, R) is a Nash Equilibrium.\n\nSo, there are two Nash Equilibria in this game: (S, S) and (R, R)."
