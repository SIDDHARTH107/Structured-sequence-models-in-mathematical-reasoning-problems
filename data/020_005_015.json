    "message_1": "A factory manager needs to order machines for the workshop. The supplier offers two kinds of machines: Machine A costs $4500 each, and Machine B costs $6200 each. The factory manager has a budget of $50,000 to order machines. The manager wants to maximize the number of machines ordered without exceeding the budget. The workshop has enough space to accommodate at most 12 machines. How many of each kind of machine should the manager order to optimize the number of machines?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Machine A and y be the number of Machine B.\n\nThe cost constraint can be represented by the inequality:\n4500x + 6200y ≤ 50,000\n\nThe space constraint can be represented by the inequality:\nx + y ≤ 12\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of machines, which can be represented by the equation:\nx + y = M (where M is the maximum number of machines)\n\nFirst, we will find the possible values of x and y that satisfy the constraints.\n\nFrom the space constraint, we can express y in terms of x:\ny = 12 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression into the cost constraint:\n4500x + 6200(12 - x) ≤ 50,000\n\nSimplify the inequality:\n4500x + 74400 - 6200x ≤ 50,000\n\nRearrange the terms:\n1700x ≥ 24,400\n\nDivide both sides by 1700:\nx ≥ 14.35\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the minimum value of x is 15. However, this would mean that there is no space left for Machine B, which is not optimal. Therefore, we will try the next smallest integer value for x, which is 14.\n\nIf x = 14, we can find the corresponding value of y from the space constraint:\ny = 12 - 14 = -2\n\nThis is not a valid solution since y must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we will try the next smallest integer value for x, which is 13.\n\nIf x = 13, we can find the corresponding value of y from the space constraint:\ny = 12 - 13 = -1\n\nThis is not a valid solution either. We will try the next smallest integer value for x, which is 12.\n\nIf x = 12, we can find the corresponding value of y from the space constraint:\ny = 12 - 12 = 0\n\nNow, we need to check if this solution satisfies the cost constraint:\n4500(12) + 6200(0) = 54,000\n\nThis does not satisfy the cost constraint, so we will try the next smallest integer value for x, which is 11.\n\nIf x = 11, we can find the corresponding value of y from the space constraint:\ny = 12 - 11 = 1\n\nNow, we need to check if this solution satisfies the cost constraint:\n4500(11) + 6200(1) = 49,500\n\nThis solution satisfies both the cost and space constraints. Therefore, the manager should order 11 Machine A and 1 Machine B to maximize the number of machines without exceeding the budget and space constraints."
