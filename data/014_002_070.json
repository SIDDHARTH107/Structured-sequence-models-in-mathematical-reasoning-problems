    "message_2": "First, let's compute A and B.\n\nA = g^a mod p = 2^8 mod 19 = 256 mod 19 = 9\n\nB = g^b mod p = 2^13 mod 19 = 8192 mod 19 = 12\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key as follows:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key: K_A = B^a mod p = 12^8 mod 19 = 429981696 mod 19 = 2\n\nBob computes the shared secret key: K_B = A^b mod p = 9^13 mod 19 = 2541865828329 mod 19 = 2\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages is 2."
