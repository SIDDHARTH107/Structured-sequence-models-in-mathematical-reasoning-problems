    "message_2": "A group of order 18 has 18 elements. The possible number of cyclic subgroups in a group is determined by the divisors of the group order. The divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nSo, there can be cyclic subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The maximum number of elements each of these cyclic subgroups can have is equal to their respective orders:\n\n1. Cyclic subgroup of order 1: 1 element (the identity element)\n2. Cyclic subgroup of order 2: 2 elements\n3. Cyclic subgroup of order 3: 3 elements\n4. Cyclic subgroup of order 6: 6 elements\n5. Cyclic subgroup of order 9: 9 elements\n6. Cyclic subgroup of order 18: 18 elements (the entire group)\n\nSo, there can be 6 possible cyclic subgroups with maximum elements of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18 respectively."
