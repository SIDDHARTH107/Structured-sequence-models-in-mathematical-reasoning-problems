    "message_1": "Consider the Calabi-Yau variety defined by the equation:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0\n\nWhat is the degree of this Calabi-Yau variety?",
    "message_2": "The degree of a projective variety is the number of intersection points of the variety with a generic hyperplane in the projective space. In this case, the Calabi-Yau variety is defined by a homogeneous polynomial equation of degree 3 in four variables (x, y, z, w). \n\nSince the equation is homogeneous and of degree 3, the degree of this Calabi-Yau variety is 3."
