    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$\nX(x)T'(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by $4XT$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T'(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda\n$$\n\nHere, $-\\lambda$ is the separation constant. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. $T'(t) + 4\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n2. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the second ODE for $X(x)$. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous, we can use the eigenfunction expansion method. For the given boundary conditions, the eigenfunctions are:\n\n$$\nX_n(x) = sin(n\\pi x)\n$$\n\nwith corresponding eigenvalues:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_n = n^2\\pi^2\n$$\n\nNow, we solve the first ODE for $T(t)$. The general solution is:\n\n$$\nT_n(t) = e^{-4n^2\\pi^2 t}\n$$\n\nThus, the solution of the heat equation is:\n\n$$\nu_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = e^{-4n^2\\pi^2 t}sin(n\\pi x)\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients of the Fourier sine series for the initial condition:\n\n$$\nu(x,0) = sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n sin(n\\pi x)\n$$\n\nSince the initial condition is already a sine function with $n=1$, we have $B_1 = 1$ and $B_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 1$. Therefore, the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ at time $t=1$ is:\n\n$$\nu(x,1) = e^{-4\\pi^2}sin(\\pi x)\n$$"
