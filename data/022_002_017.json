    "message_2": "To find the image of the point 1/2 + i/2 under the conformal mapping f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z + 2), we simply need to substitute the given point into the function:\n\nf(1/2 + i/2) = ((1/2 + i/2)^2 - 1)/((1/2 + i/2) + 2)\n\nFirst, let's compute the square of the given point:\n\n(1/2 + i/2)^2 = (1/4 + i/2 + i^2/4) = (1/4 + i/2 - 1/4) = i/2\n\nNow, substitute this back into the function:\n\nf(1/2 + i/2) = (i/2 - 1)/((1/2 + i/2) + 2) = (-1/2 + i/2)/((5/2) + i/2)\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\n(-1/2 + i/2) * (5/2 - i/2) / ((5/2 + i/2) * (5/2 - i/2))\n\n= (-1/2 * 5/2 + i/2 * 5/2 - i/2 * i/2 + 1/4) / (25/4 - i^2/4)\n\n= (-5/4 + 5i/4 + 1/4) / (25/4 + 1/4)\n\n= (-1 + 5i) / (26/4)\n\n= (-1 + 5i) / (13/2)\n\nNow, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get rid of the fraction in the denominator:\n\n= 2(-1 + 5i) / 13\n\n= (-2 + 10i) / 13\n\nSo, the image of the point 1/2 + i/2 under the conformal mapping f(z) is (-2 + 10i) / 13."
