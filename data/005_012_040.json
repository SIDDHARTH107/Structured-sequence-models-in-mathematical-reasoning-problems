    "message_2": "To calculate the sample size needed for a survey with a specific margin of error and confidence level, we can use the following formula:\n\nn = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2\n\nwhere:\nn = sample size\nZ = Z-score (1.96 for a 95% confidence level)\np = estimated proportion (we will use 0.5 since we don't have any prior information)\nE = margin of error (0.03 for 3%)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Z-score for a 95% confidence level. The Z-score for a 95% confidence level is 1.96.\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5)) / 0.03^2\nn = (3.8416 * 0.5 * 0.5) / 0.0009\nn = (1.9208) / 0.0009\nn = 2135.3333\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a household, we will round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the sample size needed is 2136 households. However, the student wants to survey only 500 households, which is less than the calculated sample size. In this case, the student will not be able to achieve a margin of error of 3% with 95% confidence with a sample size of 500 households."
