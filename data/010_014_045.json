    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct closed, connected 2-dimensional manifolds M satisfying the given condition, we will use the classification of closed, connected 2-dimensional manifolds, which are classified by their genus g and orientability.\n\nLet M be an orientable surface of genus g. Then, the first cohomology group H^1(M;Z) is given by:\n\nH^1(M;Z) = Z^2g\n\nNow, let M be a non-orientable surface with k cross-caps. Then, the first cohomology group H^1(M;Z) is given by:\n\nH^1(M;Z) = Z^(k-1)\n\nWe are given that H^1(M;Z) = Z/2019Z. Since 2019 is a product of two distinct prime numbers, 2019 = 3 * 673, we have the following possibilities for H^1(M;Z):\n\n1. Z^2g = Z/2019Z, which implies 2g = 1. However, this is not possible since g must be a non-negative integer.\n2. Z^2g = Z/3Z and Z^2g = Z/673Z. This implies 2g = 1 for both cases, which is again not possible.\n3. Z^(k-1) = Z/2019Z, which implies k-1 = 1. This gives k = 2, which corresponds to the non-orientable surface known as the projective plane.\n\nTherefore, there is only one distinct closed, connected 2-dimensional manifold M satisfying the given condition, which is the projective plane."
