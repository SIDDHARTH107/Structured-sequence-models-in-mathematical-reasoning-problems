    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - (1 / (1 + sqrt(x_n^2 + y_n^2)))\n\nTo compute the Lyapunov exponent for the Ikeda map with parameters a = 0.9184 and b = 0.925, we need to iterate the map for a large number of steps and calculate the average growth rate of the distance between nearby points. This can be done numerically using a computer program, but it is not possible to provide an exact value without performing these calculations.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the Lyapunov exponent is typically positive for the Ikeda map when a > 0.9, indicating chaotic behavior. So, for the given parameters, we can expect the Lyapunov exponent to be positive, but the exact value would require numerical computation."
