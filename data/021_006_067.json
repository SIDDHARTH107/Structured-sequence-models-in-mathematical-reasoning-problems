    "message_1": "A numerical problem for a math student to solve using finite element methods would be:\n\nConsider the 1D heat equation, where u(x,t) is the temperature at point x and time t, given by:\n\n∂u/∂t - a∂^2u/∂x^2 = f(x,t)\n\nwhere a is a constant diffusion coefficient and f(x,t) is a heat source term. Using the finite element method, find the approximate solution of the equation for the following boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = 0 and u(L,t) = T\n\nwhere T is a constant temperature at the right boundary and L is the domain length. Assume that the initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = sin(πx/L)\n\nUse linear elements and the backward Euler method for time integration with a time step size of Δt = 0.01. Choose L = 1, T = 1, a = 0.01, and a final time t_final = 1.0.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the finite element method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain: Divide the domain [0, L] into N equal intervals of length Δx = L/N. Let x_i be the nodes where i = 0, 1, ..., N, and x_0 = 0, x_N = L.\n\n2. Define the linear basis functions: For each element, define the linear basis functions φ_i(x) such that φ_i(x_j) = δ_ij, where δ_ij is the Kronecker delta.\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the equation: Multiply the heat equation by a test function v(x) and integrate over the domain. Then, integrate the second-order derivative term by parts to obtain:\n\n∫(∂u/∂t)v dx - a∫(∂^2u/∂x^2)v dx = ∫f(x,t)v dx\n\n4. Discretize the weak form: Replace the exact solution u(x,t) with its finite element approximation u_h(x,t) = ∑u_i(t)φ_i(x), and substitute it into the weak form:\n\n∫(∂u_h/∂t)v dx - a∫(∂^2u_h/∂x^2)v dx = ∫f(x,t)v dx\n\n5. Apply the backward Euler method: Replace the time derivative with a backward difference:\n\n∫((u_h^{n+1} - u_h^n)/Δt)v dx - a∫(∂^2u_h^{n+1}/∂x^2)v dx = ∫f(x,t^{n+1})v dx\n\n6. Assemble the system of equations: For each test function v_i, substitute v = φ_i and solve for the unknown coefficients u_i^{n+1}. This will result in a system of linear equations:\n\nM(U^{n+1} - U^n) - aΔtKU^{n+1} = ΔtF^{n+1}\n\nwhere M is the mass matrix, K is the stiffness matrix, U^n is the vector of coefficients at time step n, and F^{n+1} is the vector of source terms at time step n+1.\n\n7. Apply the boundary conditions: Set U_0^n = 0 and U_N^n = T for all time steps.\n\n8. Solve the system of equations: For each time step, solve the linear system for U^{n+1}.\n\n9. Compute the approximate solution: Use the coefficients U^{n+1} to compute the approximate solution u_h(x,t) at each node x_i and time step t^n.\n\nBy following these steps, you can obtain the approximate solution of the 1D heat equation using the finite element method and the backward Euler method for time integration."
