    "message_2": "To calculate the sectional curvature of S at point P in the direction of tangent vectors v and w, we can use the formula:\n\nSectional curvature K(σ) = (R(v, w)w, v) / (|v|^2 * |w|^2 - (v • w)^2),\n\nwhere R(v, w)w is the curvature tensor, |v| and |w| are the magnitudes of the tangent vectors v and w, and v • w is the dot product of v and w.\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature K(S) = 2, we have:\n\nK(σ) = K(S) * (|v|^2 * |w|^2 - (v • w)^2) / (|v|^2 * |w|^2),\n\nwhere |v| = |w| = √3 and the angle between v and w is π/3.\n\nThe dot product of v and w can be calculated as:\n\nv • w = |v| * |w| * cos(π/3) = (√3) * (√3) * (1/2) = 3/2.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the formula:\n\nK(σ) = 2 * ((√3)^2 * (√3)^2 - (3/2)^2) / ((√3)^2 * (√3)^2)\nK(σ) = 2 * (9 - 9/4) / 9\nK(σ) = 2 * (27/4) / 9\nK(σ) = (54/4) / 9\nK(σ) = 6/4\nK(σ) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the sectional curvature of S at point P in the direction of tangent vectors v and w is 3/2."
