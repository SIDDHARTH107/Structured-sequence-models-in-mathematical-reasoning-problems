    "message_1": "Suppose that a certain disease affects 5% of the general population. If a sample of 500 individuals from a specific demographic group is taken, what is the probability that at least 25 individuals in the sample will be affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size of 500 individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of individuals affected by the disease)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an individual being affected by the disease, which is 5% or 0.05)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 25 individuals in the sample will be affected by the disease, which means we need to find the probability of 25 or more individuals being affected. To do this, we can find the probability of 24 or fewer individuals being affected and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 24:\n\nP(X ≤ 24) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nThen, we can find the probability of at least 25 individuals being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X ≤ 24)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for k = 0 to 24 and summing them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 24) ≈ 0.4412 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 25 individuals being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X ≤ 24) = 1 - 0.4412 = 0.5588\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 individuals in the sample will be affected by the disease is approximately 0.5588 or 55.88%."
