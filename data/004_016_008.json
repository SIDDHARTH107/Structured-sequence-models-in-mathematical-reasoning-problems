    "message_2": "Let's denote the total production function as P(t), where t is the number of days. We are given that P(10) = 5000 units and the target is P(18) = 8000 units.\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (10, 18) such that the average rate of change of the production function P(t) in this interval is equal to the instantaneous rate of change at that point c:\n\n(P(18) - P(10)) / (18 - 10) = P'(c)\n\nWe are asked to find the average rate at which the production must increase, which is the same as the average rate of change of the production function P(t) in the interval (10, 18). So, we need to find:\n\n(P(18) - P(10)) / (18 - 10)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(8000 - 5000) / (18 - 10) = 3000 / 8 = 375 units/day\n\nTherefore, the average rate at which the production must increase to meet their target is 375 units per day."
