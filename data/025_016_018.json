    "message_2": "1. To show that $f$ is a birational map, we need to show that it is a rational map and that it has a rational inverse. \n\nFirst, let's show that $f$ is a rational map. A map is rational if it is given by a set of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. In this case, $f(x, y) = [x : y : 1]$, which is given by the homogeneous polynomials $x, y,$ and $1$. Since $1$ is a constant polynomial, it has degree 0, and the other two polynomials have degree 1. Thus, $f$ is a rational map.\n\n2. Now, let's compute the inverse map $f^{-1}: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\dashrightarrow C$. We have $f(x, y) = [x : y : 1]$, so we want to find a map $f^{-1}(u : v : w)$ such that $f(f^{-1}(u : v : w)) = (u : v : w)$. \n\nLet $f^{-1}(u : v : w) = (x(u, v, w), y(u, v, w))$. Then, we have\n$$f(x(u, v, w), y(u, v, w)) = [x(u, v, w) : y(u, v, w) : 1] = (u : v : w).$$\n\nComparing the coordinates, we get\n$$x(u, v, w) = u,$$\n$$y(u, v, w) = v,$$\nand\n$$1 = w.$$\n\nThus, we have $f^{-1}(u : v : 1) = (u, v)$. Since $f^{-1}$ is given by the homogeneous polynomials $u$ and $v$, it is a rational map. Therefore, $f$ is a birational map.\n\n3. Finally, let's find the preimage of $P = [0 : 1 : 0]$ under $f$. We have $f^{-1}(0 : 1 : 0) = (0, 1)$. To check that this point is on the curve $C$, we plug it into the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x^2$:\n$$1^2 = 0^3 - 0^2.$$\n\nSince this equation holds, $(0, 1)$ is indeed a point on $C$. Thus, the preimage of $P$ under $f$ is $(0, 1)$."
