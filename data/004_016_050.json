    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we are given the average speed of the car over the first half of one lap, which is 25 m/s. The car is traveling along a circular track with a radius of 100 meters. The first half of the lap corresponds to half of the circumference of the circle, which is (1/2) * 2π * 100 = π * 100 meters.\n\nLet the position function of the car be s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t. The average speed of the car over the first half of the lap can be represented as:\n\nAverage speed = (Change in position) / (Change in time)\n25 m/s = (π * 100 meters) / (Δt)\n\nNow, we can solve for Δt:\nΔt = (π * 100 meters) / (25 m/s) = 4π seconds\n\nSince the car's position function s(t) is continuous and differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem. There exists a time c in the interval (0, 4π) such that:\n\ns'(c) = (s(4π) - s(0)) / (4π - 0)\n\nWe know that s(4π) - s(0) = π * 100 meters, so:\n\ns'(c) = (π * 100 meters) / (4π seconds) = 25 m/s\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be a time c during the first half of the lap when the car's instantaneous speed is equal to its average speed, which is 25 m/s. Therefore, the minimum speed of the car during that lap is at least 25 m/s."
