    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x+1) - √(x-1) = 3, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the square roots.\n√(2x+1) = √(x-1) + 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.\n(√(2x+1))^2 = (√(x-1) + 3)^2\n\n(2x+1) = (x-1+6√(x-1)+9)\n\nStep 3: Simplify and move all terms to one side of the equation.\n2x + 1 - x + 1 - 9 = 6√(x-1)\n\nx - 7 = 6√(x-1)\n\nStep 4: Isolate the remaining square root.\n6√(x-1) = x - 7\n\nStep 5: Square both sides of the equation again to eliminate the square root.\n(6√(x-1))^2 = (x - 7)^2\n\n36(x-1) = x^2 - 14x + 49\n\nStep 6: Simplify and move all terms to one side of the equation to form a quadratic equation.\n0 = x^2 - 14x + 49 - 36(x-1)\n\n0 = x^2 - 14x + 49 - 36x + 36\n\n0 = x^2 - 50x + 85\n\nStep 7: Solve the quadratic equation.\nWe can factor the quadratic equation as follows:\n\n0 = (x - 5)(x - 17)\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\nx - 17 = 0 => x = 17\n\nStep 8: Check the solutions in the original equation.\nFor x = 5:\n√(2(5)+1) - √(5-1) = √11 - √4 = 3\n\nFor x = 17:\n√(2(17)+1) - √(17-1) = √35 - √16 ≠ 3\n\nSo, the only solution that works in the original equation is x = 5."
