    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then multiply it by the fraction representing the size of the slice.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the diameter is 16 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 8 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the entire pizza:\nA = π(8^2)\nA = π(64)\nA ≈ 201.06 square inches (rounded to the nearest hundredth)\n\nSince the slice of pizza is one-fifth of the total pizza, we can multiply the area of the entire pizza by 1/5 to find the area of the sector:\n\nArea of sector = (1/5) * 201.06\nArea of sector ≈ 40.21 square inches (rounded to the nearest hundredth)"
