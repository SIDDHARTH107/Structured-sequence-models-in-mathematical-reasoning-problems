    "message_2": "Let p: Y → X be the covering map. Since X is connected and has a fundamental group π(X) = ℤ/4ℤ, we know that the covering space Y is also connected. The number of sheets in the covering is given by the number of points in Y, which is 7.\n\nNow, let's use the following fact from algebraic topology:\n\nFact: If p: Y → X is a covering map with Y connected, then there is an injective homomorphism p*: π(Y) → π(X) whose image is a subgroup of index equal to the number of sheets in the covering.\n\nIn our case, the number of sheets in the covering is 7, so the image of p* is a subgroup of π(X) = ℤ/4ℤ of index 7. However, this is a contradiction since ℤ/4ℤ has no subgroups of index 7. The only possible subgroups of ℤ/4ℤ are {0} (the trivial subgroup), ℤ/4ℤ itself, and the subgroup ℤ/2ℤ (consisting of 0 and 2). None of these subgroups have index 7 in ℤ/4ℤ.\n\nTherefore, there cannot exist a connected covering space Y of X with exactly 7 points and fundamental group π(X) = ℤ/4ℤ."
