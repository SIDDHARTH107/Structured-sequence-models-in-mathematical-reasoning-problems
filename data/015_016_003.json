    "message_2": "To find the steady-state voltage of the Chua circuit, we first need to understand the Chua circuit's equations. The Chua circuit is a nonlinear electronic circuit that exhibits chaotic behavior. The circuit consists of two capacitors (C1 and C2), one inductor (L), one resistor (R), and a nonlinear element called the Chua diode.\n\nThe equations governing the Chua circuit are given by:\n\n1. dV1/dt = (1/C1) * (V2 - V1 - f(V1))\n2. dV2/dt = (1/C2) * (V1 - V2 + VR)\n3. dI/dt = -V2/L\n\nWhere V1 and V2 are the voltages across capacitors C1 and C2, I is the current through the inductor L, and f(V1) is the nonlinear function representing the Chua diode.\n\nThe Chua diode's function is given by:\n\nf(V1) = a * V1 + (b - a) * (abs(V1 + c1) - abs(V1 - c1))/2\n\nIn the steady-state, the time derivatives dV1/dt, dV2/dt, and dI/dt are all zero. This means that the circuit is in equilibrium, and the voltages and currents are constant.\n\nGiven the initial conditions and parameters:\n\nC1 = 1µF = 1 * 10^(-6) F\nC2 = 2µF = 2 * 10^(-6) F\nR = 100Ω\na = 15.6V\nb = 28V\nc1 = -1/7\nc2 = -8/7\n\nWe can now solve the Chua circuit's equations for the steady-state voltages V1 and V2.\n\n1. 0 = (1/C1) * (V2 - V1 - f(V1))\n2. 0 = (1/C2) * (V1 - V2 + VR)\n3. 0 = -V2/L\n\nFrom equation (3), we can see that V2 = 0 in the steady-state. Now, we can substitute this into equations (1) and (2):\n\n1. 0 = (1/C1) * (-V1 - f(V1))\n2. 0 = (1/C2) * (V1 + VR)\n\nFrom equation (2), we can see that V1 = -VR in the steady-state. Now, we can substitute this into equation (1):\n\n0 = (1/C1) * (VR - f(-VR))\n\nNow, we need to find f(-VR):\n\nf(-VR) = a * (-VR) + (b - a) * (abs(-VR + c1) - abs(-VR - c1))/2\n\nSince we are looking for the steady-state voltage, we can assume that the Chua diode is operating in its linear region, which means that f(-VR) = a * (-VR). Therefore:\n\n0 = (1/C1) * (VR - a * (-VR))\n\nSolving for VR:\n\nVR = a * (-VR) * C1\n\nVR = -15.6 * 10^(-6) * VR\n\nVR = -15.6 * 10^(-6) * (-VR)\n\nVR = 15.6 * 10^(-6) * VR\n\nVR = 15.6 * 10^(-6) V\n\nSince V1 = -VR in the steady-state:\n\nV1 = -15.6 * 10^(-6) V\n\nAnd V2 = 0 in the steady-state.\n\nSo, the steady-state voltages of the Chua circuit are V1 = -15.6 * 10^(-6) V and V2 = 0 V."
