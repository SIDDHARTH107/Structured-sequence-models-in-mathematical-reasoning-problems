    "message_1": "Here's an epistemic logic problem for a math student:\n\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. Alice is thinking of a number between 1 and 10, and Bob has to guess what it is. However, Bob doesn't know the number, and Alice knows that Bob doesn't know. Then, Alice says \"I will give you a hint: the number is either 4 or 6.\" After hearing this hint, Bob says \"I don't know what the number is.\" \n\nWhat can we conclude about the number Alice is thinking of?",
    "message_2": "From the given information, we can conclude that Alice's number is either 4 or 6. However, since Bob still doesn't know the number after receiving the hint, we cannot determine the exact number Alice is thinking of."
