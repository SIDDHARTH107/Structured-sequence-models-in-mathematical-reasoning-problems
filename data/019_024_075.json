    "message_1": "Suppose that there are three boxes - one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes are labeled as follows: Box 1 reads \"Apples\", Box 2 reads \"Oranges\", and Box 3 reads \"Apples and Oranges\". However, all the labels are wrong! If you are allowed to select only one fruit from one of the boxes, which box would you choose from to determine the contents of all three boxes?",
    "message_2": "To determine the contents of all three boxes by selecting only one fruit, you should choose a fruit from Box 3, which is labeled \"Apples and Oranges\".\n\nSince all labels are wrong, Box 3 cannot contain both apples and oranges. It must contain either only apples or only oranges. \n\nIf you pick a fruit from Box 3 and it turns out to be an apple, then Box 3 must be the box with only apples. Since all labels are wrong, Box 1 cannot contain apples, so it must contain the remaining option, which is the box with both apples and oranges. Consequently, Box 2 would be the box with only oranges.\n\nOn the other hand, if you pick a fruit from Box 3 and it turns out to be an orange, then Box 3 must be the box with only oranges. Since all labels are wrong, Box 2 cannot contain oranges, so it must contain the remaining option, which is the box with both apples and oranges. Consequently, Box 1 would be the box with only apples.\n\nBy choosing a fruit from Box 3, you can accurately determine the contents of all three boxes."
