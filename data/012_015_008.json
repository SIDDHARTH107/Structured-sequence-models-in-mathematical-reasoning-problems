    "message_2": "The given graph is connected. This is because there is a path between every pair of vertices in the graph. For example, you can travel from vertex 'a' to any other vertex in the graph by following the edges:\n\n- a to b: a--b\n- a to c: a--b--c\n- a to d: a--d\n- a to e: a--d--e\n- a to f: a--b--c--f\n- a to g: a--d--g\n- a to h: a--d--e--h\n- a to i: a--b--c--f--i\n\nSince there is a path between every pair of vertices, the graph is connected, and there is only one connected component, which includes all the vertices (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i)."
