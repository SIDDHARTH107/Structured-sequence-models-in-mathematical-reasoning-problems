    "message_2": "The van der Pol oscillator is a nonlinear oscillator described by the following second-order differential equation:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x(t)^2)x'(t) + x(t) = F(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, μ is the damping coefficient, and F(t) is the forcing function.\n\nIn this problem, we have μ = 0.8 and F(t) = 1.23. The initial conditions are x(0) = 1 and dx/dt(0) = 0.\n\nTo find the frequency of the van der Pol oscillator, we first need to find the natural frequency (ω_n) of the system. The natural frequency is the frequency at which the system oscillates in the absence of damping and forcing. For a van der Pol oscillator, the natural frequency is approximately equal to 1 (ω_n ≈ 1).\n\nNext, we need to find the damped frequency (ω_d), which is the frequency at which the system oscillates in the presence of damping but without forcing. The damped frequency is given by:\n\nω_d = ω_n * sqrt(1 - ζ^2)\n\nwhere ζ is the damping ratio, which is related to the damping coefficient (μ) and the natural frequency (ω_n) by:\n\nζ = μ / (2 * sqrt(ω_n^2))\n\nIn this problem, we have ω_n ≈ 1, so the damping ratio is:\n\nζ = 0.8 / (2 * sqrt(1^2)) = 0.4\n\nNow we can find the damped frequency:\n\nω_d = 1 * sqrt(1 - 0.4^2) = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165\n\nFinally, we need to find the frequency of the van der Pol oscillator in the presence of both damping and forcing. This frequency is typically close to the damped frequency, especially when the forcing function is relatively small compared to the natural frequency of the system. In this case, the forcing function is 1.23, which is not much larger than the natural frequency (1), so we can assume that the frequency of the van der Pol oscillator is approximately equal to the damped frequency:\n\nFrequency ≈ ω_d ≈ 0.9165\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the van der Pol oscillator with a forcing function of 1.23 and a damping coefficient of 0.8 is approximately 0.9165."
