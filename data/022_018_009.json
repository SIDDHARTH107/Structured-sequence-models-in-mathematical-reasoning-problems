    "message_2": "(i) To find a complex function $f(z)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and whose real part equals $u(x,y)$, we first write $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$, where $v(x,y)$ is the imaginary part of the function. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$.\n\nNow, we are given that $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 2z = 2x + 2iy$. Comparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2x$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 2y$.\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$u(x,y) = x^2 + g(y)$, where $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$.\n\nNow, differentiating $u(x,y)$ with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = g'(y) = 2y$.\n\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$g(y) = y^2 + C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nSo, $u(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + C$.\n\nNow, we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find $v(x,y)$. We have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2x$ and $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -2y$.\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$v(x,y) = 2xy + h(x)$, where $h(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nDifferentiating $v(x,y)$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2y + h'(x) = -2y$.\n\nThis implies that $h'(x) = -4y$. However, since $h(x)$ is a function of $x$ only, this is not possible. Thus, there is no function $v(x,y)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the given $u(x,y)$.\n\n(ii) Since we could not find a complex function $f(z)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we cannot find a general solution for the given partial differential equation using this approach."
