    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem in modal logic:\n\nLet P be the statement \"It is raining\" and Q be the statement \"I am inside.\" Suppose that the modal operator ◊ represents \"possibly\" and ¬ represents \"not.\" \n\nIf ¬◊¬P is true, what can you logically conclude about ◊Q?\n\nA) ◊Q is true\nB) ◊Q is false\nC) ◊Q cannot be determined \nD) None of the above",
    "message_2": "C) ◊Q cannot be determined\n\nExplanation: ¬◊¬P means \"It is not possible that it is not raining.\" In other words, it is necessarily raining. However, this information does not provide any insight into whether or not you are inside, so we cannot determine the truth value of ◊Q."
