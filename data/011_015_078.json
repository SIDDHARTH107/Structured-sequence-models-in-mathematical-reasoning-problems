    "message_1": "In a party with ten people, each person shakes hands with at least three other people. What is the minimum number of handshakes that occur at the party?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of handshakes, we can distribute the handshakes as evenly as possible among the ten people. Let's assign each person a number from 1 to 10. We can arrange the handshakes as follows:\n\n1. Person 1 shakes hands with persons 2, 3, and 4.\n2. Person 2 shakes hands with persons 1, 3, and 5.\n3. Person 3 shakes hands with persons 1, 2, and 6.\n4. Person 4 shakes hands with persons 1, 5, and 7.\n5. Person 5 shakes hands with persons 2, 4, and 8.\n6. Person 6 shakes hands with persons 3, 7, and 9.\n7. Person 7 shakes hands with persons 4, 6, and 10.\n8. Person 8 shakes hands with persons 5, 9, and 10.\n9. Person 9 shakes hands with persons 6, 8, and 10.\n10. Person 10 shakes hands with persons 7, 8, and 9.\n\nIn this arrangement, each person shakes hands with exactly three other people. The total number of handshakes is 3 handshakes per person multiplied by 10 people, which equals 30 handshakes. However, since each handshake involves two people, we have counted each handshake twice. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of handshakes by 2 to get the actual number of handshakes:\n\n30 handshakes / 2 = 15 handshakes\n\nSo, the minimum number of handshakes that occur at the party is 15."
