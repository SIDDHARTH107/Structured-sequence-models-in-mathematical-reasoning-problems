    "message_1": "Let set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B and then find the symmetric difference of the two sets A and B. Show that the symmetric difference is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the two sets A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we want to show that the symmetric difference is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product. To do this, we will find the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference with the original sets and compare them.\n\n(A Δ B) × A = {1, 4} × {1, 2, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\n(A Δ B) × B = {1, 4} × {2, 3, 4} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) × A ≠ (A Δ B) × B, which means the symmetric difference is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
