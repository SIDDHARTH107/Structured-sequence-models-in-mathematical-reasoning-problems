    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection, we need to compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\nΓᵢⱼᵏ = 1/2 * gᵢₗ * (∂gₗⱼ/∂xᵏ + ∂gₗᵏ/∂xⱼ - ∂gⱼᵏ/∂xₗ)\n\nwhere gᵢₗ is the inverse of the metric tensor gᵢⱼ, and the indices i, j, k, and l run from 1 to 3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse metric tensor gᵢₗ. Since the given metric tensor is diagonal, its inverse is also diagonal, and the diagonal elements are the reciprocals of the corresponding elements in the original metric tensor:\n\ngᵢₗ = diag([(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2, (x^2+y^2+z^2)^2, (x^2+y^2+z^2)^2])\n\nNow, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components with respect to the coordinates x, y, and z:\n\n∂g₁₁/∂x = ∂g₂₂/∂y = ∂g₃₃/∂z = 0 (since the metric tensor components are independent of the coordinates)\n\n∂g₁₁/∂y = ∂g₂₂/∂x = ∂g₃₃/∂x = 4 * (x^2+y^2+z^2) * (2x)\n\n∂g₁₁/∂z = ∂g₂₂/∂z = ∂g₃₃/∂z = 4 * (x^2+y^2+z^2) * (2z)\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols at the point (1, 1, 1):\n\nΓᵢⱼᵏ = 1/2 * gᵢₗ * (∂gₗⱼ/∂xᵏ + ∂gₗᵏ/∂xⱼ - ∂gⱼᵏ/∂xₗ)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 1), the metric tensor components and their partial derivatives are:\n\ngᵢₗ = diag([1, 1, 1])\n∂g₁₁/∂x = ∂g₂₂/∂x = ∂g₃₃/∂x = 12\n∂g₁₁/∂y = ∂g₂₂/∂y = ∂g₃₃/∂y = 12\n∂g₁₁/∂z = ∂g₂₂/∂z = ∂g₃₃/∂z = 12\n\nUsing these values, we can compute the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\nΓ¹²¹ = Γ¹³¹ = Γ²¹² = Γ²³² = Γ³¹³ = Γ³²³ = 1/2 * 1 * (12 + 12 - 0) = 12\n\nAll other Christoffel symbols are zero.\n\nSo, the Levi-Civita connection at the point (1, 1, 1) is given by the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\nΓ¹²¹ = Γ¹³¹ = Γ²¹² = Γ²³² = Γ³¹³ = Γ³²³ = 12"
