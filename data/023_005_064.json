    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), then the Fourier transform of y''(t) is (iω)^2Y(ω) = -ω^2Y(ω). The Fourier transform of the equation is then:\n\n-ω^2Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = C(ω) / (ω^2 + 4)\n\nwhere C(ω) is an unknown function. To find C(ω), we need to use the given initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3. We know that:\n\ny(0) = 2 = F^-1{Y(ω)}(0)\n\ny'(0) = 3 = F^-1{-iωY(ω)}(0)\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) and its derivative, we get:\n\n2 = ∫[C(ω) / (ω^2 + 4)] e^(iω0) dω\n\n3 = ∫[-iω C(ω) / (ω^2 + 4)] e^(iω0) dω\n\nSince e^(iω0) = 1, the equations become:\n\n2 = ∫[C(ω) / (ω^2 + 4)] dω\n\n3 = ∫[-iω C(ω) / (ω^2 + 4)] dω\n\nNow, we need to find C(ω) such that these equations are satisfied. We can use the convolution theorem, which states that:\n\nF^-1{Y(ω)}(t) = y(t) = (y(0) * e^(-2t) * cos(2t)) + (y'(0) * e^(-2t) * sin(2t))\n\nNow, we can plug in the initial conditions:\n\ny(t) = (2 * e^(-2t) * cos(2t)) + (3 * e^(-2t) * sin(2t))\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation for t > 0 using the Fourier transform."
