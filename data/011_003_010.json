    "message_2": "In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first row is 1, the second row is 1 1, the third row is 1 2 1, and so on. The nth row of Pascal's Triangle has n elements, and the elements are the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^(n-1).\n\nThe eighth row of Pascal's Triangle is the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^7, which are:\n\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n\nThe fifth number in the eighth row is 35."
