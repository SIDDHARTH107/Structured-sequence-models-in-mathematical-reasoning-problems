    "message_2": "To find the distinct groups of order 40, we first need to find the prime factorization of 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nNow, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. We will consider the partitions of the exponents of the prime factors.\n\nFor the exponent of 2 (which is 3), we have the following partitions:\n1. 3\n2. 2, 1\n3. 1, 1, 1\n\nFor the exponent of 5 (which is 1), we have only one partition:\n1. 1\n\nNow, we will find the direct products of cyclic groups corresponding to these partitions.\n\n1. For the partition (3) of 2 and (1) of 5, we have the group Z_8 × Z_5, where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n. This group has an order of 8 * 5 = 40.\n\n2. For the partition (2, 1) of 2 and (1) of 5, we have the group Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5. This group has an order of 4 * 2 * 5 = 40.\n\n3. For the partition (1, 1, 1) of 2 and (1) of 5, we have the group Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_5. This group has an order of 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 = 40.\n\nSo, there are 3 distinct abelian groups of order 40: Z_8 × Z_5, Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5, and Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_5.\n\nNow, let's consider non-abelian groups of order 40. The only possible non-abelian group of order 40 is a semi-direct product of Z_5 and Z_8, denoted as Z_5 ⋊ Z_8. However, since Z_8 has no automorphisms of order 5, there is no non-abelian group of order 40.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 distinct groups of order 40, and they are all abelian:\n\n1. Z_8 × Z_5\n2. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5\n3. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_5"
