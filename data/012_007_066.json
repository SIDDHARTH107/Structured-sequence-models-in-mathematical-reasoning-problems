The network system consists of 5 nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, where nodes 1 and 2 represent the factory and nodes 4 and 5 represent the warehouse. The maximum flow capacity of each arc is given in the table below. Determine the maximum flow that can be transported from the factory to the warehouse.\n\n| Nodes | Arcs | Maximum Flow Capacity |\n|-------|------|----------------------|\n| 1     | 2    | 500                  |\n| 1     | 3    | 200                  |\n| 2     | 3    | 300                  |\n| 2     | 4    | 400                  |\n| 3     | 4    | 250                  |\n| 3     | 5    | 150                  |\n| 4     | 5    | 300                  |",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum flow that can be transported from the factory to the warehouse, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find the augmenting paths and calculate the bottleneck capacities for each path. The sum of the bottleneck capacities will give us the maximum flow.\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0 for all arcs.\n2. Find an augmenting path from the factory (nodes 1 and 2) to the warehouse (nodes 4 and 5) in the residual graph.\n3. Calculate the bottleneck capacity for the augmenting path.\n4. Update the flow along the augmenting path.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's find the augmenting paths and their bottleneck capacities:\n\nPath 1: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5\nBottleneck capacity: min(500, 400, 300) = 300\n\nPath 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nBottleneck capacity: min(200, 250, 300) = 200\n\nPath 3: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5\nBottleneck capacity: min(500-300, 300, 150) = 150\n\nPath 4: 1 -> 3 -> 4\nBottleneck capacity: min(200-200, 250-200) = 0 (No more augmenting paths can be found)\n\nThe maximum flow that can be transported from the factory to the warehouse is the sum of the bottleneck capacities: 300 + 200 + 150 = 650."
