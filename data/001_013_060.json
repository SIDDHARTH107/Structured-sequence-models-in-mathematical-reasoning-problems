    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n(√(3x + 4))^2 = 7^2\n\nNow, we have:\n\n3x + 4 = 49\n\nNext, we will subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 45\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:\n\nx = 15"
