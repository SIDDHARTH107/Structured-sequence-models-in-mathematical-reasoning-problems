    "message_2": "To solve the triangle using the law of sines, we first need to find the measure of the third angle. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°, we can find the third angle as follows:\n\n180° - 30° - 60° = 90°\n\nNow we have a 30-60-90 triangle with angles 30°, 60°, and 90°. Let's denote the side opposite the 30° angle as a (which is given as 5cm), the side opposite the 60° angle as b, and the side opposite the 90° angle as c. We can now use the law of sines to find the lengths of sides b and c:\n\nThe law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant for all three sides of a triangle:\n\na / sin(30°) = b / sin(60°) = c / sin(90°)\n\nWe are given a = 5cm, and we want to find b and c. Let's first find b:\n\n5 / sin(30°) = b / sin(60°)\n\nWe know that sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(60°) = √3/2. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n5 / (1/2) = b / (√3/2)\n\n10 = b * 2 / √3\n\n10 * √3 / 2 = b\n\n5√3 = b\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 60° angle (b) is 5√3 cm.\n\nNow let's find c:\n\n5 / sin(30°) = c / sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, the equation becomes:\n\n5 / (1/2) = c / 1\n\n10 = c\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 90° angle (c) is 10 cm.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of the side opposite the 60° angle is 5√3 cm, and the length of the remaining side (opposite the 90° angle) is 10 cm."
