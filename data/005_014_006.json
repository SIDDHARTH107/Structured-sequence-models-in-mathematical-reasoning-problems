    "message_1": "A psychologist wants to understand the underlying factors that contribute to a group of people's anxiety levels. They collect data from an anxiety questionnaire completed by 100 participants. Using factor analysis, the psychologist wants to identify the principal components that explain the variability in the data. The psychologist finds that the first three factors account for 70% of the total variance. How many factors do they need to consider to capture 90% of the total variance in the data?",
    "message_2": "To determine how many factors are needed to capture 90% of the total variance, we need more information about the percentage of variance explained by each additional factor. The psychologist can continue the factor analysis, extracting more factors and examining the cumulative percentage of variance explained by each additional factor. Once the cumulative percentage reaches 90% or more, the psychologist will know how many factors are needed to capture that amount of variance.\n\nWithout information about the variance explained by each additional factor, it is not possible to determine the exact number of factors needed to capture 90% of the total variance in the data."
