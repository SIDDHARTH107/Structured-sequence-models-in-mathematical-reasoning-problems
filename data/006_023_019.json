    "message_1": "In a market of 50 customers, the probability of a customer buying product A is 0.4 and the probability of a customer buying product B is 0.3. What is the probability that a customer will buy either product A or product B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a customer buying either product A or product B, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nHowever, we don't have the probability of a customer buying both products (P(A ∩ B)). Since we don't have any information about the relationship between the two events, we will assume that they are independent events. In this case, the probability of the intersection of two independent events is:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.4\nP(B) = 0.3\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12\n\nNow we can find the probability of a customer buying either product A or product B:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.12 = 0.58\n\nSo, the probability that a customer will buy either product A or product B is 0.58."
