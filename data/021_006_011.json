Use backward Euler time stepping and piecewise linear finite element basis functions with 5 nodes.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given problem using the finite element method, we first need to discretize the spatial domain and represent the solution $u(x,t)$ as a linear combination of the finite element basis functions. Let's denote the basis functions as $\\phi_i(x)$, where $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$. Then, we can represent the solution as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 c_i(t) \\phi_i(x)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $c_i(t)$ that satisfy the given heat equation and boundary conditions. To do this, we multiply the heat equation by a test function $v(x)$ and integrate over the spatial domain:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} v(x) dx$$\n\nSubstitute the representation of $u(x,t)$ into the equation:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^4 c_i(t) \\phi_i(x)\\right) v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^4 c_i(t) \\phi_i(x)\\right) v(x) dx$$\n\nNow, we apply the backward Euler time stepping for the time derivative:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} \\phi_i(x) v(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^4 c_i^{n+1} \\phi_i(x)\\right) v(x) dx$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta t = 0.1$ and $c_i^n$ represents the coefficient $c_i$ at time step $n$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\left(\\int_0^1 \\phi_i(x) v(x) dx\\right) \\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_i(x)}{\\partial x^2} v(x) dx\\right) c_i^{n+1}$$\n\nNow, we choose the test functions $v(x)$ to be the same as the basis functions $\\phi_i(x)$:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\left(\\int_0^1 \\phi_i(x) \\phi_j(x) dx\\right) \\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_i(x)}{\\partial x^2} \\phi_j(x) dx\\right) c_i^{n+1}$$\n\nfor $j = 1, 2, 3, 4$. This results in a system of linear equations that can be written in matrix form:\n\n$$M \\frac{c^{n+1} - c^n}{\\Delta t} = K c^{n+1}$$\n\nwhere $M_{ij} = \\int_0^1 \\phi_i(x) \\phi_j(x) dx$ and $K_{ij} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_i(x)}{\\partial x^2} \\phi_j(x) dx$. The initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ can be used to find the initial coefficients $c^0$.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of linear equations for each time step $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ and evaluate the solution $u(x,t)$ at the desired points $x_i = 0.2i$ using the piecewise linear finite element basis functions with 5 nodes."
