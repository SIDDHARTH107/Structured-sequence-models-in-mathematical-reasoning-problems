    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A · B) / ||B|| * B\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, and ||B|| is the magnitude of B.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (4 * 3) + (2 * 5) = 12 + 10 = 22\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of B:\n\n||B|| = √(3^2 + 5^2) = √(9 + 25) = √34\n\nNow, we can find the projection of A onto B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (22 / √34) * B\n\nTo find the actual vector, we multiply the scalar (22 / √34) by the vector B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (22 / √34) * (3, 5) = ( (22 * 3) / √34, (22 * 5) / √34 ) = (66 / √34, 110 / √34)\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is (66 / √34, 110 / √34)."
