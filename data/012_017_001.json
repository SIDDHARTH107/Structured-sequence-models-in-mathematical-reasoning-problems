    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set. In other words, each vertex is paired with another vertex through a single edge, and no vertex is left unpaired.\n\nIn order to determine whether a perfect matching exists in graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. The number of vertices should be even, which is true in this case (8 vertices).\n\n2. The graph should be connected, meaning there should be a path between any two vertices. Since we don't have information about the connectivity of the graph, we cannot definitively determine whether a perfect matching exists.\n\n3. The graph should satisfy Tutte's theorem, which states that for a graph G to have a perfect matching, for any subset U of vertices in G, the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices in the subgraph induced by (V(G) - U) should be less than or equal to |U|. Again, we don't have enough information about the graph to apply this theorem.\n\nWithout more information about the structure and connectivity of the graph, we cannot definitively determine whether a perfect matching exists or identify it."
