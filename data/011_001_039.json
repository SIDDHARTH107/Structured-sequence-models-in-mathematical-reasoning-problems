    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of unique letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS\" and their frequencies:\n\nM: 2\nA: 2\nT: 2\nH: 1\nE: 1\nI: 1\nC: 1\nS: 1\n\nNow, we need to form 6-letter words using these letters. There are a few cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: All 6 letters are distinct.\nThere are 7 unique letters (excluding M, A, and T since they appear twice). We can choose any 6 of them in 7C6 ways, and then arrange them in 6! ways. So, there are 7C6 * 6! = 7 * 720 = 5040 words in this case.\n\nCase 2: Two of the same letter appear once (either M, A, or T).\nThere are 3C1 ways to choose which letter appears twice (M, A, or T). Then, we need to choose 4 more distinct letters from the remaining 6 unique letters (5 if we exclude the chosen letter). This can be done in 6C4 ways. Finally, we arrange the 6 letters in 6!/(2!) ways, since there are 2 identical letters. So, there are 3C1 * 6C4 * 6!/(2!) = 3 * 15 * 360 = 16200 words in this case.\n\nCase 3: Two of the same letter appear twice (either M, A, or T).\nThere are 3C2 ways to choose which two letters appear twice. Then, we need to choose 2 more distinct letters from the remaining 5 unique letters (excluding the chosen letters). This can be done in 5C2 ways. Finally, we arrange the 6 letters in 6!/(2! * 2!) ways, since there are 2 pairs of identical letters. So, there are 3C2 * 5C2 * 6!/(2! * 2!) = 3 * 10 * 180 = 5400 words in this case.\n\nAdding up the words from all cases, we get a total of 5040 + 16200 + 5400 = 26640 different 6-letter words that can be formed from the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS\"."
