    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The profit obtained by selling one unit of Product A and one unit of Product B is $5 and $7, respectively. The company has a maximum of 20,000 units of raw material 1 and 30,000 units of raw material 2 for the production process. Each unit of Product A requires 2 units of raw material 1 and 3 units of raw material 2, while each unit of Product B requires 4 units of raw material 1 and 2 units of raw material 2. Determine the maximum profit that the company can make if they have to produce both products.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function (the profit function) is given by:\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nThe constraints are given by the availability of raw materials:\n2x + 4y ≤ 20,000 (raw material 1)\n3x + 2y ≤ 30,000 (raw material 2)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as follows:\ny ≤ (20,000 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ (30,000 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph and finding the intersection points.\n\nIntersection points:\n1. (0, 0) - intersection of x-axis and y-axis\n2. (0, 5000) - intersection of y-axis and the first constraint\n3. (10,000, 0) - intersection of x-axis and the second constraint\n4. (6000, 3000) - intersection of the first and second constraints\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the profit function at each of these intersection points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 5000) = 5(0) + 7(5000) = 35,000\n3. P(10,000, 0) = 5(10,000) + 7(0) = 50,000\n4. P(6000, 3000) = 5(6000) + 7(3000) = 30,000 + 21,000 = 51,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $51,000, which occurs when the company produces 6000 units of Product A and 3000 units of Product B."
