    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 9 and E = 13. We need to find out if there exists a value for F that satisfies the equation.\n\nAnother important property of planar graphs is that they must satisfy the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nLet's check if our graph satisfies this inequality:\n\n13 ≤ 3 * 9 - 6\n13 ≤ 27 - 6\n13 ≤ 21\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph could potentially be planar. Now let's go back to Euler's formula and try to find a value for F:\n\n9 - 13 + F = 2\nF = 6\n\nSince we found a valid value for F, the graph is planar."
