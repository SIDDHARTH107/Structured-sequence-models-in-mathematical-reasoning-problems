(Hint: the maximum absolute value of Z(k) before it diverges is 2, so if the absolute value of Z(k) is greater than 2 after n iterations, the point is not in the Mandelbrot set.)",
    "message_2": "To determine if the point (-0.924, 0.243) is in the Mandelbrot set, we will iterate the formula Z(k+1) = Z(k)^2 + C, where C = -0.924 + 0.243i, and check if the absolute value of Z(k) remains less than or equal to 2 for all iterations. If the absolute value of Z(k) becomes greater than 2 at any point, the point is not in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nLet's start iterating:\n\nk = 0: Z(0) = 0 (initial value)\n\nk = 1: Z(1) = Z(0)^2 + C = 0^2 + (-0.924 + 0.243i) = -0.924 + 0.243i\n\nk = 2: Z(2) = Z(1)^2 + C = (-0.924 + 0.243i)^2 + (-0.924 + 0.243i)\n= (0.853776 - 0.449784i) + (-0.924 + 0.243i)\n= -0.070224 + 0.042216i\n\nk = 3: Z(3) = Z(2)^2 + C = (-0.070224 + 0.042216i)^2 + (-0.924 + 0.243i)\n= (0.002497 + 0.005932i) + (-0.924 + 0.243i)\n= -0.921503 + 0.248932i\n\nWe can continue iterating, but it's important to note that there is no fixed maximum number of iterations to determine if a point is in the Mandelbrot set. The number of iterations required depends on the precision desired and the specific point being tested. In practice, a maximum number of iterations is often set (e.g., 1000 or 10000), and if the absolute value of Z(k) remains less than or equal to 2 after that many iterations, the point is considered to be in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nFor the given point (-0.924, 0.243), we can continue iterating until the absolute value of Z(k) either becomes greater than 2 or remains less than or equal to 2 for the desired number of iterations."
