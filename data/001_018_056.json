    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we first need to evaluate each logarithm separately.\n\n1. log(base 4) 64:\nWe need to find the exponent x such that 4^x = 64. Since 4^3 = 64, the value of this logarithm is 3.\n\n2. log(base 2) 32:\nWe need to find the exponent y such that 2^y = 32. Since 2^5 = 32, the value of this logarithm is 5.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the original expression:\n\n3 - 5 = -2\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is -2."
