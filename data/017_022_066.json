    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let's first find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nThe order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p dividing the order of G must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nFor p = 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 60 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are 1, 3, 5, or 15. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nFor p = 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are 1 or 10. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor p = 5, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 12 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possibilities are 1 or 6. Let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has unique Sylow subgroups of orders 2^2, 3, and 5. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since their orders are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is C4 × C3 × C5 ≅ C60. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup of order 5! = 120/2 = 60/2 = 30. The only possibility for a normal subgroup of order 30 is the direct product of the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, n_3 = n_5 = 1, and n_2 > 1. The Sylow 2-subgroup cannot be normal in G, so G is not isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, then G cannot have unique Sylow subgroups for all primes dividing its order. Since G is non-abelian, at least one of n_2, n_3, or n_5 must be greater than 1. We already ruled out the case where G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, so we must have n_2 > 1, n_3 > 1, or n_5 > 1. There are several possibilities for the Sylow subgroups in this case, and we cannot determine the specific non-abelian group G is isomorphic to without more information.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60 or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, but it cannot be isomorphic to A5 × C2. We cannot determine the specific non-abelian group G is isomorphic to without more information."
