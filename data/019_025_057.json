    "message_2": "To find the expected number of students who will improve their math scores, we can multiply the total number of students attending the tutorials (60) by the percentage of students who improve their scores (85%).\n\n60 students * 0.85 (85%) = 51 students\n\nSo, 51 students are expected to see an improvement in their math scores."
