Now, we find the Cartesian product of (A x B) and {6}:\n\n(A x B) x {6} = {((1,4),6), ((1,5),6), ((2,4),6), ((2,5),6), ((3,4),6), ((3,5),6)}\n\n2.

Now, we find the Cartesian product of A and (B x {6}):\n\nA x (B x {6}) = {(1,(4,6)), (1,(5,6)), (2,(4,6)), (2,(5,6)), (3,(4,6)), (3,(5,6))}\n\nNow, let's rewrite the elements of both sets to make them look similar:\n\n(A x B) x {6} = {((1,4),6), ((1,5),6), ((2,4),6), ((2,5),6), ((3,4),6), ((3,5),6)}\nA x (B x {6}) = {(1,(4,6)), (1,(5,6)), (2,(4,6)), (2,(5,6)), (3,(4,6)), (3,(5,6))}\n\nAlthough the elements look different, they represent the same ordered pairs. For example, ((1,4),6) represents the same ordered pair as (1,(4,6)). Therefore, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative.\n\n3.
