    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in a graph G with 10 vertices and each vertex having a degree of 3, we can use the Handshaking Theorem. The Handshaking Theorem states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet's denote the number of edges as E. Since there are 10 vertices and each vertex has a degree of 3, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Theorem:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * E\n\nSo, we have:\n\n30 = 2 * E\n\nNow, we can solve for E:\n\nE = 30 / 2\nE = 15\n\nTherefore, the graph G has 15 edges."
