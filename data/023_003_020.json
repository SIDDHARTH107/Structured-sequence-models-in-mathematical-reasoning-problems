    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using Fourier series, we first need to rewrite the PDE in terms of a homogeneous boundary condition. We can do this by defining a new function v(x,t) such that:\n\nv(x,t) = u(x,t) - x^2 - 4t\n\nNow, the PDE for v(x,t) becomes:\n\nv(x,t) = 0\n\nwith the boundary conditions:\n\nv(0,t) = 2t^2 - 4t = 2t(t - 2)\nv(L,t) = L^2 - L^2 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve this PDE. Let v(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Then, we have:\n\nX(x)T(t) = 0\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)T(t), we get:\n\n1 = 0\n\nSince this equation is not true, there is no nontrivial solution for v(x,t). Therefore, the original PDE u(x,t) = x^2 + 4t is the solution to the given problem with the specified boundary conditions."
