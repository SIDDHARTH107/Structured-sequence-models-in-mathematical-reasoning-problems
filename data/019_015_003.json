Define a function f : T → bool \nwhich takes as input a function of type nat → bool and returns true if f returns true for exactly 5 of the first 10 natural numbers. Prove that there exists such a function f.",
    "message_2": "To define a function f : T → bool, we first need to understand the type T. The type T is a function that takes as input a function of type nat → bool and returns a bool. In other words, T takes a function that maps natural numbers to booleans and returns a boolean value.\n\nNow, let's define the function f : T → bool as follows:\n\nf(g) = true if g returns true for exactly 5 of the first 10 natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\nf(g) = false otherwise\n\nTo prove that there exists such a function f, we need to show that f is well-defined and satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nLet g be a function of type nat → bool. We can apply g to each of the first 10 natural numbers and count the number of times g returns true. Since there are only 10 natural numbers to consider, this process is finite and well-defined.\n\nNow, let's check if f satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement:\n\n1. f takes as input a function of type nat → bool: This is true by the definition of f.\n\n2. f returns true if the input function returns true for exactly 5 of the first 10 natural numbers: This is true by the definition of f.\n\n3. f returns false otherwise: This is also true by the definition of f.\n\nSince f is well-defined and satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement, we have proved that there exists a function f : T → bool with the desired properties."
