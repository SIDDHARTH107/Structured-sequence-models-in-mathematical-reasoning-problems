    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in complexity with each iteration. In each iteration, the number of segments increases, and the length of each segment decreases.\n\nFor the first iteration, there is 1 segment with a length of 1 unit.\n\nIn the second iteration, each segment is replaced by 4 segments, each with a length of 1/2 unit. So, there are 4 segments with a total length of 4 * (1/2) = 2 units.\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the 4 segments is replaced by 4 segments, each with a length of 1/4 unit. So, there are 16 segments with a total length of 16 * (1/4) = 4 units.\n\nIn the fourth iteration, each of the 16 segments is replaced by 4 segments, each with a length of 1/8 unit. So, there are 64 segments with a total length of 64 * (1/8) = 8 units.\n\nIn the fifth iteration, each of the 64 segments is replaced by 4 segments, each with a length of 1/16 unit. So, there are 256 segments with a total length of 256 * (1/16) = 16 units.\n\nThe total length of the first 5 iterations of the Hilbert curve is the sum of the lengths of each iteration:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 units."
