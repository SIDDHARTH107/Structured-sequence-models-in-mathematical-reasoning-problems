    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 100 liters of water with a salt concentration of 0.1 kg/liter. Salt water with a concentration of 0.5 kg/liter is entering the tank at a rate of 5 liters/minute, and the mixture in the tank is kept uniform by stirring. Water is flowing out of the tank at a rate of 3 liters/minute. Find the amount of salt in the tank after half an hour.",
    "message_2": "Let x(t) be the amount of salt in the tank at time t. We want to find x(30), the amount of salt in the tank after 30 minutes.\n\nThe rate of salt entering the tank is 5 liters/minute * 0.5 kg/liter = 2.5 kg/minute. The rate of salt leaving the tank is 3 liters/minute * (x(t) / (100 + 2t) kg/liter), where 100 + 2t is the volume of the mixture in the tank at time t. The net rate of change of salt in the tank is the difference between these two rates:\n\ndx/dt = 2.5 - 3 * (x(t) / (100 + 2t))\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)):\n\ne^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)) * dx/dt = 2.5 * e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt))\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product x(t) * e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)). So we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)) * dx/dt dt) = ∫(2.5 * e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)) dt)\n\nx(t) * e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)) = 2.5 * ∫(e^(∫(3/(100+2t) dt)) dt) + C\n\nNow we need to find the integral of 3/(100+2t) with respect to t. Let u = 100 + 2t, then du = 2 dt:\n\n∫(3/(100+2t) dt) = (3/2) * ∫(1/u du) = (3/2) * ln|u| + K = (3/2) * ln|100 + 2t| + K\n\nNow we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\nx(t) * e^((3/2) * ln|100 + 2t|) = 2.5 * ∫(e^((3/2) * ln|100 + 2t|) dt) + C\n\nAt t = 0, the initial amount of salt in the tank is x(0) = 100 * 0.1 = 10 kg. Plugging this into the equation, we can solve for C:\n\n10 * e^((3/2) * ln|100|) = 2.5 * ∫(e^((3/2) * ln|100|) dt) + C\n\nC = 10\n\nNow we can find x(30):\n\nx(30) * e^((3/2) * ln|100 + 2(30)|) = 2.5 * ∫(e^((3/2) * ln|100 + 2(30)|) dt) + 10\n\nx(30) * e^((3/2) * ln|160|) = 2.5 * ∫(e^((3/2) * ln|160|) dt) + 10\n\nTo find the integral on the right side, we can use substitution again. Let v = (3/2) * ln|160 + 2t|, then dv = (3/(100 + 2t)) dt:\n\n∫(e^((3/2) * ln|100 + 2t|) dt) = (2/3) * ∫(e^v dv) = (2/3) * e^v + L = (2/3) * e^((3/2) * ln|100 + 2t|) + L\n\nNow we can substitute this back into our equation:\n\nx(30) * e^((3/2) * ln|160|) = 2.5 * ((2/3) * e^((3/2) * ln|160|) + L) + 10\n\nx(30) = 2.5 * ((2/3) * e^0 + L) + 10\n\nx(30) = 2.5 * (2/3) + 10\n\nx(30) = 1.6667 + 10\n\nx(30) ≈ 11.67 kg\n\nSo after half an hour, there are approximately 11.67 kg of salt in the tank."
