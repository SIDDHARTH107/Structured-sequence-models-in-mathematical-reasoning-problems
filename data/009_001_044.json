    "message_1": "A population of rabbits is introduced to a field where there are no predators. The growth of the rabbit population can be modeled using the differential equation: \n\ndP/dt = 0.25P, \n\nwhere P is the population size and t is the time in years. \nIf there are initially 50 rabbits and the growth rate remains constant, what will be the population size after 4 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.25P\n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.25 dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.25 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.25t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition that there are 50 rabbits at t=0:\n\nln(50) = 0.25(0) + C\nln(50) = C\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of P:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.25t + ln(50))\n\nTo find the population size after 4 years, we plug in t=4:\n\nP(4) = e^(0.25(4) + ln(50))\nP(4) = e^(1 + ln(50))\n\nP(4) = e^1 * e^ln(50)\nP(4) = e * 50\n\nP(4) ≈ 2.71828 * 50 ≈ 135.914\n\nSo, after 4 years, the population size will be approximately 136 rabbits."
