    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal structure formed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedrons from a larger one. The number of smaller tetrahedrons used to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron at any given level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the level of the Sierpinski tetrahedron.\n\nFor a 4th level Sierpinski tetrahedron:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = (4^4 - 1) / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = (256 - 1) / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = 255 / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedrons = 85\n\nSo, there are 85 smaller tetrahedrons used to construct a 4th level Sierpinski tetrahedron."
