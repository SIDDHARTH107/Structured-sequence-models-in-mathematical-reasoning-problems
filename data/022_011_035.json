    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the singularity at z = 0 of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(2z-1), we first need to determine if the singularity is removable, a pole, or essential.\n\nA singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singular point to make it continuous. A singularity is a pole if the function goes to infinity as z approaches the singular point. A singularity is essential if it is neither removable nor a pole.\n\nLet's analyze the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(2z-1) at z = 0:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(2z-1) = ((z-1)(z+1))/(2z-1)\n\nAt z = 0, the function is undefined because the denominator (2z-1) becomes zero. Now, let's find the limit of the function as z approaches 0:\n\nlim (z->0) ((z-1)(z+1))/(2z-1)\n\nSince the limit is of the form 0/0, we can use L'Hôpital's rule. Differentiate the numerator and the denominator with respect to z:\n\nd/dz ((z-1)(z+1)) = 2z\nd/dz (2z-1) = 2\n\nNow, apply L'Hôpital's rule:\n\nlim (z->0) (2z/2) = lim (z->0) z = 0\n\nSince the limit exists and is finite, the singularity at z = 0 is removable. We can redefine the function at z = 0 to make it continuous:\n\nf(z) = { (z^2 - 1)/(2z-1) if z ≠ 0\n         { 0 if z = 0\n\nThe order of a removable singularity is 0, so the order of the singularity at z = 0 is 0, and it is a removable singularity."
