    "message_1": "A pizza parlor has a large circular pizza with a radius of 14 inches. What is the perimeter of one slice of pizza if it's cut into 8 equal pieces? (Round the answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of one slice of pizza, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii that form the slice.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. Since the pizza is cut into 8 equal pieces, each slice will have an angle of 360°/8 = 45°.\n\nThe formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (angle/360°) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nFor our problem, the angle is 45° and the radius is 14 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (45°/360°) × 2π(14 inches)\nArc length = (1/8) × 2π(14 inches)\nArc length = (1/8) × 28π inches\nArc length = 3.5π inches\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter of the slice. The perimeter will be the sum of the arc length and the two radii (14 inches each):\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 × Radius\nPerimeter = 3.5π inches + 2 × 14 inches\nPerimeter = 3.5π inches + 28 inches\n\nTo get the answer to the nearest hundredth, we need to approximate the value of π:\n\nPerimeter ≈ 3.5 × 3.14 inches + 28 inches\nPerimeter ≈ 10.99 inches + 28 inches\nPerimeter ≈ 38.99 inches\n\nSo, the perimeter of one slice of pizza is approximately 38.99 inches, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
