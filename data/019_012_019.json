If so, which statements can be simultaneously true and why?",
    "message_2": "In Paraconsistent logic, it is possible for contradictory statements to be true simultaneously without leading to an explosion of truth values (i.e., without making every statement true). However, this does not mean that any set of contradictory statements can be true at the same time. The truth values still need to be consistent with the underlying mathematical or logical properties.\n\nIn this case, let's examine the statements:\n\nA) \"The number 7 is even.\"\n\nAn even number is defined as a number that is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. Since 7 is not divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder (7/2 = 3 with a remainder of 1), statement A is false.\n\nB) \"The number 7 is odd.\"\n\nAn odd number is defined as a number that is not divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. Since 7 is not divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, statement B is true.\n\nC) \"The number 7 is neither odd nor even.\"\n\nThis statement contradicts the definition of integers, as every integer is either odd or even. Since 7 is an integer and we have already established that it is odd, statement C is false.\n\nUsing Paraconsistent logic, we can conclude that it is not possible for more than one of these statements to be true simultaneously. Only statement B, \"The number 7 is odd,\" is true, while statements A and C are false."
