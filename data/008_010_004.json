    "message_2": "First, we will write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n    | 1  2 -1 |  5 |\n    | 2 -3  4 |  4 |\n    | 3 -1  2 | -1 |\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we will subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n    R2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n\n    | 1  2 -1 |  5 |\n    | 0 -7  6 | -6 |\n    | 3 -1  2 | -1 |\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we will subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n    R3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n    | 1  2 -1 |  5 |\n    | 0 -7  6 | -6 |\n    | 0 -7  5 | -16 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we will add the second row to the third row:\n\n    R3 = R3 + R2\n\n    | 1  2 -1 |  5 |\n    | 0 -7  6 | -6 |\n    | 0  0 -1 | -22 |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have -z = -22, so z = 22.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nFrom the second row, we have -7y + 6z = -6. Substitute z = 22:\n\n    -7y + 6(22) = -6\n    -7y + 132 = -6\n    -7y = -138\n    y = 19.714\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 2y - z = 5. Substitute y = 19.714 and z = 22:\n\n    x + 2(19.714) - 22 = 5\n    x + 39.428 - 22 = 5\n    x = -12.428\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -12.428, y = 19.714, and z = 22."
