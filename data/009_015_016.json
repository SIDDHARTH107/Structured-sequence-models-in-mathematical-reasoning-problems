    "message_1": "A sample of Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. If the initial mass of the sample is 2 grams, what will be its mass after 13.5 billion years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 2 grams, the time elapsed is 13.5 billion years, and the half-life is 4.5 billion years.\n\nFinal mass = 2 * (1/2)^(13.5 / 4.5)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of half-lives that have passed:\n\n13.5 billion years / 4.5 billion years = 3 half-lives\n\nNow, we can plug this into the formula:\n\nFinal mass = 2 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 2 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 2 * 0.125\n\nFinal mass = 0.25 grams\n\nSo, after 13.5 billion years, the mass of the Uranium-238 sample will be 0.25 grams."
