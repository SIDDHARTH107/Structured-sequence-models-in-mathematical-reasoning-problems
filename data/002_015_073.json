    "message_2": "The perimeter (or circumference) of a circle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 8 cm, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2 × 3.14159 × 8\nC ≈ 50.26544 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the circle is approximately 50.27 cm."
