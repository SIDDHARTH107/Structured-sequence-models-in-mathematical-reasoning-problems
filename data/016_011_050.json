    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, which means that it is formed by replacing each segment with a smaller copy of the whole fractal. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, each line segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle part is replaced by two segments of the same length, forming a \"V\" shape.\n\nLet's denote the length of the initial line segment as L (in this case, L = 1 unit). At each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced by a factor of 3.\n\nSo, at the 4th iteration, the number of segments will be 4^4 = 256, and the length of each segment will be L/3^4 = 1/81.\n\nThe perimeter of the Vicsek fractal at the 4th iteration is the product of the number of segments and the length of each segment:\n\nPerimeter = 256 * (1/81) = 256/81 â‰ˆ 3.1605 units."
