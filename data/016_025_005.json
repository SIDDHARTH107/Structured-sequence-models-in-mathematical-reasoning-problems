    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve method involves repeatedly removing smaller equilateral triangles from the larger equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 3.\n\nIn the first iteration, we have 1 large equilateral triangle.\nIn the second iteration, we have 3 smaller equilateral triangles.\nIn the third iteration, we have 3^2 = 9 triangles.\nIn the fourth iteration, we have 3^3 = 27 triangles.\n\nSo, in the fifth iteration, we will have 3^4 = 81 triangles."
