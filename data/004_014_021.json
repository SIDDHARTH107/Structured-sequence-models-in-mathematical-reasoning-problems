If the block is melted and then poured into a cylindrical container, find the radius of the container if the height of the cylindrical container is 12 cm. Use integration to find the volume of the metal block and the volume of the cylindrical container, and then find the radius of the container to which the block is poured.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the volume of the metal block and the volume of the cylindrical container using integration. Then, we will equate the two volumes and solve for the radius of the container.\n\n1. Find the volume of the metal block:\n\nThe metal block has a square base with sides of 6 cm and a height of 10 cm. To find the volume using integration, we can consider the block as a stack of infinitesimally thin square layers (each with a thickness of dx) along the x-axis.\n\nThe side length of each square layer is 6 cm, so the area of each layer is A(x) = 6^2 = 36 cm^2. The volume of each layer is then A(x) * dx, and we need to integrate this over the height of the block (from 0 to 10 cm) to find the total volume:\n\nV_block = ∫[A(x) * dx] from 0 to 10\nV_block = ∫[36 * dx] from 0 to 10\n\nIntegrating 36 with respect to x gives us 36x, and evaluating this from 0 to 10:\n\nV_block = [36 * 10] - [36 * 0] = 360 cm^3\n\n2. Find the volume of the cylindrical container:\n\nThe cylindrical container has a height of 12 cm and an unknown radius r. To find the volume using integration, we can consider the container as a stack of infinitesimally thin circular layers (each with a thickness of dy) along the y-axis.\n\nThe area of each circular layer is A(y) = π * r^2, so the volume of each layer is A(y) * dy. We need to integrate this over the height of the container (from 0 to 12 cm) to find the total volume:\n\nV_cylinder = ∫[A(y) * dy] from 0 to 12\nV_cylinder = ∫[π * r^2 * dy] from 0 to 12\n\nSince r is a constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nV_cylinder = π * r^2 * ∫[dy] from 0 to 12\n\nIntegrating 1 with respect to y gives us y, and evaluating this from 0 to 12:\n\nV_cylinder = π * r^2 * [12 - 0] = 12π * r^2\n\n3. Equate the volumes and solve for the radius:\n\nSince the metal block is melted and poured into the cylindrical container, their volumes must be equal:\n\nV_block = V_cylinder\n360 cm^3 = 12π * r^2\n\nDivide both sides by 12π:\n\n30 = r^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nr = √30 ≈ 5.48 cm\n\nSo, the radius of the cylindrical container is approximately 5.48 cm."
