    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"ATTACK\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J) in order: MATHSBCDEFGIKLOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow, the Playfair matrix looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L O\nP Q R U V\nW X Y Z\n\nNext, we need to split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters) and apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, insert an 'X' between them (or a 'Q' if the repeated letter is 'X'): AT TX AC K\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to the right (wrapping around if necessary): M -> A, A -> T, T -> H, etc.\n3. If the letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below (wrapping around if necessary): A -> B, T -> P, etc.\n4. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle: A -> T, T -> A, etc.\n\nApplying these rules to the digraphs:\n\nAT -> TM\nTX -> HP\nAC -> TB\nK -> K (since it's a single letter, we can leave it as is or add an X or Q to make a pair)\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"TMHPTBK\"."
