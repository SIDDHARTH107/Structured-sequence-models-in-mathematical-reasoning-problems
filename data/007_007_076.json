    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 2x + 3y = 17, we first find one particular solution and then use the general solution formula for linear Diophantine equations.\n\nStep 1: Find one particular solution\nWe can start by finding one solution by trial and error. For example, let's try x = 1:\n\n2(1) + 3y = 17\n3y = 15\ny = 5\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (1, 5).\n\nStep 2: Use the general solution formula\nThe general solution for the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = 17. The greatest common divisor of 2 and 3 is 1 (gcd(2, 3) = 1), so d = 1. Our particular solution is (x0, y0) = (1, 5).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the general solution formula:\n\nx = 1 + 3n\ny = 5 - 2n\n\nSince n is an integer, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different values of n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (1, 5)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (4, 3)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (-2, 7)\n\nAnd so on. The general solution for all integer values of n is:\n\n(x, y) = (1 + 3n, 5 - 2n)"
