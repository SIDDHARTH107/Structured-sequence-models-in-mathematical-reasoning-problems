    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = -4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, -2)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nN = r_vv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures k1 and k2 as the eigenvalues of the shape operator matrix:\n\n| L - k  M |\n|          | = 0\n| M  N - k |\n\nwhere L, M, N are evaluated at the point (1, -1, 0). So, we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = -4(1)(-1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(-1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(-1)^2) = 2/3\nM = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(-1)^2) = -2/3\nN = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(-1)^2) = -2/3\n\nNow, we solve the characteristic equation:\n\n| 2/3 - k  -2/3 |\n|               | = 0\n| -2/3  -2/3 - k |\n\n(2/3 - k)((-2/3) - k) - (-2/3)(-2/3) = 0\n\nk^2 - (2/3)k - (4/9) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = (2/3 + sqrt((2/3)^2 + 4/9)) / 2 = 1\nk2 = (2/3 - sqrt((2/3)^2 + 4/9)) / 2 = -2/3\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, 0) on the surface are k1 = 1 and k2 = -2/3."
