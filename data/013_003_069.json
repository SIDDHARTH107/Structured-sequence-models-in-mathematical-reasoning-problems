    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $10 to split between themselves and Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they both keep the money. If Player 2 rejects the offer, both players receive $0. \n\nAssuming Player 2 has a minimum acceptable offer of $2, what is the optimal (highest) offer that Player 1 should make to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "Since Player 2 has a minimum acceptable offer of $2, the optimal (highest) offer that Player 1 should make to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer is $2. This way, Player 1 can keep the remaining $8 for themselves, and Player 2 will accept the offer because it meets their minimum requirement."
