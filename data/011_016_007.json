    "message_1": "A university is planning a psychology experiment studying the effects of different colors on mood. There are five colors in mind: red, blue, green, yellow, and purple. The experiment will have five sessions, with each session featuring three colors. In each session, a participant will be shown a paper bearing a random selection of two of the three colors for one minute, and then the participant's mood will be evaluated. What is the minimum number of participants needed to participate in the experiment to ensure that each possible combination of two colors is shown to a participant in at least one session?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of participants needed, we first need to determine the number of possible combinations of two colors out of five. We can use the combination formula for this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of colors (5) and k is the number of colors we want to choose (2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2! * 3!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo there are 10 possible combinations of two colors out of five.\n\nNow, we need to divide these combinations into five sessions, with each session featuring three colors. We can do this by listing the combinations and grouping them in a way that ensures each color combination is shown at least once:\n\nSession 1: (red, blue), (red, green), (blue, green)\nSession 2: (red, yellow), (red, purple), (yellow, purple)\nSession 3: (blue, yellow), (blue, purple), (yellow, blue)\nSession 4: (green, yellow), (green, purple), (yellow, green)\nSession 5: (red, blue), (red, purple), (blue, purple)\n\nIn each session, there are three color combinations, and each participant will see two of them. Therefore, we need at least two participants per session to ensure that all three combinations are shown.\n\nSo the minimum number of participants needed is 2 participants * 5 sessions = 10 participants."
