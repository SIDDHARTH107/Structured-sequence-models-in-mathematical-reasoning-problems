    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is less than (n-2)π, where n is the number of sides. For a regular pentagon, n = 5. So, the sum of the interior angles is less than (5-2)π = 3π.\n\nNow, let's denote the interior angle of the regular pentagon as x. Since there are 5 equal angles in a regular pentagon, the sum of the interior angles can be represented as 5x.\n\nAccording to the hyperbolic geometry, we have:\n\n5x < 3π\n\nTo find the maximum possible value for the interior angle x, we can set the inequality as an equation:\n\n5x = 3π\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = (3π) / 5\n\nx ≈ 1.884 radians or approximately 108 degrees.\n\nSo, the interior angles of the regular pentagon in hyperbolic geometry are approximately 108 degrees each."
