    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order differential equation y' = 2xy, we can use the method of separation of variables. \n\nFirst, rewrite the equation as:\n\n(dy/dt) / y = 2x\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫2x dx\n\nThe left side integrates to ln|y| + C1, and the right side integrates to x^2 + C2:\n\nln|y| + C1 = x^2 + C2\n\nNow, we can combine the constants C1 and C2 into a single constant C:\n\nln|y| = x^2 + C\n\nTo find the value of C, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\nln|1| = 0^2 + C\n\nln(1) = 0, so C = 0:\n\nln|y| = x^2\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to solve for y:\n\ny(t) = e^(x^2)\n\nNow we can find the solutions for y(t) at t=1, t=2, and t=3:\n\ny(1) = e^(1^2) = e\ny(2) = e^(2^2) = e^4\ny(3) = e^(3^2) = e^9\n\nSo the solutions are y(1) = e, y(2) = e^4, and y(3) = e^9."
