    "message_1": "In a market, 60% of the customers purchase product A, 30% purchase product B, and 10% purchase both A and B products. What is the probability that a randomly selected customer will purchase product A but not product B?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nP(A) = 0.60 (probability of purchasing product A)\nP(B) = 0.30 (probability of purchasing product B)\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.10 (probability of purchasing both products A and B)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a customer purchasing either product A or product B:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.10 = 0.80\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of a customer purchasing product A but not product B. This can be represented as:\n\nP(A ∩ B') = P(A) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere B' represents the event of not purchasing product B.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(A ∩ B') = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected customer will purchase product A but not product B is 0.50 or 50%."
