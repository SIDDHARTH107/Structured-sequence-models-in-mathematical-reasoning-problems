    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will analyze the properties of G and compare them to the properties of C16, D8, and the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C16. A group is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. If G is cyclic, then it must have an element of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides the order of G, which is 16. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then it must be normal, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup. In this case, G would be isomorphic to C16.\n\nNow let's consider the dihedral group D8. This group has order 16 and is non-abelian. It is generated by two elements, r and s, with the relations r^8 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s. If G is isomorphic to D8, then it must have an element of order 8 (corresponding to r) and an element of order 2 (corresponding to s). Additionally, G must be non-abelian.\n\nFinally, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 16. There are several non-abelian groups of order 16, but one example is the quaternion group Q16, which is generated by two elements, i and j, with the relations i^4 = j^4 = 1 and ij = j^(-1)i^(-1). If G is isomorphic to Q16, then it must have elements of order 4 and be non-abelian.\n\nTo determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the structure and properties of G. If G has an element of order 16, then it is isomorphic to C16. If G has an element of order 8 and an element of order 2, and is non-abelian, then it is isomorphic to D8. If G has elements of order 4 and is non-abelian, then it could be isomorphic to Q16 or another non-abelian group of order 16. Without further information about G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
