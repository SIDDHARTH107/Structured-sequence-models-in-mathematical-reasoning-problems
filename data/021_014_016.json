    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can solve this problem analytically, but I understand that you want to use genetic algorithms to find the solution. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use a genetic algorithm to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 3 over the interval [0, 5] accurate to 3 decimal places.\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of random candidate solutions (x-values) within the interval [0, 5]. The size of the population depends on the problem, but let's use 20 individuals for this example.\n\n2. Fitness Evaluation: Calculate the fitness of each individual in the population by evaluating the function f(x) at their respective x-values. The fitness is the value of the function f(x) for each individual.\n\n3. Selection: Select individuals for reproduction based on their fitness. The higher the fitness, the higher the chance of being selected for reproduction. You can use methods like roulette wheel selection or tournament selection.\n\n4. Crossover: Pair the selected individuals and perform crossover to create offspring. Crossover is the process of combining the genetic information of two parents to create new offspring. For this problem, you can use a simple arithmetic crossover, where the offspring's x-value is the average of the parents' x-values.\n\n5. Mutation: Apply mutation to the offspring by adding a small random value to their x-values. This helps to maintain diversity in the population and avoid getting stuck in local optima. The mutation rate should be relatively low (e.g., 1-5%).\n\n6. Replacement: Replace some of the least fit individuals in the population with the offspring.\n\n7. Termination: Repeat steps 2-6 until the maximum value converges to a stable value or a predefined number of generations have passed.\n\nAfter the termination condition is met, the individual with the highest fitness in the population represents the x-value that gives the maximum value of the function f(x) over the interval [0, 5] accurate to 3 decimal places.\n\nPlease note that as a language model AI, I cannot execute code or run algorithms. However, you can implement the above steps in a programming language of your choice to find the maximum value of the function using genetic algorithms."
