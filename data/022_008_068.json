    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z) = 2z^4 - 4z^2 + 1, we first look for a substitution that simplifies the equation. Let's substitute w = z^2, then the function becomes:\n\nf(w) = 2w^2 - 4w + 1\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in w. We can solve for w using the quadratic formula:\n\nw = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2, b = -4, and c = 1. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nw = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(1))) / (2(2))\nw = (4 ± √(16 - 8)) / 4\nw = (4 ± √8) / 4\n\nSo, we have two possible values for w:\n\nw1 = (4 + √8) / 4\nw2 = (4 - √8) / 4\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding values of z for each value of w. Recall that we made the substitution w = z^2. So, we have:\n\nz^2 = w1 = (4 + √8) / 4\nz^2 = w2 = (4 - √8) / 4\n\nTaking the square root of both sides for each equation, we get:\n\nz1,2 = ±√((4 + √8) / 4)\nz3,4 = ±√((4 - √8) / 4)\n\nThese are the four zeros of the function f(z) = 2z^4 - 4z^2 + 1. Since each zero appears only once in the factored form of the polynomial, we can classify each zero as having order 1."
