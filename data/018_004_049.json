    "message_2": "Since B is a complement of A, it means that A and B are disjoint sets and their union makes up the entire universal set. If A has 10 elements and B has 5 elements, then the universal set has 10 + 5 = 15 elements.\n\nNow, C is also a complement of A, which means that A and C are disjoint sets and their union makes up the entire universal set. Since the universal set has 15 elements and A has 10 elements, then C must have 15 - 10 = 5 elements."
