    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many adults and children are in the community.\n\nAdults: 500 * 0.60 = 300\nChildren: 500 - 300 = 200\n\nNext, let's find out how many adults and children attend the social event.\n\nAdults attending: 300 * 0.75 = 225\nChildren attending: 200 * 0.50 = 100\n\nNow, let's find the total number of attendees at the event.\n\nTotal attendees: 225 (adults) + 100 (children) = 325\n\nFinally, let's find the probability that a randomly chosen attendee is a child.\n\nProbability = (Number of children attending) / (Total attendees)\nProbability = 100 / 325\nProbability â‰ˆ 0.3077\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen attendee is a child is approximately 30.77%."
