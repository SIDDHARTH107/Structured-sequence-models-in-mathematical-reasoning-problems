    "message_2": "A meromorphic function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on its domain except for a finite number of isolated singularities, which are poles. A pole of a meromorphic function is a point where the function approaches infinity.\n\nThe given function f(z) = z^2 + 3z - 5 is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are holomorphic on the entire complex plane. Since f(z) is holomorphic everywhere, it has no poles. Therefore, the function f(z) = z^2 + 3z - 5 has no poles and their orders in the complex plane."
