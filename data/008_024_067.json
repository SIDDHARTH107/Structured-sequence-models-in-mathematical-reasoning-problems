    "message_1": "Solve the system of linear equations: \n\nx + y + z = 6 \n2x + 2y + 2z = 12 \n3x + 3y + 3z = 18 \n\nHow many solutions does this system have?",
    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations by dividing the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\nx + y + z = 6\nx + y + z = 6\nx + y + z = 6\n\nAs we can see, all three equations are the same. This means that the system has infinitely many solutions, as any solution that satisfies one equation will satisfy all three."
