    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the augmented matrix and perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the reduced row echelon form (RREF). The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n```\n| 2  3 -1 | 7 |\n| 1 -2  4 | 4 |\n| 3  1 -2 | 1 |\n```\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n```\n| 1 -2  4 | 4 |\n| 2  3 -1 | 7 |\n| 3  1 -2 | 1 |\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1. To do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\n- Row 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\n- Row 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n```\n|  1  -2   4 |  4 |\n|  0   7 -9 | -1 |\n|  0   7 -14| -11|\n```\n\nNow, we will divide Row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row, second column:\n\n```\n|  1  -2   4 |  4 |\n|  0   1  -9/7 | 1/7 |\n|  0   7 -14 | -11|\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 7 in the third row, second column by performing the following row operation:\n\n- Row 3 = Row 3 - 7 * Row 2\n\n```\n|  1  -2    4  |   4  |\n|  0   1  -9/7 |  1/7 |\n|  0   0    1  |  -2  |\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in RREF. We can read the solutions directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 4 - 2(-2) + 4(1) = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\ny = 1/7 + (-9/7)(-2) = 1/7 + 18/7 = 19/7\nz = -2\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 12\ny = 19/7\nz = -2"
