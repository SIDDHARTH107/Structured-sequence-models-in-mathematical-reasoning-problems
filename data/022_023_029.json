    "message_1": "A student is analyzing a wave equation in the complex plane represented by $u(x,y) = \\text{Re}\\{e^{i(x+3y)}\\}$. What is the amplitude and phase of the wave at the point $(1, -2)$?",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase of the wave at the point (1, -2), we first need to plug the coordinates into the equation:\n\n$u(1, -2) = \\text{Re}\\{e^{i(1+3(-2))}\\}$\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n$u(1, -2) = \\text{Re}\\{e^{i(1-6)}\\}$\n\n$u(1, -2) = \\text{Re}\\{e^{-5i}\\}$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the complex exponential in polar form using Euler's formula:\n\n$u(1, -2) = \\text{Re}\\{(\\cos(-5) + i\\sin(-5))\\}$\n\nSince we are only interested in the real part of the expression, we can ignore the imaginary part:\n\n$u(1, -2) = \\cos(-5)$\n\nThe amplitude of the wave is always 1 for a complex exponential function. The phase of the wave at the point (1, -2) is the argument of the complex exponential, which is -5 in this case.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 1, and the phase is -5."
