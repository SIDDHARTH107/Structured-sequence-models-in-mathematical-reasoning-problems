    "message_1": "A statement \"P\" is known to be true, but a student does not know \"P\". However, the student knows that if \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" is true. What value should be assigned to \"Q\" to make the student know \"Q\"?",
    "message_2": "Since the student knows that if \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" is true, we can represent this relationship as an implication: P → Q. In order for the student to know \"Q\", we need to make sure that \"Q\" is true when \"P\" is true.\n\nSince we know that \"P\" is true, we can assign any value to \"Q\" that makes the implication P → Q true. In this case, we should assign \"Q\" the value \"true\" as well. This way, the student will know \"Q\" because they know that if \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true."
