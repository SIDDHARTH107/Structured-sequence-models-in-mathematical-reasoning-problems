    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 10 cm by 15 cm has square corners of side length x cm removed from each corner. The resulting cardboard is then folded up to form an open-top box. What value of x will give the box the maximum volume?",
    "message_2": "Let's first express the dimensions of the open-top box in terms of x. After removing the square corners, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 15 - 2x\nWidth: 10 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = x(15 - 2x)(10 - 2x)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function V(x) by taking its first derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (15 - 2x)(10 - 2x) - 2x(10 - 2x) - 2x(15 - 2x)\n\nNow, we need to solve V'(x) = 0 for x:\n\n0 = (15 - 2x)(10 - 2x) - 2x(10 - 2x) - 2x(15 - 2x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n0 = -8x^3 + 60x^2 - 100x\n\nFactoring out a common factor of -4x:\n\n0 = -4x(2x^2 - 15x + 25)\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x in the quadratic part of the equation:\n\nx = (15 ± √(15^2 - 4(2)(25))) / (2 * 2)\n\nx = (15 ± √(225 - 200)) / 4\n\nx = (15 ± √25) / 4\n\nx = (15 ± 5) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (15 + 5) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5\nx = (15 - 5) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\n\nHowever, since the width of the cardboard is 10 cm, x cannot be greater than half of the width (5 cm) because the corners would overlap. Therefore, the only valid solution is:\n\nx = 2.5 cm\n\nSo, the value of x that will give the box the maximum volume is 2.5 cm."
