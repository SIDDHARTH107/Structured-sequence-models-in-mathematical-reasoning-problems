    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, we need to find the maximum distance between any two vertices, where the distance is the shortest path connecting them.\n\nSince we know the distance between each pair of vertices, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. For each vertex, find the shortest path to all other vertices.\n2. For each vertex, find the longest of these shortest paths.\n3. The diameter of the graph is the maximum of these longest shortest paths.\n\nTo find the shortest path between each pair of vertices, we can use an algorithm like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices.\n\nOnce we have the shortest path between each pair of vertices, we can find the diameter of the graph by iterating through the shortest paths and finding the maximum distance.\n\nIn this case, since there are 10 vertices, the diameter of the graph will be the maximum distance between any two vertices in the graph. Without more information about the specific distances between vertices, we cannot provide a numerical value for the diameter."
