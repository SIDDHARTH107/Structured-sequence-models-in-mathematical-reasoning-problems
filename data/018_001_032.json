    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set {} is a subset of A.\n\nBy definition, a set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. The empty set {} has no elements, so there are no elements in {} that are not in A. Therefore, the empty set {} is a subset of A (and of any other set).\n\nTo prove this, let's use a proof by contradiction:\n\nAssume that the empty set {} is not a subset of A. This means that there must be at least one element in {} that is not in A. However, this contradicts the definition of the empty set, which has no elements. Therefore, our assumption is false, and the empty set {} must be a subset of A.\n\nSo, {} ⊆ A is true."
