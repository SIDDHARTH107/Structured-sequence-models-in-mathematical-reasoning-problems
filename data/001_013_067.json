    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(3x + 10) - 2 = 5, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(3x + 10) = 7\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(3x + 10))^2 = 7^2\n\n3x + 10 = 49\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 39\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 13\n\nThe solution to the radical equation √(3x + 10) - 2 = 5 is x = 13."
