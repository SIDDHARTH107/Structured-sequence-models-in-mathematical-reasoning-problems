    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x + 5, we will apply the power rule for derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, for f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x + 5:\n\nThe derivative of 4x^3 is 4 * 3x^(3-1) = 12x^2.\nThe derivative of -2x is -2 * 1x^(1-1) = -2.\nThe derivative of 5, a constant, is 0.\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x + 5 is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 2."
