    "message_2": "To find the nature of the singularity at z=0 for the given complex function f(z) = (z^2 + z + 1)/(z^3 - 1), we first need to determine if z=0 is a pole, removable singularity, or essential singularity.\n\nA removable singularity occurs when the function can be redefined at the singular point to make it analytic. A pole occurs when the function has a non-zero limit as z approaches the singular point, and an essential singularity occurs when the function has no limit as z approaches the singular point.\n\nLet's analyze the function f(z) = (z^2 + z + 1)/(z^3 - 1) at z=0:\n\nf(0) = (0^2 + 0 + 1)/(0^3 - 1) = 1/(-1) = -1\n\nSince the function is well-defined at z=0, there is no singularity at z=0. Therefore, the nature of the singularity at z=0 is not applicable as there is no singularity at this point."
