    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The profit for each unit of X and Y are $10 and $15 respectively. They have a total of 100 units of material A, 150 units of material B and 200 units of material C available. It is known that producing one unit of X requires 2 units of A, 3 units of B and 1 unit of C, while producing one unit of Y requires 1 unit of A, 4 units of B and 3 units of C. What is the maximum profit the company can make and how many units of X and Y should they produce to achieve it? \n\nFormulate this problem as a semi-definite programming problem and solve it.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can formulate it as a linear programming problem, not a semi-definite programming problem. Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 100 (Material A constraint)\n3x + 4y <= 150 (Material B constraint)\nx + 3y <= 200 (Material C constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method.\n\nGraphical method:\n1. Plot the constraints on a graph with x-axis representing product X and y-axis representing product Y.\n2. Identify the feasible region, which is the intersection of all the constraints.\n3. Find the corner points of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each corner point.\n5. The corner point with the highest profit value is the optimal solution.\n\nSimplex method:\n1. Convert the inequalities into equalities by introducing slack variables.\n2. Set up the initial simplex tableau.\n3. Perform the simplex algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\nUsing either method, we find the optimal solution to be x = 20 and y = 30. Therefore, the company should produce 20 units of product X and 30 units of product Y to achieve a maximum profit of:\n\nP(20, 30) = 10(20) + 15(30) = 200 + 450 = $650."
