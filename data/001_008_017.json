Draw a number line with an open circle at 5 (since x is strictly greater than 5 and not equal to 5).\n2. Shade the region to the right of the open circle, indicating that all values greater than 5 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---(5)--->\n       ^\n       |\n    Open circle at 5, shaded region to the right"
