    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology group H^2(X) with coefficients in ℤ/4ℤ, we first need to understand the topological structure of X. Since X is a circle, it is a one-dimensional manifold, and its cohomology groups will be trivial in dimensions greater than 1.\n\nRecall that the cohomology groups of a topological space X with coefficients in a group G are defined as the homology groups of the singular chain complex with coefficients in G. In our case, X is a circle and G = ℤ/4ℤ.\n\nThe singular chain complex for a circle is given by:\n\n0 → ℤ/4ℤ → ℤ/4ℤ → 0\n\nwhere the first non-trivial group corresponds to 0-dimensional simplices (points), and the second non-trivial group corresponds to 1-dimensional simplices (edges).\n\nSince X is a circle, its second cohomology group H^2(X; ℤ/4ℤ) corresponds to the homology group of the trivial group 0 in the singular chain complex. Therefore, H^2(X; ℤ/4ℤ) is trivial, and we have:\n\nH^2(X; ℤ/4ℤ) = 0"
