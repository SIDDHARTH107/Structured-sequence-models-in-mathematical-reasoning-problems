    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The production of each product requires the use of two types of machines M1 and M2. Each machine can work for a maximum of 8 hours per day. Product A requires 1 hour on M1 and 2 hours on M2, while product B requires 2 hours on M1 and 1 hour on M2. The profit for each unit of product A is $10 and for each unit of product B is $25. The company wants to maximize its profit while respecting the time constraints of the machines. Using the artificial bee colony algorithm, what is the optimal production plan that the company should follow?",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees. However, this problem can be solved more easily using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 10x + 25y\n\nConstraints (machine time):\n1x + 2y ≤ 8 (M1)\n2x + 1y ≤ 8 (M2)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 1x + 2y = 8\n   y = (8 - x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 1y = 8\n   y = 8 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0), and (2, 3).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 25(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 4) = 10(0) + 25(4) = $100\n3. P(4, 0) = 10(4) + 25(0) = $40\n4. P(2, 3) = 10(2) + 25(3) = $95\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 4), with a profit of $100. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 0 units of product A and 4 units of product B."
