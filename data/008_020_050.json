    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by -2 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n-2(x + y + z) = -2(6)\n-2x - 2y - 2z = -12\n\nNow add this new equation to the second equation:\n\n(-2x - 2y - 2z) + (2x + 3y + 2z) = -12 + 15\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find x:\n\nx + 3 + z = 6\nx + z = 3 (1)\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of z equal:\n\n3(x + y + z) = 3(6)\n3x + 3y + 3z = 18\n\nNow subtract the third equation from this new equation:\n\n(3x + 3y + 3z) - (3x + 4y - 3z) = 18 - 0\n-y + 6z = 18\n\nSince we know y = 3, we can substitute it back into this equation:\n\n-3 + 6z = 18\n6z = 21\nz = 21/6\nz = 3.5\n\nNow we can substitute the value of z back into equation (1) to find x:\n\nx + 3.5 = 3\nx = 3 - 3.5\nx = -0.5\n\nSo the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations are:\n\nx = -0.5\ny = 3\nz = 3.5"
