    "message_1": "A RLC circuit is constructed with a resistor of 10 ohms, a coil with an inductance of 0.5 H and a capacitor with capacitance of 2 µF in series. The circuit is closed with a switch at t = 0. Initially, there is no current in the circuit. Determine the differential equation for the circuit and find the current in the circuit for t > 0.",
    "message_2": "To find the differential equation for the RLC circuit, we need to apply Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is equal to zero. In this case, the loop consists of the resistor (R), the inductor (L), and the capacitor (C).\n\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law: V_R = iR, where i is the current.\nThe voltage across the inductor is given by V_L = L(di/dt), where di/dt is the rate of change of current with respect to time.\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by V_C = 1/C ∫i dt, where ∫i dt is the integral of the current with respect to time.\n\nApplying KVL, we have:\n\nV_R + V_L + V_C = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the voltages, we get:\n\niR + L(di/dt) + 1/C ∫i dt = 0\n\nDifferentiating the equation with respect to time, we obtain the second-order differential equation:\n\nR(di/dt) + L(d²i/dt²) + 1/C i = 0\n\nNow, we have the differential equation for the circuit:\n\n10(di/dt) + 0.5(d²i/dt²) + 1/(2x10^(-6)) i = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation:\n\n0.5m² + 10m + 1/(2x10^(-6)) = 0\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = (-10 ± √(10² - 4(0.5)(1/(2x10^(-6)))))/(2(0.5))\n\nm = (-10 ± √(100 - 2))/(1)\n\nm = -5 ± √49\n\nm1 = -5 + 7 = 2\nm2 = -5 - 7 = -12\n\nSince we have distinct real roots, the general solution for the current i(t) is given by:\n\ni(t) = A*e^(m1*t) + B*e^(m2*t)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we need to use the initial conditions:\n\nAt t = 0, i(0) = 0 (no current initially)\n\n0 = A*e^(2*0) + B*e^(-12*0)\n0 = A + B\n\nAt t = 0, di/dt = 0 (no change in current initially)\n\n0 = 2A*e^(2*0) - 12B*e^(-12*0)\n0 = 2A - 12B\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nA = -B\n2(-B) - 12B = 0\n-14B = 0\nB = 0\n\nSince B = 0, A = 0 as well.\n\nTherefore, the current in the circuit for t > 0 is:\n\ni(t) = 0\n\nThis means that there is no current flowing in the circuit for t > 0."
