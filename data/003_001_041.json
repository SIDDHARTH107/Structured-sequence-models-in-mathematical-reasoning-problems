    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). In this case, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the legs. We are given that one leg (a) has a length of 5, and the hypotenuse (c) has a length of 13. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n13² = 5² + b²\n169 = 25 + b²\n144 = b²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the value of b:\n\nb = √144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12."
