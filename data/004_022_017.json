    "message_1": "A farmer has 400 meters of fencing and wants to enclose a rectangular pasture along the side of a barn that will require no fencing. What are the dimensions of the pasture that has the maximum area?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the width of the rectangular pasture (the side perpendicular to the barn) and y be the length of the pasture (the side parallel to the barn). Since the farmer has 400 meters of fencing, and one side of the rectangle does not require fencing (the side along the barn), we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 400\n\nWe want to maximize the area A of the rectangular pasture, which is given by:\n\nA = x * y\n\nWe can solve for y in the first equation:\n\ny = 400 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation:\n\nA = x * (400 - x)\n\nA = 400x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 400 - 2x = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 400\nx = 200\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 400 - 200\ny = 200\n\nSo, the dimensions of the pasture that maximize the area are x = 200 meters (width) and y = 200 meters (length). The maximum area is 200 * 200 = 40,000 square meters."
