    "message_1": "A ladder leans against a building with a 65 degree angle formed between the ladder and the ground. The base of the ladder is 10 feet away from the building. How long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the trigonometric function called sine. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. In this case, the ladder forms a right triangle with the ground and the building, with the angle between the ladder and the ground being 65 degrees.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\nAngle A = 65 degrees\nAdjacent side (base) = 10 feet\nHypotenuse (ladder) = ?\n\nWe can use the sine function to find the length of the ladder (hypotenuse):\n\nsin(A) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the height of the building, which we can find using the tangent function:\n\ntan(A) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(65) = height / 10\n\nSolving for height:\n\nheight = 10 * tan(65) ≈ 21.07 feet\n\nNow we can use the sine function to find the length of the ladder:\n\nsin(65) = 21.07 / ladder\n\nSolving for ladder:\n\nladder = 21.07 / sin(65) ≈ 23.54 feet\n\nThe length of the ladder is approximately 23.54 feet."
