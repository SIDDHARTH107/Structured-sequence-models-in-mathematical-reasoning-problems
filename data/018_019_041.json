    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and C.\n\n(A Δ B) Δ C = ({1, 4} Δ {3, 4, 5})\n(A Δ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = {4}\n(A Δ B) Δ C = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C (B Δ C).\n\nB Δ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C)\nB ∪ C = {2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ C = {3, 4}\nB Δ C = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B Δ C).\n\nA Δ (B Δ C) = ({1, 2, 3} Δ {2, 5})\nA ∪ (B Δ C) = {1, 2, 3, 5}\nA ∩ (B Δ C) = {2}\nA Δ (B Δ C) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nWe can see that (A Δ B) Δ C = A Δ (B Δ C) = {1, 3, 5}.
