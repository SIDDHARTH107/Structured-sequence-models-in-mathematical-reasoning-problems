    "message_2": "To verify whether (A x B)' = A' x B', we will first find the Cartesian product A x B, then find its complement (A x B)', and finally find A' x B' to compare the two sets.\n\nA x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's find the complements of sets A and B. Since we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B. Therefore, U = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, A' = U - A = {4} and B' = U - B = {1}.\n\nNext, we will find the Cartesian product A' x B' = {(4, 1)}.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B)'. Since A x B contains all possible ordered pairs of A and B, (A x B)' should contain all ordered pairs of A' and B'. In this case, (A x B)' = {(4, 1)}.\n\nComparing the two sets, we find that (A x B)' = {(4, 1)} and A' x B' = {(4, 1)}. Therefore, (A x B)' = A' x B'."
