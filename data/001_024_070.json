    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the expression:\n\nsin(x) / cos(x) * cos(x) / (1 - sin(x))\n\n= (sin(x) * cos(x)) / (cos(x) * (1 - sin(x)))\n\nNow, we can plug in x = 45 degrees:\n\n= (sin(45) * cos(45)) / (cos(45) * (1 - sin(45)))\n\nSince sin(45) = cos(45) = √2/2:\n\n= ((√2/2) * (√2/2)) / ((√2/2) * (1 - (√2/2)))\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n= (2/4) / ((√2/2) * (2/2 - √2/2))\n\n= (1/2) / ((√2/2) * (2 - √2)/2)\n\n= (1/2) / ((√2 * (2 - √2))/4)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 4 to get rid of the fraction in the denominator:\n\n= (1/2) * (4/ (√2 * (2 - √2)))\n\n= 2 / (√2 * (2 - √2))\n\nNow, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n= 2 * (2 + √2) / (√2 * (2 - √2) * (2 + √2))\n\n= (4 + 2√2) / (2(2 - √2)(2 + √2))\n\n= (4 + 2√2) / (2(4 - 2))\n\n= (4 + 2√2) / 4\n\n= 1 + √2/2\n\nSo, the simplified expression for x = 45 degrees is:\n\n1 + √2/2"
