    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} 2 & -1 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 4 & -3 & 3 & 8 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 1 & 4 \\\\ 4 & -3 & 3 & 8 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2 * Row 1 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 4 * Row 1:\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -3 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -7 & 7 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\n3. Multiply Row 2 by -1/3:\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -7 & 7 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\n4. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - Row 2 and Row 3 with Row 3 + 7 * Row 2:\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\nNow, we have row reduced the matrix to its row echelon form. The corresponding system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} x = 2 \\\\ y - z = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nNotice that the third equation has been eliminated, and we are left with only two equations for three variables. This means that the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the coefficient matrix to show that it is a singular matrix:\n\n$$\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 4 & -3 & 3 \\end{vmatrix} = 2\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 3 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1)\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 4 & 3 \\end{vmatrix} + 1\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 4 & -3 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n\n$$= 2(1\\cdot3 - (-1)\\cdot(-3)) - (-1)(1\\cdot3 - (-1)\\cdot4) + 1(1\\cdot(-3) - 1\\cdot4)$$\n\n$$= 2(3 - 3) - (-1)(3 - 4) + 1(-3 - 4)$$\n\n$$= 2(0) + 1 + (-7)$$\n\n$$= 0$$\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is 0, which means that the matrix is singular. A singular matrix is a matrix that is not invertible, and its determinant is 0. In the context of a system of linear equations, a singular matrix implies that the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions. In this case, as we have already found, the system has infinitely many solutions."
