    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of tables, A and B. Each unit of type A requires 4 hours of carpentry work, 2 hours of finishing work, and yields a profit of $120. Each unit of type B requires 6 hours of carpentry work, 1 hour of finishing work, and yields a profit of $150. The company has 40 hours of carpentry work and 18 hours of finishing work available per week. What is the maximum weekly profit that the company can make if they decide to produce tables of both types?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A tables produced and y be the number of type B tables produced. We have the following constraints:\n\nCarpentry work: 4x + 6y ≤ 40\nFinishing work: 2x + y ≤ 18\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 120x + 150y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nCarpentry work: y ≤ (40 - 4x) / 6 = (20 - 2x) / 3\nFinishing work: y ≤ 18 - 2x\n\nNow we will find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph:\n\n1. y ≤ (20 - 2x) / 3\n2. y ≤ 18 - 2x\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 6), (6, 0), and (4, 4).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 120(0) + 150(0) = $0\nP(0, 6) = 120(0) + 150(6) = $900\nP(6, 0) = 120(6) + 150(0) = $720\nP(4, 4) = 120(4) + 150(4) = $1080\n\nThe maximum weekly profit is $1080, which occurs when the company produces 4 tables of type A and 4 tables of type B."
