    "message_1": "A school has decided to allocate 25 students to different sports teams, consisting of basketball, volleyball, and football. Each team must have at least 6 players but no more than 10 players. In how many ways can the school allocate the students to the different teams?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the variables B, V, and F to represent the number of students on the basketball, volleyball, and football teams, respectively. We know that B + V + F = 25, and each team must have at least 6 players and no more than 10 players.\n\nWe can use a generating function to solve this problem. The generating function for each team is (x^6 + x^7 + x^8 + x^9 + x^10), representing the possible number of students on each team. The generating function for the total allocation of students is the product of the generating functions for each team:\n\nG(x) = (x^6 + x^7 + x^8 + x^9 + x^10)^3\n\nWe want to find the coefficient of x^25 in G(x), which represents the number of ways to allocate the students.\n\nG(x) = (x^6(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4))^3\n\nNow, let's expand G(x) using the binomial theorem:\n\nG(x) = x^18(1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 10x^3 + 15x^4 + 21x^5 + 15x^6 + 6x^7 + x^8)^3\n\nWe want the coefficient of x^25, which means we need to find the terms in the expansion that multiply to x^7 (since x^18 is already accounted for). We can use the binomial theorem again to find these terms:\n\n(1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 10x^3 + 15x^4 + 21x^5 + 15x^6 + 6x^7 + x^8)^3\n\nThe terms that multiply to x^7 are:\n\n- 3C3 * 1^0 * x^0 * 6x^7 = 1 * x^7\n- 3C2 * 3x^1 * 6x^6 = 3 * 3 * x^7\n- 3C1 * 6x^2 * 15x^5 = 3 * 6 * 15 * x^7\n- 3C0 * 10x^3 * 15x^4 = 1 * 10 * 15 * x^7\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of these terms:\n\n1 * x^7: Coefficient = 1\n3 * 3 * x^7: Coefficient = 9\n3 * 6 * 15 * x^7: Coefficient = 270\n1 * 10 * 15 * x^7: Coefficient = 150\n\nFinally, we sum these coefficients:\n\n1 + 9 + 270 + 150 = 430\n\nThus, there are 430 ways to allocate the 25 students to the different sports teams."
