    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we need to consider the prime factorization of 30, which is 2 × 3 × 5. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 30.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1 or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups (of order 2). If there is only 1, it is normal.\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There are either 1 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups (of order 3). If there is only 1, it is normal.\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: There is only 1 Sylow 5-subgroup (of order 5), so it is normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If all three Sylow subgroups are normal, then the group is the direct product of the three cyclic groups, which gives us the cyclic group of order 30, Z_30.\n\n2. If only the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal, then the group is a semidirect product of Z_5 and a group of order 6. There are two groups of order 6: Z_6 and S_3. The semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_6 is isomorphic to Z_30, which we already counted. The semidirect product of Z_5 and S_3 gives us a non-abelian group of order 30, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_15.\n\n3. If both the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup are normal, then the group is a direct product of Z_2, Z_3, and Z_5. This case is isomorphic to Z_30, which we already counted.\n\n4. If both the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are normal, then the group is a direct product of Z_3, Z_5, and a group of order 2. This case is isomorphic to Z_30, which we already counted.\n\n5. If only the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, then the group is a semidirect product of Z_2 and a group of order 15. However, there is only one group of order 15, which is Z_15, and the semidirect product of Z_2 and Z_15 is isomorphic to Z_30, which we already counted.\n\nTherefore, there are only two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30: the cyclic group Z_30 and the dihedral group D_15."
