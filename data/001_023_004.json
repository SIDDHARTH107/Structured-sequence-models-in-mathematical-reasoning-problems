    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(3x) = 1 for x in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nsin(3x) = 1/2\n\n2. Take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n\n3x = arcsin(1/2)\n\n3. Find the angles whose sine is 1/2:\n\n3x = π/6 and 3x = 5π/6\n\n4. Divide both sides of each equation by 3:\n\nx = π/18 and x = 5π/18\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π are x = π/18 and x = 5π/18."
