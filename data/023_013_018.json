    "message_1": "A metal plate of thickness 2 cm and thermal diffusivity 0.001 m²/s is initially at 20°C. Suddenly, the temperature on one side of the plate is raised to 80°C and maintained at that temperature while the other side is kept at 0°C. Find the temperature distribution through the plate as a function of time using the Fourier transform method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution through the plate as a function of position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nWe are given the initial condition:\n\nT(x,0) = 20°C\n\nand the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0,t) = 80°C and T(2 cm, t) = 0°C\n\nFirst, let's non-dimensionalize the problem by introducing the following variables:\n\nξ = x / L, τ = αt / L²\n\nwhere L is the thickness of the plate (2 cm). The heat conduction equation becomes:\n\n∂T(ξ,τ) / ∂τ = ∂²T(ξ,τ) / ∂ξ²\n\nNow, let's apply the Fourier transform method. We will assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(ξ,τ) = F(ξ)G(τ)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat conduction equation, we get:\n\nF(ξ) ∂G(τ) / ∂τ = G(τ) ∂²F(ξ) / ∂ξ²\n\nDividing both sides by F(ξ)G(τ), we obtain:\n\n(1 / G(τ)) ∂G(τ) / ∂τ = (1 / F(ξ)) ∂²F(ξ) / ∂ξ²\n\nSince the left side depends only on τ and the right side depends only on ξ, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will denote as -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂G(τ) / ∂τ + λ²G(τ) = 0\n∂²F(ξ) / ∂ξ² + λ²F(ξ) = 0\n\nThe first equation has the general solution:\n\nG(τ) = A e^(-λ²τ)\n\nThe second equation is a sinusoidal equation with the general solution:\n\nF(ξ) = B cos(λξ) + C sin(λξ)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nF(0) = B = 80°C\nF(1) = 80 cos(λ) + C sin(λ) = 0°C\n\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\nC sin(λ) = -80 cos(λ)\n\nSince λ cannot be zero, we have:\n\ntan(λ) = -80 / C\n\nThe non-trivial solutions for λ are given by:\n\nλ = (2n + 1)π / 2, n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of the individual solutions:\n\nT(ξ,τ) = Σ [A_n e^(-λ_n²τ) (80 cos(λ_nξ) + C_n sin(λ_nξ))]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n and C_n, we need to apply the initial condition:\n\nT(ξ,0) = Σ [A_n (80 cos(λ_nξ) + C_n sin(λ_nξ))] = 20°C\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and we can find the coefficients by integrating:\n\nA_n = (2 / π) ∫[0,1] (20 - 80 cos(λ_nξ)) sin(λ_nξ) dξ\n\nSolving this integral for each n, we can find the coefficients A_n and C_n. Finally, we can write the temperature distribution through the plate as a function of time:\n\nT(ξ,τ) = Σ [A_n e^(-λ_n²τ) (80 cos(λ_nξ) + C_n sin(λ_nξ))]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution through the metal plate as a function of time using the Fourier transform method."
