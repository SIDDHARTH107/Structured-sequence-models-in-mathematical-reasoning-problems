    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A.\n\nThe empty set, denoted as âˆ…, contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that we need to check for membership in set A.\n\nSince there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of set A. This holds true regardless of the number of elements in set A, including the case where A contains 5 elements."
