    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which we will denote as P. The order of P is 3^3 = 27.\n\nNow, we will compute the number of elements of order 3 in P. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 27. The only possibilities are 1 and 27. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal, and G is a p-group, which implies that G is abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nIf there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups, then each of them has order 3, and they are all cyclic. The total number of elements of order 3 in G is 27 * (3 - 1) = 54, since each Sylow 3-subgroup has 3 - 1 = 2 elements of order 3. However, this is not possible, since G has only 27 elements.\n\nTherefore, there must be only one Sylow 3-subgroup, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 27. The smallest non-abelian group of order 27 is the Heisenberg group over the field with 3 elements, denoted as H(3). This group has the following presentation:\n\nH(3) = ⟨a, b, c | a^3 = b^3 = c^3 = 1, [a, b] = c, [a, c] = [b, c] = 1⟩\n\nThe center of H(3) is the cyclic subgroup generated by c, and it has order 3. The derived subgroup of H(3) is also the cyclic subgroup generated by c. Since the derived subgroup is a proper subgroup of H(3), H(3) is not abelian.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of cyclic and non-cyclic subgroups of H(3). The cyclic subgroups of H(3) are the following:\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {1}.\n2. The subgroup generated by a, which has order 3.\n3. The subgroup generated by b, which has order 3.\n4. The subgroup generated by c, which has order 3.\n5. The subgroup generated by ab, which has order 3.\n6. The subgroup generated by ac, which has order 3.\n7. The subgroup generated by bc, which has order 3.\n\nThere are 7 cyclic subgroups in total. The only non-cyclic subgroup of H(3) is H(3) itself. Therefore, there is one non-cyclic subgroup of H(3).\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, H(3), by computing the number of cyclic and non-cyclic subgroups of G."
