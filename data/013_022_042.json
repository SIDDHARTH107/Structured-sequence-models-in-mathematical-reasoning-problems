    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given $20 and decides how much to offer Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they each keep their respective amounts. If Player 2 rejects the offer, both players receive $0. What is the optimal offer for Player 1 if they want to maximize their own payoff and Player 2's acceptance rate is 50%?",
    "message_2": "To maximize Player 1's payoff while maintaining a 50% acceptance rate from Player 2, Player 1 should offer an amount that is just enough to make Player 2 indifferent between accepting and rejecting the offer. \n\nLet x be the amount offered to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they receive x dollars. If they reject the offer, they receive $0. Since Player 2's acceptance rate is 50%, they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting when their expected payoff from accepting is equal to their expected payoff from rejecting. \n\nExpected payoff from accepting = x\nExpected payoff from rejecting = 0\n\nSince Player 2 is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, we have:\n\nx = 0\n\nHowever, offering $0 to Player 2 would not maximize Player 1's payoff, as there is a 50% chance that Player 2 will reject the offer, leaving Player 1 with nothing. To maximize Player 1's payoff, they should offer a small positive amount to Player 2, just enough to make them slightly more likely to accept the offer than to reject it. \n\nFor example, Player 1 could offer $0.01 to Player 2. In this case, Player 2's expected payoff from accepting would be slightly higher than their expected payoff from rejecting, making them more likely to accept the offer. If Player 2 accepts the offer, Player 1 would keep $19.99, which is close to the maximum possible payoff of $20."
