    "message_2": "To calculate the moving average for a window size of 5, we will take the average of every 5 consecutive temperatures in the dataset. There will be a total of 26 moving averages since there are 30 data points and the window size is 5.\n\nHere are the moving averages:\n\n1. (28+31+33+32+30)/5 = 30.8\n2. (31+33+32+30+27)/5 = 30.6\n3.

(28+27+26+24+20)/5 = 25\n\nThe moving average smooths out the data and helps us identify trends in the temperature. In this case, we can see that the temperature initially decreases from 30.8 to 21.2, then increases to 34.4, and finally decreases again to 25. This could indicate a cyclical pattern in the temperature over the 30-day period."
