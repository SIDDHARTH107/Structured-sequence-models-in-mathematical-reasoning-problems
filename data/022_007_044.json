    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the equation $z^3 + 3z^2 + 3z + 2 = 0$, we can first try to factor the polynomial. Notice that the coefficients are the same as the binomial expansion of $(z+1)^3$. Therefore, we can rewrite the polynomial as:\n\n$(z+1)^3 = z^3 + 3z^2 + 3z + 1$\n\nNow, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get the equation we want:\n\n$(z+1)^3 - 1 = z^3 + 3z^2 + 3z + 2$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$(z+1)^3 - 1 = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the difference of cubes factorization formula:\n\n$a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$\n\nIn our case, $a = z+1$ and $b = 1$. Applying the formula, we get:\n\n$(z+1 - 1)((z+1)^2 + (z+1)(1) + 1^2) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$z((z+1)^2 + (z+1) + 1) = 0$\n\nNow, we can see that one of the roots is $z = 0$. However, this is not a root of our original equation, so we can ignore it. We are left with the equation:\n\n$(z+1)^2 + (z+1) + 1 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $z+1$. Let $w = z+1$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$w^2 + w + 1 = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation:\n\n$w = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$\n\nIn our case, $A = 1$, $B = 1$, and $C = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$w = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$w = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nNow, we can see that the discriminant is negative, which means that the roots of this equation are complex numbers. Therefore, the roots of the original equation are also complex numbers.\n\nFinally, we can find the roots of the original equation by substituting $w = z+1$:\n\n$z = w - 1 = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2} - 1$\n\n$z = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nSo, the roots of the equation $z^3 + 3z^2 + 3z + 2 = 0$ are complex numbers:\n\n$z_1 = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\n$z_2 = \\frac{-3 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$"
