The scores of 10 students from Group A and 12 students from Group B in mathematics are given as:\n\nGroup A: 75, 68, 80, 91, 62, 55, 82, 70, 89, 73\nGroup B: 82, 74, 65, 89, 78, 67, 72, 68, 90, 81, 83, 69\n\nUsing Discriminant Analysis, determine whether a new student who scored 76 should be assigned to Group A or Group B.",
    "message_2": "To perform Discriminant Analysis, we first need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each group. Then, we will calculate the discriminant score for the new student and determine which group they should be assigned to.\n\nGroup A:\nMean (M1) = (75 + 68 + 80 + 91 + 62 + 55 + 82 + 70 + 89 + 73) / 10 = 745 / 10 = 74.5\nStandard Deviation (SD1) = sqrt(((75-74.5)^2 + (68-74.5)^2 + (80-74.5)^2 + (91-74.5)^2 + (62-74.5)^2 + (55-74.5)^2 + (82-74.5)^2 + (70-74.5)^2 + (89-74.5)^2 + (73-74.5)^2) / 10) = sqrt(1027.5) = 32.05\n\nGroup B:\nMean (M2) = (82 + 74 + 65 + 89 + 78 + 67 + 72 + 68 + 90 + 81 + 83 + 69) / 12 = 918 / 12 = 76.5\nStandard Deviation (SD2) = sqrt(((82-76.5)^2 + (74-76.5)^2 + (65-76.5)^2 + (89-76.5)^2 + (78-76.5)^2 + (67-76.5)^2 + (72-76.5)^2 + (68-76.5)^2 + (90-76.5)^2 + (81-76.5)^2 + (83-76.5)^2 + (69-76.5)^2) / 12) = sqrt(1026) = 32.02\n\nNow, we will calculate the discriminant score for the new student who scored 76:\n\nDiscriminant Score for Group A (DA) = (76 - M1) / SD1 = (76 - 74.5) / 32.05 = 1.5 / 32.05 = 0.0468\nDiscriminant Score for Group B (DB) = (76 - M2) / SD2 = (76 - 76.5) / 32.02 = -0.5 / 32.02 = -0.0156\n\nSince the discriminant score for Group A (DA) is higher than the discriminant score for Group B (DB), the new student who scored 76 should be assigned to Group A."
