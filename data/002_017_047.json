    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we first need to find the length of one of its sides. Since the perimeter is 48 cm and a hexagon has 6 sides, each side has a length of 48 cm / 6 = 8 cm.\n\nNow, we can divide the hexagon into 12 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices. Each of these equilateral triangles has a side length of 8 cm.\n\nTo find the area of one of these equilateral triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We can draw an altitude from one vertex of the equilateral triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side, which will bisect the side into two equal parts. This will create two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths are in the ratio 1:√3:2. Since the hypotenuse (the side of the equilateral triangle) is 8 cm, the shorter leg (half of the base of the equilateral triangle) is 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm, and the longer leg (the altitude) is 4√3 cm.\n\nNow we can find the area of one equilateral triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height) / 2. In this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 4√3 cm, so the area of one equilateral triangle is (8 cm * 4√3 cm) / 2 = 16√3 cm².\n\nSince there are 12 equilateral triangles in the hexagon, the total area of the hexagon is 12 * 16√3 cm² = 192√3 cm²."
