    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the parallel transport of a vector of magnitude 5 units along a curve described by a parametric equation r(t) = (cos t, sin t, 2t), with t varying between 0 and pi. If the initial vector is (1,0,0) at the point (1,0,0), find the final vector and its position on the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of a vector along a curve, we need to solve the following equation:\n\ndV/dt + V × (dr/dt) = 0\n\nwhere V is the vector being parallel transported, and r(t) is the curve. First, let's find dr/dt:\n\nr(t) = (cos t, sin t, 2t)\ndr/dt = (-sin t, cos t, 2)\n\nNow, let's set up the equation for parallel transport:\n\ndV/dt + V × (-sin t, cos t, 2) = 0\n\nThe initial vector V(0) = (1, 0, 0). We can solve this equation using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nI(t) = exp(∫(-sin t, cos t, 2) dt)\n\nTo compute the integral, we integrate each component separately:\n\n∫(-sin t) dt = cos t + C1\n∫(cos t) dt = sin t + C2\n∫(2) dt = 2t + C3\n\nSo, the integrating factor is:\n\nI(t) = exp(cos t + sin t + 2t)\n\nNow, we multiply the parallel transport equation by the integrating factor:\n\nI(t) dV/dt + I(t) V × (-sin t, cos t, 2) = 0\n\nThe left-hand side of this equation is the derivative of the product I(t) V:\n\nd/dt (I(t) V) = 0\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\nI(t) V = C\n\nwhere C is a constant vector. To find C, we use the initial condition V(0) = (1, 0, 0):\n\nI(0) V(0) = C\nexp(1 + 0 + 0) (1, 0, 0) = C\nC = (e, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we can find the final vector V(π) by solving for V in the equation I(t) V = C:\n\nV(π) = I(π)^(-1) C\n\nWe know that I(π) = exp(cos π + sin π + 2π) = exp(-1 + 0 + 2π) = exp(2π - 1). Thus,\n\nV(π) = (1/exp(2π - 1)) (e, 0, 0) = (e^(1 - 2π), 0, 0)\n\nNow, let's find the position of the final vector on the curve:\n\nr(π) = (cos π, sin π, 2π) = (-1, 0, 2π)\n\nSo, the final vector is V(π) = (e^(1 - 2π), 0, 0) and its position on the curve is r(π) = (-1, 0, 2π)."
