    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem that a math student can solve:\n\nConsider a transfer function with the form:\n\nH(s) = 4s / (s^2 + 4s + 3)\n\n(a) Use the partial fraction decomposition method to write H(s) as a sum of simpler fractions.\n\n(b) Use the Fourier transform to analyze the stability of the system described by the transfer function H(s). Specifically, determine if the system is stable or unstable based on the location of the poles of H(s) in the complex plane. \n\n(c) Verify your results by plotting the impulse response of the system over time using the inverse Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "(a) To perform partial fraction decomposition on H(s), we first find the roots of the denominator, which are the poles of the transfer function:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 3 = (s + 1)(s + 3)\n\nNow we can rewrite H(s) as:\n\nH(s) = 4s / ((s + 1)(s + 3))\n\nUsing partial fraction decomposition, we can express H(s) as:\n\nH(s) = A / (s + 1) + B / (s + 3)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can multiply both sides by the common denominator (s + 1)(s + 3):\n\n4s = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by substituting the values of s that make each term in the equation zero:\n\nFor s = -1:\n4(-1) = A(-1 + 3) => A = -2\n\nFor s = -3:\n4(-3) = B(-3 + 1) => B = 6\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition of H(s) is:\n\nH(s) = -2 / (s + 1) + 6 / (s + 3)\n\n(b) To analyze the stability of the system, we look at the poles of H(s). The poles are the roots of the denominator, which we already found as s = -1 and s = -3. Both poles have negative real parts, which means the system is stable.\n\n(c) To find the impulse response of the system, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of H(s). Using the inverse Laplace transform of the partial fraction decomposition, we get:\n\nh(t) = L^(-1){H(s)} = L^(-1){-2 / (s + 1) + 6 / (s + 3)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\nh(t) = -2 * e^(-t) + 6 * e^(-3t)\n\nThis is the impulse response of the system. To verify the stability, we can see that both terms decay exponentially as time goes to infinity, which confirms that the system is stable."
