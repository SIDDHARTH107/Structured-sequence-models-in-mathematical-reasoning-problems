    "message_1": "A clothing store owner claims that the average price of a dress in her store is $50. You want to investigate her claim. You take a sample of 25 dresses and find that the average price is $52 with a sample standard deviation of $5. Test the null hypothesis that the true average price of dresses in the store is $50 using a 5% level of significance. What is your conclusion?",
    "message_2": "To test the null hypothesis that the true average price of dresses in the store is $50, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The true average price of dresses is $50.\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The true average price of dresses is not $50.\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = $52\nSample standard deviation (s) = $5\nPopulation mean (μ) = $50\nLevel of significance (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score:\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (52 - 50) / (5 / √25)\nt = 2 / (5 / 5)\nt = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24) and a 5% level of significance. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.064.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (2) falls within the range of the critical t-values (-2.064 to 2.064), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. \n\nConclusion: At a 5% level of significance, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the true average price of dresses in the store is $50."
