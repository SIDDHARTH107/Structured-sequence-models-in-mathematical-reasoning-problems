    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can treat the two people who insist on sitting next to each other as a single unit. Then, we have 3 units to arrange: the pair and the other two individuals.\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these 3 units, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNow, within the pair, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the two people, which is 2 × 1 = 2 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to seat the 4 people with the two insisting on sitting next to each other is 6 (ways to arrange the units) × 2 (ways to arrange the pair) = 12 ways."
