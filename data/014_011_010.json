    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a transposition cipher with the key \"3 1 4 2\", we first need to arrange the message into a matrix with 4 columns (based on the key length) and fill in any missing spaces with a filler character (e.g., X). The message is:\n\nH E L L\nO W O R\nL D X X\n\nNow, we reorder the columns based on the key:\n\nE H L L\nW O R O\nD L X X\n\nFinally, we read off the encrypted message row by row:\n\nEHLL WORO DLXX\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"EHLLWORODLXX\"."
