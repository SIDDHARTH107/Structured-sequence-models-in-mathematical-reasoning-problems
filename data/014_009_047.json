    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits, a key size of 128 bits, and three rounds. Each round uses a 32-bit key derived from the main key using a key schedule. The Feistel function uses an S-box that maps 4 input bits to 2 output bits. How many different S-boxes can be used in the Feistel function?",
    "message_2": "An S-box maps a certain number of input bits to a certain number of output bits. In this case, the S-box maps 4 input bits to 2 output bits. Since there are 2^4 = 16 possible input combinations for the 4 input bits, each of these combinations must be mapped to one of the 2^2 = 4 possible output combinations for the 2 output bits.\n\nFor each of the 16 input combinations, there are 4 choices for the output. Therefore, the total number of different S-boxes that can be used in the Feistel function is 4^16, which is equal to 2^32 or 4,294,967,296."
