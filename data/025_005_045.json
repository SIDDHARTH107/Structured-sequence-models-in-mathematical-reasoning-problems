    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xyz. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations. We can rewrite the first equation as:\n\nx^2 = yz\n\nAnd the second equation as:\n\ny^2 = xz\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for x^2 from the first equation into the second equation:\n\ny^2 = (yz)z\n\nIf y = 0, then x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. So, (0, 0) is a singular point.\n\nIf y ≠ 0, we can divide both sides of the equation y^2 = (yz)z by y:\n\ny = z^2\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y back into the first equation:\n\nx^2 = (z^2)z\n\nx^2 = z^3\n\nIf z = 0, then x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. So, (0, 0) is a singular point, which we already found.\n\nIf z ≠ 0, we can divide both sides of the equation x^2 = z^3 by z:\n\nx^2/z = z^2\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for y = z^2 back into the second equation:\n\nz^2 = xz\n\nIf x = 0, then z^2 = 0, which implies z = 0. So, (0, 0) is a singular point, which we already found.\n\nIf x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides of the equation z^2 = xz by x:\n\nz = x\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for z back into the first equation:\n\nx^2 = yx\n\nIf x = 0, then y = 0. So, (0, 0) is a singular point, which we already found.\n\nIf x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides of the equation x^2 = yx by x:\n\nx = y\n\nSo, the singular points of the algebraic variety V are (0, 0) and all points on the line x = y."
