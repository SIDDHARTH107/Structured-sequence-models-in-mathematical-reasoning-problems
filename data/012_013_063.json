    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) represents the number of ways to color the graph G with k colors. Let's denote the given edges as e1 = {1,2}, e2 = {1,5}, e3 = {2,3}, e4 = {2,5}, e5 = {3,4}, and e6 = {4,5}.\n\nWe can start by considering the edge e1 = {1,2}. We have two cases:\n\n1. The edge e1 is not part of a proper coloring: In this case, we delete the edge e1 from the graph. The resulting graph G' has the edges e2, e3, e4, e5, and e6. Since G' is a tree (acyclic connected graph), its chromatic polynomial is P(G', k) = k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 5, so P(G', k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\n2. The edge e1 is part of a proper coloring: In this case, vertices 1 and 2 must have different colors. We can contract the edge e1, merging vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex, say vertex 1'. The resulting graph G'' has 4 vertices and the following edges: {1',5}, {1',3}, {3,4}, and {4,5}. G'' is also a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^(4-1) = k(k-1)^3.\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3 = k(k-1)^3(k-1).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^3(k-1)."
