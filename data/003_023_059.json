    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(4^2 + 2^2 + 5^2) = √(16 + 4 + 25) = √45\n|B| = √(3^2 + (-2)^2 + 6^2) = √(9 + 4 + 36) = √49 = 7\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A||B|cos(θ)\n\n(4, 2, 5) · (3, -2, 6) = 4*3 + 2*(-2) + 5*6 = 12 - 4 + 30 = 38\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|) = 38 / (√45 * 7) ≈ 0.8208\n\nθ = arccos(0.8208) ≈ 34.4°\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the right-hand rule. The cross product of A and B will be perpendicular to both A and B. We can find the components of A x B using the determinant method:\n\nA x B = (i, j, k)\n          (4, 2, 5)\n          (3, -2, 6)\n\nA x B = i(2*6 - 5*(-2)) - j(4*6 - 5*3) + k(4*(-2) - 2*3)\nA x B = i(12 + 10) - j(24 - 15) + k(-8 - 6)\nA x B = i(22) - j(9) + k(-14)\n\nA x B = (22, -9, -14)\n\nSo, the cross product of the vectors A = (4, 2, 5) and B = (3, -2, 6) using trigonometry is (22, -9, -14)."
