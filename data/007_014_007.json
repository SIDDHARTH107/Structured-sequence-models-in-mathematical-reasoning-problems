    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8,128. \n\nThe fifth perfect number can be found using the formula for even perfect numbers, which is given by (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers. \n\nThe first four prime numbers for which (2^p - 1) is also prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The next prime number is 13, and (2^13 - 1) = 8,191, which is also prime. \n\nSo, the fifth perfect number is (2^(13-1)) * (2^13 - 1) = 4,096 * 8,191 = 33,550,336."
