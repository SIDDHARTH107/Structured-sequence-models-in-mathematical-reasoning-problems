    "message_2": "In a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 5, each letter in the message is replaced by the letter 5 positions later in the alphabet. To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\", we apply this shift to each letter:\n\nH -> M\nE -> J\nL -> Q\nL -> Q\nO -> T\n(space remains unchanged)\nW -> B\nO -> T\nR -> W\nL -> Q\nD -> I\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"MJQQT BTWQI\"."
