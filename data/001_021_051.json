    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, we can try factoring.\n\n(x - a)(x - b) = x^2 - 5x + 6\n\nWe need to find two numbers a and b such that their product is equal to 6 and their sum is equal to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3.\n\nSo, the factored equation is:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3."
