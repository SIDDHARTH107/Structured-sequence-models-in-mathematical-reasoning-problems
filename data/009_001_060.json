    "message_1": "A certain species of bird starts off with an initial population of 100 birds. The population grows at a rate proportional to the current population, with a doubling time of 3 years. How many birds will be in the population after 6 years?",
    "message_2": "Since the population doubles every 3 years, after 6 years, the population will have doubled twice. \n\nAfter the first 3 years, the population will be:\n100 birds * 2 = 200 birds\n\nAfter the next 3 years (total of 6 years), the population will be:\n200 birds * 2 = 400 birds\n\nSo, after 6 years, there will be 400 birds in the population."
