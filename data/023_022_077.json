    "message_1": "Suppose the stock price of a company ABC is given by the function f(t), where t represents time in days and f(t) represents the price of the stock at time t. If the Fourier transform of f(t) is given by F(ω), find the value of F(3.5), if the stock prices are given for the time interval t = [0, 50] and the sampling frequency is 0.1.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of F(3.5), we need to compute the Fourier transform of the stock price function f(t) and then evaluate it at ω = 3.5. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nHowever, we are given a discrete set of stock prices in the time interval t = [0, 50] with a sampling frequency of 0.1. In this case, we need to use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) instead of the continuous Fourier transform. The DFT is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = Σ[f(t_n) * e^(-jωt_n)]\n\nwhere t_n = n * Δt, and Δt is the sampling interval (0.1 in this case).\n\nTo compute F(3.5), we need the stock prices f(t_n) for the given time interval. Since we don't have the actual stock prices, we cannot compute the exact value of F(3.5). However, if you provide the stock prices for the given time interval, we can compute the DFT and find the value of F(3.5)."
