    "message_2": "To calculate the number of different types of pizza that can be ordered, we will use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of toppings and k is the number of toppings chosen.\n\nWe will calculate the combinations for choosing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 toppings from the 8 available toppings.\n\nC(8, 0) = 8! / (0! * (8-0)!) = 1 (no toppings)\nC(8, 1) = 8! / (1! * (8-1)!) = 8 (1 topping)\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 28 (2 toppings)\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 56 (3 toppings)\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!) = 70 (4 toppings)\n\nNow, we add up the combinations for each case:\n1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 = 163\n\nSo, there are 163 different types of pizza that can be ordered with up to 4 different toppings."
