    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using semi-definite programming, we first need to rewrite the constraint in the form of a matrix inequality. The constraint is given by:\n\n4x^2 + y^2 ≤ 16\n\nWe can rewrite this constraint as:\n\n(2x)^2 + y^2 ≤ 16\n\nNow, let's define a matrix P and a vector X as follows:\n\nP = |1  0|\n    |0  4|\n\nX = |y|\n    |2x|\n\nThe constraint can now be written as a matrix inequality:\n\nX^T * P * X ≤ 16\n\nNow, we can set up the semi-definite programming problem:\n\nminimize: f(x, y) = 2x + 4y\nsubject to: X^T * P * X ≤ 16\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian L as follows:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = 2x + 4y + λ(X^T * P * X - 16)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L with respect to x, y, and λ and set them equal to zero:\n\n∇L = |∂L/∂x|\n         |∂L/∂y|\n         |∂L/∂λ|\n\nSetting the gradient equal to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2 + 8λx = 0\n∂L/∂y = 4 + 2λy = 0\n∂L/∂λ = (X^T * P * X) - 16 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = -1/4λ\ny = -1/λ\n\nSubstituting these values into the third equation:\n\n((-1/λ)^2 * 1 + (2 * (-1/4λ))^2 * 4) - 16 = 0\n(1/λ^2 + 1/λ^2) - 16 = 0\n2/λ^2 = 16\nλ^2 = 1/8\nλ = ±1/√8\n\nNow, we need to check both values of λ to determine which one gives the minimum value of f(x, y):\n\nFor λ = 1/√8:\n\nx = -1/4(1/√8) = -√2\ny = -1/(1/√8) = -√8\nf(x, y) = 2(-√2) + 4(-√8) = -2√2 - 8√2 = -10√2\n\nFor λ = -1/√8:\n\nx = -1/4(-1/√8) = √2\ny = -1/(-1/√8) = √8\nf(x, y) = 2(√2) + 4(√8) = 2√2 + 8√2 = 10√2\n\nSince -10√2 < 10√2, the minimum value of f(x, y) is -10√2, and the optimal values of x and y are x = -√2 and y = -√8."
