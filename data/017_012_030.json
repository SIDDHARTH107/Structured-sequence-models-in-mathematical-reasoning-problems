    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information and use the properties of groups to determine which group G is isomorphic to.\n\n1. G has order 16, so it has 16 elements.\n2. G has exactly 4 elements of order 2.\n\nNow let's consider the properties of the three groups mentioned:\n\nCyclic group C16:\n1. C16 has one generator element, say g, and its elements are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^15}.\n2. In a cyclic group, there is only one element of order 2, which is g^(16/2) = g^8.\n\nDihedral group D8:\n1. D8 has 16 elements and represents the symmetries of a regular octagon.\n2. D8 has 8 elements of order 2 (the reflections).\n\nNon-abelian group of order 16:\n1. There are two non-abelian groups of order 16: the quaternion group Q16 and the generalized quaternion group QD16.\n2. Q16 has 6 elements of order 2.\n3. QD16 has 4 elements of order 2.\n\nFrom the given information, we can rule out C16 and D8, as they do not have exactly 4 elements of order 2. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16 with 4 elements of order 2, which is the generalized quaternion group QD16."
