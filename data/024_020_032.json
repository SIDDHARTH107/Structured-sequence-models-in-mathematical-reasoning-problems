    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a mapping from the 3-sphere (S^3) to the 2-sphere (S^2) that is defined as follows:\n\nGiven a point (x, y, z, w) on the 3-sphere S^3 with radius 2 units, we can represent it as a pair of complex numbers (z1, z2) where z1 = x + yi and z2 = z + wi. The Hopf map H: S^3 â†’ S^2 is defined by:\n\nH(z1, z2) = (z1 * conj(z2), |z1|^2 - |z2|^2)\n\nwhere conj(z) is the complex conjugate of z.\n\nNow, we need to map the points from S^2 to the complex plane. We can use stereographic projection for this purpose. Let (u, v, w) be a point on S^2, and let P be the projection of this point onto the complex plane. The stereographic projection is defined as:\n\nP(u, v, w) = (u / (1 - w), v / (1 - w))\n\nSo, the composition of the Hopf map and the stereographic projection is a mapping from S^3 to the complex plane:\n\nF(z1, z2) = P(H(z1, z2))\n\nTo find the Hopf map of the 3-sphere with radius 2 units into the complex plane, we need to apply this composition to the points on the 3-sphere:\n\nF(z1, z2) = P(H(2z1, 2z2))\n\nBy substituting the Hopf map and the stereographic projection formulas, we get:\n\nF(2z1, 2z2) = P(2z1 * conj(2z2), 4|z1|^2 - 4|z2|^2)\n\nF(2z1, 2z2) = (4z1 * conj(z2) / (3 - 4|z2|^2), (4|z1|^2 - 4|z2|^2) / (3 - 4|z2|^2))\n\nThis is the Hopf map of the 3-sphere with radius 2 units into the complex plane."
