    "message_1": "An RLC circuit is composed of a 10 ohm resistor, a 5 microfarad capacitor, and a 1 Henry inductor. The circuit is connected to a sinusoidal voltage source with a frequency of 50 Hz and amplitude of 10 volts. What is the amplitude of the current in the circuit at resonance frequency?",
    "message_2": "At resonance frequency, the impedance of the RLC circuit is purely resistive, which means the inductive reactance (XL) equals the capacitive reactance (XC). The resonance frequency (fr) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nfr = 1 / (2 * π * √(LC))\n\nwhere L is the inductance (1 H) and C is the capacitance (5 µF).\n\nfr = 1 / (2 * π * √(1 * 5 * 10^(-6)))\nfr ≈ 31.83 Hz\n\nHowever, the given frequency of the voltage source is 50 Hz, which is not the resonance frequency. Therefore, we need to calculate the impedance (Z) of the circuit at 50 Hz.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC) at 50 Hz:\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXL = 2 * π * 50 * 1\nXL ≈ 314.16 ohms\n\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 50 * 5 * 10^(-6))\nXC ≈ 636.62 ohms\n\nNow, we can calculate the impedance (Z) using the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance (10 ohms).\n\nZ = √(10^2 + (314.16 - 636.62)^2)\nZ ≈ 325.27 ohms\n\nFinally, we can find the amplitude of the current (I) using Ohm's law:\n\nI = V / Z\n\nwhere V is the amplitude of the voltage (10 volts).\n\nI = 10 / 325.27\nI ≈ 0.0307 A\n\nThe amplitude of the current in the circuit at 50 Hz is approximately 0.0307 A."
