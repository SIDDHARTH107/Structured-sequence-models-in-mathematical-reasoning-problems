Consider the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_3$ of smooth projective curves of genus $3$.\n\nSuppose we have a family of smooth projective curves over a parameter space $T$ such that the fiber of this family over a point $t\\in T$ is isomorphic to $C$. Consider the universal curve $\\mathcal{C}\\subseteq \\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$ that parametrizes this family.\n\nGiven that $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(2)) = 7$, determine the dimension of the fiber of the normal bundle to $\\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$, evaluated at the point $(C, t)\\in\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the fiber of the normal bundle to $\\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$, evaluated at the point $(C, t)\\in\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The tangent space to $\\mathcal{M}_3$ at a point $[C]$ is isomorphic to $H^1(C, T_C)$, where $T_C$ is the tangent sheaf of $C$.\n2. The tangent space to $T$ at a point $t$ is isomorphic to $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(2))$.\n3. The normal bundle to $\\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$ is the quotient of the tangent bundle of $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$ by the tangent bundle of $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nNow, we know that $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(2)) = 7$, so the dimension of the tangent space to $T$ at $t$ is 7.\n\nNext, we need to compute the dimension of the tangent space to $\\mathcal{M}_3$ at $[C]$. Since $C$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g=3$, we have:\n\n$$h^1(C, T_C) = (3-1)(2\\cdot 3 - 2) = 2\\cdot 4 = 8$$\n\nSo the dimension of the tangent space to $\\mathcal{M}_3$ at $[C]$ is 8.\n\nNow, we consider the tangent bundle of $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$. Since $\\mathcal{M}_3$ and $T$ are both smooth, the tangent bundle of their product is the direct sum of their tangent bundles:\n\n$$T_{\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T} = T_{\\mathcal{M}_3}\\oplus T_T$$\n\nThus, the dimension of the tangent space to $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$ at $(C, t)$ is the sum of the dimensions of the tangent spaces to $\\mathcal{M}_3$ and $T$ at $[C]$ and $t$, respectively:\n\n$$\\dim T_{\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T} = 8 + 7 = 15$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dimension of the fiber of the normal bundle to $\\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$ at $(C, t)$. Since the normal bundle is the quotient of the tangent bundle of $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$ by the tangent bundle of $\\mathcal{C}$, we have:\n\n$$\\dim N_{\\mathcal{C}/\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T} = \\dim T_{\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T} - \\dim T_{\\mathcal{C}} = 15 - 8 = 7$$\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the fiber of the normal bundle to $\\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$, evaluated at the point $(C, t)\\in\\mathcal{M}_3\\times T$, is 7."
