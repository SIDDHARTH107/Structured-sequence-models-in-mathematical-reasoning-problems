    "message_2": "In a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) of a closed surface of genus $g$, the dimension of the vector space of states is given by the Verlinde formula. For a surface that can be represented as a connected sum of $n$ tori, the genus $g$ is equal to $n$. \n\nThe Verlinde formula for the dimension of the vector space of states with coefficients in the field of complex numbers and level $k$ is given by:\n\n$$\\text{dim}(V_g) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{k+2})}{\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{k+2})} \\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{k+2})}{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{k+2})}\\right)^{2g-2}$$\n\nSince $g = n$, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n$$\\text{dim}(V_n) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{k+2})}{\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{k+2})} \\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{k+2})}{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{k+2})}\\right)^{2n-2}$$\n\nThis formula gives the dimension of the vector space of states in the topological quantum field theory of a closed surface of genus $n$ with coefficients in the field of complex numbers when the level of the theory is $k$."
