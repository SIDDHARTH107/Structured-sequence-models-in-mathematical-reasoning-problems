    "message_2": "To find the maximum eigenvalue of the given matrix A, we can use the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix. For the given matrix A, the characteristic equation is:\n\ndet(\n[ 1-λ  0    0    1\n  0    2-λ  0    2\n  0    0    3-λ  3\n  1    2    3    4-λ ]) = 0\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(1-λ)[(2-λ)((3-λ)(4-λ) - 9) - 4] = 0\n\nExpanding further, we get:\n\n(1-λ)[(2-λ)(λ^2 - 7λ + 12 - 9) - 4] = 0\n\n(1-λ)[(2-λ)(λ^2 - 7λ + 3) - 4] = 0\n\nNow, we can find the roots of this polynomial equation to get the eigenvalues. The roots are approximately:\n\nλ1 ≈ 0.2679\nλ2 ≈ 1.0000\nλ3 ≈ 2.7321\nλ4 ≈ 6.0000\n\nThe maximum eigenvalue of matrix A is λ4 ≈ 6.0000."
