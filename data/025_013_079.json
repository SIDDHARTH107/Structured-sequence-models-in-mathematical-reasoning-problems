    "message_2": "1. To find the singular points of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and find the points where both are zero.\n\n$F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 5x - 7$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 5$\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nFor a singular point, both partial derivatives must be zero:\n\n$-3x^2 - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = \\frac{5}{3}$\n$2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo, there are no singular points on the curve since there is no solution for $x^2 = \\frac{5}{3}$ and $y = 0$ simultaneously.\n\n2. The genus of an elliptic curve is always 1.\n\n3. The given curve is already in the Weierstrass form, which is $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. In this case, $A = 5$ and $B = 7$.\n\n4. To compute the period lattice of the curve, we need to find the periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. These are complex numbers that satisfy the equation:\n\n$\\int_{\\omega_1}^{\\omega_2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{4x^3 - g_2x - g_3}}$\n\nwhere $g_2 = -27A$ and $g_3 = -54B$. In our case, $g_2 = -27(5) = -135$ and $g_3 = -54(7) = -378$.\n\nThe period lattice is difficult to compute analytically, and it is usually done numerically. However, it is important to note that the period lattice determines the structure of the elliptic curve and its group law.\n\n5. The order of the Jacobian of the curve is the number of points on the curve over a finite field, up to isomorphism. This is a difficult problem in general, and it depends on the specific field being considered. There are algorithms, such as the Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm, to compute the order of the Jacobian for elliptic curves over finite fields. However, without specifying a finite field, it is not possible to determine the order of the Jacobian."
