    "message_2": "To find the degree of the rational curve, we need to find the degree of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator of the parametrization.\n\nFor x(t), the numerator has degree 2 (since it is a quadratic polynomial) and the denominator also has degree 2 (since it is also a quadratic polynomial). Therefore, the degree of x(t) is max(2, 2) = 2.\n\nFor y(t), the numerator has degree 2 (since it is a quadratic polynomial) and the denominator also has degree 2 (since it is also a quadratic polynomial). Therefore, the degree of y(t) is max(2, 2) = 2.\n\nSince both x(t) and y(t) have degree 2, the degree of the rational curve is 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the genus of the curve. The genus of a rational curve is given by the formula:\n\ngenus = (degree - 1)(degree - 2)/2\n\nIn this case, the degree is 2, so the genus is:\n\ngenus = (2 - 1)(2 - 2)/2 = (1)(0)/2 = 0\n\nSo, the genus of the rational curve is 0."
