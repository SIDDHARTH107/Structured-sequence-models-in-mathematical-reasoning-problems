    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the Cartesian products (A × B) and (B × {6}), and then find the Cartesian products of the resulting sets with {6} and A, respectively. Finally, we will compare the two results to determine if they are equal.\n\n1. Find (A × B):\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n= {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\n2. Find (B × {6}):\nB × {6} = {(b, 6) | b ∈ B}\n= {(4, 6), (5, 6)}\n\nNow, we will find the Cartesian products of the resulting sets:\n\n3. Find ((A × B) × {6}):\n(A × B) × {6} = {((a, b), 6) | (a, b) ∈ (A × B)}\n= {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\n4.

For example, ((1, 4), 6) can be represented as (1, (4, 6)). Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\n(A × B) × {6} = A × (B × {6})"
