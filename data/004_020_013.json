    "message_1": "A crate with a mass of 50 kg is being lifted 10 meters vertically by a force of 100 N. Find the work done on the crate using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done on the crate using integration, we need to set up an integral of the force with respect to the distance it is being lifted. Since the force is constant, the integral will be straightforward.\n\nWork = ∫(Force) dx from 0 to 10 meters\n\nSince the force is constant at 100 N, the integral becomes:\n\nWork = ∫(100) dx from 0 to 10 meters\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = 100x | from 0 to 10 meters\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = 100(10) - 100(0)\nWork = 1000 - 0\nWork = 1000 J\n\nSo, the work done on the crate is 1000 Joules."
