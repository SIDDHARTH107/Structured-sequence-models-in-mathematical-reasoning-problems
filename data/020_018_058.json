They have the following preferences:\n\nFriend 1: Action (A) > Drama (D) > Horror (H) > Comedy (C)\nFriend 2: Drama (D) > Action (A) > Comedy (C) > Horror (H)\nFriend 3: Horror (H) > Comedy (C) > Drama (D) > Action (A)\nFriend 4: Comedy (C) > Horror (H) > Action (A) > Drama (D)\n\nEach friend will be given a score based on their preference ranking. The score will be highest for their first choice and lowest for their last choice. The scores will be:\nA: 4\nD: 3\nH: 2\nC: 1\n\nUsing game theory, what movie should the group watch to maximize their overall score?",
    "message_2": "To find the movie that maximizes the overall score, we need to calculate the total score for each movie genre based on the friends' preferences.\n\nFor Action (A):\nFriend 1: 4 points\nFriend 2: 3 points\nFriend 3: 1 point\nFriend 4: 2 points\nTotal score for Action: 4 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 10 points\n\nFor Drama (D):\nFriend 1: 3 points\nFriend 2: 4 points\nFriend 3: 2 points\nFriend 4: 1 point\nTotal score for Drama: 3 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 10 points\n\nFor Horror (H):\nFriend 1: 2 points\nFriend 2: 1 point\nFriend 3: 4 points\nFriend 4: 3 points\nTotal score for Horror: 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 10 points\n\nFor Comedy (C):\nFriend 1: 1 point\nFriend 2: 2 points\nFriend 3: 3 points\nFriend 4: 4 points\nTotal score for Comedy: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 points\n\nSurprisingly, all movie genres have the same total score of 10 points. In this case, there is no clear winner using game theory, and the group can choose any movie genre as they all maximize their overall score equally."
