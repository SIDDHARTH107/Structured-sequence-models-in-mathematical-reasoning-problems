    "message_1": "Suppose you have a jar with 10 identical black marbles and 8 identical white marbles. You draw 6 marbles from the jar without replacement. What is the probability of getting exactly 3 black marbles and 3 white marbles? Use generating functions to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to set up the generating functions for the black and white marbles. Let B(x) be the generating function for the black marbles and W(x) be the generating function for the white marbles.\n\nSince there are 10 identical black marbles, the generating function for black marbles is:\nB(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^10\n\nSimilarly, since there are 8 identical white marbles, the generating function for white marbles is:\nW(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^8\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of getting exactly 3 black marbles and 3 white marbles when drawing 6 marbles without replacement. To do this, we need to find the coefficient of x^6 in the product of B(x) and W(x).\n\nB(x) * W(x) = (x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^10) * (x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^8)\n\nTo get the coefficient of x^6 in the product, we need to find all the possible ways to multiply terms from B(x) and W(x) such that the exponents add up to 6. In this case, we have:\n\nx^3 (from B(x)) * x^3 (from W(x))\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to draw 3 black marbles and 3 white marbles. This can be done using combinations:\n\nNumber of ways to draw 3 black marbles from 10 = C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 120\nNumber of ways to draw 3 white marbles from 8 = C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 56\n\nSo, the number of ways to draw 3 black marbles and 3 white marbles is:\n120 * 56 = 6720\n\nThere are a total of C(18, 6) ways to draw 6 marbles from the jar without replacement:\nC(18, 6) = 18! / (6! * (18-6)!) = 18564\n\nThus, the probability of getting exactly 3 black marbles and 3 white marbles is:\n6720 / 18564 â‰ˆ 0.362\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 black marbles and 3 white marbles is approximately 0.362 or 36.2%."
