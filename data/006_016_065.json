    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a defect occurring in any given product is 0.08. If a batch of 500 products is produced, what is the probability that at least 40 of them will have a defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (defects) in n trials (products)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defect) in a single trial (product), which is 0.08\n- n is the number of trials (products), which is 500\n- k is the number of successes (defects), which is 40 or more in this case\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 40 defects, we need to find the sum of the probabilities from 40 to 500 defects. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) = 1 - P(X < 40) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 39\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities using the binomial formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) = 1 - Σ [C(500, k) * (0.08)^k * (1-0.08)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 39\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use software or a calculator with a built-in binomial probability function. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 40) ≈ 0.9594\n\nSo, the probability that at least 40 products will have a defect in a batch of 500 products is approximately 0.9594 or 95.94%."
