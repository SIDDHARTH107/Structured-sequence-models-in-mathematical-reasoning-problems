    "message_2": "To encode the plaintext message \"HELLO\" using a One-Time Pad encryption with the key \"GYBNQKURP\", we need to perform an XOR operation on each character of the message with the corresponding character of the key. We'll do this using their ASCII values.\n\n1. H (72 in ASCII) XOR G (71 in ASCII) = 7 (ASCII for 7)\n2. E (69 in ASCII) XOR Y (89 in ASCII) = 20 (ASCII for T)\n3. L (76 in ASCII) XOR B (66 in ASCII) = 14 (ASCII for N)\n4. L (76 in ASCII) XOR N (78 in ASCII) = 6 (ASCII for 6)\n5. O (79 in ASCII) XOR Q (81 in ASCII) = 26 (ASCII for Z)\n\nSo, the encoded message is \"7TN6Z\"."
