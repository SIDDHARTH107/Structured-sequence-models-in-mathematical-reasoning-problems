    "message_2": "A group of order 77 has 77 elements. The prime factorization of 77 is 7 * 11, where 7 and 11 are distinct prime numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order 77 must be isomorphic to one of the following structures:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 77, denoted as Z_77.\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, denoted as Z_7 × Z_11.\n\nTo determine whether the group is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, we can use the following observations:\n\n1. If the group has an element of order 77, then it is a cyclic group. This is because a cyclic group is generated by a single element, and the order of that element is equal to the order of the group.\n\n2. If the group does not have an element of order 77, then it must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups. This is because, in this case, the group can be generated by two elements of orders 7 and 11, and their orders are relatively prime. According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, i.e., Z_7 × Z_11.\n\nIn summary, to determine the structure of a group of order 77, we need to find the orders of its elements. If there is an element of order 77, the group is cyclic (Z_77). If not, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups (Z_7 × Z_11)."
