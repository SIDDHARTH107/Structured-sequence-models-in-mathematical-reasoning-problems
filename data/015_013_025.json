    "message_2": "We can find the value of x₁₀₀ by iterating the logistic equation 100 times with the given values of r and x₀.\n\nLet's start with x₀ = 0.5 and r = 4:\n\nx₁ = 4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 4 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 1\n\nNow we have x₁, so we can find x₂:\n\nx₂ = 4 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 4 * 1 * 0 = 0\n\nNow we have x₂, so we can find x₃:\n\nx₃ = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 4 * 0 * 1 = 0\n\nSince x₂ = x₃ = 0, the sequence will remain 0 for all subsequent iterations. Therefore, x₁₀₀ = 0."
