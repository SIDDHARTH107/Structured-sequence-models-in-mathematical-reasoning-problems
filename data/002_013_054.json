    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base of length 6 cm and width 4 cm. The height of the pyramid is 10 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width\nBase Area = 6 cm * 4 cm\nBase Area = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 24 cm² * 10 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 240 cm³\nVolume = 80 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
