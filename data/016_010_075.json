    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between circles with new circles that are tangent to the surrounding circles. In this case, we start with three mutually tangent circles with curvatures 1, 1, and 2.\n\nFirst, we need to find the curvature of the first circle in the next iteration. The Descartes' Circle Theorem states that if four circles are mutually tangent, then the sum of the squares of their curvatures is twice the square of the sum of their curvatures. Let k1, k2, and k3 be the curvatures of the starting circles, and k4 be the curvature of the new circle. Then:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nPlugging in the given curvatures:\n\n(1 + 1 + 2 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + k4^2)\n\nSolving for k4, we get k4 = 3.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of circles in each iteration:\n\n1st iteration: 3 initial circles + 1 new circle = 4 circles\n2nd iteration: 4 circles + 3 new circles = 7 circles\n3rd iteration: 7 circles + 6 new circles = 13 circles\n4th iteration: 13 circles + 12 new circles = 25 circles\n5th iteration: 25 circles + 24 new circles = 49 circles\n6th iteration: 49 circles + 48 new circles = 97 circles\n\nSo, there are a total of 97 circles in the 6th iteration of the Apollonian gasket with the given starting configuration."
