    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected registered voter will vote for Candidate A, we need to divide the number of voters who plan to vote for Candidate A by the total number of registered voters surveyed.\n\nProbability = (Number of voters for Candidate A) / (Total number of registered voters surveyed)\n\nProbability = 450 / 1000\n\nProbability = 0.45\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected registered voter from this state will vote for Candidate A in the election is 0.45 or 45%."
