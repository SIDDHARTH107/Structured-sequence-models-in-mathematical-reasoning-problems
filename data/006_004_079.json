    "message_1": "In a game of chance, a player rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 or 11?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a total of 7 or 11, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice.\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's find the favorable outcomes for rolling a total of 7 or 11:\n\nFor a total of 7:\n1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1 (6 combinations)\n\nFor a total of 11:\n5+6, 6+5 (2 combinations)\n\nThere are a total of 6 + 2 = 8 favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (favorable outcomes) / (total possible outcomes) = 8/36 = 2/9\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a total of 7 or 11 is 2/9."
