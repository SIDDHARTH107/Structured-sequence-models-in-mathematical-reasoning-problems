    "message_1": "A mass of 1 kg is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 10 N/m. The mass is displaced 5 cm from its equilibrium position and released from rest. Find the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following formulas related to simple harmonic motion:\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the mass is displaced 5 cm, which is equal to 0.05 m. So, the amplitude is A = 0.05 m.\n\n2. Period (T): The time it takes for the mass to complete one full oscillation. The formula for the period of a spring-mass system is T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. In this case, m = 1 kg and k = 10 N/m. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nT = 2π√(1 kg / 10 N/m) = 2π√(0.1) ≈ 2π(0.316) ≈ 1.99 s\n\nSo, the period of the oscillation is approximately 1.99 seconds.\n\n3. Frequency (f): The number of oscillations per unit time. The formula for frequency is the reciprocal of the period, f = 1/T. Using the period calculated above:\n\nf = 1 / 1.99 s ≈ 0.502 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the oscillation is approximately 0.502 Hz.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of the oscillation is 0.05 m, the period is approximately 1.99 seconds, and the frequency is approximately 0.502 Hz."
