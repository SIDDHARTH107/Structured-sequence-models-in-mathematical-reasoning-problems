    "message_2": "To determine whether 2 ⊨ ◇p is true or false, we need to check if there exists a world w in W such that (2, w) is in R and w ⊨ p.\n\nFrom the given model M, we have the accessibility relation R = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)} and the valuation function V(p) = {1, 2}.\n\nNow, let's consider the world 2. We can see that (2,2) and (2,3) are in the accessibility relation R. Since 2 ⊨ p (as 2 is in V(p)), we can conclude that 2 ⊨ ◇p is true."
