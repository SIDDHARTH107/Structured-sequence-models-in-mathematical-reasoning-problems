The cost of transporting the goods per mile on each road is given below:\n\n| Road       | Cost per mile |\n|------------|---------------|\n| A - City 1 | $5            |\n| A - City 2 | $6            |\n| City 1 - B | $4            |\n| City 2 - B | $8            |\n| City 1 - City 2 | $3            |\n\nWhat is the cheapest cost to transport the goods from city A to city B?",
    "message_2": "To find the cheapest cost to transport the goods from city A to city B, we need to consider all possible routes and their costs. There are three possible routes:\n\n1. A - City 1 - B\n2. A - City 2 - B\n3. A - City 1 - City 2 - B\n\nLet's calculate the cost for each route:\n\n1. A - City 1 - B: $5 (A - City 1) + $4 (City 1 - B) = $9\n2. A - City 2 - B: $6 (A - City 2) + $8 (City 2 - B) = $14\n3. A - City 1 - City 2 - B: $5 (A - City 1) + $3 (City 1 - City 2) + $8 (City 2 - B) = $16\n\nComparing the costs of the three routes, the cheapest cost to transport the goods from city A to city B is $9, using the route A - City 1 - B."
