    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 10 elements and let B and C be complements of A. If B has 5 elements, what is the number of elements in C?",
    "message_2": "Since B and C are complements of A, this means that the elements in B and C together make up the elements that are not in A. If A has 10 elements and B has 5 elements, then there must be 5 elements in C to make up the remaining elements not in A. Therefore, the number of elements in C is 5."
