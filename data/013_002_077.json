    "message_1": "Two companies, A and B, are deciding whether to invest in a new market or not. If both invest, they will split a profit of $10 million equally. If neither invest, they will lose $1 million each. If one company invests and the other does not, the company that invested will profit $15 million, while the non-investing company will lose $5 million. What is the Nash Equilibrium in this situation?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to determine the best response for each company given the other company's decision. We can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n                  Company B\n                  Invest    Not Invest\n                 ---------------------\nCompany A  Invest |  5,  5  | 15, -5\n          Not Invest | -5, 15  | -1, -1\n```\n\nNow, let's find the best response for each company:\n\n1. If Company A invests, Company B's best response is to invest as well (5 > -5).\n2. If Company A does not invest, Company B's best response is to invest (15 > -1).\n3. If Company B invests, Company A's best response is to invest (5 > -5).\n4. If Company B does not invest, Company A's best response is to invest (15 > -1).\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium occurs when both companies choose their best response given the other company's decision. In this case, the Nash Equilibrium is when both companies invest, resulting in a payoff of $5 million each."
