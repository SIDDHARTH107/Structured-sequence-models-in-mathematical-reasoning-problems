    "message_2": "To find the total length of the 6th-order Hilbert curve, we need to understand how the length of the curve changes with each order. Given that the length of each subsequent order Hilbert curve is one-half the length of the previous order Hilbert curve, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of n-th order Hilbert curve = Length of (n-1)-th order Hilbert curve * (1/2)\n\nSince we know the length of the 1st-order Hilbert curve is 2, we can find the length of the 6th-order Hilbert curve by applying the formula iteratively:\n\nLength of 2nd-order Hilbert curve = 2 * (1/2) = 1\nLength of 3rd-order Hilbert curve = 1 * (1/2) = 1/2\nLength of 4th-order Hilbert curve = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\nLength of 5th-order Hilbert curve = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\nLength of 6th-order Hilbert curve = (1/8) * (1/2) = 1/16\n\nSo, the total length of the 6th-order Hilbert curve is 1/16."
