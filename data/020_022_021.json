    "message_1": "A small business has a budget of $10,000 to spend on advertising. They have the option to advertise on television, radio or both. The cost of advertising on television is $2,500 per week and on radio is $1,500 per week. Each ad campaign can run for a maximum of 4 weeks. The business wants to allocate their budget in such a way to reach the maximum number of potential customers. What is the optimal allocation of advertising budget between television and radio for maximum reach?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the different options for allocating the budget between television and radio advertising.\n\nOption 1: All budget on television advertising\nWith a budget of $10,000 and a cost of $2,500 per week, the business can run a television ad campaign for 4 weeks ($10,000 / $2,500 = 4 weeks).\n\nOption 2: All budget on radio advertising\nWith a budget of $10,000 and a cost of $1,500 per week, the business can run a radio ad campaign for 6.67 weeks ($10,000 / $1,500 â‰ˆ 6.67 weeks). However, since the maximum campaign length is 4 weeks, the business can only run a radio ad campaign for 4 weeks, leaving $4,000 unspent.\n\nOption 3: Split budget between television and radio advertising\nTo maximize the reach, the business can allocate the budget between television and radio advertising. Let's consider different combinations:\n\n- 1 week of television and 3 weeks of radio: $2,500 (TV) + $4,500 (Radio) = $7,000\n- 2 weeks of television and 2 weeks of radio: $5,000 (TV) + $3,000 (Radio) = $8,000\n- 3 weeks of television and 1 week of radio: $7,500 (TV) + $1,500 (Radio) = $9,000\n\nThe optimal allocation of the advertising budget for maximum reach would be to spend $7,500 on television advertising for 3 weeks and $1,500 on radio advertising for 1 week, totaling $9,000. This way, the business can reach potential customers through both mediums and make the most of their budget."
