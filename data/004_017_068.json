    "message_1": "A cable wire is run along the curve given by y = 3x^2/2 + 4 in the x range from 0 to 5. Find the length of this cable wire.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the cable wire along the curve, we need to use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x) in the given range [a, b]:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the given function, y = 3x^2/2 + 4:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2/2 + 4)/dx = 3x\n\nNow, we need to find the expression inside the square root:\n\n(1 + (f'(x))^2) = 1 + (3x)^2 = 1 + 9x^2\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the arc length:\n\nL = ∫[0, 5] √(1 + 9x^2) dx\n\nThis integral is not easily solvable using elementary functions. However, we can use numerical methods or software to approximate the value of the integral. Using a numerical integration tool, we find:\n\nL ≈ 23.63\n\nTherefore, the length of the cable wire along the curve is approximately 23.63 units."
