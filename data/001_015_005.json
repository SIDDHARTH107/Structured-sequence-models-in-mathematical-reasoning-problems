    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that isolates x. We can do this by expressing both sides of the equation with the same base. Since 32 can be written as 2^5, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(x+3) = 2^5\n\nNow that both sides of the equation have the same base, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 3 = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides:\n\nx = 5 - 3\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2."
