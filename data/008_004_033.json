First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 2  3 -1 | 0\n| 4 -2  3 | 0\n| 6  1 -2 | 0\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n| 4 -2   3   | 0\n| 6  1  -2   | 0\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the leading terms in the second and third rows by subtracting multiples of the first row:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 4 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 6 * Row1\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n| 0 -8   5   | 0\n| 0 -7   1   | 0\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -8 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n| 0  1  -5/8 | 0\n| 0 -7   1   | 0\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the leading term in the third row by adding a multiple of the second row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 + 7 * Row2\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n| 0  1  -5/8 | 0\n| 0  0  -3/8 | 0\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -3/8 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 0\n| 0  1  -5/8 | 0\n| 0  0   1   | 0\n\nStep 6: Eliminate the remaining non-zero terms above the leading 1's:\n\nRow1 = Row1 + 1/2 * Row3\nRow2 = Row2 + 5/8 * Row3\n\n| 1  3/2  0 | 0\n| 0  1   0 | 0\n| 0  0   1 | 0\n\nThe resulting matrix corresponds to the system of equations:\n\nx + 3/2y = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n\nSince y and z are both 0, the solution is:\n\nx = -3/2y\ny = 0\nz = 0\n\nExpressing the solution as a linear combination of the variables:\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n\nThe solution is the trivial solution, as all variables are equal to 0."
