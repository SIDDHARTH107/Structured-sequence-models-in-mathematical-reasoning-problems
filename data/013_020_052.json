    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, consider a group of 50 people who are each asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the person whose number is the closest to two-thirds the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should each player choose to increase their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To increase their chances of winning, each player should try to predict what the other players will choose and then select a number that is two-thirds of the expected average. \n\nLet's assume that all players think rationally and believe that the other players will choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. In this case, the average of all chosen numbers would be 50. Therefore, a rational player would choose two-thirds of 50, which is approximately 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think one step further and assume that everyone else will also choose 33.33, then the new average would be 33.33, and the optimal choice would be two-thirds of 33.33, which is approximately 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, and as players continue to think more steps ahead, the chosen numbers will converge to 0. In practice, players may not think infinitely many steps ahead, but choosing a number closer to 0 will generally increase their chances of winning in the Beauty Contest Game."
