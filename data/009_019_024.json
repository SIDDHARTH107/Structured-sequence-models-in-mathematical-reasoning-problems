    "message_2": "To find the expected value of $X_t$ for $t = 1$, we first need to solve the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, which has the following closed-form solution:\n\n$$X_t = X_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nNow, we can find the expected value of $X_t$ for $t = 1$. Recall that the expected value of a function of a random variable is given by the integral of the function times the probability density function of the random variable. In this case, the random variable is $W_t$, which has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$.\n\nThe expected value of $X_t$ is given by:\n\n$$E[X_t] = E[X_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}]$$\n\nSince $X_0 = 1$, we have:\n\n$$E[X_t] = E[e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}]$$\n\nNow, we can use the moment-generating function (MGF) of the normal distribution, which is given by:\n\n$$M_{W_t}(s) = e^{\\mu_W s + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_W^2 s^2}$$\n\nIn our case, $\\mu_W = 0$ and $\\sigma_W^2 = t$. Thus, the MGF is:\n\n$$M_{W_t}(s) = e^{\\frac{1}{2}t s^2}$$\n\nNow, we can find the MGF of $X_t$:\n\n$$M_{X_t}(s) = E[e^{s(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}] = M_{W_t}(\\sigma s) = e^{\\frac{1}{2}t (\\sigma s)^2}$$\n\nTo find the expected value of $X_t$, we need to find the first derivative of the MGF with respect to $s$ and evaluate it at $s = 0$:\n\n$$E[X_t] = \\frac{dM_{X_t}(s)}{ds}\\Big|_{s=0}$$\n\nDifferentiating $M_{X_t}(s)$ with respect to $s$ and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{dM_{X_t}(s)}{ds} = t\\sigma^2 s e^{\\frac{1}{2}t (\\sigma s)^2}$$\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at $s = 0$:\n\n$$E[X_t] = t\\sigma^2 (0) e^{\\frac{1}{2}t (\\sigma (0))^2} = 0$$\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect because we made an error in calculating the MGF of $X_t$. The correct MGF of $X_t$ should be:\n\n$$M_{X_t}(s) = e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t s + \\frac{1}{2}t (\\sigma s)^2}$$\n\nNow, differentiate this MGF with respect to $s$:\n\n$$\\frac{dM_{X_t}(s)}{ds} = (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t s + \\frac{1}{2}t (\\sigma s)^2} + t\\sigma^2 s e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t s + \\frac{1}{2}t (\\sigma s)^2}$$\n\nEvaluate the derivative at $s = 0$:\n\n$$E[X_t] = (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(0)(\\sigma (0))^2} = (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t$$\n\nSubstitute the given values of $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and $t$:\n\n$$E[X_t] = (0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.1)^2)(1) = 0.05 - 0.005 = 0.045$$\n\nSo, the expected value of $X_t$ for $t = 1$ is $0.045$."
