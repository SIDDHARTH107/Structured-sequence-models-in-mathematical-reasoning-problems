    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a specific discrete logarithm problem for a math student to solve:\n\nGiven a prime number p = 11 and a primitive root g = 2, what is the smallest positive integer x such that 2 raised to the power x is congruent to 7 modulo 11 (i.e., 2^x ≡ 7 (mod 11))?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer x such that 2^x ≡ 7 (mod 11). We can do this by testing different values of x and checking if the congruence holds.\n\n1. For x = 1: 2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n2. For x = 2: 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n3. For x = 3: 2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 11)\n4. For x = 4: 2^4 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5. For x = 5: 2^5 ≡ 10 (mod 11)\n6. For x = 6: 2^6 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n7. For x = 7: 2^7 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n\nWe found that the smallest positive integer x such that 2^x ≡ 7 (mod 11) is x = 7."
