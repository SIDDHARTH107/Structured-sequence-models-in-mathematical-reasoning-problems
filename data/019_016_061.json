    "message_2": "The union of two sets A and B contains all the elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. In the case where there are no common elements between the two sets, the union will have the maximum number of elements possible.\n\nSet A has 5 elements and set B has 8 elements. If there are no common elements between them, the union of set A and set B will have a total of 5 + 8 = 13 elements.\n\nSo, the union of set A and set B can have at most 13 elements."
