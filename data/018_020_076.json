The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow we need to find the union of (A Δ B) and B:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ B = {1, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}."
