    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of electronic devices: smartphones and tablets. The production of each type of device requires a different amount of time, workers, and materials. The factory has 40 workers and 60 hours of production time available each day. The profit for each smartphone is $150 and for each tablet is $200. However, the factory has a limited amount of materials and can only produce a maximum of 60 devices (smartphones and tablets combined) each day. The factory manager wants to know the number of smartphones and tablets they should produce per day to maximize profits while meeting the production constraints. Formulate the problem mathematically as a mixed-integer programming problem and find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of smartphones produced per day and y be the number of tablets produced per day. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 150x + 200y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. The total number of devices produced per day should not exceed 60:\nx + y ≤ 60\n\n2. The factory has 40 workers and 60 hours of production time available each day. Let's assume that it takes a hours of production time to produce one smartphone and b hours to produce one tablet. Similarly, let's assume that it takes c workers to produce one smartphone and d workers to produce one tablet. Then, we have the following constraints:\n\nax + by ≤ 60 (production time constraint)\ncx + dy ≤ 40 (worker constraint)\n\n3. The number of smartphones and tablets produced must be non-negative integers:\nx, y ≥ 0 and x, y ∈ Z\n\nThe problem can now be formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 150x + 200y\nSubject to:\nx + y ≤ 60\nax + by ≤ 60\ncx + dy ≤ 40\nx, y ≥ 0\nx, y ∈ Z\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we would need the values of a, b, c, and d, which represent the time and workers required to produce each type of device. Once we have these values, we can use mixed-integer programming techniques (such as branch and bound or cutting plane methods) to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit function P(x, y) while satisfying the constraints."
