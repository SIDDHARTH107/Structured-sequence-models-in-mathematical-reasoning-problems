    "message_2": "To find the probability of the disease affecting the population, we need to calculate the number of affected males and females and then divide that by the total population.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of affected males:\nNumber of affected males = (15% of 250 males) = 0.15 * 250 = 37.5\nSince we cannot have half a person, we will round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we will round down to 37 affected males.\n\nNext, let's find the number of affected females:\nNumber of affected females = (10% of 250 females) = 0.10 * 250 = 25\n\nNow, let's find the total number of affected individuals:\nTotal affected individuals = affected males + affected females = 37 + 25 = 62\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of the disease affecting the population:\nProbability = (Total affected individuals) / (Total population) = 62 / 500 = 0.124\n\nSo, the probability of the disease affecting the population is 0.124 or 12.4%."
