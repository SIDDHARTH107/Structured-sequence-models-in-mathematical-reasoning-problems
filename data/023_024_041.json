    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to compute the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nSince f(x) = 2 for x < π and f(x) = 1 for x > π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * [∫(2 dx) from 0 to π + ∫(1 dx) from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * [2x | from 0 to π + x | from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * [(2π - 0) + (2π - π)]\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * (3π)\n\na_0 = 3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [∫(2 * cos(nx) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(1 * cos(nx) dx) from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(2 / n) * sin(nx) | from 0 to π + (1 / n) * sin(nx) | from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(2 / n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0)) + (1 / n) * (sin(2nπ) - sin(nπ))]\n\nSince sin(nπ) and sin(2nπ) are both 0 for integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nSplitting the integral:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫(2 * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π + ∫(1 * sin(nx) dx) from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-2 / n) * cos(nx) | from 0 to π + (-1 / n) * cos(nx) | from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-2 / n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(0)) + (-1 / n) * (cos(2nπ) - cos(nπ))]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-2 / n) * (-1)^n + (1 / n) * (1 - (-1)^n)]\n\nNow, we have all the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 3 + Σ [0 * cos(nx) + ((-2 / n) * (-1)^n + (1 / n) * (1 - (-1)^n)) * sin(nx)]\n\nf(x) = 3 + Σ [((-2 / n) * (-1)^n + (1 / n) * (1 - (-1)^n)) * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
