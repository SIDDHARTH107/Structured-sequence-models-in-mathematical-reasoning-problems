    "message_2": "To calculate the secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = α^a mod p, where α = 3, a = 5, and p = 17.\n2. Bob computes B = α^b mod p, where α = 3, b = 11, and p = 17.\n3. Alice computes the secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If the protocol is executed correctly, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nLet's compute the values:\n\n1. A = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 15\n2. B = 3^11 mod 17 = 177147 mod 17 = 6\n3. K_A = 6^5 mod 17 = 7776 mod 17 = 10\n4. K_B = 15^11 mod 17 = 576650390625 mod 17 = 10\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 10."
