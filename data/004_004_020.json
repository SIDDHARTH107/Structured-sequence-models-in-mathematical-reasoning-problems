    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 2x + 3 in the interval [0, 3] using integration, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 2x + 3. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\n∫(x^2 + 2x + 3) dx\n\nTo integrate, we apply the power rule, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1):\n\n∫(x^2) dx + ∫(2x) dx + ∫(3) dx\n\n= (x^(2+1))/(2+1) + 2(x^(1+1))/(1+1) + 3(x^(0+1))/(0+1) + C\n\n= (x^3)/3 + x^2 + 3x + C\n\nNow we need to evaluate this integral at the limits 0 and 3:\n\n[(3^3)/3 + (3^2) + 3(3)] - [(0^3)/3 + (0^2) + 3(0)]\n\n= [(27/3) + 9 + 9] - [0]\n\n= [9 + 9 + 9] - [0]\n\n= 27\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 2x + 3 in the interval [0, 3] is 27 square units."
