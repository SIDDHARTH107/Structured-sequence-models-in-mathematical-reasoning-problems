    "message_2": "The given modal logic formula is valid. To demonstrate this, we will use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume the formula is not valid, which means there exists a counterexample where ◊(p → q) is true, but (◊p → ◊q) is false. For (◊p → ◊q) to be false, ◊p must be true, and ◊q must be false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth of ◊(p → q). Since ◊(p → q) is true, there exists a possible world where (p → q) is true. In this world, either p is false, or both p and q are true.\n\nHowever, we know that ◊p is true, which means there exists a possible world where p is true. If we consider this world, then q must also be true in this world, as (p → q) is true in all possible worlds where p is true.\n\nBut this contradicts our initial assumption that ◊q is false, as we have found a possible world where q is true. Therefore, our assumption that the formula is not valid must be incorrect, and the formula ◊(p → q) → (◊p → ◊q) is indeed valid."
