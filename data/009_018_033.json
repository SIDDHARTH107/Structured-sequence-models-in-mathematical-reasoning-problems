    "message_2": "1. To find the general solution of the given nonlinear differential equation y' = x^2 * y^2, we first rewrite it as a separable equation:\n\ndy/dx = x^2 * y^2\n\nNow, we separate the variables:\n\ndy/y^2 = x^2 dx\n\nNext, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y^2) dy = ∫x^2 dx\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we get:\n\n-1/y = (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we solve for y:\n\ny = -1/((1/3)x^3 + C)\n\nThis is the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n2. To determine the particular solution using the initial condition y(0) = 1, we plug in x = 0 and y = 1 into the general solution:\n\n1 = -1/((1/3)(0)^3 + C)\n\n1 = -1/C\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, we substitute this value of C back into the general solution:\n\ny = -1/((1/3)x^3 - 1)\n\nThis is the particular solution of the given differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1.\n\n3. To plot the solution curve for the differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1, you can use a graphing utility like Desmos, GeoGebra, or WolframAlpha. Input the particular solution:\n\ny = -1/((1/3)x^3 - 1)\n\nThe graph will show the solution curve for the given differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1."
