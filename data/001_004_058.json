    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 3x^2 + 12x + 9, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. The GCF of 3x^2, 12x, and 9 is 3. We can factor out the GCF:\n\n3(x^2 + 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (3) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (4). The numbers 3 and 1 fit these criteria:\n\n3(x^2 + 4x + 3) = 3(x + 3)(x + 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 3x^2 + 12x + 9 is 3(x + 3)(x + 1)."
