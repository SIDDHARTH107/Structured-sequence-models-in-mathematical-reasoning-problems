    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [2-λ 1; 1 2-λ]\n\nThe determinant of A - λI is:\n\n(2-λ)(2-λ) - 1*1 = λ^2 - 4λ + 4 - 1 = λ^2 - 4λ + 3\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 4λ + 3 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as:\n\n(λ - 3)(λ - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([2-3 1; 1 2-3] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n([-1 1; 1 -1] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get -x1 + x2 = 0, which implies x1 = x2. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = 1. So, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 3 is [1; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 1:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([2-1 1; 1 2-1] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n([1 1; 1 1] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get x1 + x2 = 0, which implies x1 = -x2. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = -1. So, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = 1 is [1; -1].\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues of matrix A are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 1, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [1; 1] and v2 = [1; -1]."
