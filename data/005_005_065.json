Assuming that the length of the bolts follows a normal distribution, what is the probability that a randomly selected bolt has a length between 6.1 cm and 6.6 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected bolt has a length between 6.1 cm and 6.6 cm, we will use the Z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nFirst, we need to know the mean length of the bolts (μ). Let's assume the mean length is given as μ.\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere Z is the Z-score, X is the length of the bolt, μ is the mean length, and σ is the standard deviation (0.5 cm).\n\nWe will calculate the Z-scores for both 6.1 cm and 6.6 cm.\n\nZ1 = (6.1 - μ) / 0.5\nZ2 = (6.6 - μ) / 0.5\n\nNow, we will look up the Z-scores in the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities.\n\nP(Z1) = Probability of a bolt having a length less than or equal to 6.1 cm\nP(Z2) = Probability of a bolt having a length less than or equal to 6.6 cm\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected bolt has a length between 6.1 cm and 6.6 cm is the difference between P(Z2) and P(Z1).\n\nP(6.1 cm < X < 6.6 cm) = P(Z2) - P(Z1)\n\nWithout the mean length (μ), we cannot provide a numerical probability. If you provide the mean length, we can calculate the exact probability."
