    "message_2": "To find the smallest value of c such that the complex function f(z) = z^2 + c enters an infinite loop when starting at z=0, we need to find the value of c for which the function does not diverge.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z=0. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is where the function starts to diverge.\n\nFor the function to enter an infinite loop, it must reach a fixed point or a periodic cycle. A fixed point is a value of z such that f(z) = z. Let's find the fixed points of the function:\n\nz = z^2 + c\nz - z^2 = c\nz(1 - z) = c\n\nThere are two fixed points: z = 0 and z = 1.\n\nWhen z = 0, the function is at the starting point, and we have c = 0(1 - 0) = 0. However, this is not the smallest value of c on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nWhen z = 1, we have c = 1(1 - 1) = 0. This is a degenerate case, as the function will not enter an infinite loop.\n\nTo find the smallest value of c on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, we need to look for a periodic cycle. The simplest periodic cycle is a 2-cycle, where the function returns to its starting value after two iterations.\n\nLet's find the value of c for which f(f(z)) = z:\n\nf(f(z)) = (z^2 + c)^2 + c = z\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\nz^4 + 2cz^2 + c^2 + c = z\nz^4 + 2cz^2 + c^2 + c - z = 0\n\nSince we start at z = 0:\n\n0^4 + 2c(0)^2 + c^2 + c - 0 = 0\nc^2 + c = 0\n\nFactoring:\n\nc(c + 1) = 0\n\nThere are two solutions: c = 0 and c = -1.\n\nAs we already discussed, c = 0 is not the smallest value on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Therefore, the smallest value of c such that the complex function f(z) = z^2 + c enters an infinite loop when starting at z=0 is c = -1."
