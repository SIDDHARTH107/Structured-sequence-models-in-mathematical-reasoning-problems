    "message_2": "The problem states that there are three factors accounting for 60%, 30%, and 10% of the total variance. To calculate the proportion of the total variance accounted for by each factor, we simply need to convert these percentages into decimal form.\n\nFactor 1: 60% = 0.60\nFactor 2: 30% = 0.30\nFactor 3: 10% = 0.10\n\nNow, we have the proportions of the total variance accounted for by each factor:\n\nFactor 1: 0.60\nFactor 2: 0.30\nFactor 3: 0.10"
