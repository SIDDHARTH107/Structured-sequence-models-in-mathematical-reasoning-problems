    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the triangle is a right triangle. If it is, we can use trigonometry to find the perimeter.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Let's check if this holds for the given triangle:\n\n6² + 8² = 10²\n36 + 64 = 100\n100 = 100\n\nSince the equation holds true, the triangle is a right triangle with sides 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm.\n\nNow, let's use trigonometry to find the perimeter. Since the triangle is a right triangle, we can use the sine, cosine, and tangent functions to find the angles. Let's find the angle θ between the 6 cm and 10 cm sides:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = 6 / 10\nθ = arcsin(0.6)\n\nNow, let's find the angle φ between the 8 cm and 10 cm sides:\n\ncos(φ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(φ) = 8 / 10\nφ = arccos(0.8)\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, the third angle is 90 degrees (π/2 radians). Now that we have all the angles and side lengths, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = side 1 + side 2 + side 3\nPerimeter = 6 cm + 8 cm + 10 cm\nPerimeter = 24 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm."
