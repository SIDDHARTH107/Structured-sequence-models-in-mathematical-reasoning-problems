    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can first use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. We have:\n\nlog(x^2 - 4) - log(x - 2) = 2\n\nUsing the quotient rule for logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog((x^2 - 4)/(x - 2)) = 2\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the base 10:\n\n10^log((x^2 - 4)/(x - 2)) = 10^2\n\n(x^2 - 4)/(x - 2) = 100\n\nNext, we can factor the numerator of the fraction:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 2)/(x - 2) = 100\n\nSince (x - 2) is in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out, leaving:\n\nx + 2 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 100 - 2\nx = 98\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 98."
