    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of X with respect to Y, we first need to compute the Lie bracket [X, Y]. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n[X, Y] = XY - YX\n\nwhere XY and YX are the actions of the vector fields X and Y on each other. In this case, we have:\n\nX = x∂/∂x + y^2∂/∂y\nY = x^2∂/∂x + 2xy∂/∂y\n\nNow, we compute XY and YX:\n\nXY = (x∂/∂x + y^2∂/∂y)(x^2∂/∂x + 2xy∂/∂y)\n   = x(x^2∂/∂x) + x(2xy∂/∂y) + y^2(x^2∂/∂x) + y^2(2xy∂/∂y)\n   = x^3∂/∂x + 2x^2y∂/∂y + x^2y^2∂/∂x + 2x^2y^3∂/∂y\n\nYX = (x^2∂/∂x + 2xy∂/∂y)(x∂/∂x + y^2∂/∂y)\n   = x^2(x∂/∂x) + x^2(y^2∂/∂y) + 2xy(x∂/∂x) + 2xy(y^2∂/∂y)\n   = x^3∂/∂x + x^2y^2∂/∂y + 2x^2y∂/∂x + 2x^2y^3∂/∂y\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket [X, Y] = XY - YX:\n\n[X, Y] = (x^3∂/∂x + 2x^2y∂/∂y + x^2y^2∂/∂x + 2x^2y^3∂/∂y) - (x^3∂/∂x + x^2y^2∂/∂y + 2x^2y∂/∂x + 2x^2y^3∂/∂y)\n       = (x^3 - x^3)∂/∂x + (2x^2y - 2x^2y)∂/∂y + (x^2y^2 - x^2y^2)∂/∂x + (2x^2y^3 - 2x^2y^3)∂/∂y\n       = 0\n\nSo, the Lie bracket [X, Y] is zero. This means that the Lie derivative of X with respect to Y is also zero at any point, including the point (1, 1)."
