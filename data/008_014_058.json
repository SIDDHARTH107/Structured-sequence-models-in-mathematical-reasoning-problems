    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |      x = | x |      b = |  6  |\n    | 2  1 -1 |          | y |          |  1  |\n    | 3  4  1 |          | z |          | 13  |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process where matrix A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition algorithm (such as Gram-Schmidt, Householder, or Givens rotations), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.2673  -0.8729  -0.4082 |\n    | -0.5345  -0.2182   0.8165 |\n    | -0.8018   0.4364  -0.4082 |\n\nR = | -3.7417  -3.7417  -0.2673 |\n    |  0       2.9277   1.3093 |\n    |  0       0       1.6329 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nFirst, we compute Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.2673  -0.5345  -0.8018 |  |  6  |\n       | -0.8729  -0.2182   0.4364 |  |  1  |\n       | -0.4082   0.8165  -0.4082 |  | 13  |\n\nQ^Tb = | -9.8018 |\n       | -4.6541 |\n       |  5.4082 |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = | -3.7417  -3.7417  -0.2673 |  x = | x |  Q^Tb = | -9.8018 |\n    |  0       2.9277   1.3093 |      | y |          | -4.6541 |\n    |  0       0       1.6329 |      | z |          |  5.4082 |\n\nFrom the third row of R, we have:\n1.6329z = 5.4082\nz = 5.4082 / 1.6329\nz ≈ 3.31\n\nFrom the second row of R, we have:\n2.9277y + 1.3093(3.31) = -4.6541\ny ≈ -2.15\n\nFrom the first row of R, we have:\n-3.7417x - 3.7417(-2.15) - 0.2673(3.31) = -9.8018\nx ≈ 1.84\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\nx ≈ 1.84\ny ≈ -2.15\nz ≈ 3.31"
