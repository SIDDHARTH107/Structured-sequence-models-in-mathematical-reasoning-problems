    "message_2": "The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is given as 4 units.\n\nA = π(4)²\nA = π(16)\nA = 16π\n\nThe area of the largest circular component in the Mandelbrot set with a radius of 4 units is 16π square units."
