    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', consists of all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the integers from 1 to 10: U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of set A by identifying the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement of set A is unique. To do this, let's assume there is another set B that is also a complement of set A. This means that B contains all the elements in U that are not in A, just like A'.\n\nSince both A' and B are complements of A, they must have the same elements. If there is any element in A' that is not in B, or vice versa, then they cannot both be complements of A. However, we have already established that A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A, so B must also contain these same elements.\n\nTherefore, A' = B, and the complement of set A is unique."
