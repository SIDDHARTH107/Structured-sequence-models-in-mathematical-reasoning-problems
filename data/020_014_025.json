    "message_1": "Suppose you are the owner of a small bakery that produces two types of cakes: chocolate and vanilla. On a given day, you have 9 pounds of flour, 7 pounds of sugar, and 5 pounds of cocoa powder at your disposal. A chocolate cake requires 2 pounds of flour, 2 pounds of sugar, and 1 pound of cocoa powder, while a vanilla cake requires 1 pound of flour, 2 pounds of sugar, and no cocoa powder. If you want to maximize the total profit from selling these cakes, where the profit from a chocolate cake is $4 and the profit from a vanilla cake is $3, how many of each cake should you make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes.\n\nWe have the following constraints based on the available ingredients:\n\n1. Flour constraint: 2x + y <= 9\n2. Sugar constraint: 2x + 2y <= 7\n3. Cocoa powder constraint: x <= 5\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 4x + 3y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the sugar constraint by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + y <= 3.5\n\nSince x and y must be integers (you can't make a fraction of a cake), we can rewrite this constraint as:\n\nx + y <= 3\n\nNow, we can list the possible combinations of x and y that satisfy the constraints:\n\n(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0)\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit for each combination:\n\nP(0, 0) = 0\nP(0, 1) = 3\nP(0, 2) = 6\nP(0, 3) = 9\nP(1, 0) = 4\nP(1, 1) = 7\nP(1, 2) = 10\nP(2, 0) = 8\nP(2, 1) = 11\nP(3, 0) = 12\n\nThe maximum profit is $12, which can be achieved by making 3 chocolate cakes and 0 vanilla cakes."
