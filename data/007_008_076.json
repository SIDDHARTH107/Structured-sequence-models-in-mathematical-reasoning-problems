    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the remainder when 7^13 is divided by 17. Since 17 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem with a = 7 and p = 17. According to the theorem, we have:\n\n7^(17-1) ≡ 7^16 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we want to find 7^13 (mod 17). We can rewrite 7^13 as:\n\n7^13 = 7^(16-3) = 7^16 * 7^(-3)\n\nSince we know that 7^16 ≡ 1 (mod 17), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n7^13 ≡ 1 * 7^(-3) (mod 17)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 7^3 (mod 17). We can use the fact that 7^16 ≡ 1 (mod 17) to find the inverse:\n\n7^(-3) ≡ 7^(16-3) ≡ 7^13 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the equation:\n\n7^13 ≡ 1 * 7^13 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^13 is divided by 17 is 7^13 (mod 17)."
