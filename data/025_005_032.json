    "message_2": "To find the singular locus of the hypersurface defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{C}^4$, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to each variable simultaneously vanish. \n\nLet $f(x, y, z, w) = x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4$. We compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 4x^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 4y^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 4z^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial w} = 4w^3$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z, w)$ where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$4x^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$4y^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\n$4z^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 0$\n\n$4w^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow w = 0$\n\nThe only point that satisfies all these conditions is the origin $(0, 0, 0, 0)$. Therefore, the singular locus of the hypersurface defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{C}^4$ is the point $(0, 0, 0, 0)$."
