The company collects the following data:\n\n| Hours Worked | Productivity Level |\n|--------------|--------------------|\n|       5      |        80          |\n|       7      |        90          |\n|       4      |        75          |\n|       8      |       100         |\n\nUsing simple linear regression analysis, what is the equation of the regression line that describes the relationship between hours worked and productivity level?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we first need to calculate the mean of the hours worked (x) and the mean of the productivity levels (y). Then, we'll calculate the slope (b1) and the y-intercept (b0) of the regression line.\n\nMean of hours worked (x̄):\n(5 + 7 + 4 + 8) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6\n\nMean of productivity levels (ȳ):\n(80 + 90 + 75 + 100) / 4 = 345 / 4 = 86.25\n\nNow, we'll calculate the slope (b1) using the formula:\n\nb1 = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nFor each data point, we'll calculate (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) and (xi - x̄)^2:\n\n| Hours Worked | Productivity Level | xi - x̄ | yi - ȳ | (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) | (xi - x̄)^2 |\n|--------------|--------------------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|\n|       5      |        80          |  -1    | -6.25  |       6.25      |     1      |\n|       7      |        90          |   1    |  3.75  |       3.75      |     1      |\n|       4      |        75          |  -2    | -11.25 |      22.5       |     4      |\n|       8      |       100         |   2    |  13.75 |      27.5       |     4      |\n\nNow, we'll sum the last two columns:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) = 6.25 + 3.75 + 22.5 + 27.5 = 60\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b1):\n\nb1 = 60 / 10 = 6\n\nNext, we'll calculate the y-intercept (b0) using the formula:\n\nb0 = ȳ - b1 * x̄\n\nb0 = 86.25 - 6 * 6 = 86.25 - 36 = 50.25\n\nNow, we have the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = b0 + b1 * x\ny = 50.25 + 6 * x\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line that describes the relationship between hours worked and productivity level is:\n\ny = 50.25 + 6x"
