    "message_2": "To find the value of theta for which cos(theta) = -0.5, we can first consider the angles in degrees. The cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants. The reference angle for which cos(theta) = 0.5 is 60 degrees. Therefore, the angles in degrees are:\n\nTheta = 180 - 60 = 120 degrees (second quadrant)\nTheta = 180 + 60 = 240 degrees (third quadrant)\n\nNow, let's convert these angles to radians. We know that 180 degrees = π radians. So, we can use the conversion factor (π/180) to convert the angles to radians:\n\nTheta = 120 * (π/180) = (2/3)π radians (second quadrant)\nTheta = 240 * (π/180) = (4/3)π radians (third quadrant)\n\nSo, the values of theta for which cos(theta) = -0.5 are 120 degrees (or (2/3)π radians) and 240 degrees (or (4/3)π radians)."
