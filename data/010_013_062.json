Let $\\pi : E \\rightarrow X$ be the projection map. If $U$ and $V$ are two open sets in $X$, with $U\\cap V \\neq \\varnothing$, let $f$ and $g$ be two continuous functions that satisfy $f|_{U\\cap V} = g|_{U\\cap V}$. \n\nProve that there exists a continuous section $s: X \\rightarrow E$ such that $s(x) \\in \\pi^{-1}(x)$ and $s(x)|_U = f(x)$ and $s(x)|_V = g(x)$.",
    "message_2": "To prove the existence of such a continuous section $s$, we will define $s$ on $U$ and $V$ separately and then show that it is continuous on their intersection.\n\nDefine $s: X \\rightarrow E$ as follows:\n\n$$\ns(x) = \\begin{cases}\nf(x) & \\text{if } x \\in U \\\\\ng(x) & \\text{if } x \\in V\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNote that $s(x) \\in \\pi^{-1}(x)$ for all $x \\in X$, since both $f$ and $g$ map into the fibers of $E$.\n\nNow we need to show that $s$ is continuous. Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $U$ and $V$ respectively, it suffices to show that $s$ is continuous on $U \\cap V$. \n\nLet $x \\in U \\cap V$. Since $f|_{U\\cap V} = g|_{U\\cap V}$, we have $f(x) = g(x)$. Thus, $s(x) = f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in U \\cap V$. \n\nLet $W$ be an open neighborhood of $s(x)$ in $E$. Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous, there exist open neighborhoods $U_f$ and $U_g$ of $x$ in $U$ and $V$ respectively such that $f(U_f) \\subseteq W$ and $g(U_g) \\subseteq W$. Let $U_x = U_f \\cap U_g \\cap (U \\cap V)$. Then $U_x$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $U \\cap V$. \n\nFor any $y \\in U_x$, we have $y \\in U_f$ and $y \\in U_g$. Thus, $s(y) = f(y) \\in W$ and $s(y) = g(y) \\in W$. Therefore, $s(U_x) \\subseteq W$. This shows that $s$ is continuous at $x$. Since $x \\in U \\cap V$ was arbitrary, $s$ is continuous on $U \\cap V$.\n\nHence, $s$ is a continuous section of $E$ such that $s(x)|_U = f(x)$ and $s(x)|_V = g(x)$."
