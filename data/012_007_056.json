You need to find the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node E in this network.\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/Is4D911.png)",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph.\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's start with the first iteration:\n\nAugmenting path: A -> B -> D -> E\nFlow: min(5, 2, 5) = 2\n\nUpdate the residual capacities:\nAB: 3, AC: 3, BC: 2, BD: 0, CD: 4, CE: 3, DE: 3, EB: 2\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nAugmenting path: A -> C -> D -> E\nFlow: min(3, 4, 3) = 3\n\nUpdate the residual capacities:\nAB: 3, AC: 0, BC: 2, BD: 0, CD: 1, CE: 3, DE: 0, EA: 3, EC: 1\n\nThird iteration:\n\nAugmenting path: A -> B -> C -> E\nFlow: min(3, 2, 3) = 2\n\nUpdate the residual capacities:\nAB: 1, AC: 0, BA: 2, BC: 0, BD: 0, CD: 1, CE: 1, DE: 0, EA: 3, EC: 3\n\nNo more augmenting paths can be found. The maximum flow from node A to node E is the sum of the flows found in each iteration: 2 + 3 + 2 = 7."
