    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the intersection between A and the resulting set. Next, find the symmetric difference of B and A, followed by the intersection between B and the resulting set. Show that these two intersections are not equal, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection between A and the resulting set (A ∆ B).\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 2}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B ∆ A is the same as A ∆ B.\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection between B and the resulting set (B ∆ A).\n\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = {5}\n\nAs we can see, the two intersections are not equal:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1, 2} ≠ {5} = B ∩ (B ∆ A)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
