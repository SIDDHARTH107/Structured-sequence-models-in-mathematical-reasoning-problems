    "message_2": "Given that M is a closed 3-dimensional manifold with a fundamental group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 4, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem and Poincaré Duality to determine the homology groups H_i(M;Z) for i = 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1. H_0(M;Z): The 0th homology group represents the number of connected components of the manifold. Since M is a closed 3-manifold, it is connected, and thus H_0(M;Z) = Z.\n\n2. H_1(M;Z): The 1st homology group is isomorphic to the abelianization of the fundamental group. The fundamental group of M is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 4, which is already abelian. Therefore, H_1(M;Z) = Z_4.\n\n3. H_2(M;Z): Using the Universal Coefficient Theorem, we can determine the 2nd homology group. The theorem states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H_1(M;Z), Z) → H_2(M;Z) → Hom(H_2(M;Z), Z) → 0\n\nSince H_1(M;Z) = Z_4, we have Ext(Z_4, Z) = Z_4 and Hom(Z_4, Z) = 0. Therefore, H_2(M;Z) = Z_4.\n\n4. H_3(M;Z): Poincaré Duality states that for a closed, oriented n-dimensional manifold M, the homology groups H_i(M;Z) are isomorphic to the homology groups H_{n-i}(M;Z). Since M is a 3-dimensional manifold, we have:\n\nH_3(M;Z) ≅ H_{3-3}(M;Z) = H_0(M;Z) = Z\n\nIn summary, the homology groups H_i(M;Z) for i = 0, 1, 2, and 3 are:\n\nH_0(M;Z) = Z\nH_1(M;Z) = Z_4\nH_2(M;Z) = Z_4\nH_3(M;Z) = Z"
