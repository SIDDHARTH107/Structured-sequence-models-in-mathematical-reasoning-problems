    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we first need to check if the matrix A is singular or not. A matrix is singular if its determinant is zero. Let's find the determinant of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A is:\n[ 1  3 -2]\n[ 2  6 -4]\n[ 4 12 -8]\n\nThe determinant of A can be calculated as follows:\n\n|A| = 1 * (6 * -8 - (-4) * 12) - 3 * (2 * -8 - (-4) * 4) + (-2) * (2 * 12 - 6 * 4)\n\n|A| = 1 * (0) - 3 * (0) + (-2) * (0)\n\n|A| = 0\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is zero, it is a singular matrix.\n\nNow, let's check if the system of equations has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution. To do this, we can use the rank method. We need to find the rank of matrix A and the augmented matrix [A|b].\n\nMatrix [A|b] is:\n[ 1  3 -2 |  6]\n[ 2  6 -4 | 12]\n[ 4 12 -8 | 24]\n\nWe can perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n[ 1  3 -2 |  6]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0]\n[ 4 12 -8 | 24]\n\nR3 = R3 - 4 * R1\n[ 1  3 -2 |  6]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. The rank of matrix A is the number of non-zero rows, which is 1. The rank of matrix [A|b] is also 1.\n\nSince the rank of matrix A and the augmented matrix [A|b] are equal, the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. The given system of linear equations does not have a unique solution."
