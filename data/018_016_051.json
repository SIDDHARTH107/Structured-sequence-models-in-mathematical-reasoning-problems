However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product itself is commutative. \n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative, we can simply compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, A x B ≠ B x A, which means the Cartesian product is not commutative. The union operation being commutative does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative."
