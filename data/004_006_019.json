    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2 + 24x + 15, we first need to find the derivative of the function, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe derivative of the function f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2 + 24x + 15)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 48x^2 + 36x + 24\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0. This will give us the critical points of the function.\n\n12x^3 - 48x^2 + 36x + 24 = 0\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the entire equation by 12:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. This can be done using various methods, such as factoring, synthetic division, or numerical methods. In this case, we can try factoring by grouping:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x^3 - 4x^2) + (3x + 2)\n\nFactor out the common terms:\n\nx^2(x - 4) + 1(3x + 2) = 0\n\nNow, we have a factored form of the equation:\n\n(x^2 + 1)(x - 4) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\nx^2 + 1 = 0\nx - 4 = 0\n\nFor the first equation, x^2 + 1 = 0, there are no real solutions, as x^2 cannot be negative. For the second equation, x - 4 = 0, we get x = 4.\n\nSo, there is only one critical point for the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2 + 24x + 15, and that is x = 4."
