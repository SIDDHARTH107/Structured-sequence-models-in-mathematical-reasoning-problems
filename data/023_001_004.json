The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]\n\nwhere the coefficients are given by:\n\na₀ = (1/L) ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to L (L is half the period)\naₙ = (2/L) ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from 0 to L\nbₙ = (2/L) ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from 0 to L\n\nFor the given function, the period is 2π, so L = π.\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to π\na₀ = (1/π) [∫[2dx] from 0 to π + ∫[-2dx] from π to 2π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) [2x | from 0 to π - 2x | from π to 2π]\na₀ = (1/π) [(2π - 0) - (4π - 2π)]\na₀ = (1/π) (2π - 2π)\na₀ = 0\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (2/π) ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from 0 to π\naₙ = (2/π) [∫[2cos(nx)dx] from 0 to π + ∫[-2cos(nx)dx] from π to 2π]\n\naₙ = (2/π) [(2/n)sin(nx) | from 0 to π - (2/n)sin(nx) | from π to 2π]\naₙ = (2/π) [(2/n)(sin(nπ) - sin(0)) - (2/n)(sin(2nπ) - sin(nπ))]\naₙ = (2/π) [(2/n)(0) - (2/n)(0)]\naₙ = 0\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from 0 to π\nbₙ = (2/π) [∫[2sin(nx)dx] from 0 to π + ∫[-2sin(nx)dx] from π to 2π]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) [(-2/n)cos(nx) | from 0 to π + (2/n)cos(nx) | from π to 2π]\nbₙ = (2/π) [(-2/n)(cos(nπ) - cos(0)) + (2/n)(cos(2nπ) - cos(nπ))]\n\nFor n is even, cos(nπ) = 1 and cos(2nπ) = 1, so bₙ = 0.\nFor n is odd, cos(nπ) = -1 and cos(2nπ) = 1, so bₙ = (4/nπ).\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(4/nπ)sin(nx)] for odd n\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function."
