    "message_1": "A bird is flying at an altitude of 100 meters. It spots a fish in a pond and wants to catch it. The angle of depression from the bird to the fish is 30 degrees. What is the horizontal distance from the bird to the fish? (Assume the ground is level)",
    "message_2": "To find the horizontal distance from the bird to the fish, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is 30 degrees, and the altitude (opposite side) is 100 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30°) = 100 meters / adjacent side\n\nNow, we need to find the adjacent side (horizontal distance). Rearrange the equation to solve for the adjacent side:\n\nAdjacent side = 100 meters / tan(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nAdjacent side = 100 meters / 0.577 ≈ 173.21 meters\n\nSo, the horizontal distance from the bird to the fish is approximately 173.21 meters."
