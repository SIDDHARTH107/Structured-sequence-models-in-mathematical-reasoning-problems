    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B). Show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs you can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal. However, this does not show that the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union. In fact, the union operation is commutative, which means that A ∪ B = B ∪ A for any sets A and B.\n\nWhat we need to show is that A × B ≠ B × A in general, which would demonstrate that the Cartesian product is not commutative. In this example, we can see that A × B and B × A are not equal:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nSince A × B ≠ B × A, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
