    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is constructed by iteratively subdividing the square into smaller squares and connecting them with line segments.\n\nLet's denote the length of the Peano curve after n iterations as L(n). After the first iteration, the curve consists of 3 line segments, each with a length equal to 1/3 of the side length of the square. So, L(1) = 3 * (1/3) = 1.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the curve is scaled down by a factor of 1/3 and replicated 9 times (since the square is divided into 9 smaller squares). Therefore, the length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated as:\n\nL(n) = 3 * (1/3)^n\n\nNow, we want to find the total length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations:\n\nL(5) = 3 * (1/3)^5 = 3 * (1/243) = 1/81\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations is 1/81."
