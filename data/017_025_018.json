    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor using their exponents.\n   For 2: 1, 2, 3\n   For 3: 1, 3\n   For 5: 1, 5\n3. Calculate the number of groups for each prime factor using the formula: n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where p is the prime factor and k is its exponent.\n   For 2: n_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 15\n   For 3: n_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = 4\n   For 5: n_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1) / (5 - 1) = 6\n4. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: n = (n_p1 * n_p2 * ... * n_pk) / (p1 * p2 * ... * pk)\n   n = (15 * 4 * 6) / (2 * 3 * 5) = 360 / 30 = 12\n\nThere are 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
