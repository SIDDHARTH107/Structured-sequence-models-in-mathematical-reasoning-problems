    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(3x - 2)(3) = (x + 5)(4)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n9x - 6 = 4x + 20\n\nNext, move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n9x - 4x = 20 + 6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5x = 26\n\nFinally, divide by 5 to isolate x:\n\nx = 26/5"
