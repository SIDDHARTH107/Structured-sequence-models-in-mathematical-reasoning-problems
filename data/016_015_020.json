    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The total length of a Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * a\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve, and a is the length of the sides of the initial square.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, we have n = 3. Assuming the length of the sides of the initial square is 1 unit (a = 1), we can calculate the total length as follows:\n\nLength = (2^3 - 1) * 1\nLength = (8 - 1) * 1\nLength = 7 * 1\nLength = 7 units\n\nSo, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order 3 is 7 units."
