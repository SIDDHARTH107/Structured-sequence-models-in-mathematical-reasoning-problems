    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Morse-Smale complexes:\n\nConsider a Morse function on a compact 3-manifold with two critical points, one maximum and one minimum. The descending manifold of the maximum intersects the ascending manifold of the minimum in a one-dimensional submanifold, and all other intersection points are isolated. Find the homology group of the Morse-Smale complex associated to this function.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the maximum critical point as p and the minimum critical point as q. Since there are only two critical points, the Morse inequalities imply that the Betti numbers of the 3-manifold are given by:\n\nb_0 = b_3 = 1, b_1 = b_2 = 0.\n\nNow, let's construct the Morse-Smale complex. The descending manifold of p and the ascending manifold of q intersect in a one-dimensional submanifold. This means that there is a single 1-cell in the Morse-Smale complex connecting p and q. \n\nThe Morse-Smale complex has the following structure:\n\n0-cells: {p, q}\n1-cells: {e}, where e is the 1-cell connecting p and q\n2-cells: {}\n3-cells: {}\n\nNow, we can compute the homology groups of the Morse-Smale complex using the standard techniques of algebraic topology. \n\nH_0: Since there are two 0-cells, the 0-th homology group is generated by two elements. However, since there is a 1-cell connecting p and q, these two generators are homologous, and H_0 is isomorphic to Z (the integers).\n\nH_1: There is only one 1-cell, and no 2-cells, so H_1 is isomorphic to Z.\n\nH_2: There are no 2-cells or 3-cells, so H_2 is trivial (isomorphic to the trivial group).\n\nH_3: There are no 3-cells, so H_3 is trivial (isomorphic to the trivial group).\n\nThus, the homology groups of the Morse-Smale complex are:\n\nH_0 ≅ Z\nH_1 ≅ Z\nH_2 ≅ 0\nH_3 ≅ 0"
