    "message_2": "A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in a graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in a graph.\n\nLet's denote the cut vertices as A and B, and the bridge as the edge connecting vertices C and D. Since there are six vertices, we have two more vertices, E and F.\n\nNow, let's analyze the graph:\n\n1. A and B are cut vertices, so they must be connected to at least one other vertex.\n2. The bridge connects C and D, so they are not connected to any other vertices.\n\nWe can construct the graph as follows:\n\nA - E - B\n|       |\nC - D\n\nIn this graph, there are six vertices and six edges. We have two cut vertices (A and B) and one bridge (the edge connecting C and D).\n\nNow, let's remove the cut vertices A and B:\n\nE\n|\nC - D\n\nAfter removing the cut vertices, we have two connected components: {E} and {C, D}. Therefore, there are 2 connected components in the graph after removing the cut vertices."
