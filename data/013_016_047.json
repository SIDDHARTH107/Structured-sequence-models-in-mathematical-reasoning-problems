    "message_1": "Suppose that two players are considering entering into a partnership to start a business venture. Player 1 has a choice of either putting in high effort (H) or low effort (L) and player 2 has a choice of investing a lot of money (A) or investing a little money (B). The possible outcomes and payoffs are as follows: \n\n- If both players choose H and A, they will make a profit of $100,000 each. \n- If both players choose H and B, they will make a profit of $75,000 each. \n- If player 1 chooses L and player 2 chooses A, they will make a profit of $110,000 and $0 respectively. \n- If player 1 chooses L and player 2 chooses B, they will make a profit of $90,000 and $10,000 respectively. \n\nIf player 1 expects player 2 to choose A, what effort should player 1 choose to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "If player 1 expects player 2 to choose A, then player 1 should choose low effort (L) to maximize their expected profit. This is because, with player 2 choosing A, the possible outcomes for player 1 are:\n\n- If player 1 chooses H and player 2 chooses A, player 1's profit is $100,000.\n- If player 1 chooses L and player 2 chooses A, player 1's profit is $110,000.\n\nSince $110,000 is greater than $100,000, player 1 should choose low effort (L) to maximize their expected profit when they expect player 2 to choose A."
