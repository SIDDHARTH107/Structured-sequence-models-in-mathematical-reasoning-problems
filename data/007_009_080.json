    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nTo find φ(63), we first need to find the prime factors of 63. The prime factorization of 63 is 3^2 * 7^1.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor φ(63):\n\nφ(63) = 63 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/7)\nφ(63) = 63 * (2/3) * (6/7)\nφ(63) = 63 * (2 * 6) / (3 * 7)\nφ(63) = 63 * 12 / 21\nφ(63) = 3 * 12\nφ(63) = 36\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(63) is 36."
