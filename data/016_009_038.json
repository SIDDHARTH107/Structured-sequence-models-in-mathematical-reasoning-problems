    "message_2": "A dragon curve is a fractal pattern formed by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to create a series of turns. The length of a dragon curve at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial segment length) * (2^(Level/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length (level-0) is 1, and we want to find the length of a level-15 dragon curve. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(15/2))\n\nLength = 1 * (2^7.5)\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2^15))\n\nLength = sqrt(2^15)\n\nLength â‰ˆ 181.019\n\nSo, the length of a level-15 dragon curve is approximately 181.019 units."
