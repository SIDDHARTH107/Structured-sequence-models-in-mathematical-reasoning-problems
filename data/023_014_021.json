Evaluate the integral between -∞ and ∞ and express your answer in terms of the momentum space wavefunction ψ(p).",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the wavefunction f(x) = Ae^(-|x|/a), we first need to define the Fourier transform:\n\nψ(p) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[f(x) * e^(-ipx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to ∞.\n\nSince f(x) = Ae^(-|x|/a), we need to split the integral into two parts, one for x < 0 and one for x > 0:\n\nψ(p) = (1/√(2π)) [∫[Ae^(x/a) * e^(-ipx)] dx + ∫[Ae^(-x/a) * e^(-ipx)] dx], where the first integral is taken from -∞ to 0 and the second integral is taken from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can integrate each part separately:\n\n∫[Ae^(x/a) * e^(-ipx)] dx = A ∫[e^((1/a - ip)x)] dx = A[((1/a - ip)^(-1)) * e^((1/a - ip)x)] evaluated from -∞ to 0.\n\n∫[Ae^(-x/a) * e^(-ipx)] dx = A ∫[e^((-1/a - ip)x)] dx = A[((-1/a - ip)^(-1)) * e^((-1/a - ip)x)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals at their limits:\n\nA[((1/a - ip)^(-1)) * e^((1/a - ip)x)] evaluated from -∞ to 0 = A(1/a - ip).\n\nA[((-1/a - ip)^(-1)) * e^((-1/a - ip)x)] evaluated from 0 to ∞ = A(-1/a - ip).\n\nNow, we can add these two results together:\n\nψ(p) = (1/√(2π)) [A(1/a - ip) + A(-1/a - ip)].\n\nFinally, we can factor out the A and simplify the expression:\n\nψ(p) = (A/√(2π)) [(1 - ipa) / (a^2 * (1 + p^2 * a^2))].\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the wavefunction f(x) = Ae^(-|x|/a) is given by:\n\nψ(p) = (A/√(2π)) [(1 - ipa) / (a^2 * (1 + p^2 * a^2))]."
