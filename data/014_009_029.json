    "message_2": "A Feistel cipher is a symmetric key block cipher that operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and produces fixed-size blocks of ciphertext. To compute the ciphertext for the given plaintext and key, we need to know the number of rounds and the specific round functions used in the Feistel cipher. However, since this information is not provided, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext.\n\nIn general, a Feistel cipher works as follows:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext block into two equal halves, L0 and R0.\n2. For each round i (from 1 to n, where n is the number of rounds):\n   a. Compute the round function F(Ri-1, Ki), where Ki is the round key derived from the main key.\n   b. Update the left half: Li = Ri-1\n   c. Update the right half: Ri = Li-1 âŠ• F(Ri-1, Ki)\n3. Combine the final left and right halves (Ln, Rn) to form the ciphertext block.\n\nWithout the specific round functions and the number of rounds, it is impossible to compute the ciphertext for the given plaintext and key."
