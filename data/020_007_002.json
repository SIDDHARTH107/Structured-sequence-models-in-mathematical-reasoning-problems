    "message_1": "A toy manufacturer has to make a set of 5 stuffed animals using different types of fabric. They have 10 types of fabric to choose from, but only enough of each fabric to make one animal. They want to choose the fabrics to minimize the sum of the distances between the colors of adjacent animals. \n\nWhat combination of fabrics should the manufacturer use to minimize the total color distance between each adjacent animal?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total color distance between each adjacent animal, the manufacturer should choose fabrics with colors that are as close as possible to each other in terms of color distance. Since there are 10 types of fabric to choose from, we need to find the combination of 5 fabrics that have the smallest color distances between them.\n\nLet's represent the 10 fabric colors as points on a line, with their positions corresponding to their color distances. We can label these points as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J, in increasing order of color distance.\n\nTo minimize the sum of the distances between the colors of adjacent animals, we should choose 5 consecutive points on the line. This is because any other combination would result in a larger total distance between adjacent animals.\n\nThere are 6 possible combinations of 5 consecutive points:\n\n1. A, B, C, D, E\n2. B, C, D, E, F\n3. C, D, E, F, G\n4. D, E, F, G, H\n5. E, F, G, H, I\n6. F, G, H, I, J\n\nTo determine which combination has the smallest total color distance, we can calculate the sum of the distances between adjacent points for each combination:\n\n1. (B-A) + (C-B) + (D-C) + (E-D) = E-A\n2. (C-B) + (D-C) + (E-D) + (F-E) = F-B\n3. (D-C) + (E-D) + (F-E) + (G-F) = G-C\n4. (E-D) + (F-E) + (G-F) + (H-G) = H-D\n5. (F-E) + (G-F) + (H-G) + (I-H) = I-E\n6. (G-F) + (H-G) + (I-H) + (J-I) = J-F\n\nSince the color distances are in increasing order, the smallest total color distance will be the one with the smallest starting point. Therefore, the combination of fabrics that minimizes the total color distance between each adjacent animal is A, B, C, D, and E."
