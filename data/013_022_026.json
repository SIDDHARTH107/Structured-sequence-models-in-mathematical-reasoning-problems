The dictator can choose to keep any amount of the money for themselves and give the rest to the recipient. If the dictator decides to keep x% of the money, what is the maximum amount of money they can give to the recipient?\n\nFor example, if the dictator decides to keep 30% of the money, they would keep $15 and give $35 to the recipient. But if they decided to keep 40% of the money, they could only give $30 to the recipient. The question asks what the maximum amount they can give is for any given percentage they choose to keep.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of money the dictator can give to the recipient, we need to determine the percentage that maximizes the amount given to the recipient. Let's denote the percentage the dictator keeps as x, and the percentage given to the recipient as (1-x). \n\nThe total amount of money is $50, so the amount given to the recipient can be represented as:\n\nAmount given to recipient = 50 * (1-x)\n\nTo find the maximum amount given to the recipient, we need to minimize the percentage the dictator keeps (x). The minimum value for x is 0, which means the dictator keeps 0% of the money.\n\nSo, when x = 0:\n\nAmount given to recipient = 50 * (1-0) = 50 * 1 = $50\n\nThe maximum amount of money the dictator can give to the recipient is $50, which occurs when they choose to keep 0% of the money for themselves."
