    "message_2": "Since we are not given any specific information about the group G, we cannot determine if it is isomorphic to C32, D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. However, we can discuss the possibilities.\n\n1. C32: This is the cyclic group of order 32. If G is generated by a single element, then it would be isomorphic to C32.\n\n2. D16: This is the dihedral group of order 32. If G has the structure of symmetries of a regular 16-gon, then it would be isomorphic to D16.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 32: There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, which are not isomorphic to C32 or D16. These groups have different structures and properties. If G has a structure that matches one of these six non-abelian groups, then it would be isomorphic to that specific group.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the group G, we cannot determine which specific group it is isomorphic to."
