    "message_2": "We can use the concept of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. We want to find the remainder of 7^23 when divided by 13, which can be written as:\n\n7^23 ≡ x (mod 13)\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 7 modulo 13:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n7^3 ≡ 7 * 10 ≡ 70 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n7^4 ≡ 7 * 3 ≡ 21 ≡ 8 (mod 13)\n7^5 ≡ 7 * 8 ≡ 56 ≡ 4 (mod 13)\n7^6 ≡ 7 * 4 ≡ 28 ≡ 2 (mod 13)\n7^7 ≡ 7 * 2 ≡ 14 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nNotice that 7^7 ≡ 1 (mod 13). This means that every 7th power of 7 will be congruent to 1 modulo 13. We can use this property to simplify our problem:\n\n7^23 ≡ 7^(3 * 7 + 2) ≡ (7^7)^3 * 7^2 ≡ 1^3 * 10 ≡ 10 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^23 is divided by 13 is 10."
