    "message_1": "Suppose you are given the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x -5. Use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the equation correct to 3 decimal places, starting with an initial guess of x0 = 2.",
    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the given function, f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. \n\nThe derivative, f'(x), is given by:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson formula iteratively until we reach the desired accuracy of 3 decimal places. The formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with the initial guess x0 = 2.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 2 - ( (2^3 - 2*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 2) )\nx1 = 2 - ( (8 - 4 - 5) / (12 - 2) )\nx1 = 2 - ( -1 / 10 )\nx1 = 2 + 0.1\nx1 = 2.1\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx2 = 2.1 - ( (2.1^3 - 2*2.1 - 5) / (3*(2.1^2) - 2) )\nx2 ≈ 2.094\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - f(x2) / f'(x2)\nx3 = 2.094 - ( (2.094^3 - 2*2.094 - 5) / (3*(2.094^2) - 2) )\nx3 ≈ 2.0946\n\nWe can stop here since the result is accurate to 3 decimal places (2.095). Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 2 is approximately 2.095."
