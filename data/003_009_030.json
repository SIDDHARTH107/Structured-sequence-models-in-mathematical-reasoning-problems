    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the field, we simply need to add the lengths of all three sides. However, since the problem specifically asks to use trigonometry, we can use the Law of Cosines to verify that the given side lengths form a valid triangle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nLet a = 80 meters, b = 50 meters, and c = 60 meters. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle C:\n\n60² = 80² + 50² - 2 * 80 * 50 * cos(C)\n3600 = 6400 + 2500 - 8000 * cos(C)\n3600 = 8900 - 8000 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(C):\n\n8000 * cos(C) = 5300\ncos(C) = 5300 / 8000\ncos(C) ≈ 0.6625\n\nSince the value of cos(C) is between -1 and 1, we can conclude that the given side lengths form a valid triangle. Now, we can find the perimeter by adding the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = 80 + 50 + 60 = 190 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangular field is 190 meters."
