    "message_2": "First, let's correct the second equation by replacing the 7 with the correct value of 6:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 15\n5x + 6y + 6z = 32\n8x + 9y + 10z = 49\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations by multiplying the first equation by suitable constants and subtracting:\n\nMultiply the first equation by -2.5 and add it to the second equation:\n-5x - 7.5y - 10z = -37.5\n5x + 6y + 6z = 32\n-------------------\n-1.5y - 4z = -5.5 (New second equation)\n\nMultiply the first equation by -4 and add it to the third equation:\n-8x - 12y - 16z = -60\n8x + 9y + 10z = 49\n-------------------\n-3y - 6z = -11 (New third equation)\n\nStep 2: Solve the new system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n-1.5y - 4z = -5.5\n-3y - 6z = -11\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\n-1.5y - 3z = -5.5 (New second equation)\n\nSubtract the new second equation from the first equation:\n-1.5y - 4z = -5.5\n1.5y + z = 0\n-------------------\n-3z = -5.5 (New third equation)\n\nStep 3: Solve for z and then y:\n\nz = -5.5 / -3\nz = 11/6\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into the new second equation to find y:\n1.5y + (11/6) = 0\n1.5y = -11/6\ny = -11/9\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find x:\n\n2x + 3(-11/9) + 4(11/6) = 15\n2x - 33/9 + 44/6 = 15\n2x = 15 - 44/6 + 33/9\n2x = 15 - 22/3 + 11/3\n2x = (45 + 11 - 66)/3\n2x = -10/3\nx = -5/3\n\nSo, the best estimate for the solution of the system is x = -5/3, y = -11/9, and z = 11/6."
