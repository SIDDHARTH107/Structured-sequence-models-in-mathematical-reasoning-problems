    "message_2": "To determine the number of different pairs of representatives that can be chosen from the group, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (5) and k is the number of representatives to be chosen (2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2! * 3!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different pairs of representatives that can be chosen from the group."
