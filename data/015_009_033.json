    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) is a measure of the average rate of separation between two initially close trajectories in a dynamical system. The separation (d) between two trajectories after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd(n) = d(0) * e^(λ * n)\n\nwhere d(0) is the initial separation, n is the number of iterations, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nd(0) = 0.1\nλ = 0.5\nn = 100\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd(100) = 0.1 * e^(0.5 * 100)\n\nd(100) = 0.1 * e^50\n\nTo find the approximate separation, we can use a calculator to compute e^50:\n\ne^50 ≈ 5.184705528e+21\n\nNow, we can multiply this by the initial separation:\n\nd(100) ≈ 0.1 * 5.184705528e+21\n\nd(100) ≈ 5.184705528e+20\n\nSo, the approximate separation between the two identical trajectories after 100 iterations is 5.184705528e+20."
