    "message_1": "A region has an average of 30 rainy days in a year. What is the probability that there will be more than 25 rainy days in the region this year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that represents the number of events (in this case, rainy days) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one year). The Poisson distribution is given by the formula:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x events occurring, λ is the average number of events (in this case, 30 rainy days), e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and x! is the factorial of x.\n\nWe want to find the probability of having more than 25 rainy days, which means we need to find the probability of having 26, 27, 28, ..., up to an infinite number of rainy days. To do this, we can find the probability of having 25 or fewer rainy days and then subtract that from 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of having 25 or fewer rainy days:\n\nP(0) + P(1) + P(2) + ... + P(25)\n\nNow, we can calculate the individual probabilities using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-30) * 30^x) / x!\n\nSumming up the probabilities for x = 0 to 25:\n\nP(0 to 25) = Σ [(e^(-30) * 30^x) / x!] for x = 0 to 25\n\nFinally, to find the probability of having more than 25 rainy days, we subtract the probability of having 25 or fewer rainy days from 1:\n\nP(more than 25) = 1 - P(0 to 25)\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using a calculator or software that can handle Poisson distribution calculations. Using such a tool, we find:\n\nP(more than 25) ≈ 0.5753\n\nSo, the probability of having more than 25 rainy days in the region this year is approximately 57.53%."
