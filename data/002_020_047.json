    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the length of the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nFor this problem, we have a radius (r) of 8 cm and a central angle (θ) of 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2π(8)\nL = (1/6) × 16π\nL = 16π/6\nL ≈ 8.37758 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the length of the two radii (each 8 cm) to the arc length:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 2(8)\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 24.37758 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.38 cm."
