    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle ABC, AB = AC = 10 cm. The height BD from the vertex B to the base AC measures 8 cm. What is the length of the base AC?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the point where the height BD intersects the base AC as point D. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, BD is also the median, which means that AD = DC. Let's denote the length of AD as x. Then, the length of the base AC is 2x.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle ABD:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\nWe know that AB = 10 cm, BD = 8 cm, and AD = x. So, we can write the equation as:\n\n10^2 = x^2 + 8^2\n100 = x^2 + 64\nx^2 = 36\nx = 6\n\nSince AD = x = 6 cm, and AC = 2x, the length of the base AC is:\n\nAC = 2 * 6 = 12 cm"
