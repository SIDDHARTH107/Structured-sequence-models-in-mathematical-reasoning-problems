    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star of ω with respect to the metric g, we first need to know the components of the metric tensor g_ij. Since the problem does not provide the metric tensor, we will assume the metric g is the Euclidean metric, which has components g_ij = δ_ij (Kronecker delta). In this case, the volume form is given by:\n\nvol = sqrt(det(g)) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star of ω. In general, for a 2-form ω = ω_ij dx^i ∧ dx^j in 3-dimensional space, the Hodge star is given by:\n\n*ω = (1/2) ε^k_ij ω_ij dx^k\n\nwhere ε^k_ij is the Levi-Civita symbol. In our case, ω = -3x² y² z² dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, so the only non-zero component is ω_12 = -3x² y² z². Therefore, the Hodge star of ω is:\n\n*ω = (1/2) ε^3_12 ω_12 dx^3 = -3x² y² z² dz\n\nNow, we can evaluate *ω at the point (1, 1, -1):\n\n*ω(1, 1, -1) = -3(1)² (1)² (-1)² dz = -3 dz\n\nSo, the Hodge star of ω with respect to the metric g at the point (1, 1, -1) is -3 dz."
