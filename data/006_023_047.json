    "message_1": "A market research firm surveys a random sample of 500 consumers and finds that 140 of them regularly purchase a new smartphone every year. Calculate the probability of a randomly chosen consumer to purchase a new smartphone in a year from this market.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a randomly chosen consumer purchasing a new smartphone in a year, we need to divide the number of consumers who regularly purchase a new smartphone by the total number of consumers surveyed.\n\nNumber of consumers who regularly purchase a new smartphone = 140\nTotal number of consumers surveyed = 500\n\nProbability = (Number of consumers who regularly purchase a new smartphone) / (Total number of consumers surveyed)\n\nProbability = 140 / 500\n\nProbability = 0.28\n\nSo, the probability of a randomly chosen consumer purchasing a new smartphone in a year from this market is 0.28 or 28%."
