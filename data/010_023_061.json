    "message_2": "The fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot in $S^3$ is the knot group of the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, and its knot group is the free group on two generators, which can be denoted as $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\langle a, b \\rangle$. This means that the fundamental group consists of all words that can be formed by combining the generators a and b and their inverses, with no simplifications possible."
