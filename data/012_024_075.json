    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges. Determine the genus of G using the formula: genus = (m - n + c - 2)/2, where m is the number of edges, n is the number of vertices, and c is the number of connected components.",
    "message_2": "Let's plug the given values into the formula:\n\nm = 15 (number of edges)\nn = 10 (number of vertices)\nc = 1 (assuming the graph is connected, meaning there is only one connected component)\n\nNow, we can calculate the genus:\n\ngenus = (m - n + c - 2)/2\ngenus = (15 - 10 + 1 - 2)/2\ngenus = (4)/2\ngenus = 2\n\nSo, the genus of the graph G is 2."
