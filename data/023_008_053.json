    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [-2, 2], we first need to determine if we are working with a Fourier sine series, Fourier cosine series, or a full Fourier series. Since the function is odd, we will use the Fourier sine series.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier sine series is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [B_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, n is an integer, and B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nIn this case, L = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2. So, we need to find the B_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for B_n is:\n\nB_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx, integrated over the interval [-L, L].\n\nFor our function, this becomes:\n\nB_n = (1/2) * ∫[(x - 1) * sin(n * π * x / 2)] dx, integrated over the interval [-2, 2].\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral:\n\nB_n = (1/2) * [∫(x * sin(n * π * x / 2) dx - ∫(sin(n * π * x / 2) dx)], integrated over the interval [-2, 2].\n\nWe can solve these integrals using integration by parts:\n\nFor the first integral, let u = x and dv = sin(n * π * x / 2) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-2/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 2).\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\n∫(x * sin(n * π * x / 2) dx) = (-2/(n * π)) * x * cos(n * π * x / 2) - ∫((-2/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx).\n\nNow, we need to integrate (-2/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 2) with respect to x:\n\n∫((-2/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx) = (-4/(n^2 * π^2)) * sin(n * π * x / 2).\n\nSo, the first integral becomes:\n\n∫(x * sin(n * π * x / 2) dx) = (-2/(n * π)) * x * cos(n * π * x / 2) + (4/(n^2 * π^2)) * sin(n * π * x / 2).\n\nFor the second integral, we have:\n\n∫(sin(n * π * x / 2) dx) = (-2/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 2).\n\nNow, we can plug these results back into the B_n formula:\n\nB_n = (1/2) * [(-2/(n * π)) * x * cos(n * π * x / 2) + (4/(n^2 * π^2)) * sin(n * π * x / 2) + 2/(n * π) * cos(n * π * x / 2)] evaluated from -2 to 2.\n\nB_n = (1/2) * [(4/(n * π)) * cos(n * π) - (4/(n * π)) * cos(0) + (8/(n^2 * π^2)) * sin(n * π) - (8/(n^2 * π^2)) * sin(0)].\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and cos(0) = 1, we get:\n\nB_n = (1/2) * [(4/(n * π)) * ((-1)^n - 1)].\n\nFinally, the Fourier sine series for the function f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [-2, 2] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(1/2) * (4/(n * π)) * ((-1)^n - 1) * sin(n * π * x / 2)]."
