Both firms have constant marginal costs of $20. What will be the equilibrium price and quantity in the market when both firms choose their prices at the same time?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete on price, and consumers will buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms have the same price, they will split the market demand equally. Since both firms have constant marginal costs of $20, they will set their prices equal to their marginal costs to maximize profits.\n\nLet's find the equilibrium price and quantity in the market.\n\n1. Both firms set their prices equal to their marginal costs: P_A = P_B = MC = $20.\n\n2. Since both firms have the same price, they will split the market demand equally. Let Q_A be the quantity produced by firm A and Q_B be the quantity produced by firm B. Then, the total quantity in the market is Q = Q_A + Q_B.\n\n3. Substitute the prices into the demand curve: P = 100 - Q => 20 = 100 - Q => Q = 100 - 20 = 80.\n\n4. Since both firms split the market demand equally, Q_A = Q_B = Q/2 => Q_A = Q_B = 80/2 = 40.\n\nSo, the equilibrium price in the market is $20, and the equilibrium quantity is 80 units, with each firm producing 40 units."
