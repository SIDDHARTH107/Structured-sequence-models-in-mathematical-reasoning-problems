    "message_2": "To find the image of the upper half-plane under the transformation $f(z) = \\frac{1+z}{1-z}$, we first need to find the image of the boundary of the upper half-plane, which is the real axis. Let $z = x$ be a real number, then\n\n$$f(x) = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}.$$\n\nNow, let's find the image of the upper half of the unit circle $|z|=1$. Let $z = e^{i\\theta}$ with $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$. Then,\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = \\frac{1+e^{i\\theta}}{1-e^{i\\theta}} = \\frac{1+\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta}{1-\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta}.$$\n\nTo find the image of the lower half-plane below $y=0$, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a domain and continuous on its boundary, then the function can be analytically continued across the boundary by reflecting the function values across the boundary.\n\nLet $z = x - iy$ with $y > 0$. Then, the reflection of $z$ across the real axis is $\\bar{z} = x + iy$. We can find the image of $\\bar{z}$ under the transformation $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{1+\\bar{z}}{1-\\bar{z}} = \\frac{1+x+iy}{1-x-iy}.$$\n\nNow, we can find the reflection of $f(\\bar{z})$ across the real axis:\n\n$$\\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = \\frac{1+x-iy}{1-x+iy}.$$\n\nThis is the image of the lower half-plane below $y=0$ under the transformation $f(z)$ using the Schwarz reflection principle.\n\nIn summary, the image of the upper half-plane under the transformation $f(z)$ is given by the function $f(z) = \\frac{1+z}{1-z}$, the image of the upper half of the unit circle $|z|=1$ is given by the function $f(e^{i\\theta}) = \\frac{1+\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta}{1-\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta}$, and the image of the lower half-plane below $y=0$ is given by the reflection of $f(\\bar{z})$ across the real axis, which is $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = \\frac{1+x-iy}{1-x+iy}$."
