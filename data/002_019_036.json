    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cone, we need to find the sum of the base area and the lateral area.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle, so we can find its area using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nBase area = π * r^2\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nBase area = π * (5 cm)^2\nBase area = π * 25 cm^2\nBase area ≈ 78.54 cm^2\n\nThe lateral area of the cone can be found using the formula:\n\nLateral area = π * r * l\nwhere r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height.\n\nLateral area = π * (5 cm) * (10 cm)\nLateral area = π * 50 cm^2\nLateral area ≈ 157.08 cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the base area and the lateral area:\n\nTotal surface area = Base area + Lateral area\nTotal surface area ≈ 78.54 cm^2 + 157.08 cm^2\nTotal surface area ≈ 235.62 cm^2\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is approximately 235.62 cm^2."
