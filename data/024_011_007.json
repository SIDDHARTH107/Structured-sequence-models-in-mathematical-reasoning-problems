    "message_2": "To compute the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the surface of a sphere with radius 5, we need to use the spherical coordinate system. Let's first convert the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), where:\n\nx = r * sin(θ) * cos(φ)\ny = r * sin(θ) * sin(φ)\nz = r * cos(θ)\n\nIn this case, the radius r is constant and equal to 5. Now, let's rewrite the function f in terms of spherical coordinates:\n\nf(r, θ, φ) = r^2\n\nNow, we can compute the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. The Laplacian in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\nΔf = (1 / r^2) * (∂ / ∂r) * (r^2 * (∂f / ∂r)) + (1 / (r^2 * sin(θ))) * (∂ / ∂θ) * (sin(θ) * (∂f / ∂θ)) + (1 / (r^2 * sin^2(θ))) * (∂^2f / ∂φ^2)\n\nSince f(r, θ, φ) = r^2, we have:\n\n∂f / ∂r = 2r\n∂f / ∂θ = 0\n∂f / ∂φ = 0\n\nNow, we can plug these into the Laplacian formula:\n\nΔf = (1 / r^2) * (∂ / ∂r) * (r^2 * (2r)) + (1 / (r^2 * sin(θ))) * (∂ / ∂θ) * (sin(θ) * 0) + (1 / (r^2 * sin^2(θ))) * 0\nΔf = (1 / r^2) * (∂ / ∂r) * (2r^3)\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative with respect to r:\n\n(∂ / ∂r) * (2r^3) = 6r^2\n\nFinally, we can plug this back into the Laplacian formula:\n\nΔf = (1 / r^2) * 6r^2 = 6\n\nSo, the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the surface of a sphere with radius 5 is 6."
