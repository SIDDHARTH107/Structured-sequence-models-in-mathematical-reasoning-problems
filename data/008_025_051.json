    "message_2": "To determine if the given system of linear equations has no solution, we can first try to solve it using the method of substitution or elimination.\n\nLet's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(2x + 3y = 7) * 2\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 14 (1)\n4x + 6y = 14 (2)\n\nNow, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 14 - 14\n0 = 0\n\nSince we got 0 = 0, it means that the two equations are dependent and have infinitely many solutions, not no solution. The given system of linear equations does not have no solution; instead, it has infinitely many solutions."
