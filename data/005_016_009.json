    "message_1": "A company wants to use discriminant analysis to predict whether a job applicant will be successful or not. The company collected data on the ages and years of experience of 50 successful employees and 50 unsuccessful employees. Using this data, the company created a discriminant function:\n\nD(x) = -0.5(15-age) + 0.8(years of experience)\n\nIf a job applicant is 30 years old with 5 years of experience, will the company hire them? Use the discriminant function to make a prediction.",
    "message_2": "To make a prediction using the discriminant function, we need to plug in the applicant's age and years of experience into the function:\n\nD(x) = -0.5(15 - age) + 0.8(years of experience)\n\nD(x) = -0.5(15 - 30) + 0.8(5)\n\nD(x) = -0.5(-15) + 4\n\nD(x) = 7.5 + 4\n\nD(x) = 11.5\n\nThe discriminant function has produced a positive value (11.5). Generally, in discriminant analysis, a positive value indicates that the applicant belongs to the successful group, while a negative value indicates that they belong to the unsuccessful group. Since the result is positive, the company is likely to predict that the applicant will be successful and may consider hiring them. However, the final decision will depend on the company's hiring criteria and other factors beyond the discriminant function."
