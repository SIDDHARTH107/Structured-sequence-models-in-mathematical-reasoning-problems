    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides 27, and\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe possible divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisors that satisfy both conditions are 1 and 27. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, which is the same as the order of G, we have P = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 27 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 27\nIf there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups, each of order 9, then any two distinct subgroups must intersect trivially (i.e., their intersection is the identity element). Let P and Q be two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups. Then |P ∩ Q| = 1, and |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 9 / 1 = 81. However, this is impossible since |PQ| must divide |G| = 27. Therefore, there cannot be 27 3-Sylow subgroups.\n\nSince the only possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27, and we have shown that n_3 cannot be 27, it must be the case that n_3 = 1. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 27, and it is not isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
