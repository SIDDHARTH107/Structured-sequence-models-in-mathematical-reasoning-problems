    "message_1": "Suppose that the heights of adult men in a certain population are normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. What is the probability that a randomly selected man from this population will have a height between 66 and 72 inches?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected man from this population will have a height between 66 and 72 inches, we can use the Z-score formula to standardize the values and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the Z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-scores for both 66 inches and 72 inches.\n\nFor 66 inches:\nZ1 = (66 - 70) / 3\nZ1 = -4 / 3\nZ1 ≈ -1.33\n\nFor 72 inches:\nZ2 = (72 - 70) / 3\nZ2 = 2 / 3\nZ2 ≈ 0.67\n\nNow, we will use the Z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores. The Z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than or equal to a given Z-score.\n\nP(Z ≤ -1.33) ≈ 0.092\nP(Z ≤ 0.67) ≈ 0.748\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected man will have a height between 66 and 72 inches, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(66 ≤ X ≤ 72) = P(Z ≤ 0.67) - P(Z ≤ -1.33)\nP(66 ≤ X ≤ 72) = 0.748 - 0.092\nP(66 ≤ X ≤ 72) ≈ 0.656\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected man from this population will have a height between 66 and 72 inches is approximately 65.6%."
