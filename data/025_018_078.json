    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$. Let $P = (-1,0)$ and $Q = (1,2)$ be two points on $E$. Show that the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ intersects $E$ at exactly one other point $R$, and find the coordinates of $R$.",
    "message_2": "To find the line passing through points $P$ and $Q$, we can use the slope-point form of a line equation. The slope of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is given by:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_Q - y_P}{x_Q - x_P} = \\frac{2 - 0}{1 - (-1)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a line equation:\n\n$y - y_P = m(x - x_P)$\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of point $P$ and the slope $m$, we get:\n\n$y - 0 = 1(x - (-1))$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$:\n\n$y = x + 1$\n\nNow we want to find the point $R$ where this line intersects the elliptic curve $E$. To do this, we can substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the curve:\n\n$(x + 1)^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$x^2 + 2x + 1 = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get a cubic equation:\n\n$x^3 - x^2 + 2x^2 - 2x + x - 1 = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x^3 + x^2 - x - 1 = 0$\n\nWe know that $x = -1$ and $x = 1$ are solutions to this equation, corresponding to points $P$ and $Q$. To find the third intersection point $R$, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining factor:\n\n$(x^3 + x^2 - x - 1) / (x - (-1))(x - 1) = (x^3 + x^2 - x - 1) / (x^2 - 1)$\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n$x + 1$\n\nSetting this factor equal to zero, we find the $x$-coordinate of point $R$:\n\n$x + 1 = 0$\n\n$x = -1$\n\nNow we can plug this value back into the equation of the line to find the $y$-coordinate of point $R$:\n\n$y = (-1) + 1$\n\n$y = 0$\n\nThus, the coordinates of point $R$ are $(-1, 0)$. However, this is the same as point $P$. In the context of elliptic curves, when a line intersects the curve at two distinct points, it must intersect at a third point. In this case, the line is tangent to the curve at point $P$, so the third intersection point is the reflection of point $P$ across the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $R$ are $(-1, -0) = (-1, 0)$, which is the same as point $P$."
