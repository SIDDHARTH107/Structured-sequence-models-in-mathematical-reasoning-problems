    "message_1": "A building is 200 meters tall. From a point on the ground, you measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 45 degrees. What is the distance from your point on the ground to the base of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Since the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, we can use the tangent function. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (200 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point on the ground to the base of the building, which we'll call \"x\".\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(45) = 200 / x\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = 200 / x\n\nTo find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x:\n\nx = 200\n\nSo, the distance from the point on the ground to the base of the building is 200 meters."
