    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the compound proposition [(p ∧ q) → r] ∨ (p → ~r), we will first evaluate the individual propositions and then combine them according to the logical operators.\n\nGiven: p = true, q = false, and r = true\n\n1. (p ∧ q): Since p is true and q is false, the conjunction (p ∧ q) is false.\n\n2. (p → ~r): Since r is true, ~r (not r) is false. The implication (p → ~r) is false because p is true and ~r is false.\n\n3. (p ∧ q) → r: Since (p ∧ q) is false and r is true, the implication (p ∧ q) → r is true. This is because an implication is true when the antecedent is false or when both the antecedent and consequent are true.\n\n4. Finally, we evaluate the disjunction [(p ∧ q) → r] ∨ (p → ~r): Since (p ∧ q) → r is true and (p → ~r) is false, the disjunction is true. A disjunction is true when at least one of its components is true.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of the compound proposition [(p ∧ q) → r] ∨ (p → ~r) is true."
