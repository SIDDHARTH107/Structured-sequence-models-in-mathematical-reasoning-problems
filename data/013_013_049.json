    "message_1": "Consider an auction where there are five bidders, with valuations of $20, $25, $30, $35 and $40 for the item being auctioned. The auction is a second-price sealed-bid auction and each bidder submits a bid. What is the winning bid and who wins the auction?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. \n\nIn this case, the bids are $20, $25, $30, $35, and $40. The highest bid is $40, so the bidder with a valuation of $40 wins the auction. The second-highest bid is $35, so the winner will pay $35 for the item."
