    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem based on Combinatorics and Graph Theory:\n\nSuppose there are 7 people at a party. Each person may or may not know each other. We define \"knowing\" as a mutual introduction during the party. Let's assume that knowing is a symmetric relation, so if person A knows person B, then person B also knows person A. If there are no groups of three people who all know each other, then we say that there is no \"triangle\" in the group. \n\nHow many different groups of 7 people are there such that there is no triangle?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the concept of Turán's theorem in Graph Theory. Turán's theorem provides an upper bound on the number of edges in a graph with n vertices that does not contain a complete subgraph with r vertices (K_r). In this case, we want to find the number of groups of 7 people (n=7) with no triangles (K_3).\n\nAccording to Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a graph with n vertices and no K_r is given by:\n\nt(n, r) = (r-2)/(2r-2) * n^2 / 2\n\nFor our problem, n=7 and r=3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nt(7, 3) = (3-2)/(2*3-2) * 7^2 / 2 = 1/4 * 49 / 2 = 49 / 8\n\nSince the number of edges must be an integer, we round down to get the maximum number of edges:\n\nt(7, 3) = floor(49/8) = 6\n\nNow, we need to find the number of different groups of 7 people with no triangles. This is equivalent to finding the number of graphs with 7 vertices and at most 6 edges without any triangles. We can use the following combinatorial approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of possible edges in a graph with 7 vertices: C(7, 2) = 21\n2. Calculate the number of graphs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 edges without any triangles.\n\nFor 0 edges, there is only 1 graph (the empty graph).\n\nFor 1 edge, there are C(21, 1) = 21 graphs.\n\nFor 2 edges, there are C(21, 2) = 210 graphs.\n\nFor 3 edges, there are C(21, 3) = 1330 graphs.\n\nFor 4 edges, we need to subtract the number of graphs with a triangle. There are 35 such graphs (one for each combination of 3 vertices). So, there are C(21, 4) - 35 = 5985 - 35 = 5950 graphs.\n\nFor 5 edges, we need to subtract the number of graphs with a triangle. There are 35 * 18 = 630 such graphs (one for each combination of 3 vertices, and 18 remaining edges). So, there are C(21, 5) - 630 = 20349 - 630 = 19719 graphs.\n\nFor 6 edges, we need to subtract the number of graphs with a triangle. There are 7 * C(6, 3) = 7 * 20 = 140 such graphs (one for each combination of 3 vertices, and 20 remaining edges). So, there are C(21, 6) - 140 = 54264 - 140 = 54124 graphs.\n\nAdding up the number of graphs for each case, we get:\n\n1 + 21 + 210 + 1330 + 5950 + 19719 + 54124 = 79355\n\nSo, there are 79,355 different groups of 7 people such that there is no triangle."
