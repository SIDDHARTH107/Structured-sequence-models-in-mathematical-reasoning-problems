    "message_1": "A metal plate has initial temperature of 100 째C. The ambient temperature is 20 째C. The plate is heated from one end and the resulting temperature distribution satisfies the following heat diffusion equation:\n\n$u_t = 0.01u_{xx}$\n\nwhere $u$ is the temperature of the plate in degrees Celsius, $x$ is the distance from the heated end of the plate in meters and $t$ is the time in seconds. \n\nIf the heated end of the plate is maintained at a constant temperature of 200 째C, find the temperature distribution of the plate at $t = 100$ seconds and $x = 0.5$ meters.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat diffusion equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T'(t) = 0.01X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $0.01X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{0.01T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a separation constant. This gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T'(t) + 0.01\\lambda T(t) = 0$ and $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the spatial equation:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nSince the heated end of the plate is maintained at a constant temperature of 200 째C, we have the boundary condition:\n\n$X(0) = 200$\n\nThe general solution of the spatial equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$\n\nApplying the boundary condition, we get:\n\n$200 = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) \\implies A = 200$\n\nNow, we solve the temporal equation:\n\n$T'(t) + 0.01\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the general solution:\n\n$T(t) = Ce^{-0.01\\lambda t}$\n\nNow, we have the solution in the form:\n\n$u(x, t) = (200\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x))Ce^{-0.01\\lambda t}$\n\nTo find the temperature distribution of the plate at $t = 100$ seconds and $x = 0.5$ meters, we need to determine the values of $B$, $C$, and $\\lambda$. However, we do not have enough information to uniquely determine these values. Additional boundary conditions or information about the plate's geometry would be needed to fully solve the problem."
