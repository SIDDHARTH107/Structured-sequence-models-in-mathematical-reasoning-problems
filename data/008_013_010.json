    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as the matrix equation Ax = b, where:\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 4  7  5 |\n    | 6  9  8 |\n\nb = | 14 |\n    | 32 |\n    | 44 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nPerforming Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix:\n\n1. Multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row.\n2. Multiply the first row by 3 and subtract it from the third row.\n\nU = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 0  1  3 |\n    | 0  0  2 |\n\nNow, we can find the L matrix by using the multipliers used during the Gaussian elimination:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 3  3  1 |\n\nStep 2: Solve Ly = b for y\n\nWe have the lower triangular matrix L:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 14 |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 32 |\n| 3  3  1 | | y3 |   | 44 |\n\nSolving for y1, y2, and y3:\n\ny1 = 14\ny2 = 32 - 2 * y1 = 4\ny3 = 44 - 3 * y1 - 3 * y2 = 2\n\nSo, y = | 14 |\n        |  4 |\n        |  2 |\n\nStep 3: Solve Ux = y for x\n\nWe have the upper triangular matrix U:\n\n| 2  3  1 | | x1 |   | 14 |\n| 0  1  3 | | x2 | = |  4 |\n| 0  0  2 | | x3 |   |  2 |\n\nSolving for x1, x2, and x3:\n\nx3 = 2 / 2 = 1\nx2 = (4 - 3 * x3) / 1 = 1\nx1 = (14 - 3 * x2 - x3) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, x = | 2 |\n        | 1 |\n        | 1 |\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = 1."
