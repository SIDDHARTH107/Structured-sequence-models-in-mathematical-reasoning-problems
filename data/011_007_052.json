    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of ways to choose a committee of k people with John as a member by C(n, k), where n is the total number of employees. In this case, n = 10 and k = 3.\n\nWe can use the following recurrence relation to solve the problem:\n\nC(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)\n\nThe first term, C(n-1, k-1), represents the number of ways to choose a committee with John and k-1 other employees from the remaining n-1 employees. The second term, C(n-1, k), represents the number of ways to choose a committee without John and k employees from the remaining n-1 employees. Since John must be in the committee, we only need to consider the first term.\n\nWe have:\n\nC(10, 3) = C(9, 2)\n\nNow, we can use the base case C(n, 1) = n for the recurrence relation:\n\nC(9, 2) = C(8, 1) + C(8, 2) = 8 + C(7, 1) + C(7, 2) = 8 + 7 + C(6, 1) + C(6, 2) = 15 + 6 + C(5, 1) + C(5, 2) = 21 + 5 + C(4, 1) + C(4, 2) = 26 + 4 + C(3, 1) + C(3, 2) = 30 + 3 + C(2, 1) + C(2, 2) = 33 + 2 + 1 = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 ways to choose a committee of 3 people with John as a member."
