    "message_2": "The given information is contradictory. If P is necessarily false, it cannot be possibly true. Similarly, if Q is necessarily true, it cannot be possibly false. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the truth value of the statement \"(P ∧ Q) → Q\". The answer is:\n\nC) Insufficient information to determine."
