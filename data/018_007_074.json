    "message_2": "To prove that the number of subsets in the power set of A is greater than the number of elements in set A, we will use the principle of counting.\n\nLet A be a set with 4 elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c, d}. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself.\n\nWe can form a subset by either including or not including each element of A. Since there are 4 elements in A, there are 2 choices (include or not include) for each element. Therefore, by the principle of counting, there are 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^4 = 16 possible subsets in the power set of A.\n\nNow, let's compare the number of elements in set A and the number of subsets in the power set of A:\n\nNumber of elements in set A = 4\nNumber of subsets in the power set of A = 16\n\nSince 16 > 4, we have proven that the number of subsets in the power set of A is greater than the number of elements in set A."
