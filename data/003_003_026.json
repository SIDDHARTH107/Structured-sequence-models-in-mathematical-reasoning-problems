    "message_2": "For an angle of 45° (or π/4 in radians), the sine, cosine, and tangent values are as follows:\n\nsin(45°) = sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071\n\ncos(45°) = cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071\n\ntan(45°) = tan(π/4) = sin(π/4) / cos(π/4) = (√2/2) / (√2/2) = 1\n\nSo, sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071, cos(45°) ≈ 0.7071, and tan(45°) = 1."
