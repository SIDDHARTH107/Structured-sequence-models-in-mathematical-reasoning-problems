    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. By the Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element of order 2 in G. Let's denote this element by x, so x^2 = e (the identity element of G). Now, let's consider the possible cases for the structure of G:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group: In this case, G is isomorphic to Z_10 (the additive group of integers modulo 10). The only element of order 2 in Z_10 is 5, since 5 + 5 = 10 â‰¡ 0 (mod 10). So, in this case, there is only 1 element of order 2 in G.\n\n2. G is not a cyclic group: In this case, G must be a product of two smaller cyclic groups, since the order of G is 10 = 2 * 5, which is a product of two distinct prime numbers. So, G is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_5. In this case, there are 2 elements of order 2 in G: (1, 0) and (1, 5), since (1, 0) + (1, 0) = (0, 0) and (1, 5) + (1, 5) = (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the possible values of the number of elements of order 2 in G are 1 and 2."
