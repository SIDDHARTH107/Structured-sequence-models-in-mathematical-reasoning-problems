    "message_2": "To find the average angular displacement of the pendulum over the first 5 seconds, we need to integrate the function $\\theta(t) = 2\\sin(2t)$ from $t = 0$ to $t = 5$ and then divide by the length of the interval, which is 5 seconds.\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of $\\theta(t)$:\n\n$$\\int_0^5 2\\sin(2t) dt$$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let $u = 2t$, so $du = 2dt$. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int_0^5 2\\sin(2t) dt = \\int_0^{10} \\sin(u) du$$\n\nNow, we can integrate $\\sin(u)$:\n\n$$\\int \\sin(u) du = -\\cos(u) + C$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral from $0$ to $10$:\n\n$$-\\cos(10) - (-\\cos(0)) = -\\cos(10) + 1$$\n\nNow, we need to divide this result by the length of the interval, which is 5 seconds:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\cos(10) + 1}{5}$$\n\nThis is the average angular displacement of the pendulum over the first 5 seconds."
