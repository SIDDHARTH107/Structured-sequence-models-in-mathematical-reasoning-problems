    "message_2": "To find the value of 'a' for which the system has an infinite number of solutions, we need to find the value of 'a' that makes the system of equations dependent. This means that one of the equations can be written as a linear combination of the other two equations.\n\nFirst, let's manipulate the first two equations to see if we can find a relationship between them.\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 3 to match the coefficients of the x term in the second equation:\n\n3(x - 3y + 2z) = 3(5)\n3x - 9y + 6z = 15\n\nNow, let's subtract the second equation from this new equation:\n\n(3x - 9y + 6z) - (3x - 7y + 6z) = 15 - 10\n-2y = 5\n\nThis gives us an equation that is not consistent (-2y = 5), so we cannot find a relationship between the first two equations.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a relationship between the first and third equations. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to match the coefficients of the x term in the third equation:\n\n2(x - 3y + 2z) = 2(5)\n2x - 6y + 4z = 10\n\nNow, let's subtract the third equation from this new equation:\n\n(2x - 6y + 4z) - (2x - 4y + az) = 10 - 6\n-2y + (4 - a)z = 4\n\nFor the system to have an infinite number of solutions, the third equation must be a multiple of the first equation. This means that the coefficients of y and z must also be multiples of the coefficients in the first equation. In other words, -2y must be a multiple of -6y, and (4 - a)z must be a multiple of 4z.\n\nSince -2y is already a multiple of -6y, we just need to find the value of 'a' that makes (4 - a)z a multiple of 4z. This occurs when 4 - a = 4, which means that a = 0.\n\nSo, the value of 'a' for which the system has an infinite number of solutions is a = 0."
