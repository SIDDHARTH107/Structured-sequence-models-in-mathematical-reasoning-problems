    "message_2": "The Gosper curve is a fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. At each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of (√7). So, to find the total length of the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length × (√7)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 × (√7)^6\n\nLength = (√7)^6\n\nLength ≈ 117.816\n\nSo, the total length of the 6th iteration of the Gosper curve is approximately 117.816 when rounded to three decimal places."
