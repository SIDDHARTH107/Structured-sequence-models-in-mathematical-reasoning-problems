    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set A, we first need to define a universal set U that contains all possible elements in the context of the problem. The complement of A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nSince the problem does not provide a specific universal set, let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} for the purpose of this example. Now, we can find the complement of A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of A and U, we can determine that A' = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, let's verify that the complement of A is unique. The uniqueness of the complement of A means that there is only one set A' that satisfies the condition of being the complement of A.\n\nSuppose there is another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also the complement of A. This would mean that B contains elements not in A and not in A'. However, since A' already contains all elements in U that are not in A, there is no room for another set B to be the complement of A without having the same elements as A'. This contradiction shows that the complement of A is unique.\n\nTherefore, the complement of A is A' = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, and it is unique."
