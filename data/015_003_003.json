    "message_2": "The period-doubling bifurcation ratio, also known as the Feigenbaum constant (Î´), is a universal constant that describes the ratio of the difference between consecutive bifurcation points in a chaotic system. It is approximately equal to 4.669.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for the value of the logistic map at a specific control parameter r = 3.6. The logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx[n+1] = r * x[n] * (1 - x[n])\n\nTo find the value of the logistic map at r = 3.6, we need to iterate the equation for a given initial value of x[0] (usually between 0 and 1) until it converges to a stable value or a periodic cycle.\n\nLet's assume x[0] = 0.5. After iterating the logistic map equation several times, the values will converge to a periodic cycle. For r = 3.6, the logistic map converges to a period-2 cycle, which means it oscillates between two values.\n\nIt's important to note that the period-doubling bifurcation ratio (Feigenbaum constant) is not directly related to the value of the logistic map at a specific control parameter. The Feigenbaum constant describes the ratio of the difference between consecutive bifurcation points, not the value of the logistic map itself."
