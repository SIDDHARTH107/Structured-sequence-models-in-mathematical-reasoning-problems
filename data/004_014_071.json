    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the curve y = x^3 from x = 0 to x = 2 about the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the cross-sectional area of the solid along the axis of rotation.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the solid at a given x-value is a circle with radius y = x^3. The area of this circle is A(x) = π(x^3)^2 = πx^6.\n\nNow we need to integrate this area function from x = 0 to x = 2 to find the volume of the solid:\n\nV = ∫[0, 2] A(x) dx = ∫[0, 2] πx^6 dx\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule:\n\n∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n\nSo,\n\nV = π ∫[0, 2] x^6 dx = π [(x^7)/7] | from 0 to 2\n\nNow we evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\nV = π [(2^7)/7 - (0^7)/7] = π [128/7] = 128π/7\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid formed by rotating the curve y = x^3 from x = 0 to x = 2 about the x-axis is 128π/7 cubic units."
