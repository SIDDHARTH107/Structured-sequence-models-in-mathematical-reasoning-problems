    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of triangle XYZ, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides, YZ and XZ. We can use the Law of Sines to do this.\n\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In other words:\n\n(YZ/sin(X)) = (XZ/sin(Y)) = (XY/sin(Z))\n\nWe know XY = 10 cm, angle YXZ = 60 degrees, and angle XYZ = 80 degrees. We can find angle YZX (Z) using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nZ = 180 - (YXZ + XYZ) = 180 - (60 + 80) = 180 - 140 = 40 degrees\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of YZ and XZ:\n\n(YZ/sin(60)) = (XZ/sin(80)) = (10/sin(40))\n\nFirst, let's solve for YZ:\n\nYZ/sin(60) = 10/sin(40)\nYZ = (10 * sin(60))/sin(40)\n\nNow, let's solve for XZ:\n\nXZ/sin(80) = 10/sin(40)\nXZ = (10 * sin(80))/sin(40)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of the sine functions:\n\nsin(60) = √3/2\nsin(80) ≈ 0.9848\nsin(40) ≈ 0.6428\n\nYZ = (10 * (√3/2))/0.6428 ≈ 12.1244 cm\nXZ = (10 * 0.9848)/0.6428 ≈ 15.3066 cm\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of triangle XYZ:\n\nPerimeter = XY + YZ + XZ = 10 + 12.1244 + 15.3066 ≈ 37.431 cm"
