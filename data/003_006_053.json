    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle, we first need to find the largest side, which is already given as 15. Now, we will use the Law of Cosines to find the angle opposite to the largest side, which will be the largest angle. Then, we will use the Law of Sines to find the smallest angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines is given by:\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nHere, a = 10, b = 12, and c = 15. We want to find the angle C.\n\n15² = 10² + 12² - 2 * 10 * 12 * cos(C)\n225 = 100 + 144 - 240 * cos(C)\n225 = 244 - 240 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we will solve for cos(C):\ncos(C) = (244 - 225) / 240\ncos(C) = 19 / 240\n\nNow, we will find the angle C:\nC = arccos(19 / 240)\nC ≈ 81.79°\n\nNow that we have the largest angle, we can use the Law of Sines to find the smallest angle. The Law of Sines is given by:\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe have the side lengths a, b, and c, and we have the angle C. We want to find the smallest angle, which is either A or B. Since sin(A) and sin(B) are both positive and less than 1, the smallest angle will have the smallest side length opposite to it. In this case, the smallest side length is 10, so we want to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines:\na/sin(A) = c/sin(C)\n10/sin(A) = 15/sin(81.79°)\n\nNow, we will solve for sin(A):\nsin(A) = (10 * sin(81.79°)) / 15\nsin(A) ≈ 0.6428\n\nNow, we will find the angle A:\nA = arcsin(0.6428)\nA ≈ 40.18°\n\nTherefore, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 40.18°."
