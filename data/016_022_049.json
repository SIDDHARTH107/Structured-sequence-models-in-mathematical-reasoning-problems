    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski Pyramid construction, the number of filled triangles at each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of filled triangles = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the stage number.\n\nFor the 6th stage, we can plug in the value of n:\n\nNumber of filled triangles = (4^6 - 1) / 3\nNumber of filled triangles = (4096 - 1) / 3\nNumber of filled triangles = 4095 / 3\nNumber of filled triangles = 1365\n\nSo, there are 1365 filled triangles in the 6th stage of the Sierpinski Pyramid construction."
