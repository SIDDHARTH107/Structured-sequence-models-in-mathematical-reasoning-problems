    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator, we can use the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement from the equilibrium position at time t, A is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the mass (m = 0.5 kg), the spring constant (k = 200 N/m), and the initial displacement (x0 = 0.05 m). We can find the amplitude A, which is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, as:\n\nA = x0 = 0.05 m\n\nNext, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nω = sqrt(200 N/m / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(400 s^(-2)) = 20 rad/s\n\nSince the oscillator starts at its maximum displacement, the phase angle φ is 0. Therefore, the equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(20t)\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the oscillator to complete five complete cycles of oscillation. The period T of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value of ω:\n\nT = 2π/20 = π/10 s\n\nSince we want to find the time for five complete cycles, we multiply the period by 5:\n\nt = 5 * (π/10) = π/2 s\n\nSo, the time it takes for the oscillator to complete five complete cycles of oscillation is π/2 seconds."
