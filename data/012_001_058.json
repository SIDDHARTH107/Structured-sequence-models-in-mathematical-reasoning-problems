    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the graph visually. Here's the graph with the nodes and edges labeled:\n\n```\n1 --(1)-- 2 --(2)-- 3 --(1)-- 6\n|         |         |         |\n(2)       (1)       (2)       (1)\n|         |         |         |\n4 --(1)-- 5 --(1)-- 6 --(2)-- 7\n```\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6:\n\n1. Starting at node 1, we can either go to node 2 (with a cost of 1) or node 4 (with a cost of 2). We choose the path with the lowest cost, so we go to node 2.\n\n2. From node 2, we can go to node 3 (with a cost of 2) or node 5 (with a cost of 1). We choose the path with the lowest cost, so we go to node 5.\n\n3. From node 5, we can go to node 6 (with a cost of 1). So, we go to node 6.\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6, with a total cost of 3."
