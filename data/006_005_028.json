    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 out of 5 randomly selected employees will be absent on a given day, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes (absences) in n trials (employees), C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success (absence), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (presence).\n\nIn this case, n = 5, p = 0.20, and we want to find the probability of at least 2 absences, so we need to calculate the probabilities for x = 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then sum them up.\n\nP(at least 2) = P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5)\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nP(2) = C(5, 2) * 0.20^2 * 0.80^3 = 10 * 0.04 * 0.512 = 0.2048\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * 0.20^3 * 0.80^2 = 10 * 0.008 * 0.64 = 0.0512\nP(4) = C(5, 4) * 0.20^4 * 0.80^1 = 5 * 0.0016 * 0.8 = 0.0064\nP(5) = C(5, 5) * 0.20^5 * 0.80^0 = 1 * 0.00032 * 1 = 0.00032\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nP(at least 2) = 0.2048 + 0.0512 + 0.0064 + 0.00032 = 0.26272\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 out of 5 randomly selected employees will be absent on a given day is approximately 26.27%."
