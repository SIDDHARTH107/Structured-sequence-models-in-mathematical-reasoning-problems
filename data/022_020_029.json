    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis, we first recognize that the given partial differential equation is the Laplace's equation in two dimensions:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\\partial y^2} = 0.$\n\nWe will use the method of conformal mapping to transform the Laplace's equation into a simpler problem. Let's consider the following conformal mapping:\n\n$z = x + iy = a \\cosh(w),$\n\nwhere $w = u + iv$ and $u(x,y)$ is the real part of $w$. The mapping $z = a \\cosh(w)$ maps the strip $0 < u < a$ and $-\\infty < v < \\infty$ onto the upper half-plane $Im(z) > 0$. The boundary conditions become:\n\n$u(0,y) = 0 \\Rightarrow w = iv$ on the imaginary axis,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(a,y) + u(a,y) = 0 \\Rightarrow w = a + iv$ on the line $Re(w) = a$.\n\nNow, we consider the function $f(w) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\log(z - a) - \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\log(z)$. The function $f(w)$ is harmonic in the upper half-plane since it is the real part of an analytic function. Moreover, it satisfies the boundary conditions:\n\n$f(0) = 0$ and $f(a) = 0$.\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the conformal mapping to obtain the solution $u(x,y)$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. From the mapping $z = a \\cosh(w)$, we have:\n\n$w = \\cosh^{-1} \\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right).$\n\nSubstituting $z = x + iy$, we get:\n\n$w = \\cosh^{-1} \\left(\\frac{x + iy}{a}\\right) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y).$\n\nNow, we can find the real part of $w$ which is the solution $u(x,y)$:\n\n$u(x,y) = Re\\left(\\cosh^{-1} \\left(\\frac{x + iy}{a}\\right)\\right).$\n\nFinally, we substitute the harmonic function $f(w)$ into the expression for $u(x,y)$:\n\n$u(x,y) = Re\\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\log\\left(\\frac{x + iy - a}{a}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\log(x + iy)\\right).$\n\nThis is the solution to the given boundary value problem using complex analysis."
