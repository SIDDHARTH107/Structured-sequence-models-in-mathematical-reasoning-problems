    "message_1": "A school is choosing a student council consisting of 1 president, 1 vice president, and 3 members. If there are 8 candidates running for the council, how many ways can the council be chosen using Multinomial coefficients?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 8 candidates and we need to choose 1 president, 1 vice president, and 3 members, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the council as follows:\n\n1. Choose the president: There are 8 candidates, so there are 8 ways to choose the president.\n2. Choose the vice president: After choosing the president, there are 7 candidates left, so there are 7 ways to choose the vice president.\n3. Choose the 3 members: After choosing the president and vice president, there are 6 candidates left. We need to choose 3 members from these 6 candidates, which can be done in 6!/(3!*(6-3)!) ways using the binomial coefficient formula.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose the council is:\n\n8 (ways to choose president) * 7 (ways to choose vice president) * (6!/(3!*3!)) (ways to choose 3 members)\n\n8 * 7 * (6!/(3!*3!)) = 8 * 7 * (720/(6*6)) = 8 * 7 * 20 = 1120\n\nThere are 1120 ways to choose the student council using Multinomial coefficients."
