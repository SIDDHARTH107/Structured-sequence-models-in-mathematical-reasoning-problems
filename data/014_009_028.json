    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure that uses a block size of 64 bits and 16 rounds. Each round involves dividing the input block into two parts, each 32 bits long, and applying a round function to one of the parts. If the round function uses a key of 48 bits, how many bits does the key schedule for all 16 rounds need?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher with 16 rounds, each round requires a unique subkey. Since the round function uses a key of 48 bits for each round, we can calculate the total number of bits needed for the key schedule for all 16 rounds as follows:\n\nTotal bits = (Number of rounds) * (Bits per round key)\nTotal bits = 16 * 48\nTotal bits = 768\n\nSo, the key schedule for all 16 rounds needs 768 bits."
