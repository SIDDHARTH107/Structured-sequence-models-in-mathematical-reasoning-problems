    "message_2": "To find the numerical derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 5 at x = 2 using the backward finite difference method with a step size of 0.1, we can use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x) - f(x - h)) / h\n\nwhere f'(x) is the numerical derivative, f(x) is the function, x is the point at which we want to find the derivative, and h is the step size (0.1 in this case).\n\nFirst, let's find the values of f(x) and f(x - h):\n\nx = 2\nh = 0.1\nx - h = 2 - 0.1 = 1.9\n\nNow, let's find f(x) and f(x - h):\n\nf(x) = 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 5 = 8 + 6 - 5 = 9\nf(x - h) = 2(1.9)^2 + 3(1.9) - 5 = 7.22 + 5.7 - 5 = 7.92\n\nNow we can use the formula to find the numerical derivative:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x) - f(x - h)) / h = (9 - 7.92) / 0.1 = 1.08 / 0.1 = 10.8\n\nSo, the numerical derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 5 at x = 2 using the backward finite difference method with a step size of 0.1 is approximately 10.8."
