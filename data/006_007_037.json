    "message_1": "Suppose that the daily returns of a certain stock are normally distributed with a mean of 0.8% and a standard deviation of 1.2%. What is the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 2% in a single day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 2% in a single day, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 2%, μ = 0.8%, and σ = 1.2%.\n\nz = (2 - 0.8) / 1.2\nz = 1.2 / 1.2\nz = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 1. We can use the z-table to find the probability that the z-score is less than 1 and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 1.\n\nP(Z < 1) = 0.8413 (from the z-table)\n\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z < 1)\nP(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413\nP(Z > 1) = 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 2% in a single day is approximately 15.87%."
