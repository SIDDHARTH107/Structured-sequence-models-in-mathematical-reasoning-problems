    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\nMean (μ) = 500g\nStandard deviation (σ) = 15g\nSample size (n) = 25\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean and is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 15 / √25\nSE = 15 / 5\nSE = 3g\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of average weights (495g and 505g). The z-score is the number of standard errors a value is away from the mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower limit (495g):\nz1 = (495 - 500) / 3\nz1 = -5 / 3\nz1 ≈ -1.67\n\nFor the upper limit (505g):\nz2 = (505 - 500) / 3\nz2 = 5 / 3\nz2 ≈ 1.67\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the average weight of the bottles is between these z-scores. We can use a z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nFor z1 ≈ -1.67, the probability is 0.0475 (from the z-table).\nFor z2 ≈ 1.67, the probability is 0.9525 (from the z-table).\n\nTo find the probability that the average weight is between 495g and 505g, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(495g < X < 505g) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP(495g < X < 505g) = 0.9525 - 0.0475\nP(495g < X < 505g) = 0.905\n\nSo, there is a 90.5% probability that the average weight of the 25 bottles is between 495g and 505g."
