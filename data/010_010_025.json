    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = 3x^3 - 3x^2 + 2y^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of the function is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 9x^2 - 6x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 4y$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$9x^2 - 6x = 0 \\implies x(9x - 6) = 0 \\implies x = 0, \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$4y = 0 \\implies y = 0$\n\nSo, we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's find the number of connected components of the level set $f(x, y) = 1$. We have:\n\n$3x^3 - 3x^2 + 2y^2 = 1$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$2y^2 = 1 - 3x^3 + 3x^2$\n\nSince $2y^2$ is always non-negative, the right-hand side must also be non-negative:\n\n$1 - 3x^3 + 3x^2 \\geq 0$\n\nLet $g(x) = 3x^3 - 3x^2 + 1$. We want to find the range of $x$ for which $g(x) \\geq 0$. Taking the derivative of $g(x)$, we get:\n\n$g'(x) = 9x^2 - 6x$\n\nSetting $g'(x)$ equal to zero, we find the critical points of $g(x)$:\n\n$9x^2 - 6x = 0 \\implies x(9x - 6) = 0 \\implies x = 0, \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nSince $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, it has only one change in concavity. Therefore, $g(x)$ is increasing on the interval $x \\in [0, \\frac{2}{3}]$ and decreasing on the interval $x \\in [\\frac{2}{3}, \\infty)$. Since $g(0) = 1$ and $g(\\frac{2}{3}) = 0$, we conclude that $g(x) \\geq 0$ for $x \\in [0, \\frac{2}{3}]$.\n\nNow, we know that $2y^2 = 1 - 3x^3 + 3x^2 \\geq 0$ for $x \\in [0, \\frac{2}{3}]$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, we can conclude that the level set $f(x, y) = 1$ is connected for $x \\in [0, \\frac{2}{3}]$.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 connected component of the level set $f(x, y) = 1$.\n\nIn summary, there are 2 critical points of the function $f(x, y) = 3x^3 - 3x^2 + 2y^2$, and there is 1 connected component of the level set $f(x, y) = 1$."
