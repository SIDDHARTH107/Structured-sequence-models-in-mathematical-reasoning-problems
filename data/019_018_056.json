    "message_2": "Proof by Contradiction:\n\nAssume the opposite of the statement, i.e., there exists a prime number x greater than 2 such that x is even.\n\nAn even number can be defined as a number that is divisible by 2, which means x can be written in the form x = 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, since x is a prime number, it should have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself (x).\n\nHowever, since x is even (x = 2k), it is divisible by both 1 and 2. This means that x has at least three distinct positive divisors: 1, 2, and x.\n\nThis contradicts the definition of a prime number, which states that a prime number should have exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a prime number x greater than 2 such that x is even is false.\n\nHence, if x is a prime number greater than 2, then x must be odd.
