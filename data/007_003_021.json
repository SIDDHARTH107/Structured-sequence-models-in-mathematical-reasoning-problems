    "message_2": "To find the remainder of the division $189^2$ by $6$, we can first find the remainder of $189$ when divided by $6$. \n\n$189$ divided by $6$ gives a quotient of $31$ and a remainder of $3$. So, we can write $189$ as $6 \\cdot 31 + 3$.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of $189^2$ when divided by $6$. We can rewrite $189^2$ as $(6 \\cdot 31 + 3)^2$. \n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\n$(6 \\cdot 31 + 3)^2 = (6 \\cdot 31)^2 + 2 \\cdot (6 \\cdot 31) \\cdot 3 + 3^2$\n\nNow, notice that both $(6 \\cdot 31)^2$ and $2 \\cdot (6 \\cdot 31) \\cdot 3$ are divisible by $6$, so their remainders when divided by $6$ are $0$. \n\nSo, we only need to find the remainder of $3^2$ when divided by $6$. \n\n$3^2 = 9$, and when we divide $9$ by $6$, we get a remainder of $3$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder of the division $189^2$ by $6$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
