    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $3^x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{41}$, we can use the method of successive squaring and modular exponentiation.\n\nWe start by computing powers of 3 modulo 41:\n\n$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{41}$\n\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{41}$\n\n$3^3 \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$\n\n$3^4 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 27 \\equiv 81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$\n\nNow, we notice that $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$. This means that $3^{4k} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$ for any non-negative integer $k$. We can use this property to find the smallest $x$ such that $3^x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{41}$.\n\nLet's try different values of $k$:\n\nFor $k = 1$, $3^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nFor $k = 2$, $3^{8} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nFor $k = 3$, $3^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nFor $k = 4$, $3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nFor $k = 5$, $3^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nNow, let's try multiplying these powers of 3 by 3:\n\n$3 \\cdot 3^{20} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$3 \\cdot 3^{16} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$3 \\cdot 3^{12} \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$3 \\cdot 3^{8} \\equiv 81 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$3 \\cdot 3^{4} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nNow, let's try multiplying these powers of 3 by 9:\n\n$9 \\cdot 3^{20} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$9 \\cdot 3^{16} \\equiv 81 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$9 \\cdot 3^{12} \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$9 \\cdot 3^{8} \\equiv 81 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$9 \\cdot 3^{4} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nFinally, let's try multiplying these powers of 3 by 27:\n\n$27 \\cdot 3^{20} \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$27 \\cdot 3^{16} \\equiv 81 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$27 \\cdot 3^{12} \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$27 \\cdot 3^{8} \\equiv 81 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\n$27 \\cdot 3^{4} \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$, which is not equal to 20.\n\nIt seems we have not found the smallest $x$ yet. Let's continue with the next powers of 3:\n\n$3^5 \\equiv 3^4 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{41}$\n\n$3^6 \\equiv 3^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{41}$\n\n$3^7 \\equiv 3^4 \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 27 \\equiv 27 \\pmod{41}$\n\n$3^8 \\equiv 3^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}$\n\nWe can see that the powers of 3 are repeating after every 4 powers. This means that the order of 3 modulo 41 is 4. However, we still need to find the smallest $x$ such that $3^x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{41}$.\n\nLet's try multiplying the powers of 3 by 20:\n\n$20 \\cdot 3^{20} \\equiv 20 \\pmod{41}$, which is equal to 20.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $3^x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{41}$ is $x = 20$."
