The price of widgets varies randomly each day, with a mean price of $10 and a standard deviation of $2.50. The factory owner has a fixed production capacity of 100 widgets per day. What is the optimal production quantity for the factory to maximize their expected profit, assuming they can sell all widgets produced?\n\nHint: To solve this stochastic optimization problem, you will need to model the uncertain price of widgets as a random variable and use a probabilistic approach to find the expected profit at different production levels.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the production quantity as Q and the random price of widgets as P. The cost of producing Q widgets is 5Q, and the revenue from selling Q widgets at price P is PQ. The profit function can be expressed as:\n\nProfit(Q) = PQ - 5Q\n\nSince the price P is a random variable with a mean of $10 and a standard deviation of $2.50, we can model it as a normal distribution with these parameters. To find the expected profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit function:\n\nE[Profit(Q)] = E[PQ - 5Q]\n\nSince Q is a constant, we can rewrite this as:\n\nE[Profit(Q)] = Q * E[P] - 5Q\n\nWe know that E[P] = $10, so:\n\nE[Profit(Q)] = 10Q - 5Q = 5Q\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal production quantity Q to maximize the expected profit. Since the expected profit is a linear function of Q, it will increase as Q increases. However, the factory has a fixed production capacity of 100 widgets per day. Therefore, the optimal production quantity to maximize the expected profit is Q = 100.\n\nIn this case, the factory should produce 100 widgets per day to maximize their expected profit."
