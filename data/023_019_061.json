    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation, we get:\n\ndY/dω + Y(ω) = S(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and S(ω) is the Fourier transform of sin(2t).\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of sin(2t). Using the Euler's formula, we have:\n\nsin(2t) = (e^(j2t) - e^(-j2t)) / (2j)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of sin(2t), we get:\n\nS(ω) = ∫[((e^(j2t) - e^(-j2t)) / (2j)) * e^(-jωt) dt]\n\nS(ω) = (1/2j) [∫(e^(j(2-ω)t) dt) - ∫(e^(j(-2-ω)t) dt)]\n\nNow, we can solve these integrals:\n\n∫(e^(j(2-ω)t) dt) = (1/(j(2-ω))) * e^(j(2-ω)t)\n\n∫(e^(j(-2-ω)t) dt) = (1/(j(-2-ω))) * e^(j(-2-ω)t)\n\nPlugging these back into the expression for S(ω), we get:\n\nS(ω) = (1/2j) [(1/(j(2-ω))) * e^(j(2-ω)t) - (1/(j(-2-ω))) * e^(j(-2-ω)t)]\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for S(ω) back into the differential equation in the frequency domain:\n\ndY/dω + Y(ω) = (1/2j) [(1/(j(2-ω))) * e^(j(2-ω)t) - (1/(j(-2-ω))) * e^(j(-2-ω)t)]\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the behavior of Y(ω) as ω approaches infinity. If the magnitude of Y(ω) remains bounded as ω approaches infinity, the system is stable.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly solve this differential equation for Y(ω) without additional information. In general, the stability of a system depends on the specific properties of the system, such as the transfer function or the impulse response. In this case, we do not have enough information to determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform."
