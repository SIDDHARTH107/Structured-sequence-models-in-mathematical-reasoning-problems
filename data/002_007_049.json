    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a bottom base of 8 cm, a top base of 5 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the bottom base is 8 cm, the top base is 5 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (8 + 5) * 6\nArea = (1/2) * (13) * 6\nArea = 6.5 * 6\nArea = 39 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 39 square centimeters."
