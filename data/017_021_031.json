    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 48, which can be factored as 2^4 * 3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFor n_2, the possible values are 1 and 3. For n_3, the possible values are 1 and 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which implies that G is the direct product of these subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 16, which is isomorphic to either C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. The Sylow 3-subgroup is of order 3, which is isomorphic to C3. Therefore, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C48, C8 × C2 × C3, C4 × C4 × C3, or C4 × C2 × C2 × C3.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The Sylow 3-subgroup is of order 3, which is isomorphic to C3. Since G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, G cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G is one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 16, which is isomorphic to either C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. Since G has more than one Sylow 3-subgroup, G cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G is one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup and more than one Sylow 3-subgroup, G cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Therefore, G is one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group G, we cannot determine which specific group G is isomorphic to. It could be isomorphic to C48, A4 × C4 (which is isomorphic to C8 × C2 × C3), or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
