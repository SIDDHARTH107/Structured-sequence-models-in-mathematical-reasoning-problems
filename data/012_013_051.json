    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) represents the number of ways to color the graph G with k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's apply the deletion-contraction algorithm on the edge (1, 2):\n\n1. Delete the edge (1, 2): The remaining graph G' has edges {(1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5)}. Now we need to find the chromatic polynomial of G', which we denote as P(G', k).\n\n2. Contract the edge (1, 2): This means we merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex, say v12. The resulting graph G'' has vertices {v12, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(v12,3), (v12,4), (3,4), (4,5)}. Now we need to find the chromatic polynomial of G'', which we denote as P(G'', k).\n\nNow, let's find P(G', k) and P(G'', k):\n\nFor P(G', k):\n- Vertex 1 can be colored in k ways.\n- Vertex 2 can be colored in (k-1) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertex 1).\n- Vertex 3 can be colored in (k-1) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertex 2).\n- Vertex 4 can be colored in (k-2) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertices 1 and 2).\n- Vertex 5 can be colored in (k-1) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertex 4).\n\nSo, P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-1)(k-2)(k-1).\n\nFor P(G'', k):\n- Vertex v12 can be colored in k ways.\n- Vertex 3 can be colored in (k-1) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertex v12).\n- Vertex 4 can be colored in (k-1) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertex v12).\n- Vertex 5 can be colored in (k-1) ways (since it cannot have the same color as vertex 4).\n\nSo, P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-1)(k-1).\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm to find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) - k(k-1)(k-1)(k-1).\n\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-1)[(k-2)(k-1) - (k-1)] = k(k-1)(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) - k(k-1)(k-1)^2.\n\nThus, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) - k(k-1)(k-1)^2."
