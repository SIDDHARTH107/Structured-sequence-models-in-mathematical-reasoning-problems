    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a road at a rate of 0.05 accidents per hour. What is the probability that there will be at least 2 of these accidents within a 24-hour period on this road?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Poisson distribution to solve this problem. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, traffic accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events, k is the number of occurrences we are interested in, λ is the average rate of occurrence, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this problem, we have λ = 0.05 accidents per hour * 24 hours = 1.2 accidents per 24-hour period. We want to find the probability of at least 2 accidents occurring within a 24-hour period, which can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for X = 0 and X = 1 using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (1.2^0 * e^(-1.2)) / 0! = (1 * e^(-1.2)) / 1 = e^(-1.2) ≈ 0.301194\nP(X = 1) = (1.2^1 * e^(-1.2)) / 1! = (1.2 * e^(-1.2)) / 1 ≈ 0.361433\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 accidents occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)) = 1 - (0.301194 + 0.361433) = 1 - 0.662627 ≈ 0.337373\n\nSo, the probability that there will be at least 2 accidents within a 24-hour period on this road is approximately 0.337 or 33.7%."
