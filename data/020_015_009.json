    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the equation:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 80 meters of fencing, the perimeter is 80 meters:\n\n80 = 2L + 2W\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n40 = L + W\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by the equation:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can express W in terms of L using the simplified perimeter equation:\n\nW = 40 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (40 - L)\n\nArea = 40L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to L and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 40 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 40\nL = 20\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 40 - 20 = 20\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular land with the largest possible area that can be enclosed are 20 meters by 20 meters."
