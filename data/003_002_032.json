    "message_2": "To find the cosine of a 60-degree angle in a right triangle, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(Î¸) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the adjacent side is 4 inches and the hypotenuse is 8 inches. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ncos(60) = 4 / 8\n\ncos(60) = 0.5\n\nThe value of the cosine of a 60-degree angle in this right triangle is 0.5."
