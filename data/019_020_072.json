    "message_2": "To determine the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, we need to find the relationship between the input size and the time taken to sort the elements. Let's denote the input size as n and the time taken as T(n).\n\nWe are given that T(10,000) = 100 seconds.\n\nNow, we need to find T(80,000) when the input size is increased to 80,000 elements.\n\nFirst, let's try to find the time complexity of the algorithm. We will consider three common time complexities: O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2).\n\n1. Linear time complexity (O(n)):\nIf the algorithm has a linear time complexity, then T(n) = k * n for some constant k. In this case, we have:\n\n100 = k * 10,000\nk = 100 / 10,000\nk = 0.01\n\nSo, T(80,000) = 0.01 * 80,000 = 800 seconds.\n\n2. Log-linear time complexity (O(n log n)):\nIf the algorithm has a log-linear time complexity, then T(n) = k * n * log(n) for some constant k. In this case, we have:\n\n100 = k * 10,000 * log(10,000)\nk = 100 / (10,000 * log(10,000))\n\nSo, T(80,000) = k * 80,000 * log(80,000) = 100 / (10,000 * log(10,000)) * 80,000 * log(80,000) â‰ˆ 533.3 seconds.\n\n3. Quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)):\nIf the algorithm has a quadratic time complexity, then T(n) = k * n^2 for some constant k. In this case, we have:\n\n100 = k * (10,000)^2\nk = 100 / (10,000)^2\n\nSo, T(80,000) = k * (80,000)^2 = 100 / (10,000)^2 * (80,000)^2 = 6,400 seconds.\n\nWithout more information about the sorting algorithm, we cannot determine the exact time complexity. However, based on the above calculations, if the algorithm has a linear time complexity, it will take 800 seconds; if it has a log-linear time complexity, it will take approximately 533.3 seconds; and if it has a quadratic time complexity, it will take 6,400 seconds to sort 80,000 elements."
