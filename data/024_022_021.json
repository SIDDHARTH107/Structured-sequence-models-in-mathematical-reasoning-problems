    "message_2": "To find the isometries of the given Riemannian metric g = dx^2 + 9 dy^2, we need to find the transformations that preserve the distance between points in the manifold M. In other words, we need to find the transformations T: M → M such that for any two points p, q ∈ M, the distance between T(p) and T(q) is the same as the distance between p and q.\n\nLet's consider the transformations of the form:\n\nT(x, y) = (ax + by + e, cx + dy + f)\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, and f are constants. The differential of this transformation is given by:\n\ndT = (a dx + b dy, c dx + d dy)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants a, b, c, d, e, and f such that the transformed metric g' = (dT)^2 is equal to the original metric g. In other words, we need to satisfy the following equation:\n\ng' = (a dx + b dy)^2 + 9(c dx + d dy)^2 = dx^2 + 9 dy^2\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n(a^2 + 9c^2) dx^2 + (2ab + 18cd) dx dy + (b^2 + 9d^2) dy^2 = dx^2 + 9 dy^2\n\nComparing the coefficients of dx^2, dx dy, and dy^2, we obtain the following system of equations:\n\n1. a^2 + 9c^2 = 1\n2. 2ab + 18cd = 0\n3. b^2 + 9d^2 = 9\n\nFrom equation (1), we have two possibilities: (a, c) = (±1, 0) or (a, c) = (0, ±1/3). Similarly, from equation (3), we have two possibilities: (b, d) = (±3, 0) or (b, d) = (0, ±1). We can combine these possibilities in four ways:\n\n1. (a, c, b, d) = (±1, 0, ±3, 0)\n2. (a, c, b, d) = (±1, 0, 0, ±1)\n3. (a, c, b, d) = (0, ±1/3, ±3, 0)\n4. (a, c, b, d) = (0, ±1/3, 0, ±1)\n\nNow, we need to check which of these possibilities satisfy equation (2). It turns out that only possibilities (2) and (4) satisfy equation (2). Therefore, the isometries of the given Riemannian metric are of the form:\n\nT(x, y) = (±x + e, ±y + f)\n\nNow, we need to prove that these isometries form a group with respect to the composition operation. Let T1(x, y) = (±x + e1, ±y + f1) and T2(x, y) = (±x + e2, ±y + f2) be two isometries. The composition of these two isometries is given by:\n\nT1(T2(x, y)) = T1(±x + e2, ±y + f2) = (±(±x + e2) + e1, ±(±y + f2) + f1)\n\nThis composition is again an isometry of the same form, so the set of isometries is closed under the composition operation. The identity transformation I(x, y) = (x, y) is an isometry, and the inverse of an isometry T(x, y) = (±x + e, ±y + f) is given by T^(-1)(x, y) = (±x ∓ e, ±y ∓ f), which is also an isometry. Therefore, the set of isometries forms a group with respect to the composition operation."
