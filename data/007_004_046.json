    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 48, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n48 รท 36 = 1, remainder 12\n\nStep 2: Replace the larger number (48) with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (12) from the previous step.\nNow, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\nStep 3: Divide the larger number (36) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n36 รท 12 = 3, remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the divisor in the last step, which is 12. So, the GCD of 36 and 48 is 12."
