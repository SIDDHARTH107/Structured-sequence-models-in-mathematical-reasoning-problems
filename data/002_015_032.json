    "message_1": "A circular garden has a diameter of 10 meters. What is the perimeter of the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere C is the circumference, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the circular garden is 10 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 meters.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(5)\nC = 10π\n\nUsing the approximate value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nC ≈ 10 × 3.14159\nC ≈ 31.4159 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the garden is approximately 31.4159 meters."
