    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). Applying this property to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog((x+2)(x-3)) = log(42)\n\nNow, since the logarithms are equal, we can equate the arguments:\n\n(x+2)(x-3) = 42\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2x - 6 = 42\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 - x - 48 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x-8)(x+6) = 0\n\nSo, the possible solutions for x are:\n\nx - 8 = 0 => x = 8\nx + 6 = 0 => x = -6\n\nHowever, since we have a logarithm of (x-3) in the original equation, we must ensure that x-3 > 0, otherwise, the logarithm would be undefined. Therefore, x > 3. \n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 8."
