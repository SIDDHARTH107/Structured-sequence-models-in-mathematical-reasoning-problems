    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n2^(x+1) = 16\n\nSince 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite 16 as 2^4:\n\n2^(x+1) = 2^4\n\nNow, since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx+1 = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 4 - 1\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 3."
