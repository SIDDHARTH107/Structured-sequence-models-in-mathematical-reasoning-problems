    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can first try to simplify the equations. Notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2(2x + 3y) = 2(7)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, these two equations are essentially the same, and they represent the same line. In this case, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line represented by the equation 2x + 3y = 7 is a solution to the system."
