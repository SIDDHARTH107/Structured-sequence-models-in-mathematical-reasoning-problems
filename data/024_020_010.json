Also, determine the fibers of f over the points (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) and (-1,0,0) in S2.",
    "message_2": "To show that the map f is invariant under the equivalence relation, we need to show that if two points (x,y,z) and (x',y',z') in R3 \\ {0} are equivalent, i.e., (x',y',z') = k(x,y,z) for some nonzero scalar k, then f(x,y,z) = f(x',y',z').\n\nLet (x',y',z') = k(x,y,z), where k is a nonzero scalar. Then x' = kx, y' = ky, and z' = kz. Now let's compute f(x',y',z'):\n\nf(x',y',z') = ((x')^2-(y')^2, 2x'y', 2z'(x'^2+y'^2-1))/((x')^2+(y')^2+(z')^2)\n           = ((kx)^2-(ky)^2, 2(kx)(ky), 2(kz)((kx)^2+(ky)^2-1))/((kx)^2+(ky)^2+(kz)^2)\n           = (k^2(x^2-y^2), 2k^2xy, 2kz(k^2(x^2+y^2)-1))/(k^2(x^2+y^2+z^2))\n\nNow, we can factor out k^2 from the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x',y',z') = (k^2(x^2-y^2), 2k^2xy, 2kz(k^2(x^2+y^2)-1))/(k^2(x^2+y^2+z^2))\n           = (x^2-y^2, 2xy, 2z(x^2+y^2-1))/(x^2+y^2+z^2)\n           = f(x,y,z)\n\nThus, f is invariant under the equivalence relation.\n\nNow, let's determine the fibers of f over the points (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and (-1,0,0) in S2.\n\n1. f^(-1)(1,0,0): We want to find all (x,y,z) such that f(x,y,z) = (1,0,0). This means:\n\n   (x^2-y^2, 2xy, 2z(x^2+y^2-1))/(x^2+y^2+z^2) = (1,0,0)\n\n   Equating the components, we get:\n\n   x^2-y^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2\n   2xy = 0\n   2z(x^2+y^2-1) = 0\n\n   From 2xy = 0, either x = 0 or y = 0. If x = 0, then y^2 = y^2+z^2, which implies z = 0, but (x,y,z) cannot be (0,0,0). So, y = 0. Then x^2 = x^2+z^2, which implies z = 0. Thus, the fiber is {(x,0,0) | x ≠ 0}.\n\n2. f^(-1)(0,1,0): We want to find all (x,y,z) such that f(x,y,z) = (0,1,0). This means:\n\n   (x^2-y^2, 2xy, 2z(x^2+y^2-1))/(x^2+y^2+z^2) = (0,1,0)\n\n   Equating the components, we get:\n\n   x^2-y^2 = 0\n   2xy = x^2+y^2+z^2\n   2z(x^2+y^2-1) = 0\n\n   From x^2-y^2 = 0, we have x = ±y. If x = y, then 2x^2 = x^2+z^2, which implies x^2 = z^2, so z = ±x. If x = -y, then -2x^2 = x^2+z^2, which implies x^2 = -z^2, but this is not possible since x^2 and z^2 are both nonnegative. Thus, the fiber is {(x,x,z) | x ≠ 0, z = ±x}.\n\n3. f^(-1)(0,0,1): We want to find all (x,y,z) such that f(x,y,z) = (0,0,1). This means:\n\n   (x^2-y^2, 2xy, 2z(x^2+y^2-1))/(x^2+y^2+z^2) = (0,0,1)\n\n   Equating the components, we get:\n\n   x^2-y^2 = 0\n   2xy = 0\n   2z(x^2+y^2-1) = x^2+y^2+z^2\n\n   From 2xy = 0, either x = 0 or y = 0. If x = 0, then y^2 = y^2+z^2, which implies z = 0, but (x,y,z) cannot be (0,0,0). So, y = 0. Then x^2 = x^2+z^2, which implies z = 0. This contradicts the third equation. Thus, there are no points in the fiber.\n\n4. f^(-1)(-1,0,0): We want to find all (x,y,z) such that f(x,y,z) = (-1,0,0). This means:\n\n   (x^2-y^2, 2xy, 2z(x^2+y^2-1))/(x^2+y^2+z^2) = (-1,0,0)\n\n   Equating the components, we get:\n\n   x^2-y^2 = -(x^2+y^2+z^2)\n   2xy = 0\n   2z(x^2+y^2-1) = 0\n\n   From 2xy = 0, either x = 0 or y = 0. If x = 0, then y^2 = y^2+z^2, which implies z = 0, but (x,y,z) cannot be (0,0,0). So, y = 0. Then x^2 = -x^2-z^2, which implies x^2 = -z^2, but this is not possible since x^2 and z^2 are both nonnegative. Thus, there are no points in the fiber.\n\nIn summary, the fibers are:\n\nf^(-1)(1,0,0) = {(x,0,0) | x ≠ 0}\nf^(-1)(0,1,0) = {(x,x,z) | x ≠ 0, z = ±x}\nf^(-1)(0,0,1) = {}\nf^(-1)(-1,0,0) = {}"
