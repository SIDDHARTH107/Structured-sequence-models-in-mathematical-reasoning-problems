Use the conjugate gradient method to find the minimum value of f and the values of x₁ and x₂ that achieve this minimum.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the conjugate gradient method, we first need to find the gradient of the function f(x). The gradient is a vector of the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable.\n\n∇f(x) = (∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂)\n\n∂f/∂x₁ = 2x₁ - 6 + 5x₂\n∂f/∂x₂ = 10x₂ - 20 + 5x₁\n\nNow, we will use the conjugate gradient method to find the minimum value of f and the values of x₁ and x₂ that achieve this minimum. We will start with an initial guess for x, say x₀ = (0, 0), and then iteratively update x using the conjugate gradient method.\n\n1. Initialize x₀ = (0, 0), r₀ = -∇f(x₀) = (6, 20), and p₀ = r₀.\n2. For each iteration k:\n   a. Compute α_k = (r_k^T * r_k) / (p_k^T * A * p_k), where A is the Hessian matrix of f(x) and r_k is the residual at iteration k.\n   b. Update x_k+1 = x_k + α_k * p_k.\n   c. Update r_k+1 = r_k - α_k * A * p_k.\n   d. If ||r_k+1|| is small enough, stop the iteration and return x_k+1 as the minimum point.\n   e. Compute β_k = (r_k+1^T * r_k+1) / (r_k^T * r_k).\n   f. Update p_k+1 = r_k+1 + β_k * p_k.\n\nThe Hessian matrix A of f(x) is given by:\n\nA = | 2   5 |\n    | 5  10 |\n\nNow, let's perform the conjugate gradient method:\n\nIteration 1:\nx₀ = (0, 0)\nr₀ = (6, 20)\np₀ = (6, 20)\nα₁ = (6*6 + 20*20) / (6*2*6 + 5*20*6) = 260 / 220 = 1.1818\nx₁ = x₀ + α₁ * p₀ = (0, 0) + 1.1818 * (6, 20) = (7.0908, 23.636)\nr₁ = r₀ - α₁ * A * p₀ = (6, 20) - 1.1818 * (12, 50) = (-1.0908, -3.636)\np₁ = r₁ = (-1.0908, -3.636)\n\nIteration 2:\nα₂ = (1.0908*1.0908 + 3.636*3.636) / (-1.0908*2*-1.0908 + 5*3.636*-1.0908) = 14.5454 / 12.7272 = 1.1429\nx₂ = x₁ + α₂ * p₁ = (7.0908, 23.636) + 1.1429 * (-1.0908, -3.636) = (6, 19)\nr₂ = r₁ - α₂ * A * p₁ = (-1.0908, -3.636) - 1.1429 * (-2.1816, -5.4544) = (0, 0)\n\nSince r₂ is (0, 0), we have found the minimum point. The minimum value of f(x) is achieved at x = (x₁, x₂) = (6, 19), and the minimum value is:\n\nf(6, 19) = 6² + 5*19² - 6*6 - 20*19 + 5*6*19 = 36 + 5*361 - 36 - 380 + 570 = 1801\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is 1801, and it is achieved at x = (6, 19)."
