    "message_1": "Suppose we have 5 types of fruits: apples (A), bananas (B), cherries (C), grapes (G), and oranges (O). We want to create a basket of three fruits, where no two fruits in the basket are the same. How many different fruit baskets could we create?",
    "message_2": "To create a basket of three different fruits, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, types of fruits), k is the number of items we want to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this problem, we have n = 5 types of fruits and we want to choose k = 3 fruits for the basket. So, we can plug these values into the combination formula:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different fruit baskets we can create with three different fruits."
