    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π × Diameter (D)\n\nGiven the diameter (D) is 14 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π × 14 cm\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14159, we get:\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 × 14 cm\nC ≈ 43.98226 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
