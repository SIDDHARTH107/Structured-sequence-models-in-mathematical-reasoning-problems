    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected lollipop will weigh between 9.5 and 10.5 grams, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between these two values. We can use the Z-score formula to standardize these values and then use a standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the probabilities.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, let's find the Z-scores for 9.5 and 10.5 grams:\n\nZ_9.5 = (9.5 - 10) / 0.5 = -1\nZ_10.5 = (10.5 - 10) / 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we can use a Z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores. The probability for Z = -1 is 0.1587 (15.87%) and for Z = 1 is 0.8413 (84.13%). To find the probability that a lollipop weighs between 9.5 and 10.5 grams, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(9.5 < X < 10.5) = P(Z = 1) - P(Z = -1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected lollipop will weigh between 9.5 and 10.5 grams is 0.6826 or 68.26%."
