    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize profit by producing and selling two products. The selling price of product 1 is $10 per unit and that of product 2 is $15 per unit. The company has a production constraint of 100 units per day for product 1 and 80 units per day for product 2. The production cost for each unit of product 1 is $3 and for each unit of product 2 is $5. The company wants to know how many units of each product should be produced and sold to maximize the profit. Use nonlinear programming to solve the problem. What is the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a nonlinear programming model. Let x1 be the number of units of product 1 produced and sold, and x2 be the number of units of product 2 produced and sold.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 7x1 + 10x2\nSubject to the constraints:\nx1 <= 100 (production constraint for product 1)\nx2 <= 80 (production constraint for product 2)\nx1 >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for product 1)\nx2 >= 0 (non-negativity constraint for product 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x1 and x2 that maximize the profit function P, subject to the constraints.\n\nThe feasible region is a rectangle with vertices (0,0), (100,0), (0,80), and (100,80). We can evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 7(0) + 10(0) = 0\n2. P(100,0) = 7(100) + 10(0) = 700\n3. P(0,80) = 7(0) + 10(80) = 800\n4. P(100,80) = 7(100) + 10(80) = 700 + 800 = 1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (100,80), with a profit of $1500. Therefore, the company should produce and sell 100 units of product 1 and 80 units of product 2 to maximize their profit. The maximum profit is $1500."
