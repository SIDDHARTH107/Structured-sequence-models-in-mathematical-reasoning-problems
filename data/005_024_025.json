They found that the mean was 360 minutes and the standard deviation was 30 minutes. If a random sample of 50 customers is selected, what is the probability that the mean of their phone call minutes will be between 350 and 370 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\n\nPopulation mean (μ) = 360 minutes\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 30 minutes\nSample size (n) = 50\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The formula for standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 30 / √50 ≈ 4.24\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample means (350 and 370 minutes). The z-score is the number of standard errors a value is from the population mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower limit (350 minutes):\n\nz1 = (350 - 360) / 4.24 ≈ -2.36\n\nFor the upper limit (370 minutes):\n\nz2 = (370 - 360) / 4.24 ≈ 2.36\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-2.36 < z < 2.36) ≈ 0.9821\n\nSo, the probability that the mean of the phone call minutes for a random sample of 50 customers will be between 350 and 370 minutes is approximately 98.21%."
