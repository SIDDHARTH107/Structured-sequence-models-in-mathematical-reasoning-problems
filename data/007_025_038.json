She chooses a private key a=5 and computes A=g^a mod p. Bob chooses his private key b=11 and computes B=g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, Alice and Bob will exchange their computed values A and B. Then, they will compute the shared secret key using their private keys and the received values.\n\nFirst, let's find A and B:\nA = g^a mod p = 3^5 mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 15\nB = g^b mod p = 3^11 mod 17 = 177147 mod 17 = 6\n\nNow, Alice computes the shared secret key using B and her private key a:\nkey_Alice = B^a mod p = 6^5 mod 17 = 7776 mod 17 = 10\n\nBob computes the shared secret key using A and his private key b:\nkey_Bob = A^b mod p = 15^11 mod 17 = 4177248169415651 mod 17 = 10\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have the same shared secret key: 10. They will use this key for their secure communication."
