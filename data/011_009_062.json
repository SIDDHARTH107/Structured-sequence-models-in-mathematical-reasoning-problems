    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we use the Bell number, which is denoted as B(n). The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle or other methods, but for small values like n = 7, we can use the known Bell numbers.\n\nThe Bell numbers for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, and 877, respectively.\n\nSo, there are 877 ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
