    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. A' contains all the elements that are not in A. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we can assume the universal set to be the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nA' = {1, 2, 3, 4} - A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3} = {4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (A △ B) ∆ A':\n\n(A △ B) ∆ A' = ({1, 4} ∪ {4}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {4}) = {1, 4} - {4} = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference B △ A':\n\nB △ A' = (B ∪ A') - (B ∩ A') = ({2, 3, 4} ∪ {4}) - ({2, 3, 4} ∩ {4}) = {2, 3, 4} - {4} = {2, 3}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) ∆ A' = {1} and B △ A' = {2, 3}. These two sets are not equal, so we have shown that (A △ B) ∆ A' is not equal to B △ A'."
