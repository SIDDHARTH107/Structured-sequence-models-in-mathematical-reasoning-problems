    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method, we will first discretize the domain using a uniform grid with h=0.25. This will result in a 5x5 grid, including the boundary points. Since the boundary conditions are given, we will focus on the interior grid points.\n\nLet u_ij represent the approximate solution at the grid point (i*h, j*h). The PDE can be approximated using the standard five-point stencil finite difference scheme:\n\n(u_(i-1,j) - 2u_(i,j) + u_(i+1,j))/h^2 + (u_(i,j-1) - 2u_(i,j) + u_(i,j+1))/h^2 - 4u_(i,j) = f(i*h, j*h)\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nu_(i-1,j) + u_(i+1,j) + u_(i,j-1) + u_(i,j+1) - (4 + 2*h^2)u_(i,j) = h^2 * f(i*h, j*h)\n\nNow, we will apply this equation to the interior grid points (i=1,2,3 and j=1,2,3) and use the given boundary conditions:\n\n1. For i=1, j=1:\nu_(0,1) + u_(2,1) + u_(1,0) + u_(1,2) - (4 + 2*h^2)u_(1,1) = h^2 * f(0.25, 0.25)\n\n2. For i=1, j=2:\nu_(0,2) + u_(2,2) + u_(1,1) + u_(1,3) - (4 + 2*h^2)u_(1,2) = h^2 * f(0.25, 0.5)\n\n3. For i=1, j=3:\nu_(0,3) + u_(2,3) + u_(1,2) + u_(1,4) - (4 + 2*h^2)u_(1,3) = h^2 * f(0.25, 0.75)\n\nSimilarly, we can write equations for i=2,3 and j=1,2,3. This will result in a system of 9 linear equations with 9 unknowns (u_(1,1), u_(1,2), u_(1,3), u_(2,1), u_(2,2), u_(2,3), u_(3,1), u_(3,2), u_(3,3)). We can solve this system of linear equations using standard techniques such as Gaussian elimination or iterative methods like the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel methods.\n\nOnce the system of linear equations is solved, we will have the approximate solution at the interior grid points. The complete solution will include the given boundary conditions."
