    "message_1": "Suppose you want to distribute 20 identical balls among three different boxes labeled Box A, Box B, and Box C, such that Box A contains 5 balls, Box B contains 7 balls, and Box C contains 8 balls. In how many ways can you distribute the balls?",
    "message_2": "Since the balls are identical, and the number of balls in each box is predetermined (Box A has 5 balls, Box B has 7 balls, and Box C has 8 balls), there is only one way to distribute the balls:\n\n- Put 5 balls in Box A\n- Put 7 balls in Box B\n- Put 8 balls in Box C\n\nSo, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls."
