Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "We will use the logistic equation to predict the population size after 5 generations. \n\nGiven:\nInitial population P(0) = 10\nGrowth rate r = 3.8\nCarrying capacity K = 100\n\nWe need to find P(5).\n\nWe will use the logistic equation iteratively for 5 generations:\n\n1. P(1) = r * P(0) * (1 - P(0) / K)\n2. P(2) = r * P(1) * (1 - P(1) / K)\n3. P(3) = r * P(2) * (1 - P(2) / K)\n4. P(4) = r * P(3) * (1 - P(3) / K)\n5. P(5) = r * P(4) * (1 - P(4) / K)\n\nLet's calculate the population for each generation:\n\n1. P(1) = 3.8 * 10 * (1 - 10 / 100) = 3.8 * 10 * (1 - 0.1) = 3.8 * 10 * 0.9 = 34.2\n2. P(2) = 3.8 * 34.2 * (1 - 34.2 / 100) = 3.8 * 34.2 * (1 - 0.342) = 3.8 * 34.2 * 0.658 ≈ 85.3\n3. P(3) = 3.8 * 85.3 * (1 - 85.3 / 100) = 3.8 * 85.3 * (1 - 0.853) = 3.8 * 85.3 * 0.147 ≈ 47.7\n4. P(4) = 3.8 * 47.7 * (1 - 47.7 / 100) = 3.8 * 47.7 * (1 - 0.477) = 3.8 * 47.7 * 0.523 ≈ 95.0\n5. P(5) = 3.8 * 95.0 * (1 - 95.0 / 100) = 3.8 * 95.0 * (1 - 0.95) = 3.8 * 95.0 * 0.05 ≈ 18.1\n\nAfter 5 generations, the population size is approximately 18. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the population size is 18."
