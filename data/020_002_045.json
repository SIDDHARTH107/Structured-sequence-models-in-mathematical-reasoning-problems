    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of Product A is $15 and for Product B is $20. To produce one unit of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while to produce one unit of Product B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. \n\nThe company has a labor budget of 60 hours and a machine time budget of 90 hours. The company wants to maximize its profit given the given resources.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce in order to maximize its total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nP = 15x + 20y\n\nThe constraints are given by the labor and machine time budgets:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 60 (labor constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 90 (machine time constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (60 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 90\ny ≤ (90 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The corner points of the feasible region are (0,0), (0,20), (30,0), and (18,12).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 15x + 20y at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 15(0) + 20(0) = 0\n2. P(0,20) = 15(0) + 20(20) = 400\n3. P(30,0) = 15(30) + 20(0) = 450\n4. P(18,12) = 15(18) + 20(12) = 270 + 240 = 510\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (18,12), where the company produces 18 units of Product A and 12 units of Product B. The maximum total profit is $510."
