    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime divisors.\n2. The number of non-isomorphic groups of a given order is determined by the number of distinct ways to partition the prime divisors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. Now we will consider the possible partitions of the prime divisors.\n\n1. For the 2^3 factor, there are two possibilities: (2^3) and (2^1, 2^2). The first possibility corresponds to the cyclic group of order 8, while the second possibility corresponds to the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 2 and 4.\n2. For the 3^1 factor, there is only one possibility: (3^1), which corresponds to the cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNow we will consider the possible combinations of these partitions:\n\n1. (2^3) and (3^1): This combination corresponds to the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8 and 3, which results in a group of order 24. This is the cyclic group of order 24, denoted as C24 or Z24.\n2. (2^1, 2^2) and (3^1): This combination corresponds to the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 2, 4, and 3. This results in a group of order 24, which is the direct product of C2, C4, and C3, denoted as C2 x C4 x C3.\n\nNow we need to consider the semi-direct products:\n\n3. (2^3) and (3^1): There are two non-isomorphic semi-direct products of C8 and C3, which are the dihedral group D12 and the dicyclic group Q12.\n4. (2^1, 2^2) and (3^1): There is one non-isomorphic semi-direct product of C2, C4, and C3, which is the dihedral group D24.\n\nIn total, there are 5 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 24: C24, C2 x C4 x C3, D12, Q12, and D24."
