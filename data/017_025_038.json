    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 120 are there and can you provide an example of one such group?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Find the number of abelian groups of order 120 using the formula: p(n) = product of (p_i^(n_i + 1) - 1) / (p_i - 1), where p_i are the distinct prime factors of the order and n_i are their respective exponents. In our case, p(120) = (2^4 - 1)(3^2 - 1)(5^2 - 1) / ((2 - 1)(3 - 1)(5 - 1)) = (15)(8)(24) / (1*2*4) = 15.\n3. Use the formula for the total number of groups of order 120: g(120) = sum of gcd(120, phi(120/d)), where the sum is taken over all divisors d of 120, and phi is Euler's totient function. We have g(120) = gcd(120, phi(120)) + gcd(120, phi(60)) + gcd(120, phi(40)) + gcd(120, phi(30)) + gcd(120, phi(24)) + gcd(120, phi(20)) + gcd(120, phi(15)) + gcd(120, phi(12)) + gcd(120, phi(10)) + gcd(120, phi(8)) + gcd(120, phi(6)) + gcd(120, phi(5)) + gcd(120, phi(4)) + gcd(120, phi(3)) + gcd(120, phi(2)) + gcd(120, phi(1)) = 120 + 24 + 40 + 8 + 24 + 40 + 8 + 24 + 40 + 8 + 24 + 40 + 8 + 24 + 40 + 120 = 520.\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups to get the number of non-abelian groups: 520 - 15 = 505.\n\nSo, there are 505 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nAn example of a non-abelian group of order 120 is the symmetric group S_5, which is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. The order of S_5 is 5! = 120, and it is non-abelian since the composition of permutations is not commutative."
