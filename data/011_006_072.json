    "message_1": "A math student is planning to buy a new phone. The phone comes in 3 different colors - black, white, and silver. The student has a budget of $500 and wants to buy at least 2 phones, but not more than 4 phones. How many ways can the student buy the phones if each phone costs $150? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to set up the generating function for the number of ways to buy the phones. Let x represent the number of phones purchased, and let the coefficient of x^n represent the number of ways to buy n phones.\n\nThe generating function for the number of ways to buy the phones can be represented as:\n\nG(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)^3\n\nThis is because there are 3 colors of phones (black, white, and silver), and the student can buy 0, 1, 2, or 3 phones of each color. The exponent 3 represents the 3 different colors.\n\nNow we need to find the coefficients of x^2, x^3, and x^4 in the expansion of G(x), as these represent the number of ways to buy 2, 3, and 4 phones, respectively.\n\nExpanding G(x) using the multinomial theorem, we get:\n\nG(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 10x^3 + 15x^4 + ...\n\nNow, we need to consider the budget constraint. The student has a budget of $500 and each phone costs $150. We need to find the number of ways to buy 2, 3, or 4 phones within the budget.\n\nFor 2 phones, the cost is $300, which is within the budget. The coefficient of x^2 in G(x) is 6, so there are 6 ways to buy 2 phones.\n\nFor 3 phones, the cost is $450, which is within the budget. The coefficient of x^3 in G(x) is 10, so there are 10 ways to buy 3 phones.\n\nFor 4 phones, the cost is $600, which is not within the budget. Therefore, there are 0 ways to buy 4 phones within the budget.\n\nAdding up the number of ways to buy 2, 3, and 4 phones, we get:\n\n6 + 10 + 0 = 16\n\nSo there are 16 ways for the student to buy the phones within their budget."
