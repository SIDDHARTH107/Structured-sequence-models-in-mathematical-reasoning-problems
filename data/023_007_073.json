    "message_1": "A signal has a Fourier transform given by:\n \nF(w) = 5πδ(w-2) - 3πδ(w+2) + 2πδ(w)\n \nCalculate the frequency content of the signal in terms of frequency components and their corresponding magnitudes.",
    "message_2": "The given Fourier transform F(w) consists of three Dirac delta functions, which represent impulses at specific frequencies. The frequency content of the signal can be determined by analyzing the location and magnitude of these impulses.\n\n1. The first term, 5πδ(w-2), represents an impulse at frequency w = 2 with a magnitude of 5π. This means there is a frequency component at 2 rad/s with a magnitude of 5π.\n\n2. The second term, -3πδ(w+2), represents an impulse at frequency w = -2 with a magnitude of -3π. This means there is a frequency component at -2 rad/s with a magnitude of 3π (the negative sign indicates a phase shift, but the magnitude remains positive).\n\n3. The third term, 2πδ(w), represents an impulse at frequency w = 0 with a magnitude of 2π. This means there is a frequency component at 0 rad/s (DC component) with a magnitude of 2π.\n\nIn summary, the frequency content of the signal consists of three frequency components:\n\n1. A frequency component at 2 rad/s with a magnitude of 5π.\n2. A frequency component at -2 rad/s with a magnitude of 3π.\n3. A frequency component at 0 rad/s (DC component) with a magnitude of 2π."
