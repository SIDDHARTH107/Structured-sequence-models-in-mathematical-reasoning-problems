    "message_1": "Consider a small manufacturing company that produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company wants to maximize its profit by producing an optimal combination of both products. It has enough resources to produce up to 150 units of product A and up to 100 units of product B. The profit per unit of product A is $20 and the profit per unit of product B is $30. However, the company also wants to ensure that at least 30 units of product A are produced. Formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to determine how many units of product A and B the company should produce in order to maximize its profit while meeting these constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x ≤ 150 (cannot produce more than 150 units of product A)\n2. y ≤ 100 (cannot produce more than 100 units of product B)\n3. x ≥ 30 (at least 30 units of product A must be produced)\n4. x, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe multi-objective optimization problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize P = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to:\n1. x ≤ 150\n2. y ≤ 100\n3. x ≥ 30\n4. x, y ≥ 0"
