    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5 ]\n[ 2  1  1 |  4 ]\n[ 3 -1  2 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[ 2  1  1 |  4 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5 ]\n[ 3 -1  2 |  0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 3 with (-3/2 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  2   1   1 |  4 ]\n[  1   2  -1 |  5 ]\n[  0  -2   1 | -6 ]\n```\n\n3. Swap Row 2 and Row 3 to have the largest absolute value in the second column:\n\n```\n[  2   1   1 |  4 ]\n[  0  -2   1 | -6 ]\n[  1   2  -1 |  5 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 1 with (-1/2 * Row 3) + Row 1:\n\n```\n[  2   0   2 |  2 ]\n[  0  -2   1 | -6 ]\n[  1   2  -1 |  5 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 1 with (1/2 * Row 1):\n\n```\n[  1   0   1 |  1 ]\n[  0  -2   1 | -6 ]\n[  1   2  -1 |  5 ]\n```\n\n6. Replace Row 3 with (-1 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  1   0   1 |  1 ]\n[  0  -2   1 | -6 ]\n[  0   2  -2 |  4 ]\n```\n\n7. Replace Row 3 with (-1 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  1   0   1 |  1 ]\n[  0  -2   1 | -6 ]\n[  0   0  -1 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can perform back-substitution to find the solution:\n\n1. z = -2\n2. -2y + z = -6 => y = 1\n3. x + z = 1 => x = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 1, and z = -2."
