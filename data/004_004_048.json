    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 3x^2 - 2x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the indefinite integral of the function:\n\n∫(3x^2 - 2x + 1) dx\n\nTo do this, we'll integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(2x) dx + ∫(1) dx\n\nNow, we'll apply the power rule for integration, which states that ∫(x^n) dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration:\n\n(3x^(2+1))/(2+1) - (2x^(1+1))/(1+1) + (1x^(0+1))/(0+1) + C\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n(x^3) - x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we'll find the definite integral by evaluating the indefinite integral at the limits x = 2 and x = 0:\n\n[(2^3) - (2^2) + (2)] - [(0^3) - (0^2) + (0)]\n\nCalculating the values:\n\n[(8 - 4 + 2)] - [(0 - 0 + 0)]\n\n(6) - (0)\n\nThe area under the curve y = 3x^2 - 2x + 1 between x = 0 and x = 2 is 6 square units."
