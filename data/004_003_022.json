    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to maximize the profit of a product by determining the quantity to produce. The profit, P, is given by P = 50x - 0.02x^2 - 500, where x is the quantity produced. How many items should the manufacturer produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the quantity that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function P(x) = 50x - 0.02x^2 - 500. We do this by taking the first derivative of P(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0.\n\ndP/dx = d(50x - 0.02x^2 - 500)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndP/dx = 50 - 0.04x\n\nNow, we set the first derivative equal to 0 to find the critical points:\n\n50 - 0.04x = 0\n\n0.04x = 50\n\nx = 50 / 0.04\n\nx = 1250\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a maximum or minimum. We do this by taking the second derivative of P(x) and evaluating it at x = 1250:\n\nd²P/dx² = d²(50x - 0.02x^2 - 500)/dx²\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nd²P/dx² = -0.04\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point x = 1250 corresponds to a maximum. Therefore, the manufacturer should produce 1250 items to maximize the profit."
