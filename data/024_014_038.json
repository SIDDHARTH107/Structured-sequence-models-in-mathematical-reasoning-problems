    "message_2": "To find the Lie derivative of V(x,y) with respect to W(x,y), we need to compute the Lie bracket [W, V]. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n[W, V] = (W∇)V - (V∇)W\n\nwhere W∇ and V∇ are the covariant derivatives along the vector fields W and V, respectively. In Cartesian coordinates, the covariant derivative is just the ordinary derivative. So, we have:\n\n(W∇)V = (2x ∂/∂x + y ∂/∂y)(x^2 + y^2, xy) = (4x^3 + 4x^2y, 2x^2y + y^3)\n\n(V∇)W = ((x^2 + y^2) ∂/∂x + xy ∂/∂y)(2x, y) = (4x^3 + 2xy^2, 2x^2y + y^3)\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie bracket [W, V]:\n\n[W, V] = (W∇)V - (V∇)W = ((4x^3 + 4x^2y, 2x^2y + y^3) - (4x^3 + 2xy^2, 2x^2y + y^3)) = (2x^2y - 2xy^2, 0)\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (1,1):\n\n[W, V](1,1) = (2(1)^2(1) - 2(1)(1)^2, 0) = (0, 0)"
