    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm, one base is 6 cm, and the other base is 14 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, one base is 6 cm, and the other base is 14 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 14) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (20) * 8\n\nArea = 10 * 8\n\nArea = 80 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 80 square centimeters."
