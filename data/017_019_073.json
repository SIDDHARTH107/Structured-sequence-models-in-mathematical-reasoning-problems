Cyclic group: C_36\nThis is the group of order 36 with elements generated by a single element, say a, such that a^36 = e (identity element). It has the structure C_36 = {e, a, a^2, ..., a^35}.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_9 × C_4\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It has the structure C_9 × C_4 = {(a^i, b^j) | 0 ≤ i ≤ 8, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3}, where a^9 = e and b^4 = e.\n\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_3 × C_12\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 12. It has the structure C_3 × C_12 = {(a^i, b^j) | 0 ≤ i ≤ 2, 0 ≤ j ≤ 11}, where a^3 = e and b^12 = e.\n\n4. Semidirect product of C_9 and C_4: C_9 ⋊ C_4\nThis group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 4. It is non-abelian and has the structure C_9 ⋊ C_4 = {a^i * b^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ 8, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3}, where a^9 = e, b^4 = e, and b * a * b^(-1) = a^k for some k not equal to 1.\n\nThese are the four non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
