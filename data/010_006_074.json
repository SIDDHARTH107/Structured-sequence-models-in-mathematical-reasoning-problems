    "message_2": "Since X is homeomorphic to $S^2$, we can assume that X is $S^2$. Now, we want to compute the fundamental group of the product space $S^2 \\times Y$. \n\nRecall the following theorem: If X and Y are topological spaces, then $\\pi_1(X \\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(X) \\times \\pi_1(Y)$.\n\nIn our case, X is $S^2$. The fundamental group of $S^2$ is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^2) = \\{e\\}$, where e is the identity element. This is because $S^2$ is simply connected, meaning it is connected and every loop can be continuously deformed to a point.\n\nNow, we can apply the theorem:\n\n$\\pi_1(S^2 \\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(S^2) \\times \\pi_1(Y) \\cong \\{e\\} \\times \\pi_1(Y)$.\n\nSince the direct product of a trivial group with any group G is isomorphic to G itself, we have:\n\n$\\pi_1(S^2 \\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(Y)$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the product space $S^2 \\times Y$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of Y."
