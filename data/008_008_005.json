    "message_1": "A farmer has 600 acres of land for planting corn and soybeans. Each acre of corn requires 2 units of fertilizer and 1 unit of insecticide, while each acre of soybeans requires 1 unit of fertilizer and 3 units of insecticide. The farmer has 800 units of fertilizer and 900 units of insecticide. If the profit for each acre of corn is $500 and the profit for each acre of soybeans is $700, how many acres of each crop should the farmer plant to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of soybeans.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Total acres: x + y ≤ 600\n2. Fertilizer: 2x + y ≤ 800\n3. Insecticide: x + 3y ≤ 900\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 500x + 700y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region.\n\n1. y ≤ 600 - x\n2. y ≤ 800 - 2x\n3. y ≤ (900 - x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\nx + y = 600\n2x + y = 800\n=> x = 200, y = 400\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\nx + y = 600\nx + 3y = 900\n=> x = 300, y = 300\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\n2x + y = 800\nx + 3y = 900\n=> x = 100, y = 600\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(200, 400) = 500(200) + 700(400) = 100,000 + 280,000 = 380,000\nP(300, 300) = 500(300) + 700(300) = 150,000 + 210,000 = 360,000\nP(100, 600) = 500(100) + 700(600) = 50,000 + 420,000 = 470,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $470,000, which occurs when the farmer plants 100 acres of corn and 600 acres of soybeans."
