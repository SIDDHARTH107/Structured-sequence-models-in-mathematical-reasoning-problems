    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 4, we will shift each letter 4 positions to the right in the alphabet. If a letter goes beyond 'Z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet. Here's the encrypted message:\n\nM -> Q\nA -> E\nT -> X\nH -> L\nE -> I\nM -> Q\nA -> E\nT -> X\nI -> M\nC -> G\nS -> W\n\nSo, the encrypted code for the message \"MATHEMATICS\" is \"QEXLQEXMIGW\"."
