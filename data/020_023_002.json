The expected return on the stocks is 8% with a variance of 0.03, while the expected return on bonds is 5% with a variance of 0.01. What is the optimal allocation of your investment between stocks and bonds in order to maximize your expected return while minimizing your risk? Assume there is no correlation between the returns on stocks and bonds. ",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the efficient frontier, which is a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. In this case, we have two assets: stocks and bonds, with their respective expected returns, variances, and no correlation between them.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the investment in stocks and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in bonds. The total investment is $100,000.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio, E(Rp), can be calculated as follows:\n\nE(Rp) = x * E(Rs) + (1-x) * E(Rb)\n\nwhere E(Rs) is the expected return on stocks (8%) and E(Rb) is the expected return on bonds (5%).\n\nThe variance of the portfolio, Var(Rp), can be calculated as follows:\n\nVar(Rp) = x^2 * Var(Rs) + (1-x)^2 * Var(Rb) + 2 * x * (1-x) * Cov(Rs, Rb)\n\nSince there is no correlation between the returns on stocks and bonds, the covariance term, Cov(Rs, Rb), is 0. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\nVar(Rp) = x^2 * Var(Rs) + (1-x)^2 * Var(Rb)\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal allocation (x) that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk (variance). To do this, we can use the concept of the Sharpe ratio, which is the ratio of the excess return of the portfolio to its standard deviation:\n\nSharpe ratio = (E(Rp) - Rf) / StdDev(Rp)\n\nwhere Rf is the risk-free rate. In this problem, the risk-free rate is not given, so we can assume it to be 0 for simplicity.\n\nWe want to maximize the Sharpe ratio, so we can take the derivative of the Sharpe ratio with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Sharpe ratio) / dx = 0\n\nAfter solving for x, we can find the optimal allocation between stocks and bonds. However, this calculus-based approach can be quite complex. Instead, we can use a simpler approach by trying different values of x and calculating the corresponding Sharpe ratios.\n\nFor example, let's try x = 0.5 (50% in stocks and 50% in bonds):\n\nE(Rp) = 0.5 * 0.08 + 0.5 * 0.05 = 0.065 (6.5%)\nVar(Rp) = 0.5^2 * 0.03 + 0.5^2 * 0.01 = 0.01 (1%)\nStdDev(Rp) = sqrt(0.01) = 0.1 (10%)\n\nSharpe ratio = (0.065 - 0) / 0.1 = 0.65\n\nYou can try different values of x and calculate the corresponding Sharpe ratios. The optimal allocation will be the one that results in the highest Sharpe ratio. In practice, you can use optimization techniques or software to find the optimal allocation more efficiently."
