    "message_1": "A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 500 meters and spots a boat in a nearby lake at an angle of depression of 30 degrees. What is the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the boat? (Assume the helicopter is directly above the boat when it spots it)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Since we know the angle of depression and the altitude of the helicopter, we can use the tangent function to find the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the boat.\n\nLet's denote the horizontal distance as x. The angle of depression is 30 degrees, and the altitude of the helicopter is 500 meters. We can set up the following equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(30°) = 500 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 500 / tan(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 500 / 0.57735\nx ≈ 865.26 meters\n\nSo, the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the boat is approximately 865.26 meters."
