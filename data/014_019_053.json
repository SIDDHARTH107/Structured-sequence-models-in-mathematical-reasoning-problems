    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a message that was encrypted using a transposition cipher that involves rearranging the letters of a plaintext message. If the original message was \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\", and the ciphertext produced was \"MTFIUSHASAIMETXEN\", how many rows of text were likely used to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of rows used in the transposition cipher, we first need to find the length of the original message without spaces. The original message is \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\", which has 16 characters without spaces.\n\nNow, we need to find the factors of 16 to determine the possible number of rows and columns used in the transposition cipher. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.\n\nWe can eliminate 1 and 16 as the number of rows since they would result in no transposition (1 row would mean the message stays the same, and 16 rows would mean each letter is in its own row). This leaves us with 2, 4, and 8 as possible numbers of rows.\n\nLet's test each possibility:\n\n1. 2 rows:\n\nM T F I U S H A\nS A I M E T X E N\n\nDecrypted message: \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\"\n\n2. 4 rows:\n\nM A T H\nE M A T\nI C S I\nS F U N\n\nDecrypted message: \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\"\n\n3. 8 rows:\n\nM A T H E M A\nT I C S I S\nF U N\n\nDecrypted message: \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\"\n\nIn this case, all three possibilities (2, 4, and 8 rows) result in the correct decrypted message. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact number of rows used to encrypt the message."
