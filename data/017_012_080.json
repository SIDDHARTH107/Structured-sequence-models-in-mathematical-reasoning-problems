    "message_2": "To prove that H is a normal subgroup of G, we will use the fact that the index of H in G is 2. Recall that a subgroup of index 2 is always normal. The index of H in G is given by [G : H] = |G| / |H| = 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16 or the non-abelian group of order 16. We will consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 16.\nIf G has an element of order 16, then G is a cyclic group generated by that element, and G is isomorphic to C16.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 16.\nIn this case, all elements of G must have orders that are divisors of 16. Since G does not have an element of order 16, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\nWe know that H is a subgroup of order 8, so there exists an element h in H with order 8. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G| / |H| = 16 / 8 = 2, so G/H is isomorphic to C2.\n\nLet g be an element of G that is not in H. Then, the order of g must be 2, as G/H is isomorphic to C2. Consider the element gh, where h is an element of H with order 8. We have (gh)^2 = g^2h^2 = h^2, since g^2 = e (the identity element) and ghg^(-1) is in H (as H is normal). Thus, the order of gh is 4.\n\nNow, we have elements of orders 1 (the identity), 2 (g), 4 (gh), and 8 (h) in G. We can construct a non-abelian group of order 16 using these elements, which is the dihedral group D8. The group G is isomorphic to D8 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16 or the non-abelian group of order 16 (the dihedral group D8)."
