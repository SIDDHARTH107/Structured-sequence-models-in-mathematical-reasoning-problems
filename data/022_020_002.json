    "message_2": "To find the analytic function f(z) in the unit disk |z| < 1, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the given boundary conditions. Since f(z) is analytic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\ndu/dx = dv/dy and du/dy = -dv/dx\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nu(e^(iθ), 0) = cosθ for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π\nv(e^(iθ), 0) = sinθ for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π\n\nLet's rewrite the boundary conditions in terms of z:\n\nu(z, 0) = Re(z) for |z| = 1 and 0 ≤ arg(z) ≤ π\nv(z, 0) = Im(z) for |z| = 1 and 0 ≤ arg(z) ≤ π\n\nNow, let's use the Poisson integral formula to find the harmonic functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) in the unit disk |z| < 1. The Poisson integral formula for a harmonic function u(x, y) with boundary values u(z, 0) is:\n\nu(x, y) = (1/2π) ∫_(θ=0)^(π) [u(e^(iθ), 0) * (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(θ - φ) + r^2)] dθ\n\nwhere z = re^(iφ) and |z| < 1.\n\nUsing the given boundary values, we have:\n\nu(x, y) = (1/2π) ∫_(θ=0)^(π) [cos(θ) * (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(θ - φ) + r^2)] dθ\n\nSimilarly, for v(x, y):\n\nv(x, y) = (1/2π) ∫_(θ=0)^(π) [sin(θ) * (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(θ - φ) + r^2)] dθ\n\nNow, we can find the analytic function f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) by combining the expressions for u(x, y) and v(x, y):\n\nf(z) = (1/2π) ∫_(θ=0)^(π) [(cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)) * (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(θ - φ) + r^2)] dθ\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can use the fact that e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ) and rewrite the integral:\n\nf(z) = (1/2π) ∫_(θ=0)^(π) [e^(iθ) * (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(θ - φ) + r^2)] dθ\n\nNow, we can use the change of variables t = θ - φ:\n\nf(z) = (1/2π) ∫_(t=-φ)^(π-φ) [e^(i(t+φ)) * (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(t) + r^2)] dt\n\nFinally, we can recognize this integral as the convolution of e^(iφ) and the Poisson kernel. The convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier series coefficients. The Fourier series coefficients of e^(iφ) are 1 for n = 1 and 0 for all other n. Therefore, the convolution is equal to the Poisson kernel itself:\n\nf(z) = (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2r*cos(φ) + r^2)\n\nThis is the analytic function f(z) in the unit disk |z| < 1 with the given boundary conditions."
