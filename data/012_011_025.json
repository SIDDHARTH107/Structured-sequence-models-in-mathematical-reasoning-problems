    "message_2": "To find the number of cut vertices and determine if there are any bridges in the graph, we can use the following properties:\n\n1. A graph with n vertices and m edges is a tree if and only if it is connected and has n-1 edges. A tree has no cycles and all its edges are bridges.\n\n2. A vertex is a cut vertex if and only if its removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nSince the given graph has 8 vertices and 10 edges, it is not a tree (as it has more than 7 edges). Therefore, it must contain at least one cycle.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of cut vertices. A cut vertex can be found by checking if the removal of a vertex disconnects the graph. We can use DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms to check the connectivity of the graph after removing each vertex.\n\nHowever, without the specific adjacency list or adjacency matrix of the graph, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices or whether the graph contains any bridges or not.\n\nIn general, a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges can have varying numbers of cut vertices and bridges depending on its structure."
