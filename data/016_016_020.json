    "message_1": "A Gosper curve is created by starting with an equilateral triangle and replacing each line segment with a specific pattern of smaller line segments. If the original triangle has a side length of 27 units, what is the total length of the curve after the first 5 iterations of this replacement process? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "The Gosper curve is a fractal curve, and its length increases with each iteration. In each iteration, each line segment is replaced by a pattern of 7 smaller line segments, each of which is 1/3 the length of the original segment. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is 7 times the original length divided by 3. After the second iteration, the length of the curve is 7 times the length after the first iteration divided by 3, and so on.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the curve after 5 iterations:\n\nOriginal length: 27 units (side length of the equilateral triangle)\n\n1st iteration: (7/3) * 27\n2nd iteration: (7/3) * (7/3) * 27\n3rd iteration: (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) * 27\n4th iteration: (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) * 27\n5th iteration: (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) * (7/3) * 27\n\n5th iteration: (7^5 / 3^5) * 27\n\nNow, we need to multiply this length by 3 since there are 3 sides in the equilateral triangle:\n\nTotal length after 5 iterations: 3 * (7^5 / 3^5) * 27\n\nTotal length after 5 iterations ≈ 3 * (16807 / 243) * 27 ≈ 1868.96\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the total length of the curve after the first 5 iterations is approximately 1869 units."
