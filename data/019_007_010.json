    "message_1": "Unfortunately, Non-monotonic logic does not usually involve numerical problems. It is a type of logic that deals with reasoning and decision-making in situations where the available information is uncertain or incomplete. Can I offer you a question related to Non-monotonic logic that does not involve numerical problems?",
    "message_2": "Yes, I can provide you with a question related to Non-monotonic logic that does not involve numerical problems. \n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nJohn is a college student who usually attends his classes. However, today there is a major snowstorm in the area, and many classes have been canceled. You do not have any information about whether John's classes have been canceled or not. \n\nUsing Non-monotonic logic, can you determine if John will attend his classes today?"
