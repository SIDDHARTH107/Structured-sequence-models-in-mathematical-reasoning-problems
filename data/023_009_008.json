    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form u(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = X(x)T'(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)T(t), we obtain:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = T'(t)/T(t)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = T'(t)/T(t) = -λ^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + λ^2T(t) = 0\n\nThe boundary conditions for X(x) are X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0. The general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*sin(λx) + B*cos(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) = B = 0\nX(1) = A*sin(λ) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λ) = 0, which implies λ = nπ for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, the equation for T(t) is:\n\nT'(t) + (nπ)^2T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-(nπ)^2*t)\n\nThus, the solution for u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑(A_n*sin(nπx)*exp(-(nπ)^2*t))\n\nThe initial condition is u(x,0) = sin(πx). Comparing this with the general solution, we can see that A_1 = 1 and all other A_n = 0. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(πx)*exp(-(π^2)*t)\n\nNow we can find u(1/4, 1/2):\n\nu(1/4, 1/2) = sin(π*(1/4))*exp(-(π^2)*(1/2))\n\nu(1/4, 1/2) ≈ 0.71*0.14 = 0.0994\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, u(1/4, 1/2) ≈ 0.10."
