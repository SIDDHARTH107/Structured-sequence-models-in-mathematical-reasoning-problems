    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem. We have a topological space X with three open sets {∅, X, A}, where A is a non-empty proper subset of X. We want to find the maximum number of distinct topologies that can be defined on X.\n\nSince A is a proper subset of X, there exists at least one element in X that is not in A. Let's denote this element as x. Now, we have two cases:\n\n1. x is the only element not in A. In this case, X has two elements: x and A. The possible topologies on X are:\n\n   a. {∅, X, A}\n   b. {∅, X, {x}, A}\n\n2. There is more than one element not in A. In this case, X has at least three elements: x, y (another element not in A), and A. The possible topologies on X are:\n\n   a. {∅, X, A}\n   b. {∅, X, A, {x}}\n   c. {∅, X, A, {y}}\n   d. {∅, X, A, {x, y}}\n\nIn both cases, we can see that the maximum number of distinct topologies that can be defined on X is 4."
