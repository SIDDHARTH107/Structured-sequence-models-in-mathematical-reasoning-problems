    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 637, we can start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, 2. Since 637 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We move on to the next smallest prime number, 3.\n\n637 รท 3 = 212 with a remainder of 1. So, 637 is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, we try dividing 637 by the next smallest prime number, 5.\n\n637 รท 5 = 127 with a remainder of 2. So, 637 is not divisible by 5.\n\nNow, we try dividing 637 by the next smallest prime number, 7.\n\n637 รท 7 = 91 with no remainder. Since 637 is divisible by 7, the smallest prime factor of 637 is 7."
