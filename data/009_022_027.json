Take L = 5 and use a spatial step size of h = 0.1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the reaction-diffusion equation using the finite difference method, we will discretize the spatial and temporal domains. Let's use a spatial step size of h = 0.1 and a time step size of k. We will use the forward difference for the time derivative and the central difference for the spatial second derivative.\n\nLet u_i^n denote the concentration u(x_i, t_n), where x_i = i * h and t_n = n * k. The discretized equation is:\n\n(u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n) / k = D * (u_{i+1}^n - 2 * u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n) / h^2 + f(u_i^n)\n\nNow, we need to choose a suitable time step size k. To ensure stability, we can use the following condition:\n\nk <= h^2 / (2 * D)\n\nFor D = 0.5 and h = 0.1, we have k <= 0.01. Let's choose k = 0.01.\n\nNext, we set up the initial condition:\n\nu_i^0 = 1 for |x_i| < L and u_i^0 = 0 for |x_i| > L\n\nNow, we can use the discretized equation to compute the concentration profile at t = 1. Since t = 1 corresponds to n = 100 (1 / 0.01), we need to perform 100 time steps.\n\nFor each time step, we update the concentration profile using the discretized equation:\n\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + k * (D * (u_{i+1}^n - 2 * u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n) / h^2 + f(u_i^n))\n\nWe perform this update for all spatial points i and repeat it for 100 time steps.\n\nAfter completing the 100 time steps, we obtain the concentration profile u(x, t=1) as the values of u_i^100 for all spatial points x_i."
