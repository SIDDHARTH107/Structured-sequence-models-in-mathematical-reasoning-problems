    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\n\"The rate of formation of product in a chemical reaction is given by the following rate equation: \n\nr = k[A]^2[B]\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration of reactant A, and [B] is the concentration of reactant B. The initial concentrations of reactants A and B are given by [A]0 = 0.2 M and [B]0 = 0.3 M. If the rate constant k is equal to 0.002 M-1s-1, what is the rate of formation of product when [A] = 0.1 M and [B] = 0.2 M?\"",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of formation of the product, we can plug the given values into the rate equation:\n\nr = k[A]^2[B]\n\nGiven values:\nk = 0.002 M^-1s^-1\n[A] = 0.1 M\n[B] = 0.2 M\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation:\n\nr = (0.002 M^-1s^-1)(0.1 M)^2(0.2 M)\n\nr = (0.002)(0.01)(0.2)\n\nr = 0.00004 M/s\n\nSo, the rate of formation of the product when [A] = 0.1 M and [B] = 0.2 M is 0.00004 M/s."
