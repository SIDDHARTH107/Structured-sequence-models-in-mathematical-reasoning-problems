    "message_1": "Suppose a botanist is comparing the growth rates of four different types of plants (A, B, C, and D) at three different temperatures (50°F, 70°F, and 90°F). The botanist graphed the data and observed the following means:\n\n- Mean growth rate for type A at 50°F is 5cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type B at 50°F is 6cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type C at 50°F is 7cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type D at 50°F is 8cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type A at 70°F is 10cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type B at 70°F is 11cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type C at 70°F is 12cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type D at 70°F is 13cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type A at 90°F is 15cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type B at 90°F is 16cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type C at 90°F is 17cm.\n- Mean growth rate for type D at 90°F is 18cm.\n\nIf the botanist wants to find out whether there are significant differences in the growth rates of each plant type across different temperatures, the student could use ANOVA to statistically test the hypothesis. \n\nThe precise question for the math student to solve is: \"Perform a one-way ANOVA test to determine if there are any significant differences in the growth rates of the four types of plants across three different temperatures.\"",
    "message_2": "To perform a one-way ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following:\n\n1. The overall mean (grand mean) of all the growth rates.\n2. The sum of squares between groups (SSB).\n3. The sum of squares within groups (SSW).\n4. The mean square between groups (MSB) and mean square within groups (MSW).\n5. The F-statistic.\n\nLet's calculate these step by step:\n\n1. Overall mean (grand mean):\n\n(5+6+7+8+10+11+12+13+15+16+17+18) / 12 = 128 / 12 = 10.67\n\n2. Sum of squares between groups (SSB):\n\nSSB = Σn_i (mean_i - grand_mean)^2, where n_i is the number of observations in each group (in this case, 3 for each plant type) and mean_i is the mean growth rate for each plant type.\n\nFor type A: 3 * (6.67 - 10.67)^2 = 3 * 16 = 48\nFor type B: 3 * (7.67 - 10.67)^2 = 3 * 9 = 27\nFor type C: 3 * (8.67 - 10.67)^2 = 3 * 4 = 12\nFor type D: 3 * (9.67 - 10.67)^2 = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nSSB = 48 + 27 + 12 + 3 = 90\n\n3. Sum of squares within groups (SSW):\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_i)^2, where x_ij is the individual observation and mean_i is the mean growth rate for each plant type.\n\nFor type A: (5-6.67)^2 + (10-6.67)^2 + (15-6.67)^2 = 2.78 + 11.11 + 69.44 = 83.33\nFor type B: (6-7.67)^2 + (11-7.67)^2 + (16-7.67)^2 = 2.78 + 11.11 + 69.44 = 83.33\nFor type C: (7-8.67)^2 + (12-8.67)^2 + (17-8.67)^2 = 2.78 + 11.11 + 69.44 = 83.33\nFor type D: (8-9.67)^2 + (13-9.67)^2 + (18-9.67)^2 = 2.78 + 11.11 + 69.44 = 83.33\n\nSSW = 83.33 + 83.33 + 83.33 + 83.33 = 333.32\n\n4. Mean square between groups (MSB) and mean square within groups (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1) = 90 / (4 - 1) = 30\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of groups) = 333.32 / (12 - 4) = 55.55\n\n5. F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 30 / 55.55 = 0.54\n\nNow, we need to compare the F-statistic with the critical value from the F-distribution table. We will use a significance level of 0.05. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (df1) is the number of groups - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. The degrees of freedom for the denominator (df2) is the total number of observations - number of groups = 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nLooking up the F-distribution table for df1 = 3 and df2 = 8 at a 0.05 significance level, we find the critical value to be 4.07.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (0.54) is less than the critical value (4.07), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference in the growth rates of the four types of plants across the three different temperatures."
