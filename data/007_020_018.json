    "message_1": "Suppose you are given two prime numbers p = 47 and q = 71. Use the RSA encryption algorithm to encrypt the message M = 5. Take e = 79 as the encryption key. What is the encrypted message C?",
    "message_2": "To use the RSA encryption algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)\n3. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 (e is given as 79)\n4. Compute the encrypted message C using the formula: C ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. n = 47 * 71 = 3337\n2. φ(n) = (47-1)*(71-1) = 46 * 70 = 3220\n3. e is given as 79, and gcd(79, 3220) = 1, so it's a valid choice.\n4. C ≡ M^e (mod n) = 5^79 (mod 3337)\n\nTo calculate 5^79 (mod 3337), we can use the exponentiation by squaring method:\n\n5^1 (mod 3337) = 5\n5^2 (mod 3337) = 25\n5^4 (mod 3337) = 625\n5^8 (mod 3337) = 2790\n5^16 (mod 3337) = 2189\n5^32 (mod 3337) = 157\n5^64 (mod 3337) = 2894\n\nNow, we can multiply the necessary powers together (mod 3337):\n\n5^79 = 5^(64+8+4+2+1) = (5^64)*(5^8)*(5^4)*(5^2)*(5^1) (mod 3337)\nC = (2894*2790*625*25*5) (mod 3337)\nC = 1206942306250 (mod 3337)\nC = 2791\n\nSo, the encrypted message C is 2791."
