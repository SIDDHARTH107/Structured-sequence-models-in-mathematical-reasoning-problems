    "message_2": "To find the values of sin θ, cos θ, and tan θ when θ = 30°, we can use the following trigonometric ratios:\n\nsin θ = opposite side / hypotenuse\ncos θ = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ntan θ = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nFor a 30° angle, we can use a 30-60-90 right triangle, where the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. In this triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is 1, the side adjacent to the 30° angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nNow, we can find the trigonometric ratios:\n\nsin 30° = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1 / 2\ncos 30° = adjacent side / hypotenuse = √3 / 2\ntan 30° = opposite side / adjacent side = 1 / √3 = √3 / 3 (by rationalizing the denominator)\n\nSo, the values of the trigonometric ratios are:\n\nsin 30° = 1/2\ncos 30° = √3/2\ntan 30° = √3/3"
