    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has dimensions of length 8 cm, width 6 cm, and height 10 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of this rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. If the length, width, and height of the prism are given by l, w, and h, respectively, then the length of the diagonal (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nIn this case, l = 8 cm, w = 6 cm, and h = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(8² + 6² + 10²)\nd = √(64 + 36 + 100)\nd = √200\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √200 cm, which can be simplified to 10√2 cm."
