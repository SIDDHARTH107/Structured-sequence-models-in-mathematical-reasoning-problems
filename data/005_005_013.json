    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected bolt will be between 8 mm and 12 mm in length, we can use the Z-score formula to standardize the values and then use the standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the probabilities.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the Z-scores for 8 mm and 12 mm.\n\nFor 8 mm:\nZ = (8 - 10) / 1.5 = -2 / 1.5 = -1.33\n\nFor 12 mm:\nZ = (12 - 10) / 1.5 = 2 / 1.5 = 1.33\n\nNow, we'll use the Z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores.\n\nFor Z = -1.33, the probability is 0.0918 (or 9.18%).\nFor Z = 1.33, the probability is 0.9082 (or 90.82%).\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected bolt will be between 8 mm and 12 mm in length, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(8 mm < X < 12 mm) = P(Z = 1.33) - P(Z = -1.33) = 0.9082 - 0.0918 = 0.8164\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected bolt will be between 8 mm and 12 mm in length is approximately 0.8164, or 81.64%."
