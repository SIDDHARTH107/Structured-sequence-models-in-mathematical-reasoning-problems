The distances (in km) between the cities are given in the matrix below:\n\n|    | City 1 | City 2 | City 3 | City 4 | City 5 | City 6 |\n|----|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1  |  --    |   8    |   20   |   30   |   25   |   15   |\n| 2  |   8    |   --   |   12   |   18   |   21   |   24   |\n| 3  |   20   |   12   |   --   |   22   |   20   |   17   |\n| 4  |   30   |   18   |   22   |   --   |   10   |   30   |\n| 5  |   25   |   21   |   20   |   10   |   --   |   28   |\n| 6  |   15   |   24   |   17   |   30   |   28   |   --   |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost to build a network of roads that connects all 6 cities?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to build a network of roads that connects all 6 cities, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Both algorithms are used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. In this case, the cities are the vertices, and the distances between them are the edge weights.\n\nI will use Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in ascending order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the graph in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the graph.\n4. Continue adding edges until all the vertices are connected.\n\nSorted edges:\n(1, 2) - 8\n(4, 5) - 10\n(1, 6) - 15\n(3, 6) - 17\n(2, 3) - 12\n(2, 4) - 18\n(3, 5) - 20\n(1, 3) - 20\n(1, 5) - 25\n(2, 5) - 21\n(3, 4) - 22\n(1, 4) - 30\n(4, 6) - 30\n(5, 6) - 28\n(2, 6) - 24\n\nAdding edges to the minimum spanning tree:\n(1, 2) - 8\n(4, 5) - 10\n(1, 6) - 15\n(3, 6) - 17\n(2, 3) - 12\n\nThe minimum spanning tree now connects all 6 cities. The minimum cost to build the network of roads is the sum of the edge weights in the minimum spanning tree:\n\n8 + 10 + 15 + 17 + 12 = 62\n\nThe minimum cost to build a network of roads that connects all 6 cities is 62 km."
