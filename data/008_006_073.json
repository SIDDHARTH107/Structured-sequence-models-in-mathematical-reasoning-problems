So, the eigenvector v1 is:\n\nv1 = [2; 1]\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([3 - (-1), 4; 2, 1 - (-1)]v2 = [0; 0]\n([4, 4; 2, 2]v2 = [0; 0]\n\nWe can rewrite the system of equations as:\n\n4x + 4y = 0\n2x + 2y = 0\n\nThese equations are linearly dependent, so we can remove one of them:\n\n4x + 4y = 0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nx + y = 0\n\nLet x = 1, then y = -1. So, the eigenvector v2 is:\n\nv2 = [1; -1]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 5, Eigenvector v1 = [2; 1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = -1, Eigenvector v2 = [1; -1]"
