    "message_2": "To add two points P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2) on an elliptic curve, we need to find the slope λ and then use it to find the coordinates of the resulting point R = (x3, y3).\n\nIf P ≠ Q, the slope λ is given by:\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nSince we are working in a field with modulus 23, we need to perform all calculations modulo 23. In this case, P = (6, 10) and Q = (20, 7), so:\n\nλ = (7 - 10) / (20 - 6) ≡ (-3) / (14) ≡ 20 / 14 (mod 23)\n\nNow we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 14 modulo 23. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the inverse of 14 modulo 23 is 10. So:\n\nλ = 20 * 10 ≡ 200 ≡ 8 (mod 23)\n\nNow we can find the coordinates of the resulting point R:\n\nx3 = λ² - x1 - x2 ≡ 8² - 6 - 20 ≡ 64 - 6 - 20 ≡ 38 ≡ 15 (mod 23)\ny3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1 ≡ 8(6 - 15) - 10 ≡ 8(-9) - 10 ≡ (-72) - 10 ≡ 9 (mod 23)\n\nSo, the result of adding the points (6, 10) and (20, 7) on the given elliptic curve is R = (15, 9)."
