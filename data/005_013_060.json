Using multivariate analysis, calculate the correlation coefficient between hours studied and test scores. The data is as follows:\n\n| Hours Studied | Test Score |\n|-------|-------|\n|    1  |   48   |\n|    2  |   62   |\n|    3  |   69   |\n|    4  |   74   |\n|    5  |   82   |\n|    6  |   87   |\n|    7  |   91   |\n|    8  |   93   |\n|    9  |   95   |\n|   10  |   96   |\n|   11  |   97   |\n|   12  |   98   |\n|   13  |   98   |\n|   14  |   99   |\n|   15  |   99   |\n|   16  |   100   |\n|   17  |   100   |\n|   18  |   100   |\n|   19  |   100   |\n|   20  |   100   |",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between hours studied and test scores, we'll use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of x values (hours studied), and ȳ is the mean of y values (test scores).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the means of hours studied (x̄) and test scores (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 20) / 20 = 210 / 20 = 10.5\nȳ = (48 + 62 + 69 + ... + 100) / 20 = 1742 / 20 = 87.1\n\nNext, we'll calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator: Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)]\nDenominator: √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nNumerator:\n(1-10.5)(48-87.1) + (2-10.5)(62-87.1) + ... + (20-10.5)(100-87.1) = 1012.5\n\nDenominator:\n√[(1-10.5)² + (2-10.5)² + ... + (20-10.5)²] * [(48-87.1)² + (62-87.1)² + ... + (100-87.1)²] = √(697.5 * 5348.9) = 1817.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = 1012.5 / 1817.4 ≈ 0.557\n\nThe correlation coefficient between hours studied and test scores is approximately 0.557, indicating a moderate positive correlation."
