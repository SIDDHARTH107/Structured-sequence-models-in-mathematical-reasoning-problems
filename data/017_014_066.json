    "message_2": "To prove that there exists a group of order 20 that is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 20, we will construct a semi-direct product of two groups. Let's consider the cyclic groups Z_5 and Z_4, where Z_5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and Z_4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}. We know that |Z_5| = 5 and |Z_4| = 4, and since 5 and 4 are coprime, we have that |Z_5 × Z_4| = 20.\n\nNow, let's define a homomorphism φ: Z_4 → Aut(Z_5), where Aut(Z_5) is the group of automorphisms of Z_5. Since Z_5 is a cyclic group of prime order, Aut(Z_5) is isomorphic to Z_4. We can define φ as follows:\n\nφ(0) = id (identity automorphism)\nφ(1) = α (an automorphism of order 4)\nφ(2) = α²\nφ(3) = α³\n\nNow, we can construct the semi-direct product of Z_5 and Z_4 using this homomorphism, denoted as Z_5 ⋊_φ Z_4. The elements of this group are ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ Z_5 and b ∈ Z_4. The group operation is defined as:\n\n(a, b) * (c, d) = (a + φ(b)(c), b + d)\n\nSince φ is a non-trivial homomorphism, Z_5 ⋊_φ Z_4 is a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nNow, let's determine the Cayley table for Z_5 ⋊_φ Z_4. We will represent the elements of the group as (a, b), where a ∈ Z_5 and b ∈ Z_4. The Cayley table will be a 20x20 table, with rows and columns indexed by the elements of Z_5 ⋊_φ Z_4.\n\nTo compute the product of two elements (a, b) and (c, d), we use the group operation:\n\n(a, b) * (c, d) = (a + φ(b)(c), b + d)\n\nWe can fill in the Cayley table by computing the products for all pairs of elements in Z_5 ⋊_φ Z_4. Note that this process can be quite tedious and time-consuming, so it is often more practical to use a computer program or software to generate the Cayley table.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists a non-abelian group of order 20, specifically the semi-direct product Z_5 ⋊_φ Z_4, and we have described how to compute its Cayley table using the group operation."
