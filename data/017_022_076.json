    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 60 are there, and can you provide an example of each of these 32 groups?",
    "message_2": "There are five non-abelian groups of order 60, not 32. Here are the examples of each of these five groups:\n\n1. The symmetric group S5: This group consists of all the permutations of 5 elements. It has order 60 because there are 5! = 120 permutations, and S5 is non-abelian.\n\n2. The alternating group A5: This group consists of all the even permutations of 5 elements. It has order 60 because there are 5!/2 = 60 even permutations, and A5 is non-abelian.\n\n3. The direct product D5 x Z2: This group is formed by taking the direct product of the dihedral group D5 (which has order 10) and the cyclic group Z2 (which has order 2). The order of the direct product is 10 * 2 = 20, and D5 x Z2 is non-abelian.\n\n4. The direct product D3 x Z4: This group is formed by taking the direct product of the dihedral group D3 (which has order 6) and the cyclic group Z4 (which has order 4). The order of the direct product is 6 * 4 = 24, and D3 x Z4 is non-abelian.\n\n5. The direct product D2 x Z6: This group is formed by taking the direct product of the dihedral group D2 (which has order 4) and the cyclic group Z6 (which has order 6). The order of the direct product is 4 * 6 = 24, and D2 x Z6 is non-abelian.\n\nNote that the last three examples have orders 20, 24, and 24, which are not equal to 60. Therefore, there are only two non-abelian groups of order 60: S5 and A5."
