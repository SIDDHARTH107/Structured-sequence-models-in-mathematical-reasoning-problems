    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for a non-periodic function, we need to first convert the function into a periodic function by defining a period for it. However, the given function f(x) = 3x + 5cos(2x) - 2sin(3x) is not periodic, and therefore, it is not possible to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for this function.\n\nFourier series and coefficients are used to represent periodic functions, and since the given function is non-periodic, it cannot be represented by a Fourier series."
