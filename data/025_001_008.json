    "message_2": "To find the number of intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$xy^4 + 4x^3y = 0$ (1)\n\n$2x^2 - y^2 + 2x + y = 2$ (2)\n\nFirst, let's analyze equation (1). We can factor out an x and a y:\n\n$x(y^4 + 4x^2y) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two cases:\n\nCase 1: $x = 0$\n\nIf $x = 0$, then equation (2) becomes:\n\n$2(0)^2 - y^2 + 2(0) + y = 2$\n\n$-y^2 + y = 2$\n\n$y^2 - y - 2 = 0$\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n$(y - 2)(y + 1) = 0$\n\nSo, $y = 2$ or $y = -1$. Therefore, we have two intersection points in this case: $(0, 2)$ and $(0, -1)$.\n\nCase 2: $y^4 + 4x^2y = 0$\n\nIn this case, we can factor out a y:\n\n$y(y^3 + 4x^2) = 0$\n\nSo, either $y = 0$ or $y^3 + 4x^2 = 0$.\n\nIf $y = 0$, then equation (2) becomes:\n\n$2x^2 - (0)^2 + 2x + 0 = 2$\n\n$2x^2 + 2x = 2$\n\n$x^2 + x - 1 = 0$\n\nThis equation does not have rational roots, and it is difficult to find the exact number of real roots without using numerical methods. However, we can use the discriminant to determine the number of real roots. The discriminant is given by:\n\n$D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5$\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for x. Therefore, there are two intersection points in this case.\n\nIn total, we have found four intersection points: two from Case 1 and two from Case 2."
