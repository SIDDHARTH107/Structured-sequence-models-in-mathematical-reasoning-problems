    "message_2": "Euler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 7 vertices (V = 7) and 9 edges (E = 9). We want to determine if the graph is planar, so we need to check if there exists a value for F that satisfies Euler's formula.\n\nLet's solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 7 + 9\nF = 4\n\nSo, if the graph is planar, it should have 4 faces. Now, let's use the inequality for planar graphs to check if this graph can be planar:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V and E:\n\n9 ≤ 3(7) - 6\n9 ≤ 21 - 6\n9 ≤ 15\n\nSince the inequality holds true, it is possible for the graph to be planar. However, this is not a guarantee that the graph is planar, as the inequality is a necessary but not sufficient condition for planarity. To be absolutely certain, one would need to either find a planar embedding of the graph or use a more advanced algorithm like Kuratowski's theorem to test for planarity. But based on Euler's formula and the inequality, it seems likely that the graph is planar."
