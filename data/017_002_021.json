    "message_2": "To determine all possible subgroups of G, we will use the fact that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since the order of G is 8, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 4, and 8. We will now find the subgroups of each order.\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\n2. Order 2: We need to find elements of order 2 in G. Since G is a cyclic group of order 8, it is generated by an element g such that g^8 = e. The element g^4 has order 2, because (g^4)^2 = g^8 = e. So, the subgroup of order 2 is ⟨g^4⟩ = {e, g^4}.\n\n3. Order 4: We need to find elements of order 4 in G. The element g^2 has order 4, because (g^2)^4 = g^8 = e. So, the subgroup of order 4 is ⟨g^2⟩ = {e, g^2, g^4, g^6}.\n\n4. Order 8: The entire group G itself, which is ⟨g⟩ = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7}.\n\nNow, we will show that each of these subgroups is cyclic:\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {e} is cyclic, as it is generated by the identity element e.\n\n2. The subgroup ⟨g^4⟩ = {e, g^4} is cyclic, as it is generated by the element g^4.\n\n3. The subgroup ⟨g^2⟩ = {e, g^2, g^4, g^6} is cyclic, as it is generated by the element g^2.\n\n4. The entire group G = ⟨g⟩ = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7} is cyclic by definition, as it is generated by the element g.\n\nThus, all subgroups of G are cyclic."
