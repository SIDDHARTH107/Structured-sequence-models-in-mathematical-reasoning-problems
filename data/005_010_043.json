    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a box containing 100 balls, out of which 60 are blue and 40 are red. You randomly select 10 balls from the box without replacement, and find that 6 of them are blue. What is the probability that the next ball you select from the box will be red, given that 6 of the first 10 balls you selected were blue?",
    "message_2": "Given that 6 of the first 10 balls selected were blue, we know that there are now 54 blue balls (60 - 6) and 34 red balls (40 - (10 - 6)) left in the box. There are a total of 90 balls remaining in the box (100 - 10).\n\nThe probability that the next ball selected will be red is the ratio of the number of red balls remaining to the total number of balls remaining. \n\nProbability = (Number of red balls remaining) / (Total number of balls remaining)\nProbability = 34 / 90\nProbability â‰ˆ 0.3778\n\nSo, the probability that the next ball selected will be red, given that 6 of the first 10 balls selected were blue, is approximately 0.3778 or 37.78%."
