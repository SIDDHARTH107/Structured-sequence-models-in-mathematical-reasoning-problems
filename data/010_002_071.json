Prove that the singleton set {x} is closed in X. \n\nLet the student prove whether the singleton set {x} is closed in X or not using the given conditions.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the singleton set {x} is closed in X, we need to show that its complement, X \\ {x}, is open in X. Recall that a set is open in a topological space if for every point in the set, there exists an open neighborhood around that point contained entirely within the set.\n\nLet y be an arbitrary point in X \\ {x}. Since y is not equal to x, there exists an open neighborhood U_y containing y such that x is not in U_y. This is because x_n converges to x, so for any open neighborhood V_x containing x, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n > N, x_n is in V_x. Since y is not equal to x, there must be a positive integer n > N such that x_n is not in U_y. Therefore, U_y does not contain x.\n\nNow, we have shown that for every point y in X \\ {x}, there exists an open neighborhood U_y containing y and not containing x. Thus, X \\ {x} is a union of open neighborhoods, which implies that X \\ {x} is open in X.\n\nSince the complement of {x} is open in X, the singleton set {x} is closed in X."
