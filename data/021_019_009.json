    "message_2": "Harmony search (HS) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. To apply HS to find the global minimum of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 in the interval [0, 2], we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters:\n   - Harmony memory size (HMS): number of solutions stored in the harmony memory (e.g., HMS = 10)\n   - Harmony memory considering rate (HMCR): probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., HMCR = 0.8)\n   - Pitch adjusting rate (PAR): probability of adjusting a selected value (e.g., PAR = 0.3)\n   - Number of iterations (NI): number of times the algorithm will be repeated (e.g., NI = 1000)\n   - Step size (bw): maximum change allowed for pitch adjustment (e.g., bw = 0.1)\n\n2. Initialize the harmony memory (HM) with HMS random solutions in the interval [0, 2].\n\n3. Repeat the following steps for NI iterations:\n   a. Create a new harmony vector (solution) by considering each decision variable (in this case, x):\n      i. Generate a random number r1.\n      ii. If r1 < HMCR, select a value from the HM for the decision variable. Otherwise, generate a random value in the interval [0, 2].\n      iii. Generate another random number r2. If r2 < PAR, adjust the selected value by adding or subtracting a random number in the range [-bw, bw].\n   b. Evaluate the new harmony vector using the objective function f(x).\n   c. If the new harmony vector is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony vector.\n\n4. After NI iterations, the best harmony vector in the HM represents the global minimum of the function f(x) in the interval [0, 2].\n\nPlease note that the HS algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the results may vary depending on the parameter settings and random number generation. To obtain a more accurate result, you can increase the number of iterations or run the algorithm multiple times and take the average of the results."
