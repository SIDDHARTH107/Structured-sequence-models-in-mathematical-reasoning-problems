    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 65. Since 65 = 5 * 13, where 5 and 13 are distinct primes, we can apply the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 13-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 13 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 13-subgroups, n_13, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 13. The only possibility is n_13 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the unique Sylow 13-subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G (by the Sylow theorems). The order of P is 5, and the order of Q is 13. Since 5 and 13 are prime, P and Q are both cyclic (by the classification of finite cyclic groups).\n\nNow, consider the product set PQ = {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have:\n\n(pq)p' = p(qp') for all p, p' ∈ P and q ∈ Q,\nand\nq'(pq) = (q'p)q for all p, q, q' ∈ Q.\n\nThus, PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|, and since P and Q have relatively prime orders, their intersection is just the identity element. Therefore, |PQ| = |P||Q| = 5 * 13 = 65, which implies that PQ = G.\n\nSince P and Q are both cyclic, their direct product P × Q is also cyclic. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 13, which means that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 13."
