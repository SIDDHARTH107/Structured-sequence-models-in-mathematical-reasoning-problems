    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x - 1 on the interval [0, 2] with a period of 2, we will use the formula for the Fourier series:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period, a_0 is the average value of the function over the interval, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince the period is 2, L = 1. Now, we will find the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n.\n\na_0 = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / 1) * ∫[(x - 1) dx] from 0 to 1\na_0 = [0.5x^2 - x] from 0 to 1\na_0 = (0.5 - 1) - (0) = -0.5\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / 1) * ∫[(x - 1) * cos(n * π * x) dx] from 0 to 1\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x - 1 and dv = cos(n * π * x) dx.\nThen, du = dx and v = (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x).\n\nuv - ∫v du = (x - 1) * (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) - ∫(1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) dx from 0 to 1\n= [(x - 1) * (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)] from 0 to 1 - [(1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * (-cos(n * π * x))] from 0 to 1\n= [sin(n * π) / (n * π)] - [(-1)^n / (n^2 * π^2)]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / 1) * ∫[(x - 1) * sin(n * π * x) dx] from 0 to 1\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x - 1 and dv = sin(n * π * x) dx.\nThen, du = dx and v = (-1 / (n * π)) * cos(n * π * x).\n\nuv - ∫v du = (x - 1) * (-1 / (n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) - ∫(-1 / (n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) dx from 0 to 1\n= [(-1 / (n * π)) * (x - 1) * cos(n * π * x)] from 0 to 1 - [(1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * sin(n * π * x)] from 0 to 1\n= [(-1)^n / (n * π)] + [1 / (n * π)] = [1 - (-1)^n] / (n * π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x - 1:\n\nf(x) = -0.5 + Σ[0 * cos(n * π * x) + ([1 - (-1)^n] / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)]\n\nf(x) = -0.5 + Σ[([1 - (-1)^n] / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)] for n = 1 to infinity"
