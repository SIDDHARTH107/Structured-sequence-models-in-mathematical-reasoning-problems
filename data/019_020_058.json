If we have an input size of 1000 elements, what is the maximum number of operations that the algorithm could perform in the worst case scenario?",
    "message_2": "In the worst-case scenario, the time complexity of the sorting algorithm is O(n^2). Given an input size of 1000 elements (n = 1000), we can calculate the maximum number of operations as follows:\n\nMaximum operations = n^2 = 1000^2 = 1,000,000\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm could perform a maximum of 1,000,000 operations."
