    "message_1": "A surface has a sectional curvature of $-5$ at a given point. What is the radius of curvature for any plane that goes through that point?",
    "message_2": "The sectional curvature, denoted by K, is related to the radius of curvature, denoted by R, through the following formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nIn this case, the sectional curvature K is given as -5. To find the radius of curvature R, we can rearrange the formula:\n\nR^2 = 1/(-5)\n\nSince the sectional curvature is negative, the surface is hyperbolic, and the concept of a single radius of curvature does not apply in the same way as it does for elliptical surfaces. However, we can still find the imaginary radius of curvature:\n\nR = sqrt(1/(-5))\nR = sqrt(-1/5)\nR = (1/sqrt(5)) * sqrt(-1)\n\nSo, the \"radius of curvature\" for any plane that goes through that point is (1/sqrt(5)) times the imaginary unit, usually denoted as 'i'."
