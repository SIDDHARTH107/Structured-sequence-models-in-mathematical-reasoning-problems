    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we can analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 16, we have that |G| = 2^4. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, satisfies:\n\n1. n_2 divides the index of the 2-Sylow subgroup, which is 16/2^4 = 1.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can conclude that n_2 = 1. This means that there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G, which we'll call P. Since P is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of P. Since P is a group of order 2^4, it can have the following structures:\n\n1. Cyclic: P is isomorphic to C16.\n2. Elementary abelian: P is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2 × C2.\n3. P is isomorphic to C4 × C4.\n4. P is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C4.\n\nIf P is cyclic, then G is also cyclic and isomorphic to C16.\n\nIf P is elementary abelian, then G is abelian, but not cyclic. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to D8, as D8 is non-abelian. G would be isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2 × C2.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C4 × C4, then G is abelian, but not cyclic. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to D8, as D8 is non-abelian. G would be isomorphic to C4 × C4.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C4, then G can be either abelian or non-abelian. If G is abelian, it would be isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C4. If G is non-abelian, it could be isomorphic to D8, as D8 has a normal subgroup of order 8 and a subgroup of order 2 that generates the entire group.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, depending on the structure of its unique 2-Sylow subgroup. To determine which one G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the structure of G."
