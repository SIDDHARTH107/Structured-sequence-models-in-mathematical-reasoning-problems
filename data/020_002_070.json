    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products A and B. The profit earned from the sale of each unit of product A is $5 and that of each unit of product B is $6. The production process requires two raw materials X and Y. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of material X and 3 units of material Y. Each unit of product B requires 4 units of material X and 1 unit of material Y. The company has 500 units of raw material X and 450 units of raw material Y available for production. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit? What is the maximum profit the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the raw materials can be represented as:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 500 (raw material X constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 450 (raw material Y constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 6y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints as:\n\ny ≤ (500 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ (450 - 3x) / 1\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of the two lines:\n\n(500 - 2x) / 4 = 450 - 3x\n500 - 2x = 4(450 - 3x)\n500 - 2x = 1800 - 12x\n10x = 1300\nx = 130\n\ny = 450 - 3(130) = 60\n\nIntersection point: (130, 60)\n\n2. Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0):\n\n2x + 4(0) ≤ 500\nx ≤ 250\n\nIntersection point: (250, 0)\n\n3. Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0):\n\n3(0) + y ≤ 450\ny ≤ 450\n\nIntersection point: (0, 450)\n\nThe feasible region is the triangle formed by the points (0, 450), (250, 0), and (130, 60). Since the objective function is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nWe'll now evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 450) = 5(0) + 6(450) = 2700\n2. P(250, 0) = 5(250) + 6(0) = 1250\n3. P(130, 60) = 5(130) + 6(60) = 650 + 360 = 1010\n\nThe maximum profit of $2700 occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 450 units of product B."
