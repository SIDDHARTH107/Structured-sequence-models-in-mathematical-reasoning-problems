    "message_2": "To differentiate the composite function f(x) = tan(5x^2 - 3) using the chain rule, we first need to identify the inner function and the outer function. In this case, the inner function is g(x) = 5x^2 - 3, and the outer function is h(u) = tan(u), where u = g(x).\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of the inner and outer functions. The derivative of g(x) with respect to x is:\n\ng'(x) = d(5x^2 - 3)/dx = 10x\n\nThe derivative of h(u) with respect to u is:\n\nh'(u) = d(tan(u))/du = sec^2(u)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composite function is the product of the derivatives of the inner and outer functions:\n\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\n\nf'(x) = sec^2(5x^2 - 3) * 10x\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = tan(5x^2 - 3) is:\n\nf'(x) = 10x * sec^2(5x^2 - 3)"
