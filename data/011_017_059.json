    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach. Let's start by filling in the first row with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in different orders:\n\n1. 1 2 3\n2. 1 3 2\n3. 2 1 3\n4. 2 3 1\n5. 3 1 2\n6. 3 2 1\n\nNow, for each of these possibilities, we will fill in the second row such that it contains each number exactly once and does not repeat any numbers in the same column as the first row:\n\n1. 1 2 3\n   3 1 2\n\n2. 1 3 2\n   2 1 3\n\n3. 2 1 3\n   3 2 1\n\n4. 2 3 1\n   1 2 3\n\n5. 3 1 2\n   1 3 2\n\n6. 3 2 1\n   1 3 2\n\nFinally, we will fill in the third row such that it contains each number exactly once and does not repeat any numbers in the same column as the first two rows:\n\n1. 1 2 3\n   3 1 2\n   2 3 1\n\n2. 1 3 2\n   2 1 3\n   3 2 1\n\n3. 2 1 3\n   3 2 1\n   1 3 2\n\n4. 2 3 1\n   1 2 3\n   3 1 2\n\n5. 3 1 2\n   1 3 2\n   2 3 1\n\n6. 3 2 1\n   1 3 2\n   2 1 3\n\nWe can see that there are 6 different ways to fill the 3x3 grid with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 such that each row and each column contains each number exactly once."
