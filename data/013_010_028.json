    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms that produce identical products. The total market demand is given by Q = 120 - P where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced. Each firm has a constant marginal cost of $20. Determine the quantity produced and the price charged by each firm if they compete in a Cournot duopoly.",
    "message_2": "In a Cournot duopoly, each firm chooses its quantity to maximize its profit, taking the other firm's quantity as given. Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2. \n\nFrom the demand function, we can express the price as P = 120 - Q. \n\nThe revenue for each firm is given by:\nR1 = P * q1 = (120 - Q) * q1 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q1\nR2 = P * q2 = (120 - Q) * q2 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q2\n\nSince each firm has a constant marginal cost of $20, the profit for each firm is given by:\nπ1 = R1 - 20 * q1 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 20 * q1\nπ2 = R2 - 20 * q2 = (120 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 20 * q2\n\nTo find the Cournot equilibrium, we need to find the Nash equilibrium in quantities. Each firm maximizes its profit with respect to its own quantity, taking the other firm's quantity as given. We do this by taking the first-order conditions (FOC) with respect to q1 and q2:\n\nFOC1: ∂π1/∂q1 = 120 - 2q1 - q2 - 20 = 0\nFOC2: ∂π2/∂q2 = 120 - 2q2 - q1 - 20 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nq1 = 40 - (1/2)q2\nq2 = 40 - (1/2)q1\n\nSubstituting q1 into the second equation:\n\nq2 = 40 - (1/2)(40 - (1/2)q2)\nq2 = 40 - 20 + (1/4)q2\n(3/4)q2 = 20\nq2 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nNow, substituting q2 back into the equation for q1:\n\nq1 = 40 - (1/2)(80/3)\nq1 = 40 - 40/3\nq1 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, each firm produces approximately 26.67 units. To find the price charged by each firm, we can plug the equilibrium quantities back into the price equation:\n\nP = 120 - Q = 120 - (q1 + q2) = 120 - (80/3 + 80/3) = 120 - 160/3 ≈ 40\n\nThus, in the Cournot duopoly, each firm produces approximately 26.67 units and charges a price of approximately $40."
