    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor.\n   For 2^3, there are 1, 2, and 3 as possible divisors.\n   For 3^2, there are 1 and 2 as possible divisors.\n3. Use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of one more than each of the possible divisors of the prime factors:\n   (1+1)(2+1)(3+1) = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nHowever, this formula gives us the upper bound for the number of groups of order 72. To find the actual number of non-isomorphic groups, we need to consider the possible structures of the groups and eliminate any isomorphic groups.\n\nUsing the Sylow theorems and some group theory, we can determine that there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. Z_72 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_36 × Z_2\n3. Z_18 × Z_4\n4. Z_9 × Z_8\n5. Z_9 × (Z_4 × Z_2)\n6. Z_3 × Z_24\n7. Z_3 × (Z_8 × Z_3)\n8. Z_3 × Z_4 × Z_6\n9. Z_3 × (Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_3)\n10. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8 (a semidirect product)\n\nSo, there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
