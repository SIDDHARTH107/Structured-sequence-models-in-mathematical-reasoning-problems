Find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=1$ and use it to evaluate the integral $\\oint_C \\frac{e^z}{(z-1)^3} dz$, where $C$ is the positively oriented circle of radius 2 centered at $z=1$.",
    "message_2": "To find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=1$, we need to find the coefficient of the $(z-1)^{-1}$ term in the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ around $z=1$. Since $f(z)$ has a pole of order 3 at $z=1$, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order $n$:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = \\frac{1}{(n-1)!} \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}((z-1)^n f(z))$$\n\nIn our case, $n=3$, so we need to find the second derivative of $(z-1)^3 f(z)$ with respect to $z$ and then take the limit as $z$ approaches 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of $(z-1)^3 f(z)$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dz}((z-1)^3 f(z)) = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(\\frac{e^z}{(z-1)^3} \\cdot (z-1)^3\\right) = \\frac{d}{dz}(e^z) = e^z$$\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2}{dz^2}((z-1)^3 f(z)) = \\frac{d}{dz}(e^z) = e^z$$\n\nNow, we can find the residue:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = \\frac{1}{(3-1)!} \\lim_{z \\to 1} e^z = \\frac{1}{2} e^1 = \\frac{e}{2}$$\n\nNow that we have the residue, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{e^z}{(z-1)^3} dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\frac{e}{2} = \\pi i e$$\n\nSo, the integral $\\oint_C \\frac{e^z}{(z-1)^3} dz$ is equal to $\\pi i e$."
