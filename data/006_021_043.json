    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in July)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day), which is 0.2\n- n is the number of trials (days in July), which is 31\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days), which is at least 8\n\nSince we want to find the probability of it raining on at least 8 days, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 8, 9, 10, ..., 31.\n\nP(X >= 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + ... + P(X = 31)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up. However, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (the probability of it raining on 7 or fewer days) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 8) = 1 - P(X <= 7)\n\nP(X <= 7) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 7)\n\nNow, we can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X <= 7) = Σ [C(31, k) * (0.2)^k * (0.8)^(31-k)] for k = 0 to 7\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X <= 7) ≈ 0.6024\n\nNow, we can find the probability of it raining on at least 8 days:\n\nP(X >= 8) = 1 - P(X <= 7) = 1 - 0.6024 ≈ 0.3976\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on at least 8 days during the month of July in this region is approximately 0.3976 or 39.76%."
