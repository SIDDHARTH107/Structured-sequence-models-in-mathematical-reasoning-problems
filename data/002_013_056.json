    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base with a length of 10 cm and a width of 6 cm. The height of the pyramid is 12 cm. Find the volume of the pyramid in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width\nBase Area = 10 cm * 6 cm\nBase Area = 60 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the volume formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 60 cm² * 12 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 720 cm³\nVolume = 240 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 240 cubic centimeters."
