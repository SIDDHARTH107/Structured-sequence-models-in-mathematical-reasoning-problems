    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is formed by recursively removing the central square from each remaining square in the pattern. In each iteration, the number of squares increases by a factor of 8, and the side length of each square is divided by 3.\n\nLet P(n) be the perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet after n iterations. The initial square has a perimeter of 12 units, so P(0) = 12.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 8 smaller squares, each with a side length of 1/3 of the original square. The perimeter of each smaller square is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3. So, the total perimeter after the first iteration is 8 * (4/3) = 32/3, and P(1) = 32/3.\n\nIn general, after n iterations, there will be 8^n squares, each with a side length of (1/3)^n of the original square. The perimeter of each square will be 4 * (1/3)^n. Therefore, the total perimeter after n iterations is:\n\nP(n) = 8^n * 4 * (1/3)^n\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nP(n) = 2^(3n) * 4 * (1/3)^n\n\nP(n) = 2^(3n) * 4 * 3^(-n)\n\nP(n) = 2^(3n - n) * 4\n\nP(n) = 2^(2n) * 4\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet after n iterations is P(n) = 2^(2n) * 4."
