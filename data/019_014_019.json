According to the definition of the function f, we have:\n\nf(2) = 2 * 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of f(f(2)) which is f(5):\n\nf(5) = 2 * 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of f(f(f(2))) which is f(11):\n\nf(11) = 2 * 11 + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23\n\nSo, the value of f(f(f(2))) is 23."
