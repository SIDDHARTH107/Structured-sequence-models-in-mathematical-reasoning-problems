    "message_1": "In a game of Stag Hunt, two players can either choose to hunt a stag or a hare. If both players hunt a stag, they each receive 5 points. If one player hunts a stag and the other hunts a hare, the player who hunted the hare gets one point and the other gets nothing. If both players hunt a hare, they each get 2 points. \n\nAssume that player 1 always hunts stags if player 2 does, and that player 2 always hunts stags if player 1 does. If player 1 hunts the stag with probability p and player 2 hunts the stag with probability q, what are the probabilities that both players hunt a stag, only player 1 hunts a stag, only player 2 hunts a stag, and both players hunt a hare?",
    "message_2": "Let's find the probabilities for each of the four scenarios:\n\n1. Both players hunt a stag:\nSince player 1 hunts a stag with probability p and player 2 hunts a stag with probability q, the probability that both players hunt a stag is given by the product of their individual probabilities: p * q.\n\n2. Only player 1 hunts a stag:\nPlayer 1 hunts a stag with probability p, and player 2 hunts a hare with probability (1 - q). The probability that only player 1 hunts a stag is given by the product of these probabilities: p * (1 - q).\n\n3. Only player 2 hunts a stag:\nPlayer 1 hunts a hare with probability (1 - p), and player 2 hunts a stag with probability q. The probability that only player 2 hunts a stag is given by the product of these probabilities: (1 - p) * q.\n\n4. Both players hunt a hare:\nPlayer 1 hunts a hare with probability (1 - p) and player 2 hunts a hare with probability (1 - q). The probability that both players hunt a hare is given by the product of these probabilities: (1 - p) * (1 - q).\n\nIn summary, the probabilities for each scenario are as follows:\n- Both players hunt a stag: p * q\n- Only player 1 hunts a stag: p * (1 - q)\n- Only player 2 hunts a stag: (1 - p) * q\n- Both players hunt a hare: (1 - p) * (1 - q)"
