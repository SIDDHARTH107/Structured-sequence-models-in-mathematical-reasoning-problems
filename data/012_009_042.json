    "message_2": "To determine if the degree sequence is graphical or not, we can use the Havel-Hakimi theorem. The Havel-Hakimi theorem states that a degree sequence is graphical if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first vertex and subtracting 1 from the next k vertices (where k is the degree of the first vertex) is graphical.\n\nGiven degree sequence: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1\nSort the sequence in non-increasing order: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1\n\n1. Remove the first vertex (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 vertices:\n   New sequence: 2, 2, 1, 2, 1\n   Sort in non-increasing order: 2, 2, 2, 1, 1\n\n2. Remove the first vertex (2) and subtract 1 from the next 2 vertices:\n   New sequence: 1, 1, 1, 1\n   Sort in non-increasing order: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\n3. Remove the first vertex (1) and subtract 1 from the next vertex:\n   New sequence: 0, 1, 1\n   Sort in non-increasing order: 1, 1, 0\n\n4. Remove the first vertex (1) and subtract 1 from the next vertex:\n   New sequence: 0, 0\n   Sort in non-increasing order: 0, 0\n\nThe process terminates with a sequence of all zeros, which means the original degree sequence is graphical.\n\nNow, let's draw a possible graph with this degree sequence:\n\nLabel the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F with degrees 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, and 1, respectively.\n\n1. Connect vertex A (degree 3) to vertices B, C, and D.\n2. Connect vertex B (degree 3) to vertices C and E.\n3. Connect vertex C (degree 3) to vertex F.\n4. Vertex D (degree 2) is already connected to A and C.\n5. Vertex E (degree 2) is already connected to B and C.\n6. Vertex F (degree 1) is already connected to C.\n\nThe resulting graph has the following edges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BE, and CF. This graph has the given degree sequence, so the degree sequence is graphical."
