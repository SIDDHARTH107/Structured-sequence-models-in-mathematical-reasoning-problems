    "message_1": "A system undergoes simple harmonic motion with an amplitude of 8 cm and a period of 2 seconds. If the displacement of the system is given by the equation x(t) = 8 cos(πt), what is the maximum velocity of the system?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum velocity of the system, we need to differentiate the displacement equation x(t) with respect to time t. This will give us the velocity equation v(t).\n\nx(t) = 8 cos(πt)\n\nDifferentiating x(t) with respect to time t:\n\nv(t) = dx(t)/dt = -8π sin(πt)\n\nThe maximum velocity occurs when the sine function has its maximum value, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum velocity is:\n\nv_max = -8π(1) = -8π cm/s\n\nHowever, since we are only interested in the magnitude of the maximum velocity, we can ignore the negative sign:\n\nv_max = 8π cm/s ≈ 25.13 cm/s"
