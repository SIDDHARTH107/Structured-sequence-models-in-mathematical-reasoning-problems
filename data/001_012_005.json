    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 4x^2 - 16x\nFactor out the common factor of 4x:\n4x(x - 4)\n\nDenominator: 12x^2 - 24x\nFactor out the common factor of 12x:\n12x(x - 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n(4x(x - 4)) / (12x(x - 2))\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the common factor is 4x.\n\n(4x/4x)((x - 4) / (3(x - 2)))\n\nAfter canceling out the common factor, we are left with:\n(x - 4) / (3(x - 2))\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n(x - 4) / (3(x - 2))"
