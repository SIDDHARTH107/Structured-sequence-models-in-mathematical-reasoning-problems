    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices. To find the diameter, we need to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices and then find the longest among those shortest paths.\n\nWe can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices. The algorithm works by considering each vertex as an intermediate vertex and updating the shortest path between all pairs of vertices.\n\nHere's the adjacency matrix with the initial distances between vertices (with infinity for non-adjacent vertices and 0 for the same vertex):\n\n 0  1  1  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞\n 1  0  1  1  1  ∞  ∞  ∞\n 1  1  0  ∞  1  1  1  ∞\n ∞  1  ∞  0  1  1  ∞  ∞\n ∞  1  1  1  0  1  1  1\n ∞  ∞  1  1  1  0  1  ∞\n ∞  ∞  1  ∞  1  1  0  1\n ∞  ∞  ∞  ∞  1  ∞  1  0\n\nAfter applying the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we get the following matrix with the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices:\n\n 0  1  1  2  2  2  2  3\n 1  0  1  1  1  2  2  2\n 1  1  0  2  1  1  1  2\n 2  1  2  0  1  1  2  3\n 2  1  1  1  0  1  1  1\n 2  2  1  1  1  0  1  2\n 2  2  1  2  1  1  0  1\n 3  2  2  3  1  2  1  0\n\nNow, we need to find the longest distance among these shortest paths. Ignoring the diagonal elements (since they are always 0), we can see that the longest distance is 3, which occurs between vertices 1 and 8.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of this graph is 3."
