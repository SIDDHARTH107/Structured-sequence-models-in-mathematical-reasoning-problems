The production of A requires 4 units of material X and 2 units of material Y while the production of B requires 3 units of material X and 5 units of material Y. The cost of material X is $200 per unit and the cost of material Y is $400 per unit. The revenue per unit of A is $800 and that of B is $1000. The company can produce a maximum of 800 units of A and 700 units of B. Determine the number of units of A and B the company should produce to maximize the profit, using matrix methods.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first set up the linear programming problem and then use matrix methods to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = 800x + 1000y - (200 * (4x + 3y) + 400 * (2x + 5y))\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nProfit = 800x + 1000y - (800x + 600y + 800x + 2000y)\nProfit = -800x - 600y + 800x + 1000y\nProfit = 400y - 800x\n\nThe constraints are given by the availability of materials X and Y, and the maximum production limits:\n\n1. 4x + 3y <= 800 (Material X constraint)\n2. 2x + 5y <= 700 (Material Y constraint)\n3. x <= 800 (Maximum production of A)\n4. y <= 700 (Maximum production of B)\n5. x >= 0, y >= 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we will use the matrix method to solve this linear programming problem. First, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities.\n\n1. 4x + 3y <= 800\ny <= (800 - 4x) / 3\n\n2. 2x + 5y <= 700\ny <= (700 - 2x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities along with the non-negativity constraints and the maximum production constraints. To find the optimal solution, we will evaluate the profit function at the corner points of the feasible region.\n\nCorner points:\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (0, 700)\nC. (800, 0)\nD. Intersection of 4x + 3y = 800 and 2x + 5y = 700\n\nTo find point D, we can use the matrix method to solve the system of linear equations:\n\nMatrix form: AX = B\nA = [[4, 3], [2, 5]]\nX = [[x], [y]]\nB = [[800], [700]]\n\nInverse of A:\nA_inv = 1/(20-6) * [[5, -3], [-2, 4]]\nA_inv = 1/14 * [[5, -3], [-2, 4]]\n\nMultiply A_inv by B to get X:\nX = A_inv * B\nX = [[200], [100]]\n\nSo, point D is (200, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\nA. Profit(0, 0) = 0\nB. Profit(0, 700) = 400 * 700 - 800 * 0 = 280000\nC. Profit(800, 0) = 400 * 0 - 800 * 800 = -640000 (This is not a valid solution since profit cannot be negative)\nD. Profit(200, 100) = 400 * 100 - 800 * 200 = 40000 - 160000 = -120000 (This is not a valid solution since profit cannot be negative)\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point B (0, 700) with a profit of $280,000. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 700 units of product B to maximize the profit."
