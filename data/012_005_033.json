    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph G with 7 vertices and 8 edges, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum number of edges required to connect all 7 vertices. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, a tree with 7 vertices would have 6 edges.\n\nSince our graph G has 8 edges, which is 2 more than the minimum required for a tree, it must contain at least one cycle. In the worst-case scenario, the graph would look like a tree with an additional edge connecting two vertices that are farthest apart. In this case, the diameter would be the same as the tree's diameter.\n\nFor a tree with 7 vertices, the maximum diameter is 4 (consider a tree with a central vertex connected to 3 other vertices, and each of those vertices connected to another vertex). Adding an edge to this tree would not increase the diameter, as it would only create a cycle.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the graph G with 7 vertices and 8 edges is 4."
