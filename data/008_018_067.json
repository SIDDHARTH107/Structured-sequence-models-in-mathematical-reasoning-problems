    "message_2": "To determine the value of k that will make the system have a unique solution, we need to find the value of k for which the determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero.\n\nThe coefficient matrix A is:\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 4  5  2 |\n    | 6  7  k |\n\nWe need to calculate the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(5k - 14) - 3(4k - 12) + 1(28 - 30)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of k for which det(A) ≠ 0:\n\ndet(A) = 2(5k - 14) - 3(4k - 12) + (-2)\n\ndet(A) = 10k - 28 - 12k + 36 - 2\n\ndet(A) = -2k + 6\n\nFor the system to have a unique solution, det(A) ≠ 0:\n\n-2k + 6 ≠ 0\n\n-2k ≠ -6\n\nk ≠ 3\n\nSo, the value of k that will make the system have a unique solution is k ≠ 3."
