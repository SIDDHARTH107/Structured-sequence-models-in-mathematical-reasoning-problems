    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere inscribed in a cube, we first need to find the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. In this case, the side length of the cube is 6 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 6 cm.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nSubstitute the radius (3 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(27)\n\nV = (4)(9)π\n\nV = 36π cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is 36π cubic centimeters."
