    "message_1": "A company wants to manufacture two products, Product A and Product B. The profit contribution for each unit of Product A is $3 and for Product B is $5. The manufacturing process requires 1 hour of assembly time and 3 hours of finishing time for Product A, while for Product B, it requires 2 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of finishing time. The company has 20 hours of assembly time and 30 hours of finishing time available. Find an optimal production plan for the company that maximizes the profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nProfit = 3x + 5y\n\nThe constraints are given by the available assembly and finishing times:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 20 (assembly time constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 30 (finishing time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 1x + 2y = 20\n   y = (20 - x) / 2\n\n2. 3x + 2y = 30\n   y = (30 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area enclosed by the x-axis, y-axis, and the lines y = (20 - x) / 2 and y = (30 - 3x) / 2.\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we need to evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region. The vertices are:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 10)\nC: (6, 7)\nD: (10, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at these points:\n\nProfit(A) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0\nProfit(B) = 3(0) + 5(10) = 50\nProfit(C) = 3(6) + 5(7) = 18 + 35 = 53\nProfit(D) = 3(10) + 5(0) = 30\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at point C, with a profit of $53. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 6 units of Product A and 7 units of Product B."
