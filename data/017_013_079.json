    "message_2": "To prove that there is only one non-abelian group of order 18 up to isomorphism, we will first analyze the possible structures of groups of order 18 and then show that there is only one non-abelian group among them.\n\nLet G be a group of order 18. Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups is either 1 or 9, and the number of 3-Sylow subgroups is either 1 or 3.\n\nCase 1: There is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup.\nIn this case, let P be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since both P and Q are normal in G (due to their uniqueness), we have that G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P is of order 2 and Q is of order 9, we have G ≅ Z_2 × Z_9, which is an abelian group.\n\nCase 2: There is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and three 3-Sylow subgroups.\nLet P be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup and let Q1, Q2, and Q3 be the three 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P is normal in G, we can consider the action of G on the set of 3-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_3, where S_3 is the symmetric group on three elements. The kernel of φ, denoted by K, is a normal subgroup of G that is contained in all 3-Sylow subgroups.\n\nNow, we claim that K must be equal to P. To see this, note that |K| must divide both |G| and |S_3|, so |K| must be a divisor of gcd(18, 6) = 6. Since K is a normal subgroup of G and is contained in all 3-Sylow subgroups, |K| must also divide 9. Thus, |K| can only be 1, 2, 3, or 6. If |K| = 6, then K would contain elements of order 2 and 3, which is not possible since K is contained in all 3-Sylow subgroups. If |K| = 3, then K would be a 3-Sylow subgroup, but this would contradict the fact that there are three distinct 3-Sylow subgroups. If |K| = 1, then φ is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_3, which is not possible since |G| = 18 > 6 = |S_3|. Therefore, |K| = 2, and K = P.\n\nNow, let Q be any 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G, we have that PQ is a subgroup of G with order 18. Moreover, since P ∩ Q = {e}, we have that G = PQ. By the recognition theorem for semidirect products, we have that G is the semidirect product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P ⋊ Q. Since P ≅ Z_2 and Q ≅ Z_9, we have G ≅ Z_2 ⋊ Z_9. Note that there is only one nontrivial homomorphism from Z_9 to Aut(Z_2) (since Aut(Z_2) is trivial), so there is only one non-abelian group of this form, which is the unique non-abelian group of order 18 up to isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one non-abelian group of order 18 up to isomorphism, which is the semidirect product Z_2 ⋊ Z_9."
