    "message_2": "In temporal logic, we can use the \"always\" operator (denoted by a square) and the \"next\" operator (denoted by a circle) to represent this pattern of events. Let P be the event that happens every 2 minutes, starting at minute 0.\n\nThe statement to represent this pattern of events can be written as:\n\n□(P ∧ ◯◯¬P)"
