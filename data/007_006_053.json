    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 252 and 105 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (252) by the smaller number (105) and find the remainder.\n   252 รท 105 = 2 with a remainder of 42.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (252) with the smaller number (105), and the smaller number with the remainder (42).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 105 and 42.\n\n3. Repeat step 1 with the new numbers.\n   105 รท 42 = 2 with a remainder of 21.\n\n4. Replace the larger number (105) with the smaller number (42), and the smaller number with the remainder (21).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 42 and 21.\n\n5. Repeat step 1 with the new numbers.\n   42 รท 21 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n6. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 21.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 105 is 21."
