    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the given function. The function is f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1. \n\nThe derivative, f'(x), is:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 3\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the root. Let's start with x0 = 1.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe will iterate this formula until we reach the desired accuracy of one decimal place.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 1 - (1^3 - 3*1 + 1) / (3*1^2 - 3)\nx1 = 1 - (-1) / 0\nSince the denominator is 0, we need to choose a different initial guess. Let's try x0 = 0.5.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 0.5 - (0.5^3 - 3*0.5 + 1) / (3*0.5^2 - 3)\nx1 = 0.5 - (-0.375) / (-0.75)\nx1 ≈ 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 1 - (1^3 - 3*1 + 1) / (3*1^2 - 3)\nx2 = 1 - (-1) / 0\nAgain, the denominator is 0. We need to choose a different initial guess. Let's try x0 = 0.6.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 0.6 - (0.6^3 - 3*0.6 + 1) / (3*0.6^2 - 3)\nx1 = 0.6 - (-0.056) / (-0.28)\nx1 ≈ 0.8\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 0.8 - (0.8^3 - 3*0.8 + 1) / (3*0.8^2 - 3)\nx2 = 0.8 - (0.288) / (0.52)\nx2 ≈ 0.6\n\nWe can see that the values are oscillating between 0.6 and 0.8. To get a more accurate result, we can take the average of the two values:\n\nx = (0.6 + 0.8) / 2\nx ≈ 0.7\n\nSo, the root of the equation x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0, correct to one decimal place, is approximately x = 0.7."
