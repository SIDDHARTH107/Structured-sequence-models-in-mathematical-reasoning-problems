    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A △ B) × A = {1, 4} × {1, 2, 3}\n   = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\n2.

(B △ A) × A = (A △ B) × A (since symmetric difference is commutative)\n   = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference of two sets is associative with respect to the Cartesian product:\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\nA △ (B × A) = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n(B △ A) × A = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\n(A △ B) × A ≠ A △ (B × A), so the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
