    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (4x - 3), we will use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2.\n\nLet g(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 and h(x) = 4x - 3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2 - 5x + 2)/dx = 6x - 5\nh'(x) = d(4x - 3)/dx = 4\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = ((6x - 5)(4x - 3) - (3x^2 - 5x + 2)(4)) / (4x - 3)^2\n\nNow, we will expand the terms in the numerator:\n\nf'(x) = (24x^2 - 18x - 20x + 15 - 12x^2 + 20x - 8) / (4x - 3)^2\n\nCombine like terms in the numerator:\n\nf'(x) = (12x^2 - 18x + 7) / (4x - 3)^2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (4x - 3) is:\n\nf'(x) = (12x^2 - 18x + 7) / (4x - 3)^2"
