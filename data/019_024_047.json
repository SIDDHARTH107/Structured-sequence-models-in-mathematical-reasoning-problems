    "message_1": "Samantha has three bags filled with marbles. The first bag contains 12 red marbles and 8 blue marbles, the second bag contains 6 red marbles and 4 blue marbles, and the third bag contains 15 red marbles and 10 blue marbles. Samantha randomly picks one bag and then randomly selects one marble from the chosen bag. What is the probability that the marble will be red?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the marble will be red, we need to find the probability of picking a red marble from each bag and then average those probabilities since Samantha is equally likely to choose any of the three bags.\n\nBag 1: There are 12 red marbles and 20 total marbles (12 red + 8 blue). The probability of picking a red marble from Bag 1 is 12/20 or 3/5.\n\nBag 2: There are 6 red marbles and 10 total marbles (6 red + 4 blue). The probability of picking a red marble from Bag 2 is 6/10 or 3/5.\n\nBag 3: There are 15 red marbles and 25 total marbles (15 red + 10 blue). The probability of picking a red marble from Bag 3 is 15/25 or 3/5.\n\nSince the probability of picking a red marble from each bag is the same (3/5), the overall probability of picking a red marble is also 3/5 or 0.6."
