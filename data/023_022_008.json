    "message_1": "A finance student is analyzing the stock market data for a company and wants to identify the dominant frequency of the stock price fluctuations. The historical stock price data is collected over a period of 5 years with a sampling frequency of 1 sample per day. The student wants to use Fourier analysis to determine the dominant frequency of the stock price fluctuations. What is the dominant frequency of stock price fluctuations for this company?",
    "message_2": "To determine the dominant frequency of the stock price fluctuations, the student needs to perform a Fourier analysis on the collected data. However, without the actual data, we cannot provide the specific dominant frequency value.\n\nThe Fourier analysis will transform the time-domain stock price data into the frequency domain, allowing the student to identify the dominant frequency components that contribute to the stock price fluctuations. Once the Fourier analysis is completed, the student can look for the frequency with the highest amplitude, which will represent the dominant frequency of the stock price fluctuations."
