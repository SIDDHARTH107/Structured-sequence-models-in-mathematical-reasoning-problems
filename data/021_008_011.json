    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which is the matrix of partial derivatives of the given functions with respect to x and y. Let f(x, y) = x^2 + y - 10 and g(x, y) = x - y^2 + 7. The Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y | = | 2x   1  |\n          | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |   | 1  -2y |\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the solution (x0, y0). Let's use (x0, y0) = (1, 1) as our initial guess. We will iterate the following steps using Newton's method:\n\n1. Solve the linear system J(xk, yk) * (Δx, Δy) = -(f(xk, yk), g(xk, yk)) for (Δx, Δy).\n2. Update the guess: (xk+1, yk+1) = (xk, yk) + (Δx, Δy).\n3. Check for convergence: If |Δx| < 0.001 and |Δy| < 0.001, stop. Otherwise, go back to step 1.\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 1, y0 = 1\nJ(x0, y0) = | 2  1 |\n           | 1 -2 |\nf(x0, y0) = -8, g(x0, y0) = -3\nSolving the linear system, we get Δx = 3.6, Δy = 2.2\nx1 = x0 + Δx = 4.6, y1 = y0 + Δy = 3.2\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = 4.6, y1 = 3.2\nJ(x1, y1) = | 9.2  1  |\n           | 1  -6.4 |\nf(x1, y1) = 10.76, g(x1, y1) = 1.84\nSolving the linear system, we get Δx = -0.205, Δy = -0.295\nx2 = x1 + Δx = 4.395, y2 = y1 + Δy = 2.905\n\nIteration 3:\nx2 = 4.395, y2 = 2.905\nJ(x2, y2) = | 8.79  1   |\n           | 1   -5.81 |\nf(x2, y2) = 0.245025, g(x2, y2) = 0.049025\nSolving the linear system, we get Δx = -0.000225, Δy = -0.000425\nx3 = x2 + Δx = 4.394775, y3 = y2 + Δy = 2.904575\n\nSince |Δx| < 0.001 and |Δy| < 0.001, we can stop here. The solution to the system of nonlinear equations accurate to at least three decimal places is (x, y) ≈ (4.395, 2.905)."
