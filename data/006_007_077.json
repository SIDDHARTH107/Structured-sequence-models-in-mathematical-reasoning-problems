    "message_2": "Let A be the event that the stock price increases by $2\\%$, B be the event that the stock price decreases by $1\\%$, and C be the event that the stock price remains unchanged.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.4 (probability of stock price increasing by 2%)\nP(B) = 0.6 (probability of stock price decreasing by 1%)\n\nSince the stock price can either increase, decrease, or remain unchanged, the sum of the probabilities of these three events should be equal to 1:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1\n\nWe can now solve for P(C):\n\nP(C) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - 0.4 - 0.6 = 0\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the stock price will either increase by $2\\%$ or remain unchanged in a day, which is P(A) + P(C):\n\nP(A or C) = P(A) + P(C) = 0.4 + 0 = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will either increase by $2\\%$ or remain unchanged in a day is $0.4$."
