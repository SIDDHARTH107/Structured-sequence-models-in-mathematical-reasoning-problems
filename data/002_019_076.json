    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral surface area (a curved surface), and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius of the base is 8 cm. So, the area of the base is:\n\nA_base = π(8^2) = 64π cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius, and s is the slant height. To find the slant height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, since the radius, height, and slant height form a right-angled triangle:\n\ns^2 = r^2 + h^2\ns^2 = (8^2) + (10^2)\ns^2 = 64 + 100\ns^2 = 164\ns = √164 ≈ 12.81 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area:\n\nA_lateral = π(8)(12.81) ≈ 102.65π cm^2\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 64π + 102.65π\nA_total ≈ 166.65π cm^2\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the surface area of the cone is approximately 523.60 cm^2."
