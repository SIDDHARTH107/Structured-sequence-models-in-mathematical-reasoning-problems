    "message_2": "To determine if the system is stable, we first need to find the transfer function of the system. We can do this by taking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. Let Y(s) be the Laplace transform of y(t) and let F(s) be the Laplace transform of the forcing function 2sin(2t). The Laplace transform of the given equation is:\n\nsY(s) - y(0) + 3Y(s) = F(s)\n\nNow, we can plug in the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\nsY(s) - 2 + 3Y(s) = F(s)\n\nNext, we need to find the Laplace transform of the forcing function 2sin(2t). The Laplace transform of sin(at) is a/(s^2 + a^2), so the Laplace transform of 2sin(2t) is 4/(s^2 + 4). Therefore, F(s) = 4/(s^2 + 4).\n\nNow we can solve for Y(s):\n\nY(s)(s + 3) = 4/(s^2 + 4) + 2\n\nY(s) = (4 + 2(s^2 + 4))/(s^2 + 4)(s + 3)\n\nNow, we can check the stability of the system by analyzing the poles of the transfer function Y(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator zero:\n\n(s^2 + 4)(s + 3) = 0\n\nThis equation has three poles: s = -3 and s = Â±2i. Since all the poles have negative real parts, the system is stable.\n\nNow, to find y(t), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){(4 + 2(s^2 + 4))/(s^2 + 4)(s + 3)}\n\nTo do this, we can perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n(4 + 2(s^2 + 4))/(s^2 + 4)(s + 3) = A/(s + 3) + Bs/(s^2 + 4) + C/(s^2 + 4)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator, we get:\n\n4 + 2(s^2 + 4) = A(s^2 + 4) + Bs(s + 3) + C(s + 3)\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we can find the values of A, B, and C:\n\nA = 1, B = 1, C = -1\n\nNow, we can rewrite Y(s) as:\n\nY(s) = 1/(s + 3) + s/(s^2 + 4) - 1/(s^2 + 4)\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of each term, we get:\n\ny(t) = e^(-3t) + cos(2t) - sin(2t)/2\n\nSo, the solution to the given differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = 2 is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-3t) + cos(2t) - sin(2t)/2"
