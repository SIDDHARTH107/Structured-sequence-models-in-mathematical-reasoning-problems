    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order 120 using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.\n\nFor the 2^3 part, there are three possibilities: 2^3, 2^2 * 2, and 2 * 2 * 2.\nFor the 3 part, there is only one possibility: 3.\nFor the 5 part, there is only one possibility: 5.\n\nSo, there are 3 * 1 * 1 = 3 non-isomorphic abelian groups of order 120.\n\n3. Determine the number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nWe can use the following formula to find the number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order n:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups = (Number of groups of order n) - (Number of abelian groups of order n)\n\nUsing the formula, we can find the number of groups of order 120:\n\nNumber of groups of order 120 = (Number of groups of order 2^3) * (Number of groups of order 3) * (Number of groups of order 5)\n\nNumber of groups of order 2^3 = 5 (from Sylow's theorem)\nNumber of groups of order 3 = 1 (cyclic group)\nNumber of groups of order 5 = 1 (cyclic group)\n\nNumber of groups of order 120 = 5 * 1 * 1 = 5\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 120:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\n4. Combine the results from steps 2 and 3:\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 = (Number of non-isomorphic abelian groups) + (Number of non-isomorphic non-abelian groups) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
