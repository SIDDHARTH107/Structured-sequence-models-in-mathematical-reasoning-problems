    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to create a generating function for the given set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. The generating function for this set is:\n\nG(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^10 in the expansion of G(x)^3, as this will represent the number of ways to choose three numbers from the set such that their sum is 10.\n\nG(x)^3 = (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7)^3\n\nExpanding G(x)^3, we get:\n\nG(x)^3 = x^3 + 3x^4 + 6x^5 + 10x^6 + 15x^7 + 21x^8 + 25x^9 + 27x^10 + ... (we can ignore the terms with higher powers of x)\n\nThe coefficient of x^10 in the expansion of G(x)^3 is 27. Therefore, there are 27 ways to choose three numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that the sum of the three numbers is 10."
