In this case, the subset A = {1}.\n\nFirst, let's find the closed sets in the topological space X. The open sets are {∅, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}. The complements of these open sets are:\n\n1. X \\ ∅ = {1, 2}\n2. X \\ {1} = {2}\n3. X \\ {2} = {1}\n4. X \\ {1, 2} = ∅\n\nSo, the closed sets are {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest closed set containing the subset A = {1}. The closed set {1} contains the subset {1} and is the smallest closed set containing {1}.\n\nTherefore, the closure of the subset {1} is {1}."
