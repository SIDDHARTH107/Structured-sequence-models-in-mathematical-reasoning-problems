    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix inversion, we first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |      X = | x |      B = | 1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |          | y |          | 4 |\n    | 4 -5  2 |          | z |          | 3 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 1(-1)(2) + 2(3)(4) - (-1)(-1)(-5) - 2(2)(2) - (-1)(4)(3)\n       = -2 + 24 + 5 - 8 + 12\n       = 31\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the adjugate of A and divide each element by the determinant to get A^(-1).\n\nadj(A) = | (-1)(2) - (3)(-5)   (-1)(-1) - (3)(2)   2(-1) - (-5)(2) |\n         | (2)(2) - (-1)(4)    (1)(2) - (4)(-1)   -1(1) - (4)(3)   |\n         | (2)(-5) - (-1)(-1)  (1)(4) - (2)(2)    1(4) - (2)(-1)   |\n\nadj(A) = | 13  -5  12 |\n         |  8   6 -13 |\n         | -9   0   6 |\n\nNow, divide each element by the determinant (31):\n\nA^(-1) = |  13/31  -5/31  12/31 |\n         |   8/31   6/31 -13/31 |\n         |  -9/31   0/31   6/31 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  13/31  -5/31  12/31 |   | 1 |\n    |   8/31   6/31 -13/31 |   | 4 |\n    |  -9/31   0/31   6/31 |   | 3 |\n\nX = | (13/31)(1) + (-5/31)(4) + (12/31)(3) |\n    | (8/31)(1) + (6/31)(4) + (-13/31)(3) |\n    | (-9/31)(1) + (0/31)(4) + (6/31)(3)   |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
