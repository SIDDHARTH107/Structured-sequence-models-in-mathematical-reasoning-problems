    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we will use the Möbius transformation, which is given by the formula:\n\n$$w = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d$ are complex constants and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. The Möbius transformation maps circles and lines to circles and lines, and it is conformal.\n\nFirst, we need to find the transformation that maps the unit circle to the circle $|w-2|=2$. Let's denote the center of the circle in the $w$-plane as $w_0 = 2$. The transformation should map the center of the unit circle, $z_0 = 0$, to $w_0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$w_0 = \\frac{a z_0 + b}{c z_0 + d} \\Rightarrow 2 = \\frac{b}{d}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the point $z = 1$ on the unit circle. The corresponding point on the circle $|w-2|=2$ should have a distance of 2 from the center $w_0$. Let's denote this point as $w_1$. Then, we have:\n\n$$|w_1 - w_0| = 2$$\n\nUsing the Möbius transformation, we get:\n\n$$w_1 = \\frac{a + b}{c + d}$$\n\nSince $|w_1 - w_0| = 2$, we have:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{a + b}{c + d} - 2\\right| = 2$$\n\nNow, we know that $2 = \\frac{b}{d}$, so we can write:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{a + 2d}{c + d} - 2\\right| = 2$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{a - 2c}{c + d}\\right| = 2$$\n\nWe also have the condition that $f(0) = 1 + i$. Using the Möbius transformation, we get:\n\n$$1 + i = \\frac{b}{d}$$\n\nNow, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1. $2 = \\frac{b}{d}$\n2. $\\left|\\frac{a - 2c}{c + d}\\right| = 2$\n3. $1 + i = \\frac{b}{d}$\n\nFrom equations 1 and 3, we have $b = 2d$ and $b = d(1 + i)$. Equating the two expressions for $b$, we get:\n\n$$2d = d(1 + i) \\Rightarrow d = \\frac{2}{1 + i} = \\frac{2(1 - i)}{(1 + i)(1 - i)} = 2(1 - i)$$\n\nNow, we can find $b$:\n\n$$b = d(1 + i) = 2(1 - i)(1 + i) = 2(1 - i^2) = 4$$\n\nNow, let's find $a$ and $c$. We know that $\\left|\\frac{a - 2c}{c + d}\\right| = 2$. Plugging in the values for $d$ and $b$, we get:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{a - 2c}{c + 2(1 - i)}\\right| = 2$$\n\nLet's denote $c = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{a - 2(x + yi)}{(x + yi) + 2(1 - i)}\\right| = 2$$\n\nNow, we can write $a$ in terms of $c$:\n\n$$a = 2c + 2(x + yi) + 2(1 - i)(x + yi)$$\n\nNow, we have the Möbius transformation:\n\n$$w = \\frac{(2c + 2(x + yi) + 2(1 - i)(x + yi))z + 4}{(x + yi)z + 2(1 - i)}$$\n\nThis transformation maps the unit circle in the $z$-plane to the interior of the circle $|w-2|=2$ in the $w$-plane and satisfies the condition $f(0) = 1 + i$."
