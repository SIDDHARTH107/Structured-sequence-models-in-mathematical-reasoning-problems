Also, determine whether there exists a Hamiltonian path, and if yes, provide one.\n\n![Graph theory image](https://i.imgur.com/0sUGsra.png) \n\nNote: An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nQuestion for the student to solve: Does the graph have an Eulerian path? If so, provide one. Does it have a Hamiltonian path? If so, provide one.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there exists an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has at most two vertices with an odd degree. In this graph, we have the following degrees for each vertex:\n\nA: 3\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 3\nE: 3\n\nThere are four vertices with an odd degree (A, B, D, and E), so there is no Eulerian path in this graph.\n\nNow, let's check for a Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. We can try to find one by trial and error. One possible Hamiltonian path is:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E\n\nThis path visits every vertex exactly once, so there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph."
