The equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t + u∂u/∂x + ν∂²u/∂x² + κ∂⁴u/∂x⁴ = 0\n\nwhere u(x,t) represents the flame front's height at position x and time t, ν is the viscosity, and κ is the diffusivity.\n\nThe initial condition is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = cos(x)\n\nThe boundary conditions are given by:\n\nu(0,t) = u(2π,t) = 0"
