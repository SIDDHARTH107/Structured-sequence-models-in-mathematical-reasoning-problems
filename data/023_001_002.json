    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(t), we need to determine the coefficients a0, an, and bn. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nωt) + bn * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, T is the period of the function, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor a periodic function with period 2π, the coefficients are given by:\n\na0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) dt] from -π to π\nan = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nωt) dt] from -π to π\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) dt] from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a0:\n\na0 = (1/π) * [∫[2 dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[-1 dt] from 0 to π]\na0 = (1/π) * [2t | from -π to 0 - t | from 0 to π]\na0 = (1/π) * [(0 - (-2π)) - (π - 0)]\na0 = (1/π) * (2π - π)\na0 = 1\n\nNow, let's find an:\n\nan = (1/π) * [∫[2 * cos(nωt) dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[-1 * cos(nωt) dt] from 0 to π]\n\nSince ω = 2π/T and T = 2π, ω = 1.\n\nan = (1/π) * [(2/ωn) * sin(nωt) | from -π to 0 - (1/ωn) * sin(nωt) | from 0 to π]\nan = (1/π) * [(2/n) * sin(nt) | from -π to 0 - (1/n) * sin(nt) | from 0 to π]\nan = (1/π) * [(2/n) * (sin(0) - sin(-nπ)) - (1/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))]\nan = (1/π) * [(2/n) * (0 - (-1)^n) - 0]\nan = (2/nπ) * (-1)^n for odd n, and 0 for even n\n\nFinally, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (1/π) * [∫[2 * sin(nωt) dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[-1 * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to π]\nbn = (1/π) * [(-2/ωn) * cos(nωt) | from -π to 0 + (1/ωn) * cos(nωt) | from 0 to π]\nbn = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * cos(nt) | from -π to 0 + (1/n) * cos(nt) | from 0 to π]\nbn = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (cos(0) - cos(-nπ)) + (1/n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(0))]\nbn = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (1 - (-1)^n) + (1/n) * ((-1)^n - 1)]\nbn = 0, for all n\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(t) is:\n\nf(t) = 1 + Σ[((2/nπ) * (-1)^n) * cos(nt)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity for odd n, and the coefficients are:\n\na0 = 1\nan = (2/nπ) * (-1)^n for odd n, and 0 for even n\nbn = 0, for all n"
