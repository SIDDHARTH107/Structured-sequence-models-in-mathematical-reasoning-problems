    "message_2": "Let's evaluate the formula step by step:\n\n1. P = true and Q = false\n2. P ∧ Q = true ∧ false = false (since both P and Q need to be true for the conjunction to be true)\n3. P ∨ Q = true ∨ false = true (since at least one of P or Q needs to be true for the disjunction to be true)\n4. (P ∧ Q) → (P ∨ Q) = false → true = true (since a material implication is true when the antecedent is false or both the antecedent and consequent are true)\n\nSo, the truth value of the formula when P = true and Q = false is true."
