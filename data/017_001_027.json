    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 4 cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A4, we will first look at the properties of both groups and then show that they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of elements in the group. The order of A4 is 12, as it consists of all even permutations of the symmetric group S4. In contrast, a group of order 4 has only 4 elements.\n\n2. A group of order 4 can either be cyclic (isomorphic to Z4) or isomorphic to the Klein four-group (V4). In both cases, all elements in the group have order 1, 2, or 4. In A4, there are elements of order 3 (for example, the 3-cycles), which do not exist in a group of order 4.\n\n3. A group of order 4 has a unique subgroup of order 2, whereas A4 has three subgroups of order 2 (consisting of the 2-cycles and the identity element).\n\nSince the orders of the groups are different, and they have different properties regarding the orders of their elements and the number of subgroups, a group of order 4 cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A4."
