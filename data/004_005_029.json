    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 - 3r + 2 = 0\n\nThis factors as (r - 1)(r - 2) = 0, so the roots are r1 = 1 and r2 = 2.\n\nThe general solution to the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = C1 * e^(r1*t) + C2 * e^(r2*t)\ny(t) = C1 * e^t + C2 * e^(2t)\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions to find the constants C1 and C2:\n\ny(0) = 4 => C1 * e^(0) + C2 * e^(0) = 4 => C1 + C2 = 4 (1)\n\ny'(t) = C1 * e^t + 2 * C2 * e^(2t)\n\ny'(0) = 2 => C1 * e^(0) + 2 * C2 * e^(0) = 2 => C1 + 2 * C2 = 2 (2)\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations (1) and (2) for C1 and C2:\n\n(1) C1 + C2 = 4\n(2) C1 + 2 * C2 = 2\n\nSubtracting (1) from (2), we get:\n\nC2 = -2\n\nPlugging C2 back into (1), we get:\n\nC1 = 4 - (-2) = 6\n\nSo, the particular solution to the differential equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\ny(t) = 6 * e^t - 2 * e^(2t)"
