    "message_1": "What is the maximum amplitude of the oscillator as a function of the natural frequency and the amplitude of the forcing signal in a forced van der Pol oscillator with parameters μ=1, ω = 1.7, and A = 0.25?",
    "message_2": "The forced van der Pol oscillator is described by the following second-order differential equation:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + ω^2x(t) = A*cos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the oscillator, μ is the damping parameter, ω is the natural frequency, and A is the amplitude of the forcing signal.\n\nTo find the maximum amplitude of the oscillator, we need to analyze the steady-state response of the system. The steady-state response is given by the amplitude of the oscillation when the transient response has decayed, and the system is in a stable oscillatory state.\n\nThe steady-state response can be found by assuming a solution of the form:\n\nx(t) = X*cos(ωt - δ)\n\nwhere X is the amplitude of the steady-state response, and δ is the phase shift. Substituting this solution into the differential equation and solving for X, we get:\n\nX = A / sqrt((ω^4 - 2ω^2(ω^2 - 2μ^2) + (ω^2 - μ^2)^2)^2 + (4ω^2μ^2(ω^2 - μ^2))^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of μ, ω, and A to find the maximum amplitude:\n\nμ = 1\nω = 1.7\nA = 0.25\n\nX = 0.25 / sqrt(((1.7^4 - 2(1.7^2)(1.7^2 - 2(1)^2) + (1.7^2 - 1^2)^2)^2 + (4(1.7^2)(1^2)(1.7^2 - 1^2))^2))\n\nX ≈ 0.178\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude of the oscillator is approximately 0.178."
