    "message_2": "To calculate the dot product of two vectors u and v using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √((-2)² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of u and v. To find the dot product, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = (3 * -2) + (4 * 5) = -6 + 20 = 14\n\nNow we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (14) / (5 * √29)\nθ = arccos(14 / (5 * √29))\n\nNow we can find the dot product using the trigonometric formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * cos(arccos(14 / (5 * √29))) = 14\n\nSo, the dot product of u and v is 14."
