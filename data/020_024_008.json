    "message_1": "A coffee shop currently sells 200 cups of coffee per day for $2 each. The shop owner wants to increase the price of coffee without losing customers, and wants to determine the optimal price point that maximizes revenue. It is estimated that for every 10 cent increase in price, the number of daily customers decreases by 5. How much should the coffee shop charge per cup of coffee to maximize revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of 10 cent increases in price, and let P(x) be the price per cup of coffee and Q(x) be the number of cups sold per day. We have:\n\nP(x) = 2 + 0.10x\nQ(x) = 200 - 5x\n\nRevenue R(x) is the product of the price per cup and the number of cups sold:\n\nR(x) = P(x) * Q(x) = (2 + 0.10x) * (200 - 5x)\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, we need to find the critical points of R(x) by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndR(x)/dx = d((2 + 0.10x) * (200 - 5x))/dx = 0\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\ndR(x)/dx = (2 + 0.10x) * d(200 - 5x)/dx + (200 - 5x) * d(2 + 0.10x)/dx\n\ndR(x)/dx = (2 + 0.10x) * (-5) + (200 - 5x) * (0.10)\n\nSimplifying and setting dR(x)/dx equal to 0:\n\n-10 - 0.50x + 20 - 0.50x = 0\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n-1x = -10\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 10\n\nSo there should be 10 increments of 10 cents to maximize revenue. Now we can find the optimal price:\n\nP(x) = 2 + 0.10x = 2 + 0.10(10) = 2 + 1 = $3\n\nThe coffee shop should charge $3 per cup of coffee to maximize revenue."
