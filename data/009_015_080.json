    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question: \n\nA sample of radioactive substance has an initial activity of 80 counts per minute (cpm). If the half-life of the substance is 10 minutes, what will its activity be after 30 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal activity = Initial activity * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial activity is 80 cpm, the half-life is 10 minutes, and the time elapsed is 30 minutes. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal activity = 80 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\nFinal activity = 80 * (1/2)^3\nFinal activity = 80 * (1/8)\nFinal activity = 10 cpm\n\nSo, after 30 minutes, the activity of the radioactive substance will be 10 counts per minute."
