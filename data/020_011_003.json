    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products, X and Y. The production of X requires 2 units of labor and 1 unit of material, while the production of Y requires 1 unit of labor and 3 units of material. Each product can be sold for a profit of $5 for X and $7 for Y. The company has 20 units of labor and 18 units of material available. The company wants to maximize its profit. Formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve it using the method of your choice.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let's define the variables:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X produced.\nLet y be the number of units of product Y produced.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nConstraints (based on available resources):\n2x + y ≤ 20 (labor constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 18 (material constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product X)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product Y)\n\nNow we have the linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize P = 5x + 7y\nSubject to:\n2x + y ≤ 20\nx + 3y ≤ 18\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this, we can use the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 20\ny ≤ -2x + 20\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 18\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 6\n\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 6), (6, 4), and (9, 0). Now, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 6) = 5(0) + 7(6) = 42\n3. P(6, 4) = 5(6) + 7(4) = 30 + 28 = 58\n4. P(9, 0) = 5(9) + 7(0) = 45\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (6, 4), with a profit of $58. The company should produce 6 units of product X and 4 units of product Y to maximize its profit."
