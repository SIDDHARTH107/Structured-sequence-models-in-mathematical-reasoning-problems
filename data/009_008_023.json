Assume that the string is fixed at both ends, so that $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$ for all $t$, where $L$ is the length of the string. The initial configuration of the string is given by $u(x,0) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$. \n\nDetermine the displacement of the string as a function of position and time, i.e., find $u(x,t)$. Assume that $L = 1$ meter and $t$ is measured in seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t).$$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = 9X''(x)T(t).$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 9\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}.$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 9\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2.$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T''(t) = -\\lambda^2 T(t)$\n2. $X''(x) = -\\frac{\\lambda^2}{9} X(x)$\n\nThe second equation has the general solution:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda x}{3}) + B\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda x}{3}).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$, we get $X(0) = X(1) = 0$. Since $L = 1$, we have:\n\n$$X(0) = B\\cos(0) = B = 0,$$\n\nand\n\n$$X(1) = A\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{3}) = 0.$$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\frac{\\lambda}{3} = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, $\\lambda = 3n\\pi$, and the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(3n\\pi x).$$\n\nNow we solve the first equation for $T(t)$. Since $\\lambda = 3n\\pi$, we have:\n\n$$T''(t) = -(3n\\pi)^2 T(t).$$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(3n\\pi t) + D\\sin(3n\\pi t).$$\n\nApplying the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 3n\\pi X(x)D = 0.$$\n\nSince $X(x)$ is not identically zero, we must have $D = 0$. Thus, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(3n\\pi t).$$\n\nNow, the general solution for $u(x,t)$ is a sum of solutions for each $n$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(3n\\pi x)\\cos(3n\\pi t).$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$:\n\n$$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(3n\\pi x)\\cos(0).$$\n\nUsing the orthogonality of sine functions, we can find $A_n$:\n\n$$A_n = 2\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(3n\\pi x) dx.$$\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have:\n\n$$A_1 = 2\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(3\\pi x) dx = \\frac{4}{\\pi}.$$\n\nFor $n > 1$, the integral evaluates to zero. Therefore, the solution for the displacement of the string is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\sin(3\\pi x)\\cos(3\\pi t).$$"
