    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The cost of producing a chair is $20 while the cost of producing a table is $30. The factory wants to produce at least 100 chairs and 60 tables. The factory can produce a maximum of 200 products due to limited resources. If the profit for a chair is $30 and the profit for a table is $50, what is the optimal combination of chairs and tables that the factory should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x ≥ 100 (at least 100 chairs)\n2. y ≥ 60 (at least 60 tables)\n3. x + y ≤ 200 (maximum of 200 products)\n\nThe profit function is P(x, y) = 30x + 50y, which we want to maximize.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region based on the constraints. Since x ≥ 100 and y ≥ 60, we are in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. The line x + y = 200 is the boundary for the maximum number of products. The feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (100, 60), (100, 140), and (200, 0).\n\nNow we need to check the profit at each vertex:\n\n1. P(100, 60) = 30(100) + 50(60) = 3000 + 3000 = 6000\n2. P(100, 140) = 30(100) + 50(140) = 3000 + 7000 = 10000\n3. P(200, 0) = 30(200) + 50(0) = 6000 + 0 = 6000\n\nThe maximum profit is $10,000, which occurs when the factory produces 100 chairs and 140 tables."
