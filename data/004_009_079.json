    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)(4x - 5) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 3x\nv(x) = 4x - 5\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x + 3\nv'(x) = 4\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstituting the functions and their derivatives, we get:\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(4x - 5) + (x^2 + 3x)(4)\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 8x^2 - 6x - 12x + 15 + 4x^2 + 12x\nf'(x) = 8x^2 - 18x + 15 + 4x^2 + 12x\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 6x + 15\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x)(4x - 5) is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 6x + 15"
