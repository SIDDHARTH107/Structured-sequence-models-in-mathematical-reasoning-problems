    "message_2": "To solve the given equation, sin(2x) + sqrt(3)cos(x) = 1, we can use the double angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + sqrt(3)cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x) from the equation:\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + sqrt(3)) = 1\n\nThere are two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: cos(x) = 0\nx = π/2, 3π/2\n\nCase 2: 2sin(x) + sqrt(3) = 1\n2sin(x) = 1 - sqrt(3)\nsin(x) = (1 - sqrt(3))/2\n\nThe value of sin(x) is between -1 and 1, and the value of (1 - sqrt(3))/2 is approximately -0.366, which is within the valid range. To find the angles x, we can use the arcsine function:\n\nx = arcsin((1 - sqrt(3))/2)\n\nThere are two angles in the range [0, 2π] that have this sine value:\n\nx = arcsin((1 - sqrt(3))/2) and x = π - arcsin((1 - sqrt(3))/2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 0.481 and x ≈ 2.661\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the range [0, 2π] are:\n\nx ≈ 0.481, π/2, 2.661, and 3π/2."
