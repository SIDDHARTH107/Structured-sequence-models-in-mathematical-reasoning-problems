    "message_1": "In a certain population, the probability of a person having a specific medical condition is 0.05. If a sample of 200 people is taken from this population, what is the probability that exactly 10 people in the sample will have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, people with the medical condition) in n trials (the sample size)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (having the medical condition) in a single trial\n- n is the number of trials (sample size)\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 200 (sample size)\n- k = 10 (number of people with the medical condition)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of having the medical condition)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = (200C10) * (0.05^10) * (1-0.05)^(200-10)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 200C10:\n200C10 = 200! / (10!(200-10)!) = 200! / (10!190!) ≈ 5.71 * 10^12\n\nNext, calculate 0.05^10:\n0.05^10 ≈ 9.76 * 10^-14\n\nFinally, calculate (1-0.05)^(200-10):\n(0.95)^190 ≈ 1.80 * 10^-1\n\nNow, multiply all the calculated values together:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ (5.71 * 10^12) * (9.76 * 10^-14) * (1.80 * 10^-1) ≈ 0.0318\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 people in the sample of 200 will have the medical condition is approximately 0.0318 or 3.18%."
