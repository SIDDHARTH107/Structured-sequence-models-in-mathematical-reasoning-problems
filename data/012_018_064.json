    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least one isolated vertex or separate the graph into two or more disconnected components.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles and has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, a tree with 9 vertices would have 8 edges. Since our graph has 14 edges, it has 6 more edges than a tree with the same number of vertices.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can remove edges that form cycles. By removing these edges, we can convert the graph into a tree, which is the minimum connected graph. Since we have 6 extra edges that form cycles, we need to remove at least 6 edges to disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph is 6."
