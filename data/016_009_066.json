After one iteration of the Dragon curve, the line is replaced by two segments of length 1, where one segment turns at a right angle and the other segment turns at a 45-degree angle. \n\nWhat is the total length of the line after 5 iterations of the Dragon curve?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the length of the line after each iteration of the Dragon curve:\n\nIteration 0: Initial straight line segment of length 1.\n\nIteration 1: Two segments of length 1/√2 (since each segment turns at a 45-degree angle). Total length = 2 * (1/√2) = √2.\n\nIteration 2: Each segment from the previous iteration is replaced by two segments of length 1/2. Total length = 4 * (1/2) = 2.\n\nIteration 3: Each segment from the previous iteration is replaced by two segments of length 1/(2√2). Total length = 8 * (1/(2√2)) = 2√2.\n\nIteration 4: Each segment from the previous iteration is replaced by two segments of length 1/4. Total length = 16 * (1/4) = 4.\n\nIteration 5: Each segment from the previous iteration is replaced by two segments of length 1/(4√2). Total length = 32 * (1/(4√2)) = 4√2.\n\nSo, the total length of the line after 5 iterations of the Dragon curve is 4√2."
