    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), can be found using the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3)/dx - d(5x^2)/dx + d(3x)/dx - d(1)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^2) - 2(5x) + 3\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3\n\nf'(2) = 6(4) - 20 + 3\n\nf'(2) = 24 - 20 + 3\n\nf'(2) = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 7."
