The production process for both products requires two raw materials X and Y. The following table shows the amount of each raw material needed to produce one unit of each product and the available total amount of each raw material:\n\n| Product | X (kg) | Y (kg) |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| A       | 2      | 1      |\n| B       | 1      | 1      |\n| Total   | 60     | 35     |\n\nThe manufacturer has a production capacity of 30 units for product A and 50 units for product B. Maximize the total profit of the manufacturer using cuckoo search algorithm.",
    "message_2": "Cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is based on the breeding behavior of cuckoo birds. However, as a text-based AI, I am unable to execute the cuckoo search algorithm directly. Instead, I will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to implement the cuckoo search algorithm to solve this problem.\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function is the total profit, which is given by the equation P = 30A + 20B, where A and B are the number of units of product A and B, respectively.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are given by the availability of raw materials X and Y, and the production capacity for products A and B. These can be represented as follows:\n\n   2A + B <= 60 (raw material X constraint)\n   A + B <= 35 (raw material Y constraint)\n   0 <= A <= 30 (production capacity of product A)\n   0 <= B <= 50 (production capacity of product B)\n\n3. Initialize the cuckoo search algorithm parameters: Choose the number of nests (n), the probability of discovering an alien egg (p_a), and the step size (α).\n\n4. Generate an initial population of n nests (solutions) randomly, ensuring that they satisfy the constraints.\n\n5. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the objective function.\n\n6. Perform the following steps iteratively until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy):\n\n   a. Choose a random nest and generate a new solution by performing a Levy flight (a random walk with step size α).\n   \n   b. If the new solution is better than the chosen nest and satisfies the constraints, replace the chosen nest with the new solution.\n   \n   c. Evaluate the fitness of the new nest (solution) using the objective function.\n   \n   d. Randomly choose a fraction (p_a) of the worst nests and replace them with new random solutions that satisfy the constraints.\n   \n   e. Evaluate the fitness of the new nests (solutions) using the objective function.\n   \n   f. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n7. The best solution found by the algorithm represents the optimal number of units of products A and B to maximize the total profit.\n\nPlease note that the cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic optimization algorithm, and the quality of the solution may depend on the choice of parameters and the number of iterations. You may need to experiment with different parameter settings and run the algorithm multiple times to find a good solution."
