    "message_2": "To determine if X is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nFirst, let's consider the closure of A in X. Since the closure of A is [0,1], it means that [0,1] is the smallest closed set containing A. In particular, 0 and 1 are limit points of A.\n\nNow, let x, y ∈ X. We will construct a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nCase 1: x, y ∈ [0,1]\nIn this case, we can define f(t) = (1-t)x + ty for t ∈ [0,1]. This is a continuous function since it is a linear combination of continuous functions, and f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nCase 2: x ∈ [0,1] and y ∉ [0,1] (or vice versa)\nIn this case, we can define f(t) as follows:\n- f(t) = x for t ∈ [0,1/2]\n- f(t) = y for t ∈ (1/2,1]\n\nSince 0 and 1 are limit points of A, there exist sequences {x_n} and {y_n} in A such that x_n → 0 and y_n → 1. By the pasting lemma, f is continuous on [0,1] if it is continuous on [0,1/2] and (1/2,1] and if f(1/2) = y. Since f is constant on both intervals, it is continuous on them. Moreover, f(1/2) = y, so f is continuous on [0,1].\n\nCase 3: x, y ∉ [0,1]\nIn this case, we can define f(t) as follows:\n- f(t) = x for t ∈ [0,1/3]\n- f(t) = 0 for t ∈ (1/3,2/3)\n- f(t) = y for t ∈ (2/3,1]\n\nSince 0 is a limit point of A, there exists a sequence {x_n} in A such that x_n → 0. By the pasting lemma, f is continuous on [0,1] if it is continuous on [0,1/3], (1/3,2/3), and (2/3,1] and if f(1/3) = 0 and f(2/3) = y. Since f is constant on all three intervals, it is continuous on them. Moreover, f(1/3) = 0 and f(2/3) = y, so f is continuous on [0,1].\n\nIn all cases, we have constructed a continuous function f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Therefore, X is path-connected."
