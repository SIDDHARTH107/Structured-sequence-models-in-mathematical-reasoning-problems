    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z = 1, we first rewrite the function as a function of (z-1). Let w = z - 1, so z = w + 1. Then, the function becomes:\n\nf(w) = ((w+1)^3 - 3) / ((w+1)^2 - 1)\n\nNow, we can expand the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(w) = (w^3 + 3w^2 + 3w + 1 - 3) / (w^2 + 2w + 1 - 1)\n\nf(w) = (w^3 + 3w^2 + 3w - 2) / (w^2 + 2w)\n\nNow, we perform long division to find the Laurent series expansion:\n\n          w + 1\n        _________\nw^2+2w | w^3 + 3w^2 + 3w - 2\n          -(w^3 + 2w^2)\n        __________\n               w^2 + 3w\n               -(w^2 + 2w)\n        __________\n                     w - 2\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(w) is:\n\nf(w) = w + 1 + (w - 2) / (w^2 + 2w)\n\nNow, we can perform a partial fraction decomposition on the remaining term:\n\n(w - 2) / (w^2 + 2w) = A / w + B / (w + 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (w^2 + 2w), we get:\n\nw - 2 = A(w + 2) + Bw\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for w:\n\nw = 0: -2 = 2A => A = -1\nw = -2: 0 = -2B => B = 0\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nf(w) = w + 1 - 1/w\n\nNow, we substitute back z = w + 1:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1) + 1 - 1/(z - 1)\n\nf(z) = z - 1/(z - 1)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z = 1.\n\nThe annulus of convergence is determined by the singularities of the function. The original function f(z) has singularities at z = 1 and z = -1. Since the Laurent series is centered at z = 1, the annulus of convergence is:\n\n0 < |z - 1| < 2\n\nThis is the annulus of convergence for the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z = 1."
