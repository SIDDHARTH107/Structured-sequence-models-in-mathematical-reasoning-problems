Find the equations of the tangent planes to this surface at the points $(\\sqrt{2},1,1)$ and $(0,0,2)$. Use these equations to determine the angle between the two tangent planes.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the equations of the tangent planes, we first need to find the gradient of the surface at the given points. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe surface equation is $F(x, y, z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 12 = 0$. We compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 4y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 6z$\n\nNow, we evaluate the gradient at the given points:\n\nAt $(\\sqrt{2}, 1, 1)$:\n\n$\\nabla F = (2\\sqrt{2}, 4, 6)$\n\nAt $(0, 0, 2)$:\n\n$\\nabla F = (0, 0, 12)$\n\nThe equation of a tangent plane at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is given by:\n\n$F_x(x_0, y_0, z_0)(x - x_0) + F_y(x_0, y_0, z_0)(y - y_0) + F_z(x_0, y_0, z_0)(z - z_0) = 0$\n\nFor the point $(\\sqrt{2}, 1, 1)$, the tangent plane equation is:\n\n$2\\sqrt{2}(x - \\sqrt{2}) + 4(y - 1) + 6(z - 1) = 0$\n\nFor the point $(0, 0, 2)$, the tangent plane equation is:\n\n$12(z - 2) = 0$\n\nNow, we find the angle between the two tangent planes. The angle between two planes is equal to the angle between their normal vectors. The normal vectors are the gradients we found earlier:\n\n$\\vec{n_1} = (2\\sqrt{2}, 4, 6)$\n\n$\\vec{n_2} = (0, 0, 12)$\n\nThe angle between the normal vectors can be found using the dot product:\n\n$\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{\\vec{n_1} \\cdot \\vec{n_2}}{||\\vec{n_1}|| ||\\vec{n_2}||}$\n\n$\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{2})(0) + (4)(0) + (6)(12)}{\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{2})^2 + 4^2 + 6^2} \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 12^2}}$\n\n$\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{72}{\\sqrt{56} \\cdot 12}$\n\n$\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{72}{2\\sqrt{14} \\cdot 12}$\n\n$\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{14}}$\n\nTherefore, the angle between the two tangent planes is:\n\n$\\theta = \\arccos{\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{14}}}$"
