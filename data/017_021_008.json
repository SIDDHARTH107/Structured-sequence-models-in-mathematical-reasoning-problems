    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the fact that the number of groups of order n is given by the number of conjugacy classes of the symmetric group S_n. In this case, we are interested in the number of groups of order 48.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 48: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order n, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(k-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(l-1) * (q-1))\n\nwhere p and q are distinct prime factors of n, k and l are the highest powers of p and q dividing n, and n(G) is the number of groups of order n.\n\nIn our case, p = 2, k = 4, q = 3, and l = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nn(G) = (2^(4-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1))\nn(G) = (2^3 * 1) * (3^0 * 2)\nn(G) = (8 * 1) * (1 * 2)\nn(G) = 8 * 2\nn(G) = 16\n\nSo there are 16 non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nTo find their respective isomorphism types, we can use the following classification:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_48\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_2 × C_24, C_3 × C_16, C_4 × C_12, C_6 × C_8\n3. Semidirect product of two cyclic groups: C_2 ⋊ C_24, C_3 ⋊ C_16, C_4 ⋊ C_12, C_6 ⋊ C_8\n4. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_2 × C_2 × C_12, C_2 × C_3 × C_8, C_2 × C_4 × C_6, C_3 × C_2 × C_8\n5. Semidirect product of three cyclic groups: C_2 ⋊ (C_2 × C_12), C_2 ⋊ (C_3 × C_8), C_2 ⋊ (C_4 × C_6), C_3 ⋊ (C_2 × C_8)\n\nThese are the 16 non-isomorphic groups of order 48 and their respective isomorphism types."
