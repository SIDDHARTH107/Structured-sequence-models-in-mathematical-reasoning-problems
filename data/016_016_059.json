    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is constructed iteratively. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 7.\n\nFor the first iteration, the length is 1 unit (the initial straight line segment).\n\nFor the second iteration, the length is 1 * sqrt(7) units.\n\nFor the third iteration, the length is 1 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(7) units.\n\nFor the fourth iteration, the length is 1 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(7) * sqrt(7) units.\n\nSo, the total length of the fourth iteration of the Gosper curve is 1 * 7^(3/2) units, which is approximately 18.47520861406803 units."
