    "message_2": "The given manifold M is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1. This is a hyperboloid of one sheet. To determine the symmetries of this manifold, we need to find the transformations that leave the equation invariant.\n\n1. Reflections through the coordinate planes:\n- Reflecting through the xy-plane: (x, y, z) → (x, y, -z)\n- Reflecting through the xz-plane: (x, y, z) → (x, -y, z)\n- Reflecting through the yz-plane: (x, y, z) → (-x, y, z)\n\n2. Rotations about the coordinate axes:\n- Rotation about the x-axis by 180 degrees: (x, y, z) → (x, -y, -z)\n- Rotation about the y-axis by 180 degrees: (x, y, z) → (-x, y, -z)\n- Rotation about the z-axis by 180 degrees: (x, y, z) → (-x, -y, z)\n\n3. 180-degree rotation about the line x = y:\n- (x, y, z) → (y, x, -z)\n\n4. Scaling:\n- Uniform scaling: (x, y, z) → (kx, ky, kz) for k ≠ 0, where k is a constant. Note that this transformation is not a symmetry for the given manifold, as it does not leave the equation invariant.\n\nThese are the main symmetries of the hyperboloid of one sheet defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1."
