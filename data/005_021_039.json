    "message_1": "A survey of 100 people was conducted to determine the average income of a certain community. The mean income of the surveyed individuals is found to be $50,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000. A math student wants to estimate the average income of the entire community. Using bootstrapping, what is the 95% confidence interval for the mean income of the community?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean income of the community using bootstrapping, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the original sample with replacement multiple times (e.g., 1000 or more times) to create a large number of bootstrap samples.\n2. Calculate the mean income for each bootstrap sample.\n3. Arrange the bootstrap sample means in ascending order.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap sample means, which will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nHowever, as an AI, I am unable to perform the bootstrapping process directly. Instead, I can provide you with an alternative method to approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution.\n\nSince we know the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) is $50,000 and the standard deviation (s) is $10,000, we can calculate the standard error (SE) using the formula:\n\nSE = s / √n\n\nwhere n is the sample size (100 in this case).\n\nSE = 10,000 / √100 = 10,000 / 10 = 1,000\n\nNow, we can use the t-distribution to find the critical value (t*) for a 95% confidence interval with 99 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 100 - 1 = 99). The critical value for a two-tailed test with 99 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.984.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the margin of error (ME) using the formula:\n\nME = t* × SE\n\nME = 1.984 × 1,000 = 1,984\n\nNow, we can find the 95% confidence interval by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the sample mean:\n\nLower bound = $\\bar{x}$ - ME = 50,000 - 1,984 = 48,016\nUpper bound = $\\bar{x}$ + ME = 50,000 + 1,984 = 51,984\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean income of the community is approximately $48,016 to $51,984. Keep in mind that this is an approximation using the t-distribution, and the actual bootstrapping method may yield slightly different results."
