Let Hodge numbers h^{1,0}(X), h^{0,1}(X) and h^{1,1}(X) respectively denote the dimensions of the complex vector spaces of holomorphic one-forms, antiholomorphic one-forms, and harmonic two-forms on X.\n\nFind the values of h^{1,0}(X), h^{0,1}(X), and h^{1,1}(X) for the given curve X of genus 2.",
    "message_2": "For a smooth projective curve X of genus g, the Hodge numbers can be determined using the following formulas:\n\n1. h^{1,0}(X) = g, which is the dimension of the space of holomorphic one-forms on X.\n2. h^{0,1}(X) = g, which is the dimension of the space of antiholomorphic one-forms on X.\n3. h^{1,1}(X) = 0, as there are no harmonic two-forms on a smooth projective curve.\n\nGiven that the curve X has genus 2, we can find the values of the Hodge numbers as follows:\n\n1. h^{1,0}(X) = 2\n2. h^{0,1}(X) = 2\n3. h^{1,1}(X) = 0\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers for the given curve X of genus 2 are h^{1,0}(X) = 2, h^{0,1}(X) = 2, and h^{1,1}(X) = 0."
