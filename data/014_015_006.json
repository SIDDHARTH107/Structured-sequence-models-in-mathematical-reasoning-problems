    "message_2": "To apply the Rail Fence cipher with a depth of 3, we write the message in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows and then read the message from left to right along each row. Here's the pattern for \"HELLO WORLD\":\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the message along each row: HORELWLDLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is: HORELWLDLO"
