    "message_1": "Sure, here's a possible question for the student:\n\nConsider the two-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions:\n\n$-\\Delta u = f$ in $\\Omega$, $u = g$ on $\\partial\\Omega$\n\nwhere $\\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\Delta$ is the Laplace operator, $u$ is the unknown function, $f$ is a given source distribution, and $g$ is a given boundary condition. Assume that $\\Omega$ is discretized by a triangulation with linear finite element basis functions. \n\nFormulate a finite element method to solve this problem numerically, using Galerkin's method and piecewise linear basis functions. Write down the stiffness matrix $A$ and load vector $b$ for a single element, and use them to demonstrate the assembly procedure for a small mesh with 2 elements. Solve the resulting linear system for the unknown nodal values $u_i$, and compute the L2 error norm of the numerical solution compared to the exact solution for a given test problem with a known analytical solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve the problem numerically using Galerkin's method and piecewise linear basis functions, we first approximate the unknown function $u$ by a linear combination of basis functions:\n\n$u_h = \\sum_{i=1}^N u_i \\phi_i$\n\nwhere $u_h$ is the approximate solution, $u_i$ are the unknown nodal values, $\\phi_i$ are the piecewise linear basis functions, and $N$ is the number of nodes in the mesh.\n\nNext, we multiply the Poisson equation by a test function $v_j$ and integrate over the domain $\\Omega$:\n\n$\\int_\\Omega -\\Delta u_h v_j d\\Omega = \\int_\\Omega f v_j d\\Omega$\n\nUsing integration by parts and applying the boundary conditions, we obtain the weak form of the problem:\n\n$\\int_\\Omega \\nabla u_h \\cdot \\nabla v_j d\\Omega = \\int_\\Omega f v_j d\\Omega$\n\nNow, we can write down the stiffness matrix $A$ and load vector $b$ for a single element. The stiffness matrix is given by:\n\n$A_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_j d\\Omega$\n\nand the load vector is given by:\n\n$b_j = \\int_{\\Omega_e} f \\phi_j d\\Omega$\n\nFor a small mesh with 2 elements, we can assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector by summing the contributions from each element. Let $A^1$ and $A^2$ be the stiffness matrices for the first and second elements, and $b^1$ and $b^2$ be the load vectors for the first and second elements, respectively. Then, the global stiffness matrix $A$ and load vector $b$ are given by:\n\n$A = A^1 + A^2$\n\n$b = b^1 + b^2$\n\nWe can now solve the resulting linear system $Au = b$ for the unknown nodal values $u_i$. Once we have the nodal values, we can compute the approximate solution $u_h$ and compare it to the exact solution $u$.\n\nTo compute the L2 error norm of the numerical solution, we first compute the error function $e = u - u_h$. Then, the L2 error norm is given by:\n\n$L2\\text{-}error = \\sqrt{\\int_\\Omega e^2 d\\Omega}$\n\nFor a given test problem with a known analytical solution, we can compute the L2 error norm to evaluate the accuracy of our numerical solution."
