    "message_1": "Here's an example question for an Epistemic Logic problem:\n\nSuppose there are four mathematicians, named Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave. They all know that at least one of them has a blue dot on their forehead, but they do not know if they have one themselves. They can see each other's foreheads but not their own. Alice says, \"I do not know if I have a blue dot.\" Bob says, \"I do not know if I have a blue dot.\" Charlie says, \"I do not know if I have a blue dot.\" Dave says, \"I have a blue dot.\" \n\nHow many mathematicians in total have a blue dot on their forehead?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Alice sees the foreheads of Bob, Charlie, and Dave. If she saw only one blue dot, she would know that she doesn't have a blue dot because there must be at least one blue dot among them. However, she says she doesn't know, which means she sees more than one blue dot.\n\n2. Bob hears Alice's statement and now knows that there are at least two blue dots. If Bob saw only one blue dot (on Charlie or Dave), he would know that he has a blue dot. However, he says he doesn't know, which means he sees more than one blue dot as well.\n\n3. Charlie hears both Alice's and Bob's statements and now knows that there are at least three blue dots. If Charlie saw only one blue dot (on Dave), he would know that he has a blue dot. However, he says he doesn't know, which means he sees more than one blue dot.\n\n4. Dave hears all three statements and knows that there must be at least three blue dots. Since Dave can see Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and they all have blue dots, he concludes that he also has a blue dot.\n\nTherefore, all four mathematicians have a blue dot on their forehead."
