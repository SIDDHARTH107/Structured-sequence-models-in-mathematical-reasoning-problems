    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n5 & -3 & 2 & 7 \\\\\n8 & 9 & -6 & 12 \\\\\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n8 & 9 & -6 & 12 \\\\\n5 & -3 & 2 & 7\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-4 * Row 1 + Row 2):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 26 & -24 \\\\\n5 & -3 & 2 & 7\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (-2.5 * Row 1 + Row 3):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 26 & -24 \\\\\n0 & -10.5 & 22 & -15.5\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by -3:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -26/3 & 8 \\\\\n0 & -10.5 & 22 & -15.5\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n5. Replace Row 3 with (-10.5 * Row 2 + Row 3):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -26/3 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -14 & 98\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n6. Divide Row 3 by -14:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3 & -8 & 9 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -26/3 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -7\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have $z = -7$. \n\nFrom the second row, we have $y - \\frac{26}{3}(-7) = 8 \\Rightarrow y = 8 + \\frac{26}{3}(-7) = 2$.\n\nFrom the first row, we have $2x + 3(2) - 8(-7) = 9 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{2}(9 - 6 + 56) = 1$.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is $(x, y, z) = (1, 2, -7)$.\n\nTo determine if the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned, we need to calculate its condition number. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. If the condition number is significantly larger than 1, the matrix is considered ill-conditioned.\n\nThe matrix of coefficients is:\n\n$$\nA = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n5 & -3 & 2 \\\\\n8 & 9 & -6 \\\\\n2 & 3 & -8\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe inverse of the matrix A is:\n\n$$\nA^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-330}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n-114 & -66 & -84 \\\\\n-88 & -110 & 66 \\\\\n-44 & -66 & 55\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nUsing the infinity norm (maximum absolute row sum) for both A and A^{-1}, we have:\n\n$$\n||A||_\\infty = 23, \\quad ||A^{-1}||_\\infty = \\frac{266}{330}\n$$\n\nThe condition number is:\n\n$$\n\\kappa(A) = ||A||_\\infty \\cdot ||A^{-1}||_\\infty = 23 \\cdot \\frac{266}{330} \\approx 20.56\n$$\n\nSince the condition number is not significantly larger than 1, the matrix of coefficients is not considered ill-conditioned."
