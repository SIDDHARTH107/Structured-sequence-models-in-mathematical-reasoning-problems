    "message_1": "Let's say a company is considering offering a performance-based bonus to its employees. The company can either offer a bonus proportional to the employee's performance or a flat bonus. The probability of an employee's good performance is 0.8, and the probability of bad performance is 0.2. If the company offers a flat bonus of $5000, an employee will receive it regardless of their performance. Alternatively, if the company offers a proportional bonus, an employee will receive a bonus of $8000 if they perform well and $2000 if they perform poorly.\n\nBased on the expected utility theory, which bonus option should a risk-neutral employee choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which bonus option a risk-neutral employee should choose, we need to calculate the expected value of each option.\n\nFor the flat bonus of $5000, the expected value is simply $5000, as the employee will receive this amount regardless of their performance.\n\nFor the proportional bonus, we need to calculate the expected value based on the probabilities of good and bad performance:\n\nExpected value (proportional bonus) = (probability of good performance * bonus for good performance) + (probability of bad performance * bonus for bad performance)\n\nExpected value (proportional bonus) = (0.8 * $8000) + (0.2 * $2000) = $6400 + $400 = $6800\n\nComparing the expected values of both options, the risk-neutral employee should choose the proportional bonus option, as it has a higher expected value of $6800 compared to the flat bonus of $5000."
