    "message_1": "If an encrypted message using a substitution cipher has the letters 'T', 'A', and 'O' substituted with 'R', 'M', and 'G', respectively, what is the probability of correctly guessing the 'T', 'A', or 'O' letter in the original message with just one attempt?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of correctly guessing the 'T', 'A', or 'O' letter in the original message with just one attempt, we need to consider the total number of possible letters in the alphabet and the number of correct letters we are trying to guess.\n\nThere are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and we are trying to guess one of the 3 specific letters ('T', 'A', or 'O'). So, the probability of correctly guessing one of these letters in one attempt is:\n\n(Number of correct letters) / (Total number of letters) = 3 / 26\n\nThe probability of correctly guessing the 'T', 'A', or 'O' letter in the original message with just one attempt is 3/26 or approximately 0.1154 (rounded to four decimal places)."
