    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra:\n\nSuppose that f(z) is an entire function such that |f(z)| ≤ 10 for all complex numbers z. Show that f(z) is a constant function.\n\nHint: Consider the function g(z) = 1/f(z) and apply Liouville's theorem to this function. Remember to use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that g(z) has no zeros.",
    "message_2": "To show that f(z) is a constant function, we will follow the hint and consider the function g(z) = 1/f(z). We will first show that g(z) is an entire function, then apply Liouville's theorem to g(z), and finally use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that g(z) has no zeros.\n\n1. g(z) is entire:\n\nSince f(z) is an entire function, it is holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable) everywhere in the complex plane. The function g(z) = 1/f(z) is the reciprocal of f(z), and the reciprocal of a holomorphic function is holomorphic wherever the function is nonzero. Since f(z) is nonzero everywhere (as we will show later), g(z) is also an entire function.\n\n2. Apply Liouville's theorem to g(z):\n\nLiouville's theorem states that if a function is entire and bounded, then it must be a constant function. We are given that |f(z)| ≤ 10 for all complex numbers z. Since g(z) = 1/f(z), we have |g(z)| = 1/|f(z)|. Since |f(z)| is always greater than or equal to some positive constant (as we will show later), |g(z)| is bounded. Therefore, by Liouville's theorem, g(z) is a constant function.\n\n3. Use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that g(z) has no zeros:\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Since f(z) is an entire function, it can be represented as a power series. If f(z) were not a constant function, it would have at least one complex root by the fundamental theorem of algebra. However, if f(z) had a root, say z_0, then g(z_0) = 1/f(z_0) would be undefined, which contradicts the fact that g(z) is entire. Therefore, f(z) must be a constant function with no zeros, and g(z) has no zeros as well.\n\nIn conclusion, since g(z) is a constant function, we have g(z) = 1/f(z) = c for some constant c. This implies that f(z) = 1/c for all z, which shows that f(z) is a constant function."
