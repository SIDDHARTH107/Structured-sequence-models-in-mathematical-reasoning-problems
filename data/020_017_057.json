    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of material used in the glass production, we need to minimize the surface area of the cylindrical glass, as the material cost is directly proportional to the surface area. \n\nLet r be the radius and h be the height of the cylindrical glass. The volume V of the glass is given by:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nSince the volume is 500 ml, we have:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nNow, we need to express the height h in terms of the radius r. From the volume equation, we get:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nThe surface area A of the cylindrical glass is given by:\n\nA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nNow, substitute the expression for h in terms of r into the surface area equation:\n\nA(r) = 2πr^2 + 2πr(500 / (πr^2))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nA(r) = 2πr^2 + 1000/r\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(r) with respect to r and setting it to 0:\n\ndA/dr = 4πr - 1000/r^2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\n4πr^3 - 1000 = 0\n\nr^3 = 1000 / (4π)\n\nr^3 ≈ 79.577\n\nr ≈ 4.326 cm\n\nNow, find the height h using the expression for h in terms of r:\n\nh ≈ 500 / (π(4.326)^2)\n\nh ≈ 8.652 cm\n\nSo, to minimize the cost of material used, the radius of the cylindrical glass should be approximately 4.326 cm, and the height should be approximately 8.652 cm."
