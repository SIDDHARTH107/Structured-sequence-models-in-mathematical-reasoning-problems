    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the logistic equation iteratively for 20 generations. Let's first normalize the initial population by dividing by the carrying capacity (maximum possible population). Assuming the carrying capacity is 1000 rabbits, the initial normalized population X0 is 0.1 (100/1000).\n\nNow we will apply the logistic equation for 20 generations:\n\nXn+1 = rXn(1 - Xn)\n\nWe have r = 3.8 and X0 = 0.1. Let's calculate the population for each generation:\n\nX1 = 3.8 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.342\nX2 = 3.8 * 0.342 * (1 - 0.342) ≈ 0.855\n...\nX20 ≈ 0.513\n\nNow, we need to convert the normalized population back to the actual population by multiplying by the carrying capacity:\n\nPopulation after 20 generations ≈ 0.513 * 1000 ≈ 513\n\nSo, after 20 generations, the population of rabbits will be approximately 513 rabbits."
