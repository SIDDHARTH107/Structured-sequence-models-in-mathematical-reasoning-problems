    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank using integration, we can consider the tank as a series of infinitesimally thin circular disks stacked on top of each other. The volume of each disk can be found using the formula for the area of a circle (πr^2) multiplied by its infinitesimally small height (dh). Then, we can integrate the volume of these disks with respect to height (h) from 0 to the total height of the tank (10 meters).\n\nLet's set up the integral:\n\nV = ∫[πr^2 dh] from h = 0 to h = 10\n\nSince the radius (r) of the tank is constant (5 meters), we can take it out of the integral:\n\nV = π(5^2) ∫[dh] from h = 0 to h = 10\n\nV = 25π ∫[dh] from h = 0 to h = 10\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to h:\n\nV = 25π [h] from h = 0 to h = 10\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = 25π (10 - 0)\n\nV = 250π\n\nSo, the volume of the cylindrical tank is 250π cubic meters."
