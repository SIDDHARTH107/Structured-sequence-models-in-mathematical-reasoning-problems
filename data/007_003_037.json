    "message_2": "To solve the equation 4x ≡ 24 (mod 10), we first need to simplify the equation.\n\nSince 24 ≡ 4 (mod 10), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4x ≡ 4 (mod 10)\n\nNow, we want to find the inverse of 4 modulo 10. The inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm' is a number 'a_inv' such that (a * a_inv) ≡ 1 (mod m).\n\nThe inverse of 4 modulo 10 is 3, because (4 * 3) ≡ 12 ≡ 1 (mod 10).\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of 4 modulo 10:\n\n(4x) * 3 ≡ 4 * 3 (mod 10)\n\n12x ≡ 12 (mod 10)\n\nSince 12 ≡ 2 (mod 10), we can simplify the equation further:\n\n2x ≡ 2 (mod 10)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 10)\n\nSo, the value of x is 1."
