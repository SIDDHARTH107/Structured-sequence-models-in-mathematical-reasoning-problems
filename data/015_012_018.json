    "message_2": "The Lorenz system is a set of three differential equations that describe the behavior of a simplified model of fluid convection in the atmosphere. The equations are as follows:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the state variables, and σ, ρ, and β are parameters. The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, with a positive exponent indicating chaotic behavior.\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz system with initial conditions (1, 1, 1.05), we would need to numerically integrate the Lorenz equations and calculate the Lyapunov exponent using a numerical algorithm. This is typically done using computer simulations and specialized software.\n\nHowever, it is known that for the classical Lorenz system with parameters σ = 10, ρ = 28, and β = 8/3, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is approximately 0.9056. The value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent can change depending on the specific parameter values and initial conditions, so without more information or a numerical simulation, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the given initial conditions."
