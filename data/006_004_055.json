    "message_1": "John and Mary are playing a game in which John rolls a fair die twice. If the sum of the two rolls is 7 or 11, he wins; otherwise, Mary wins. What is the probability that John wins the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that John wins the game, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 7 or 11) and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a fair die twice.\n\nThere are 6 sides on a fair die, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow let's find the successful outcomes:\n\nFor a sum of 7, the possible rolls are:\n(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1). That's 6 successful outcomes.\n\nFor a sum of 11, the possible rolls are:\n(5, 6) and (6, 5). That's 2 successful outcomes.\n\nSo, there are a total of 6 + 2 = 8 successful outcomes.\n\nThe probability that John wins the game is the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes:\n\nP(John wins) = (Successful outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 8 / 36 = 2 / 9.\n\nTherefore, the probability that John wins the game is 2/9 or approximately 0.2222."
