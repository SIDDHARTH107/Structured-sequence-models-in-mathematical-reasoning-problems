    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism behavior of some cuckoo species. The algorithm involves generating new solutions (nest locations) and comparing their fitness (objective function value) to find the best solution. Here's a simplified version of the cuckoo search algorithm to find the global minimum of the function f(x):\n\n1. Initialize the population of n nests (solutions) randomly within the search space (0 ≤ x ≤ 4).\n2. Evaluate the fitness (f(x)) of each nest.\n3. Perform the following steps for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met:\n   a. Select a cuckoo (nest) randomly and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. Choose a random nest to compare with the new solution. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the old nest with the new solution.\n   d. With a probability pa, replace a fraction of the worst nests with new random solutions.\n   e. Evaluate the fitness of all nests and keep track of the best solution found so far.\n4. The best solution found is the global minimum of the function f(x).\n\nTo implement the cuckoo search algorithm, you would need to define parameters such as the number of nests, the number of iterations, and the probability of replacing the worst nests. You would also need to implement the random walk (Levy flight) for generating new solutions.\n\nSince I am an AI language model and cannot execute code, I cannot directly provide you with the value of x that gives the minimum value of the function. However, you can implement the cuckoo search algorithm in a programming language of your choice (such as Python) and use it to find the global minimum of the function f(x) within the given search space."
