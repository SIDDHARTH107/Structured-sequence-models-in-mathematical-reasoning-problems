    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. The length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (original length) * (2^n) * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nFor 4 iterations with an original length of 1, we have:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^4) * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nLength = 1 * 16 * (1/sqrt(2))\n\nLength = 16/sqrt(2)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):\n\nLength = (16 * sqrt(2)) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2))\n\nLength = (16 * sqrt(2)) / 2\n\nLength = 8 * sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after 4 iterations with an original length of 1 is 8 * sqrt(2)."
