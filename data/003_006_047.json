    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side using the Law of Cosines, not the Law of Sines, since we have two sides and the included angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, we have:\n\na = 7\nb = 10\nC = 60 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can apply the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 7² + 10² - 2 * 7 * 10 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 49 + 100 - 140 * (1/2)\nc² = 149 - 70\nc² = 79\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √79 ≈ 8.89\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 8.89 units."
