    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 1  1 | 5\n| 2  2 | 10\n| 3  3 | 15\n```\n\nNext, we perform Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix to its row echelon form.\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n| 1  1 | 5\n| 0  0 | 0\n| 3  3 | 15\n```\n\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  1 | 5\n| 0  0 | 0\n| 0  0 | 0\n```\n\nThe row reduced matrix has a row of zeros, which means that the system of equations is dependent. Since there is no inconsistency (e.g., 0 = nonzero number), the system has infinitely many solutions."
