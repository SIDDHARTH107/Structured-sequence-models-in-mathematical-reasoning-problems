    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X, D), we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a smooth, projective curve X of genus g and a divisor D on X, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) denotes the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X, D), K_X is the canonical divisor on X, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, we have a curve X of genus g = 3 and a divisor D with deg(D) = 5. The canonical divisor K_X has degree 2g - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = 5 + 1 - 3\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = 3\n\nTo find l(K_X - D), we first need to find the degree of the divisor K_X - D:\n\ndeg(K_X - D) = deg(K_X) - deg(D) = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nSince the degree of K_X - D is negative, there are no global sections, so l(K_X - D) = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nl(D) - 0 = 3\nl(D) = 3\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of global sections H⁰(X, D) is 3."
