Round each value to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first write the system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables, and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & -3 & 0.5 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nX = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nB = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6.2 \\\\\n9.9 \\\\\n-0.1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A_inv, and then multiply it by B to get the solution X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nFirst, we find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.246 & 0.066 & -0.082 \\\\\n0.082 & 0.164 & -0.041 \\\\\n-0.123 & 0.033 & 0.541\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we multiply A_inv by B:\n\nX = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.246 & 0.066 & -0.082 \\\\\n0.082 & 0.164 & -0.041 \\\\\n-0.123 & 0.033 & 0.541\n\\end{bmatrix} * \\begin{bmatrix}\n6.2 \\\\\n9.9 \\\\\n-0.1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nX = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.99 \\\\\n2.01 \\\\\n-1.00\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is approximately (x, y, z) = (1.99, 2.01, -1.00), rounded to two decimal places."
