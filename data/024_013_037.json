    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we need to compute the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix with the coefficients of the metric:\n\nG = | 1      0               0         |\n      | 0      r^2          0         |\n      | 0      0      r^2 sin^2(θ) |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of G:\n\ndet(G) = 1 * (r^2 * r^2 sin^2(θ)) - 0 - 0 = r^4 sin^2(θ)\n\nNext, we take the square root of the determinant:\n\nsqrt(det(G)) = r^2 sin(θ)\n\nFinally, the volume form is given by the product of the square root of the determinant and the differentials of the coordinates:\n\ndV = sqrt(det(G)) dr dθ dφ = r^2 sin(θ) dr dθ dφ\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric is:\n\ndV = r^2 sin(θ) dr dθ dφ"
