    "message_1": "A student is given two vectors: vector A has a magnitude of 5 and points in the direction of 45 degrees, while vector B has a magnitude of 8 and points in the direction of 120 degrees. Using trigonometry, what is the angle between these two vectors?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two vectors, we can simply subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle:\n\nAngle between vectors A and B = 120 degrees - 45 degrees = 75 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is 75 degrees."
