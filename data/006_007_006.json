    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain stock price increase by $10\\%$ in a given day is $0.4$ and the probability of a decrease by $5\\%$ is $0.6$. What is the probability that the stock's price will either increase or decrease on that day?",
    "message_2": "Since the stock price can either increase by 10% or decrease by 5% in a given day, and there are no other options mentioned, the probability of either of these events happening is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nProbability of increase or decrease = Probability of increase + Probability of decrease\n= 0.4 (increase) + 0.6 (decrease)\n= 1.0\n\nSo, the probability that the stock's price will either increase or decrease on that day is 1.0 or 100%."
