    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 5 over the interval [0, 5], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval (x = 0 and x = 5):\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) + 5 = 5\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) + 5 = -3\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) + 5 = 21\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 9(5)^2 + 24(5) + 5 = 5\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function over the interval [0, 5] is 21 at x = 4, and the minimum value is -3 at x = 2."
