    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal formed by recursively removing squares from a larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares from the previous iteration are divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed, creating a hole. \n\nAfter the first iteration, there is 1 hole, and the proportion of the area covered by holes is 1/9.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 8 remaining squares from the first iteration is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. This results in 8 new holes, making a total of 1 + 8 = 9 holes. The proportion of the area covered by holes is now 9/81.\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the 8 remaining squares from the second iteration is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. This results in 8 new holes for each of the 8 remaining squares, making a total of 8 * 8 = 64 new holes. The total number of holes is now 9 + 64 = 73, and the proportion of the area covered by holes is 73/729.\n\nIn the fourth iteration, each of the 8 remaining squares from the third iteration is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. This results in 8 new holes for each of the 64 remaining squares, making a total of 8 * 64 = 512 new holes. The total number of holes is now 73 + 512 = 585, and the proportion of the area covered by holes is 585/6561.\n\nSo, after the fourth iteration, the proportion of the area covered by holes in the Sierpinski carpet is 585/6561."
