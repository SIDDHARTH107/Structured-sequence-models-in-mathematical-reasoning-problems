Each straight line section of the triangle is replaced by four straight lines, each a third of the length of the original section. How long is the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after three iterations?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after three iterations, we need to consider how the perimeter changes with each iteration. \n\nIn the first iteration, each side of the equilateral triangle is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side. So, the new perimeter is 4/3 times the original perimeter.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the four segments from the first iteration is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, the new perimeter is 4/3 times the perimeter after the first iteration.\n\nAfter the third iteration, each of the 16 segments from the second iteration is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, the new perimeter is 4/3 times the perimeter after the second iteration.\n\nLet P0 be the initial perimeter, P1 be the perimeter after the first iteration, P2 be the perimeter after the second iteration, and P3 be the perimeter after the third iteration.\n\nP0 = 3 * 10 = 30 cm (initial equilateral triangle)\n\nP1 = (4/3) * P0 = (4/3) * 30 = 40 cm (after the first iteration)\n\nP2 = (4/3) * P1 = (4/3) * 40 = 160/3 ≈ 53.33 cm (after the second iteration)\n\nP3 = (4/3) * P2 = (4/3) * (160/3) = 640/9 ≈ 71.11 cm (after the third iteration)\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after three iterations is approximately 71.11 cm."
