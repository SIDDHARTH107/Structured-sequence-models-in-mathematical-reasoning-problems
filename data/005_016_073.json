    "message_2": "To find the optimal boundary that separates \"Good\" performers from \"Bad\" performers using discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the mean vectors, covariance matrices, and the within-class scatter matrix for both classes. Then, we can use these values to compute the linear discriminant function and find the optimal boundary.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean vectors for both classes.\n\nGood performers:\nAge mean: (34 + 42 + 39 + 35 + 48 + 38) / 6 = 236 / 6 = 39.33\nExperience mean: (8 + 14 + 10 + 9 + 20 + 12) / 6 = 73 / 6 = 12.17\n\nMean vector for Good performers: (39.33, 12.17)\n\nBad performers:\nAge mean: (28 + 24 + 29 + 31) / 4 = 112 / 4 = 28\nExperience mean: (4 + 2 + 6 + 7) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n\nMean vector for Bad performers: (28, 4.75)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance matrices for both classes.\n\nGood performers:\nCovariance matrix = [Σ(x_i - mean_x)(x_i - mean_x)^T] / (n - 1)\n\nFor simplicity, we'll calculate the covariance matrix for age and experience separately and then combine them.\n\nCovariance_age = Σ(age_i - mean_age)^2 / (n - 1) = [(34-39.33)^2 + (42-39.33)^2 + (39-39.33)^2 + (35-39.33)^2 + (48-39.33)^2 + (38-39.33)^2] / 5 = 52.47\n\nCovariance_experience = Σ(experience_i - mean_experience)^2 / (n - 1) = [(8-12.17)^2 + (14-12.17)^2 + (10-12.17)^2 + (9-12.17)^2 + (20-12.17)^2 + (12-12.17)^2] / 5 = 34.47\n\nCovariance matrix for Good performers:\n[52.47, 0]\n[0, 34.47]\n\nBad performers:\nCovariance matrix = [Σ(x_i - mean_x)(x_i - mean_x)^T] / (n - 1)\n\nCovariance_age = Σ(age_i - mean_age)^2 / (n - 1) = [(28-28)^2 + (24-28)^2 + (29-28)^2 + (31-28)^2] / 3 = 8.67\n\nCovariance_experience = Σ(experience_i - mean_experience)^2 / (n - 1) = [(4-4.75)^2 + (2-4.75)^2 + (6-4.75)^2 + (7-4.75)^2] / 3 = 5.25\n\nCovariance matrix for Bad performers:\n[8.67, 0]\n[0, 5.25]\n\nStep 3: Calculate the within-class scatter matrix.\n\nWithin-class scatter matrix = Covariance matrix for Good performers * (n_good - 1) + Covariance matrix for Bad performers * (n_bad - 1)\n\nWithin-class scatter matrix:\n[52.47 * 5 + 8.67 * 3, 0]\n[0, 34.47 * 5 + 5.25 * 3]\n\nWithin-class scatter matrix:\n[314.35, 0]\n[0, 186.6]\n\nStep 4: Compute the linear discriminant function.\n\nThe linear discriminant function is given by:\n\nw = inv(S_w) * (mean_good - mean_bad)\n\nw = [1 / 314.35, 0]\n     [0, 1 / 186.6] * [(39.33 - 28), (12.17 - 4.75)]\n\nw = [0.00318, 0]\n     [0, 0.00536] * [11.33, 7.42]\n\nw = [0.036, 0.0398]\n\nStep 5: Find the optimal boundary.\n\nThe optimal boundary can be found by calculating the midpoint between the mean vectors of both classes and then projecting it onto the linear discriminant function.\n\nMidpoint = (mean_good + mean_bad) / 2\nMidpoint = (39.33 + 28, 12.17 + 4.75) / 2\nMidpoint = (33.665, 8.46)\n\nOptimal boundary = w^T * Midpoint\nOptimal boundary = [0.036, 0.0398] * [33.665, 8.46]\nOptimal boundary = 0.036 * 33.665 + 0.0398 * 8.46\nOptimal boundary = 1.21034 + 0.33668\nOptimal boundary = 1.54702\n\nThe optimal boundary that separates \"Good\" performers from \"Bad\" performers based on the age and experience of employees is approximately 1.547."
