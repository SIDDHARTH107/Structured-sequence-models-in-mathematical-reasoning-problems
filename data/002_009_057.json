    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nFor the two circular bases:\nA_base = π(5 cm)^2 = 25π cm^2\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 25π = 50π cm^2.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula A_lateral = 2πrh, where r is the radius, h is the height, and A_lateral is the lateral surface area.\n\nA_lateral = 2π(5 cm)(10 cm) = 100π cm^2\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = A_bases + A_lateral = 50π cm^2 + 100π cm^2 = 150π cm^2."
