    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of mutually tangent disks with radius 1 that can be placed on a sphere with radius 5 without overlapping, we can use the Tammes problem solution for the case when the radius of the sphere is 5 times the radius of the disks.\n\nThe Tammes problem is a mathematical problem that asks for the arrangement of points on the surface of a sphere that maximizes the minimum distance between them. In this case, we are looking for the arrangement of disks with radius 1 on a sphere with radius 5.\n\nThe solution to the Tammes problem for the case when the radius of the sphere is 5 times the radius of the disks is 12. This means that the maximum number of mutually tangent disks with radius 1 that can be placed on a sphere with radius 5 without overlapping is 12."
