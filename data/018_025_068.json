    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference of B and A with set B:\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ B = (A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the intersection of A and B with B and the intersection of B complement and A complement:\n\n(A ∩ B) ∆ (B' ∩ A') = {2, 3} ∆ (B' ∩ A')\n\nTo find B' and A', we need to know the universal set U. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for this problem.\n\nB' = {1, 5}\nA' = {4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the intersection of B' and A':\n\nB' ∩ A' = {1, 5} ∩ {4, 5} = {5}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\n{2, 3} ∆ {5} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNow, let's compare the two results:\n\nIntersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with set B: {4}\nSymmetric difference of the intersection of A and B with B and the intersection of B complement and A complement: {2, 3, 5}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as {4} ≠ {2, 3, 5}."
