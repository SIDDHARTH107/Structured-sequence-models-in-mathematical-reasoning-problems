    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, producing an identical product. The market demand for this product is given by the equation Q = 1000 - 5P, where Q is the quantity demanded in units and P is the unit price charged by firms. If both firms charge the same price, profits will be split equally. If they charge different prices, the firm charging the lower price will capture the entire market demand. \n\nAssume that firm A's cost function is given by C_A(q) = 100q, where q is the quantity produced in units. Firm B's cost function is given by C_B(q) = 150q, where q is the quantity produced in units.\n\nWhat will be the equilibrium price and quantity produced, and what will be the profits earned by each firm under Bertrand competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium price and quantity produced under Bertrand competition, we first need to find the marginal cost for each firm. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function with respect to quantity.\n\nFor firm A:\nC_A(q) = 100q\nMC_A = d(C_A)/dq = 100\n\nFor firm B:\nC_B(q) = 150q\nMC_B = d(C_B)/dq = 150\n\nUnder Bertrand competition, firms set their prices equal to their marginal costs. Since firm A has a lower marginal cost (100) than firm B (150), firm A will set its price at 100 and capture the entire market demand.\n\nNow we need to find the quantity demanded at this price. Using the demand equation:\n\nQ = 1000 - 5P\nQ = 1000 - 5(100)\nQ = 1000 - 500\nQ = 500\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced is 500 units, and the equilibrium price is 100.\n\nNow let's find the profits earned by each firm. Profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost.\n\nFor firm A:\nTotal revenue = Price * Quantity = 100 * 500 = 50,000\nTotal cost = C_A(q) = 100 * 500 = 50,000\nProfit_A = Total revenue - Total cost = 50,000 - 50,000 = 0\n\nFor firm B:\nSince firm B is not able to sell any products at a higher price, its profit will be zero.\n\nIn conclusion, under Bertrand competition, the equilibrium price is 100, the equilibrium quantity produced is 500 units, and both firms earn zero profits."
