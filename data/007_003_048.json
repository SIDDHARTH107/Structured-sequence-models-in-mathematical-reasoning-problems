We will calculate the powers of 2 modulo 7:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7) (since 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n2^4 ≡ 2 (mod 7) (since 2^4 = (2^3)^2 ≡ 1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n2^5 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n2^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2^7 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n2^8 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n2^9 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n2^10 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nSo the remainder when 2^10 is divided by 7 is 2."
