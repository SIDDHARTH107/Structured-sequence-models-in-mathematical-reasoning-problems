    "message_1": "A rectangular conducting plate with dimensions 4 cm by 6 cm occupies the region 0 ≤ x ≤ 4, 0 ≤ y ≤ 6 in the xy-plane. The plate is maintained at a constant potential of 10 volts on its left edge, and at 0 volts on its right edge. Find the electrostatic potential V(x, y) everywhere inside the plate, and sketch the equipotential lines for V(x, y) corresponding to potentials of 2, 4, 6 and 8 volts.",
    "message_2": "To find the electrostatic potential V(x, y) inside the plate, we can use the Laplace's equation, which states that the sum of the second derivatives of the potential with respect to x and y is zero:\n\n∇²V(x, y) = ∂²V/∂x² + ∂²V/∂y² = 0\n\nSince the potential is constant along the y-axis, the second derivative with respect to y will be zero. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n∂²V/∂x² = 0\n\nIntegrating twice with respect to x, we get:\n\n∂V/∂x = C₁\nV(x, y) = C₁x + C₂\n\nTo find the constants C₁ and C₂, we can use the boundary conditions:\n\nV(0, y) = 10 V\nV(4, y) = 0 V\n\nApplying these conditions, we get:\n\n10 = C₁(0) + C₂ => C₂ = 10\n0 = C₁(4) + 10 => C₁ = -2.5\n\nSo the electrostatic potential V(x, y) inside the plate is:\n\nV(x, y) = -2.5x + 10\n\nNow, we can sketch the equipotential lines for V(x, y) corresponding to potentials of 2, 4, 6, and 8 volts:\n\nFor V = 2 V:\n2 = -2.5x + 10 => x = 3.2 cm\n\nFor V = 4 V:\n4 = -2.5x + 10 => x = 2.4 cm\n\nFor V = 6 V:\n6 = -2.5x + 10 => x = 1.6 cm\n\nFor V = 8 V:\n8 = -2.5x + 10 => x = 0.8 cm\n\nThe equipotential lines are vertical lines parallel to the y-axis at x = 0.8 cm, x = 1.6 cm, x = 2.4 cm, and x = 3.2 cm, corresponding to potentials of 8, 6, 4, and 2 volts, respectively."
