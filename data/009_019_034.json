    "message_2": "To find the expected value of X at time t = 2, we first need to solve the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). We can rewrite the SDE as:\n\ndX/X = 2 dt + 3 dW\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to time from 0 to t:\n\n∫(dX/X) = ∫(2 dt) + ∫(3 dW)\n\nTaking the integral, we get:\n\nln(X(t)/X(0)) = 2t + 3W(t)\n\nSince X(0) = 1, we have:\n\nln(X(t)) = 2t + 3W(t)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to get X(t):\n\nX(t) = exp(2t + 3W(t))\n\nTo find the expected value of X(t) at t = 2, we need to compute E[X(2)]. Note that the expected value of the Wiener process W(t) is 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nE[X(2)] = E[exp(2*2 + 3W(2))]\nE[X(2)] = E[exp(4 + 6W(2))]\n\nSince W(t) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t, W(2) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2. Let Y = 6W(2), then Y is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 72. Now, we can rewrite the expected value as:\n\nE[X(2)] = E[exp(4 + Y)]\n\nUsing the moment-generating function of the normal distribution, we have:\n\nE[exp(4 + Y)] = exp(4 + 0.5 * 72)\nE[X(2)] = exp(4 + 36)\nE[X(2)] = exp(40)\n\nSo, the expected value of X at time t = 2 is exp(40)."
