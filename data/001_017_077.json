    "message_2": "To solve the equation log₂(x - 1) + log₂(x + 3) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the product rule for logarithms, which states that logb(m) + logb(n) = logb(mn), we can combine the two logarithms:\n\nlog₂((x - 1)(x + 3)) = 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = (x - 1)(x + 3)\n\n8 = (x - 1)(x + 3)\n\nNow, we can expand the expression on the right side:\n\n8 = x^2 + 3x - x - 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 3 - 8 = 0\n\nx^2 + 2x - 11 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve it using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -11:\n\nx = (-2 ± √(2² - 4(1)(-11))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-2 ± √(4 + 44)) / 2\n\nx = (-2 ± √48) / 2\n\nx = (-2 ± 4√3) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nx = -1 ± 2√3\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are:\n\nx = -1 + 2√3 ≈ 2.46\nx = -1 - 2√3 ≈ -5.46\n\nHowever, if we plug x = -5.46 back into the original equation, we get a negative value inside the logarithm, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only valid solution is:\n\nx ≈ 2.46"
