    "message_1": "A statistics student collected the following data on the grades of 10 students in a class: 90, 85, 87, 89, 92, 95, 88, 86, 91, and 35 (which was the grade of a student who did not attend most of the classes). Use the interquartile range (IQR) method to determine if the grade of 35 is an outlier.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n35, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 95\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), which is the middle value of the dataset. Since there are 10 values, the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th values:\n\nMedian (Q2) = (88 + 89) / 2 = 88.5\n\nNow, we find the lower quartile (Q1) and the upper quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nLower half: 35, 85, 86, 87, 88\nUpper half: 89, 90, 91, 92, 95\n\nQ1 = (85 + 86) / 2 = 85.5\nQ3 = (91 + 92) / 2 = 91.5\n\nNext, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 91.5 - 85.5 = 6\n\nNow, we determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers. Any data point below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier.\n\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 85.5 - 1.5 * 6 = 76.5\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 91.5 + 1.5 * 6 = 100.5\n\nFinally, we check if the grade of 35 is an outlier:\n\nSince 35 is less than the lower bound (76.5), the grade of 35 is considered an outlier."
