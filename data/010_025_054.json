    "message_2": "A 2-dimensional torus with one hole can be represented as a flat square grid with opposite edges identified. In other words, when we reach the right edge of the grid and move one step further, we end up on the left edge of the grid, and similarly for the top and bottom edges.\n\nLet's consider an m x n grid, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. We need to color the grid such that no two adjacent points (horizontally or vertically) have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where both m and n are even. In this case, we can use a checkerboard pattern, where we alternate the colors in each row and column. This pattern satisfies the condition that no two adjacent points have the same color. Since there are two possible ways to start the checkerboard pattern (either with a black or a white square in the top-left corner), there are 2 distinct colorings for this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where either m or n is odd. Without loss of generality, let's assume that m is odd and n is even. In this case, we can still use a checkerboard pattern for the first n-1 columns. However, when we reach the last column, we will find that the colors in this column will be the same as the colors in the first column, due to the torus structure. This means that the adjacent points on the identified edges will have the same color, violating the given condition. Therefore, there are no valid colorings in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 2 distinct ways to color a 2-dimensional torus with one hole such that no two adjacent points have the same color if both dimensions are even, and there are no valid colorings if either dimension is odd."
