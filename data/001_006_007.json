    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 5x + 3, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2x² + 5x + 3\n\nNow, we can either factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find the x-intercepts. In this case, the equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 3.\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √(1)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 1) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx₁ = (-5 + 1) / 4 = -4 / 4 = -1\nx₂ = (-5 - 1) / 4 = -6 / 4 = -3/2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 5x + 3 are x = -1 and x = -3/2."
