    "message_2": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 7 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (7)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 49\nSurface area ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 49\nSurface area ≈ 12.56636 * 49\nSurface area ≈ 615.75216\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.75 square centimeters."
