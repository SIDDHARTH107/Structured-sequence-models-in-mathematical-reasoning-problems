    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph G, we first need to understand the concept of diameter. The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nSince we are given that there are 10 vertices and 15 edges in the graph, we can try to find the maximum possible diameter by considering the worst-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, the graph would be a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) because adding a cycle would only decrease the diameter.\n\nIn a tree with 10 vertices, the maximum diameter can be achieved by arranging the vertices in a straight line, which would result in a diameter of 9. However, this arrangement would only require 9 edges, and we are given that there are 15 edges in the graph.\n\nSince adding more edges would only decrease the diameter, we can conclude that the diameter of the graph G is less than or equal to 9. To determine the exact diameter, we would need more information about the structure of the graph."
