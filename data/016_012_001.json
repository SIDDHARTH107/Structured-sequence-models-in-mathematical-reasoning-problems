    "message_1": "What is the length of the Peano curve from (0,0) to (1,1)?\n\nNote: The Peano curve is a space-filling curve that passes through every point in a unit square. So, the problem requires you to calculate the distance covered along the curve from one corner of the square to the opposite corner.",
    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it passes through every point in the unit square. As such, it has an infinite length. This is because the curve continuously subdivides the square into smaller and smaller sections, never reaching a finite length.\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve from (0,0) to (1,1) is infinite."
