    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the dataset using the interquartile range method with a factor of 1.5, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2, also known as the median), and the third quartile (Q3).\n3. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) as IQR = Q3 - Q1.\n4. Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers: lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\n5. Identify any data points that fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound as outliers.\n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}\n\nStep 2: Calculate Q1, Q2, and Q3:\n- Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding Q2 if the dataset has an odd number of elements). In this case, the lower half is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so Q1 = 4.\n- Q2 is the median of the dataset. In this case, Q2 = (6 + 7) / 2 = 6.5.\n- Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding Q2 if the dataset has an odd number of elements). In this case, the upper half is {7, 8, 9, 10, 11}, so Q3 = 9.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 9 - 4 = 5\n\nStep 4: Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n- Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 4 - 1.5 * 5 = 4 - 7.5 = -3.5\n- Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 9 + 1.5 * 5 = 9 + 7.5 = 16.5\n\nStep 5: Identify any outliers:\nAll data points in the dataset fall within the range [-3.5, 16.5], so there are no outliers in the dataset using the interquartile range method with a factor of 1.5."
