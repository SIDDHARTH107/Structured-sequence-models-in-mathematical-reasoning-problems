    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize their profits by determining the optimal quantity of two products, X and Y, to produce using the cuckoo search algorithm. Product X costs $10 to produce and sells for $25, while Product Y costs $15 to produce and sells for $30. The company has a budget of $400 to spend on production costs, and they can only produce a maximum of 30 units of each product. What is the optimal quantity of each product to produce to maximize profits?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the cuckoo search algorithm, but it's important to note that this is a heuristic optimization algorithm, which means it may not always find the exact optimal solution. However, we can still use it to find a good solution to this problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the profit function P(x, y) for producing x units of Product X and y units of Product Y:\n\nP(x, y) = (25 - 10) * x + (30 - 15) * y = 15x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n10x + 15y ≤ 400 (budget constraint)\n0 ≤ x ≤ 30 (maximum units of Product X)\n0 ≤ y ≤ 30 (maximum units of Product Y)\n\nNow, let's use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal values of x and y:\n\n1. Initialize a population of \"nests\" (potential solutions) with random values of x and y within the constraints.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each nest.\n3. Choose the best nest (highest profit) as the current best solution.\n4. Generate new solutions (nests) by modifying the current best solution with a random step size.\n5. Replace the worst nest with the new solution if the new solution is better.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we might find the optimal solution to be:\n\nx = 20 units of Product X\ny = 20 units of Product Y\n\nThis solution satisfies the constraints and results in a profit of:\n\nP(20, 20) = 15 * 20 + 15 * 20 = 300 + 300 = $600\n\nSo, the company should produce 20 units of Product X and 20 units of Product Y to maximize their profit, which would be $600. Note that the cuckoo search algorithm may find different solutions depending on the initial population and random steps, but this solution is a good approximation of the optimal solution."
