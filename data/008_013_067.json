    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 10\n2x - 2y + 4z = 0\n-x + 0.5y - z = -8\n\nThe coefficient matrix A and the constant matrix B are:\n\nA = | 3   2  -1 |\n    | 2  -2   4 |\n    |-1  0.5 -1 |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    |  0 |\n    | -8 |\n\nNow, let's perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by the pivot element (3) to get the first column of L:\n\nL = | 1    0   0 |\n    | 2/3  1   0 |\n    |-1/3  x   1 |\n\nU = | 3   2  -1 |\n    | 0  -4/3  8/3 |\n    | 0   y   z |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second row:\n\nL = | 1    0   0 |\n    | 2/3  1   0 |\n    |-1/3  1/5  1 |\n\nU = | 3   2  -1 |\n    | 0  -4/3  8/3 |\n    | 0   0   -3/5 |\n\nNow we have L and U matrices:\n\nL = |  1    0    0  |\n    | 2/3  1    0  |\n    |-1/3  1/5  1  |\n\nU = |  3   2   -1  |\n    |  0  -4/3  8/3 |\n    |  0   0   -3/5 |\n\nNext, we will solve the system LY = B for Y:\n\n1) y1 = 10\n2) (2/3)y1 + y2 = 0 => y2 = -20/3\n3) (-1/3)y1 + (1/5)y2 + y3 = -8 => y3 = -40/3\n\nY = |  10   |\n    | -20/3 |\n    | -40/3 |\n\nFinally, we will solve the system UX = Y for X:\n\n1) -3/5 * z3 = -40/3 => z = 24\n2) -4/3 * y2 + 8/3 * z = -20/3 => y = -2\n3) 3x + 2y - z = 10 => x = 2\n\nSo the solution for the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2\ny = -2\nz = 24"
