    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, individuals affected by the disease) in n trials (the group of 50 individuals)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an individual being affected by the disease, which is 20% or 0.2)\n- n is the number of trials (50 individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (at least 8 individuals affected by the disease)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 8 individuals being affected, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 8 to k = 50.\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 8 to 50\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = 1 - P(X < 8) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 7:\n\nΣ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 7 = Σ [C(50, k) * 0.2^k * (1-0.2)^(50-k)] for k = 0 to 7\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nΣ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 7 ≈ 0.0573\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 8 individuals being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = 1 - 0.0573 ≈ 0.9427\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 individuals out of a randomly-selected group of 50 will be affected by the disease is approximately 94.27%."
