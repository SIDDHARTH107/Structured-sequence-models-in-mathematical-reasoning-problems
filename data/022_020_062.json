    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on y:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nSubstitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$$\n$$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = k^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$$\n$$Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0$$\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$$\n\nApply the boundary conditions for x:\n\n$$u(0, y) = X(0)Y(y) = \\cosh(y) \\Rightarrow A\\cosh(y) = \\cosh(y) \\Rightarrow A = 1$$\n$$u(\\pi, y) = X(\\pi)Y(y) = e^\\pi \\cosh(y) \\Rightarrow \\cos(k\\pi)Y(y) = e^\\pi \\cosh(y)$$\n\nSince this must hold for all y, we must have $k = n$ for some integer n:\n\n$$X(x) = \\cos(nx)$$\n\nNow, solve the second equation for Y(y):\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(ny) + D\\sinh(ny)$$\n\nApply the boundary conditions for y:\n\n$$u(x, 0) = X(x)Y(0) = \\cos(x) \\Rightarrow X(x)C = \\cos(x) \\Rightarrow C = 1$$\n$$u(x, 1) = X(x)Y(1) = \\cos(x) \\Rightarrow \\cos(nx)\\cosh(n) + \\cos(nx)\\sinh(n)D = \\cos(x)$$\n\nSince this must hold for all x, we must have:\n\n$$\\cosh(n) + \\sinh(n)D = 1$$\n\nSolving for D, we get:\n\n$$D = \\frac{1 - \\cosh(n)}{\\sinh(n)}$$\n\nNow, the solution is given by the product of X(x) and Y(y):\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\cos(nx)\\left(\\cosh(ny) + \\frac{1 - \\cosh(n)}{\\sinh(n)}\\sinh(ny)\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we can write the general solution as a sum over all integer values of n:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos(nx)\\left(\\cosh(ny) + \\frac{1 - \\cosh(n)}{\\sinh(n)}\\sinh(ny)\\right)$$"
