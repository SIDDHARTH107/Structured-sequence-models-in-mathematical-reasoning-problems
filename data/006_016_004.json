    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of producing a defective product is 0.05. If a company produces 500 products, what is the probability that it will have at least 25 defective products?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least 25 defective products, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of producing a defective product (0.05)\n- n is the total number of products produced (500)\n- k is the number of defective products\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of having at least 25 defective products, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 25, 26, ..., 500. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to find the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 24:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use a calculator or software that can handle binomial probability calculations. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nΣ P(X = k) ≈ 0.2166\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 25 defective products:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) ≈ 1 - 0.2166 ≈ 0.7834\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 25 defective products is approximately 0.7834 or 78.34%."
