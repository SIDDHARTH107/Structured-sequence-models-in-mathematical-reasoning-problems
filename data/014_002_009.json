    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key: (g^A) mod p\n2. Bob computes his public key: (g^B) mod p\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key: (Bob's public key ^ A) mod p\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key: (Alice's public key ^ B) mod p\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Alice's public key: (2^5) mod 11 = 32 mod 11 = 9\n2. Bob's public key: (2^7) mod 11 = 128 mod 11 = 7\n3. They exchange public keys: Alice gets 7, and Bob gets 9\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key: (7^5) mod 11 = 16807 mod 11 = 3\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key: (9^7) mod 11 = 4782969 mod 11 = 3\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for encryption and decryption is 3."
