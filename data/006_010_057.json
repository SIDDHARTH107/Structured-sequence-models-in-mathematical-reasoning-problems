    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of individuals in a certain age group being affected by a disease in a year is 0.05. If a random sample of 200 individuals from this age group is taken, what is the probability that less than 10 individuals will be affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of individuals in the sample, which is 200)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of individuals affected by the disease)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of being affected by the disease, which is 0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of not being affected by the disease, which is 0.95)\n\nWe want to find the probability that less than 10 individuals will be affected by the disease, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 9:\n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(200, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.0094\n\nSo, the probability that less than 10 individuals will be affected by the disease in the sample of 200 individuals is approximately 0.0094 or 0.94%."
