    "message_1": "Suppose there are three people, Alice, Bob, and Carol, who are each wearing a hat with a unique number written on it. They want to figure out what number is on their own hat, but they cannot communicate with each other. Alice says, \"I don't know what number is on my hat.\" Bob says, \"I don't know what number is on my hat either.\" Finally, Carol says, \"I know what number is on my hat.\" How did Carol figure out the number on her hat, and what is the number?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the numbers on Alice's, Bob's, and Carol's hats as A, B, and C, respectively. We know that all three numbers are unique.\n\nWhen Alice says she doesn't know the number on her hat, it means that she sees two different numbers on Bob's and Carol's hats. If they had the same number, Alice could have deduced her number as the unique one different from theirs. So, we know that B ≠ C.\n\nWhen Bob says he doesn't know the number on his hat, it also means that he sees two different numbers on Alice's and Carol's hats. If they had the same number, Bob could have deduced his number as the unique one different from theirs. So, we know that A ≠ C.\n\nNow, Carol knows that A ≠ B, A ≠ C, and B ≠ C. Since Carol can see both A and B, and she knows that her number must be unique, she can deduce that her number is the one that is different from both A and B. Therefore, Carol knows the number on her hat.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific numbers on Alice's and Bob's hats, we cannot determine the exact number on Carol's hat."
