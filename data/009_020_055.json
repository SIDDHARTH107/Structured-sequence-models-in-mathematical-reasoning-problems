    "message_2": "To solve this optimal control problem, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we define the Hamiltonian H as follows:\n\nH(x, u, p) = (u - 1)² + x² + p(u + x),\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable.\n\nThe necessary conditions for optimality are given by the following system of equations:\n\n1. x'(t) = ∂H/∂p = u(t) + x(t),\n2. p'(t) = -∂H/∂x = -2x(t) - p(t),\n3. ∂H/∂u = 0 => 2(u(t) - 1) + p(t) = 0.\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations:\n\nFrom equation (3), we get the optimal control u*(t) as a function of the costate variable p(t):\n\nu*(t) = (1 - p(t)/2).\n\nSubstitute u*(t) into equation (1):\n\nx'(t) = (1 - p(t)/2) + x(t).\n\nNow, we have a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\nx'(t) = (1 - p(t)/2) + x(t),\np'(t) = -2x(t) - p(t).\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the initial condition x(0) = 2.\n\nLet's first solve the costate equation:\n\np'(t) + p(t) = -2x(t).\n\nWe can solve this equation using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫1 dt) = e^t. Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:\n\ne^t * p'(t) + e^t * p(t) = -2e^t * x(t).\n\nNow, the left side is the derivative of the product e^t * p(t):\n\nd/dt (e^t * p(t)) = -2e^t * x(t).\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(d/dt (e^t * p(t))) dt = ∫(-2e^t * x(t)) dt.\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\ne^t * p(t) = -2∫(e^t * x(t)) dt + C₁.\n\nNow, we can solve for p(t):\n\np(t) = -2e^(-t)∫(e^t * x(t)) dt + C₁ * e^(-t).\n\nWe don't have enough information to find the exact value of C₁ yet. However, we can use the expression for p(t) to find u*(t):\n\nu*(t) = 1 - p(t)/2 = 1 + e^(-t)∫(e^t * x(t)) dt - C₁ * e^(-t)/2.\n\nNow, substitute u*(t) into the equation for x'(t):\n\nx'(t) = 1 + e^(-t)∫(e^t * x(t)) dt - C₁ * e^(-t)/2 + x(t).\n\nWe can solve this equation using the initial condition x(0) = 2:\n\n2 = 1 + ∫(e^0 * x(0)) d(0) - C₁ * e^(0)/2 + x(0).\n\nSolving for C₁, we get:\n\nC₁ = -2.\n\nNow we have the expressions for the optimal control u*(t) and the costate variable p(t):\n\nu*(t) = 1 + e^(-t)∫(e^t * x(t)) dt + e^(-t),\np(t) = -2e^(-t)∫(e^t * x(t)) dt - 2e^(-t).\n\nWe can use these expressions to find the state trajectory x*(t) by solving the differential equation for x'(t) with the initial condition x(0) = 2. However, finding the exact expression for x*(t) might be difficult due to the integral term. In practice, one could use numerical methods to find the state trajectory x*(t) that minimizes the functional J(u) over the time horizon [0,1]."
