    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has to allocate its resources, i.e., labor and raw materials, to produce two products, A and B. It takes 20 hours to produce one unit of A and 30 hours to produce one unit of B. Similarly, it takes 5 kilograms of raw material to produce one unit of A and 10 kilograms of raw material to produce one unit of B. If the total labor hour available is 200 hours and the total raw material available is 800 kilograms, what is the maximum number of units of product A and B that the company can produce using the whale optimization algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, this problem can be solved using linear programming, which is a more suitable approach for resource allocation problems.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 20x + 30y ≤ 200\n2. Raw material constraint: 5x + 10y ≤ 800\n\nObjective:\nMaximize the total number of units produced: x + y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. Labor constraint:\n20x + 30y ≤ 200\nDivide by 10:\n2x + 3y ≤ 20\n\n2. Raw material constraint:\n5x + 10y ≤ 800\nDivide by 5:\nx + 2y ≤ 160\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations:\n\nIntersection of labor constraint and raw material constraint:\n2x + 3y = 20\nx + 2y = 160\n\nSolve for x and y:\nx = 100 - 3y\nSubstitute x in the second equation:\n100 - 3y + 2y = 160\ny = -60\nThis solution is not feasible since y cannot be negative.\n\nIntersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 3(0) = 20\nx = 10\n\nIntersection of raw material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\nx + 2(0) = 160\nx = 160\n\nIntersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 3y = 20\ny = 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\nIntersection of raw material constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + 2y = 160\ny = 80\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices (0, 0), (10, 0), (0, 80), and (0, 20/3). Now, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): x + y = 0\n2. (10, 0): x + y = 10\n3. (0, 80): x + y = 80\n4. (0, 20/3): x + y ≈ 6.67\n\nThe maximum number of units produced is 80, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
