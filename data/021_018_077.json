    "message_1": "In a manufacturing plant, the production of two products, A and B, each require a combination of three raw materials, P, Q, and R. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of P, 1 unit of Q, and 3 units of R. Each unit of product B requires 1 unit of P, 3 units of Q, and 2 units of R. The plant has 200 units of P, 150 units of Q, and 240 units of R available daily. If the profit per unit of A is $4 and per unit of B is $5, find the daily production plan for the plant that maximizes the profit using tabu search.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution to a problem by iteratively exploring the solution space while avoiding previously visited solutions. In this case, we want to find the optimal production plan for products A and B that maximizes the profit while considering the constraints of raw materials P, Q, and R.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the raw materials are as follows:\n\n2x + y ≤ 200 (P constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 150 (Q constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 240 (R constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 4x + 5y\n\nTo apply the tabu search algorithm, we need to define an initial solution, a neighborhood function, a tabu list, and a stopping criterion.\n\n1. Initial solution: We can start with an initial solution of (x, y) = (0, 0), which means producing no units of A and B.\n\n2. Neighborhood function: We can define the neighborhood function as the set of solutions obtained by increasing or decreasing the production of A and B by one unit, while respecting the constraints.\n\n3. Tabu list: The tabu list is a fixed-size list that stores the most recently visited solutions to avoid revisiting them. We can set the tabu list size to a reasonable value, such as 10.\n\n4. Stopping criterion: We can set a maximum number of iterations or a threshold for the improvement in the objective function.\n\nNow, we can iteratively explore the solution space by moving from the current solution to the best non-tabu solution in its neighborhood, updating the tabu list, and checking the stopping criterion. Once the stopping criterion is met, the algorithm returns the best solution found so far.\n\nApplying the tabu search algorithm to this problem may require a significant amount of computation, and the result may vary depending on the specific implementation and parameter settings. However, the tabu search algorithm can help find a good approximation of the optimal production plan for products A and B that maximizes the profit while considering the constraints of raw materials P, Q, and R."
