    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B, play a game of matching pennies. If both players choose heads or both choose tails, player A wins and receives $1 from player B. If the choices are different, player B wins and receives $1 from player A. If the game is played 100 times, how much money will player A have at the end of the game if they always choose heads and player B always chooses tails?",
    "message_2": "Since player A always chooses heads and player B always chooses tails, their choices will always be different. Therefore, player B will win every game. After 100 games, player B will have won $1 from player A in each game, so player A will have lost $100. If player A started with $0, they would have -$100 at the end of the game."
