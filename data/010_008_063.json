    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a simplicial complex can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nV = 8 (vertices)\nE = 15 (edges)\nF = 10 (triangular faces)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nχ = 8 - 15 + 10\n\nχ = -7 + 10\n\nχ = 3\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the given simplicial complex is 3."
