    "message_2": "To determine the frequency components of the given signal x(t), we can observe that it is already in the sum of sinusoids form, which represents the individual frequency components directly. In this case, we don't need to compute the Fourier transform explicitly.\n\nThe given signal x(t) is:\n\n$$x(t) = 3\\sin(2\\pi 50 t) + 4\\cos(2\\pi 150 t) + 2\\sin(2\\pi 300 t)$$\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the frequency components as follows:\n\n1. A sinusoidal component with amplitude 3 and frequency 50 Hz: $$3\\sin(2\\pi 50 t)$$\n2. A cosine component with amplitude 4 and frequency 150 Hz: $$4\\cos(2\\pi 150 t)$$\n3. A sinusoidal component with amplitude 2 and frequency 300 Hz: $$2\\sin(2\\pi 300 t)$$\n\nSo, the frequency components of the signal x(t) are 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 300 Hz."
