    "message_2": "To find the total number of triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid with a base length of 6 levels deep, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the number of triangles in the first level, r is the common ratio (3 in this case), and n is the number of levels (6 in this case).\n\nIn a Sierpinski pyramid, the first level has 1 triangle. So, a = 1.\n\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * (1 - 3^6) / (1 - 3)\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * (1 - 729) / (-2)\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * (-728) / (-2)\nTotal number of triangles = 364\n\nSo, there are a total of 364 triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid with a base length of 6 levels deep, where each level adds 3 times as many triangles as the previous level."
