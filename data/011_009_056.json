    "message_1": "There are 5 people who want to split a pizza equally among themselves. How many different ways can the pizza be divided if each person must receive at least one slice? Use Bell numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bell numbers, we need to find the number of ways to partition a set of 5 elements (the people) into non-empty subsets (the slices of pizza). The Bell number B(n) is defined as the number of ways to partition a set of n elements.\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are B(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2, B(3) = 5, B(4) = 15, and B(5) = 52.\n\nSo, there are 52 different ways to divide the pizza among the 5 people, ensuring that each person receives at least one slice."
