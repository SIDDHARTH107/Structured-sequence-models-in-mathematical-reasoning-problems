    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by recursively filling the interstices between three mutually tangent circles with smaller circles that are also mutually tangent to each other. The process can be repeated infinitely, but we will consider only the first and second stages.\n\nIn the first stage, we have three mutually tangent circles with radius 1. In the center, there is a space for another circle, which is tangent to all three of the initial circles. This circle has a radius of 1/2. So, at the first stage, we have 4 circles in total (3 with radius 1 and 1 with radius 1/2).\n\nFor the second stage, we will fill the interstices between the circles from the first stage. There are three interstices between the initial circles with radius 1 and the circle with radius 1/2. In each of these interstices, a new circle can be constructed that is tangent to the surrounding circles. These new circles will have a radius of 1/6. So, at the second stage, we have 3 additional circles (all with radius 1/6).\n\nThe total number of circles in the Apollonian gasket at the first and second stages is the sum of the circles from both stages:\n\nTotal circles = Circles from the first stage + Circles from the second stage\nTotal circles = 4 + 3\nTotal circles = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 circles in the Apollonian gasket at the first and second stages."
