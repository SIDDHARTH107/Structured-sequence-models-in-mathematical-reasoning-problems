    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x), we need to analyze the coefficients of the sine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the sine term. In this case, the amplitude is the absolute value of 4, which is:\n\nAmplitude = |4| = 4\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient inside the sine term, which is the value that multiplies the variable x. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of a basic sine function is 2π, so to find the period of this function, we need to divide the basic period by the coefficient:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4sin(3x) is 4, and the period is (2π) / 3."
