    "message_1": "A company wants to compare the salaries of two groups of employees. The first group consists of 10 employees and has a median salary of $50,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000. The second group consists of 8 employees and has a median salary of $52,000 with a standard deviation of $12,000. Is there a significant difference between the salary distributions of the two groups? Use the median of each group as the measure of central tendency and the median absolute deviation (MAD) as the measure of variation. Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference between the salary distributions of the two groups, we will perform a hypothesis test using the median as the measure of central tendency and the median absolute deviation (MAD) as the measure of variation. We will use a significance level of 0.05.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the salary distributions of the two groups (M1 = M2).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between the salary distributions of the two groups (M1 ≠ M2).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the MAD for each group.\nSince we are not given the individual salaries, we cannot directly calculate the MAD. However, we can approximate the MAD using the standard deviation (SD) provided. A common approximation is to divide the SD by 1.4826.\n\nMAD1 = SD1 / 1.4826 = $10,000 / 1.4826 ≈ $6,738\nMAD2 = SD2 / 1.4826 = $12,000 / 1.4826 ≈ $8,086\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nWe will use the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the medians of the two groups. The test statistic for the Mann-Whitney U test is:\n\nU = (n1 * n2) / 2 ± (sum of ranks) / 2\n\nSince we don't have the individual salaries, we cannot calculate the exact U value. However, we can estimate the effect size (Cohen's d) using the medians and MADs:\n\nd = (M2 - M1) / sqrt((MAD1^2 + MAD2^2) / 2)\nd = ($52,000 - $50,000) / sqrt(($6,738^2 + $8,086^2) / 2)\nd ≈ 0.25\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value and make a decision.\nFor a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and sample sizes of 10 and 8, the critical value for the Mann-Whitney U test is approximately 23. Since we don't have the exact U value, we cannot directly compare it to the critical value.\n\nHowever, we can use the effect size (Cohen's d) as a rough estimate of the difference between the two groups. Generally, an effect size of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is considered medium, and 0.8 is considered large. In this case, the effect size is 0.25, which is considered small.\n\nBased on the small effect size, we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference between the salary distributions of the two groups."
