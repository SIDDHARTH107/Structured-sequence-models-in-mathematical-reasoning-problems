    "message_2": "To find the average salary of all employees in the company, we first need to find the total salary paid to all employees and then divide it by the total number of employees.\n\nTotal number of employees = 1 (CEO) + 1 (General Manager) + 80 (Remaining employees) = 82 employees\n\nTotal salary of remaining 80 employees = 80 * $60,000 = $4,800,000\n\nTotal salary of all employees = $200,000 (CEO) + $120,000 (General Manager) + $4,800,000 (Remaining employees) = $5,120,000\n\nNow, we can find the average salary by dividing the total salary by the total number of employees:\n\nAverage salary = Total salary / Total number of employees = $5,120,000 / 82 â‰ˆ $62,439.02\n\nSo, the average salary of employees in the company is approximately $62,439.02 per year."
