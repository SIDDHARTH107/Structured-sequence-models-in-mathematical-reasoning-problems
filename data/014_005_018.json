    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to digitally sign a document using the RSA algorithm. Her private key has a value of p=17 and q=23, while her public key has a value of e=5. If the hash value of the document is 329, what is the resulting digital signature?",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature using the RSA algorithm, we first need to find the modulus n and the private exponent d.\n\n1. Calculate the modulus n:\nn = p * q\nn = 17 * 23\nn = 391\n\n2. Calculate the totient of n (Euler's totient function), denoted as φ(n):\nφ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (17-1) * (23-1)\nφ(n) = 16 * 22\nφ(n) = 352\n\n3. Calculate the private exponent d, which is the modular inverse of e modulo φ(n):\ne * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n5 * d ≡ 1 (mod 352)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the value of d:\nd = 141 (since 5 * 141 ≡ 1 (mod 352))\n\n4. Compute the digital signature (s) by raising the hash value (H) to the power of d modulo n:\ns = H^d (mod n)\ns = 329^141 (mod 391)\n\nUsing modular exponentiation, we get:\ns = 248\n\nSo, the resulting digital signature is 248."
