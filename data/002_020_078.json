    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is a constant (approximately 3.14159).\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (60/360) × 2π(7)\ns = (1/6) × 14π\ns = 7π/3 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the length of the arc to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = s + 2r\nPerimeter = (7π/3) + 2(7)\nPerimeter = (7π/3) + 14\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is approximately (7π/3) + 14 cm."
