    "message_1": "Alice and Bob agree to use the prime number 11 to establish a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses the private key 4, and Bob chooses the private key 3. They then compute their respective public keys, which they exchange with each other over an insecure communication channel. Alice's public key is 7, and Bob's public key is 5. What is the shared secret key that they can use for encryption and decryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key, Alice and Bob will each raise the other's public key to the power of their own private key, modulo the prime number 11.\n\nFor Alice, this calculation is: (Bob's public key)^Alice's private key mod 11\n(5^4) mod 11 = 625 mod 11 = 9\n\nFor Bob, this calculation is: (Alice's public key)^Bob's private key mod 11\n(7^3) mod 11 = 343 mod 11 = 9\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, which is 9. They can now use this key for encryption and decryption."
