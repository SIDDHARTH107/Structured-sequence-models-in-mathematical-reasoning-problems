    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this graph, we can color the vertices as follows:\n\n1. Color 1: vertices 1, 3, and 5\n2. Color 2: vertices 2 and 6\n3. Color 3: vertex 4\n\n```\n  1(1) -- 2(2) -- 3(1)\n   |           |\n  4(3) -- 5(1) -- 6(2)\n```\n\nSince we can color the graph using 3 colors and no two adjacent vertices share the same color, the chromatic number of the graph is 3."
