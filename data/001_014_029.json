    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √27, we need to find the prime factors of 27 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n27 = 3 × 3 × 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n√(3 × 3 × 3)\n\nSince there is a pair of 3's, we can take one 3 out of the square root:\n\n3√3\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression for √27 is 3√3."
