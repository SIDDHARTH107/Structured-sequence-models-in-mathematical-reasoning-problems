    "message_2": "To find the value of θ(1+i), we first need to find the value of q when z = 1+i. \n\nq = e^(πi(1+i))\nq = e^(πi - π)\n\nNow, we can use Euler's formula to simplify the exponential term:\n\ne^(πi) = cos(π) + i*sin(π) = -1\ne^(-π) is a real number.\n\nSo, q = (-1)e^(-π)\n\nNow, we can plug this value of q into the theta function:\n\nθ(1+i) = 1 + 2∑n≥1 (-1)^n * e^(-πn^2) * cos(2n(1+i))\n\nLet's break this down further:\n\nθ(1+i) = 1 + 2∑n≥1 (-1)^n * e^(-πn^2) * (cos(2n)cos(2ni) - sin(2n)sin(2ni))\n\nSince sin(2ni) = i*sinh(2n) and cos(2ni) = cosh(2n), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nθ(1+i) = 1 + 2∑n≥1 (-1)^n * e^(-πn^2) * (cos(2n)cosh(2n) - i*sin(2n)sinh(2n))\n\nThis is a complex-valued function, and it is difficult to find an exact value for the sum. However, we can approximate the value by taking a finite number of terms in the series. The more terms we take, the more accurate our approximation will be."
