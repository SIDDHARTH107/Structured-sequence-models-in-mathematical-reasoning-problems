    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, where each square is replaced by a pattern of five smaller squares in each iteration. The number of line segments in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4 * (5^(n-1))\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the fifth iteration (n=5):\n\nNumber of line segments = 4 * (5^(5-1))\nNumber of line segments = 4 * (5^4)\nNumber of line segments = 4 * (625)\nNumber of line segments = 2500\n\nSo, there are 2500 line segments needed to draw the fifth iteration of the Vicsek fractal."
