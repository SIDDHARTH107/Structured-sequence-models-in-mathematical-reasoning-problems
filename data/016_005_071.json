    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. In the first iteration, there is one line segment. After the first iteration, there are two line segments. In each subsequent iteration, the number of line segments doubles.\n\nTo find the number of line segments after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nSo after the 5th iteration, there will be:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^5 = 32\n\nThere will be 32 line segments left after the 5th iteration of the construction of the Cantor set."
