    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 3z + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(z + 1)(z + 2) = 0\n\nSo the zeros of f(z) are z = -1 and z = -2. Both of these zeros have order 1, as each factor appears only once in the numerator.\n\nNow, to find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = 0\n\nThis is also a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(z + 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nSo the pole of f(z) is z = -1. However, since this factor appears twice in the denominator, the order of this pole is 2.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has a zero at z = -2 with order 1, and a pole at z = -1 with order 2."
