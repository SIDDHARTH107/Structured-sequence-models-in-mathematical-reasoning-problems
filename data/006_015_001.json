    "message_1": "Suppose that a particular network has 20 connected devices. The probability of a device being compromised by a certain type of cyber attack is 0.1. What is the probability that exactly 3 devices will be compromised by this attack?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, devices being compromised) in n trials (the number of connected devices)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single success (in this case, a device being compromised)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of connected devices)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3 devices being compromised)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nn = 20 (number of connected devices)\nk = 3 (number of devices we want to be compromised)\np = 0.1 (probability of a device being compromised)\n\nP(X = 3) = C(20, 3) * (0.1)^3 * (1-0.1)^(20-3)\n\nFirst, let's find C(20, 3):\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20-3)!)\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!17!)\nC(20, 3) = (20 * 19 * 18) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 1140\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 1140 * (0.1)^3 * (0.9)^(20-3)\nP(X = 3) = 1140 * 0.001 * 0.9^17\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.243\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 devices will be compromised by this attack is approximately 0.243 or 24.3%."
