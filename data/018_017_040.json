The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n\n(A × B) Δ (B × A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference.
