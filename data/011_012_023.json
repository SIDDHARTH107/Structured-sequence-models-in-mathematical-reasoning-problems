    "message_1": "There are 60 students in a class, and they were asked to choose between drama, music or art class. 35 students chose to take drama, 27 students chose to take music and 22 students chose to take art class. \n\nHow many students chose to take at least one of the three classes offered?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal number of students = 60\n\nNumber of students who chose drama (D) = 35\nNumber of students who chose music (M) = 27\nNumber of students who chose art (A) = 22\n\nNow, we need to find the number of students who chose two classes and three classes.\n\nLet's assume x students chose both drama and music (D ∩ M), y students chose both drama and art (D ∩ A), and z students chose both music and art (M ∩ A). Also, let's assume w students chose all three classes (D ∩ M ∩ A).\n\nAccording to the problem, no information is given about the students who chose two or three classes. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of students who chose at least one of the three classes offered.\n\nHowever, if we assume that no student chose more than one class, then the total number of students who chose at least one of the three classes would be:\n\nTotal students = D + M + A = 35 + 27 + 22 = 84\n\nBut since there are only 60 students in the class, this scenario is not possible. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of students who chose at least one of the three classes offered without more information."
