    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set is a subset of both Set A and Set B.\n\nTo prove this, let's use the set-builder notation. The empty set can be represented as {} or Ø. According to the definition of a subset, a set X is a subset of another set Y if every element of X is also an element of Y. In other words, if x ∈ X, then x ∈ Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set Ø. Since there are no elements in Ø, there is no element x that belongs to Ø. Therefore, the condition \"if x ∈ Ø, then x ∈ A\" is true because there is no x that can make the statement false. Similarly, the condition \"if x ∈ Ø, then x ∈ B\" is also true for the same reason.\n\nUsing set-builder notation, we can represent the empty set as a subset of Set A and Set B as follows:\n\nØ = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nSince there is no element x that can make the conditions false, the empty set is a subset of both Set A and Set B."
