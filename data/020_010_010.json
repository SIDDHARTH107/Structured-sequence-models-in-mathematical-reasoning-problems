    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of A is $10 and of B is $8. The production process involves a machine that has a 90% reliability rating, meaning that there is a 10% chance that the machine will break down during production. If the machine breaks down during production, the entire batch is lost and the company incurs a loss of $50,000.\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal number of units of each product to produce, while also taking into account the risk of machine breakdown. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B that the company should produce to maximize its profit, given the risk of machine breakdown, assuming that the company can produce a total of 500 units of both products combined?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We are given that x + y = 500.\n\nThe profit function for the company can be expressed as:\n\nProfit = (10x + 8y) * 0.9 - 50,000 * 0.1\n\nWe want to maximize this profit function, subject to the constraint x + y = 500.\n\nFirst, we can solve the constraint equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 500 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the profit function:\n\nProfit = (10x + 8(500 - x)) * 0.9 - 50,000 * 0.1\nProfit = (10x + 4000 - 8x) * 0.9 - 5000\nProfit = (2x + 4000) * 0.9 - 5000\n\nTo maximize the profit function, we can take the derivative with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = (2 * 0.9) - 0 = 1.8\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on x, the profit function is linear with respect to x. This means that the maximum profit will be achieved at one of the endpoints of the feasible region, which are x = 0 and x = 500.\n\nCase 1: x = 0 (only produce Product B)\nProfit = (2(0) + 4000) * 0.9 - 5000 = 3600 - 5000 = -$1400\n\nCase 2: x = 500 (only produce Product A)\nProfit = (2(500) + 4000) * 0.9 - 5000 = 5000 - 5000 = $0\n\nSince the profit is higher when only producing Product A, the optimal production strategy is to produce 500 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B."
