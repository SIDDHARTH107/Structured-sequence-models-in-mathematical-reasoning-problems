    "message_2": "In the given graph, there are no cliques larger than size 2 (a clique is a complete subgraph, where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). The largest cliques in this graph are the pairs of connected vertices, such as (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,6), (5,7), and (6,8).\n\nSince the largest clique has a size of 2, the treewidth of the graph is 2 - 1 = 1."
