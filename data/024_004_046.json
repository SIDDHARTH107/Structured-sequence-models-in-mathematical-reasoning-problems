    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the cylindrical water tank's surface, we need to consider two principal curvatures: one along the circular cross-section (k1) and the other along the vertical height (k2).\n\nFor a cylinder, the curvature along the circular cross-section (k1) is given by the reciprocal of the radius, and the curvature along the vertical height (k2) is 0, as it is a straight line.\n\nk1 = 1 / radius\nk1 = 1 / 5\nk1 = 0.2\n\nk2 = 0\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature (H) using the formula:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nH = (0.2 + 0) / 2\nH = 0.1\n\nThe mean curvature of the tank's surface at the top and at the bottom is 0.1."
