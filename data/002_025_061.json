    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the two equal sides is 10 cm each. If the altitude from the apex to the base is 8 cm, what is the length of the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the isosceles triangle as ABC, with A being the apex and B and C being the base vertices. Let's also denote the point where the altitude intersects the base as D.\n\nSince the altitude AD is perpendicular to the base BC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the base. We can also notice that the altitude divides the isosceles triangle into two right triangles, ABD and ADC.\n\nIn right triangle ABD, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\n10^2 = 8^2 + BD^2\n\n100 = 64 + BD^2\n\nBD^2 = 36\n\nBD = 6 cm\n\nSince the altitude divides the base into two equal parts, the length of DC is also 6 cm. Therefore, the length of the base BC is:\n\nBC = BD + DC = 6 + 6 = 12 cm"
