    "message_1": "What is the probability of a burglary occurring at least once in a neighborhood with a population of 10,000, given that the average annual burglary rate in similar neighborhoods is 4 per 1,000 residents?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of the event \"at least one burglary occurs\" is \"no burglaries occur.\" We will first find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring.\n\nThe average annual burglary rate is 4 per 1,000 residents. In a neighborhood with 10,000 residents, we can expect an average of:\n\n(4 burglaries / 1,000 residents) * 10,000 residents = 40 burglaries per year\n\nNow, let's assume that the number of burglaries follows a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, burglaries) in a fixed interval (in this case, one year) when the events occur independently and at a constant average rate.\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (burglaries), k is the specific number of events we are interested in (0 in this case, since we want to find the probability of no burglaries occurring), λ is the average number of events (40 burglaries per year), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 0) = (40^0 * e^(-40)) / 0!\n          = (1 * e^(-40)) / 1\n          = e^(-40)\n\nNow, we find the complement probability:\n\nP(at least one burglary) = 1 - P(no burglaries)\n                         = 1 - e^(-40)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\n1 - e^(-40) ≈ 1 - 4.248354255291589e-18 ≈ 0.99999999999999999575\n\nSo, the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the neighborhood is approximately 99.999999999999999575%."
