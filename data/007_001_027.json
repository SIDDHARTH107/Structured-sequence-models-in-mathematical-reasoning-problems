    "message_2": "To find the sum of the first 20 prime numbers, we first need to list them out. The first 20 prime numbers are:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71\n\nNow, we simply add them together:\n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 = 639\n\nSo, the sum of the first 20 prime numbers is 639."
