    "message_1": "The problem is:\n\nA manufacturing company wants to determine the maximum profit they can earn from producing two products, A and B. It costs the company $100 to produce each unit of A and $150 to produce each unit of B. Each unit of A can be sold for $500 and each unit of B can be sold for $700. The total production capacity is 500 units. What is the maximum profit the company can earn if they want to produce and sell both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The total production capacity constraint is:\n\nx + y ≤ 500\n\nThe profit for each unit of product A is $500 - $100 = $400, and the profit for each unit of product B is $700 - $150 = $550. The total profit P can be represented as:\n\nP = 400x + 550y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y, given the constraint x + y ≤ 500.\n\nSince product B has a higher profit per unit, it makes sense to produce as many units of B as possible. If the company produces only product B, y = 500, and x = 0. In this case, the profit would be:\n\nP = 400(0) + 550(500) = $275,000\n\nHowever, the company wants to produce and sell both products. So, we need to find the maximum profit when both x and y are greater than 0.\n\nLet's consider the case when x = 1, which means the company produces 1 unit of product A. Then, the constraint becomes:\n\n1 + y ≤ 500\n\ny ≤ 499\n\nIn this case, the company can produce 499 units of product B. The profit would be:\n\nP = 400(1) + 550(499) = $274,950\n\nThe difference in profit between producing only product B and producing both products is $275,000 - $274,950 = $50. Since the profit per unit of product B is $550, which is greater than the profit per unit of product A ($400), it is not beneficial to produce more units of product A at the expense of product B.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit the company can earn if they want to produce and sell both products is $274,950, with 1 unit of product A and 499 units of product B."
