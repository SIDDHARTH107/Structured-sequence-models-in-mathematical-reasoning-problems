    "message_2": "In the projective plane, we represent points using homogeneous coordinates. So, let's first convert the given points P(3,5) and Q(7,1) to their homogeneous coordinates:\n\nP'(3,5,1) and Q'(7,1,1)\n\nNow, to find the equation of the line passing through these points in the projective plane, we take the cross product of their homogeneous coordinates:\n\nP' x Q' = (3,5,1) x (7,1,1)\n\nThe cross product is given by:\n\nX = (5 * 1) - (1 * 1) = 4\nY = (1 * 7) - (1 * 3) = 4\nZ = (3 * 1) - (5 * 7) = -32\n\nSo, the line passing through P and Q in the projective plane has the equation:\n\n4X + 4Y - 32Z = 0\n\nDividing by 4, we get the simplified equation:\n\nX + Y - 8Z = 0"
