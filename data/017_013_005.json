    "message_2": "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a group G of order 18 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, one of order 3 and the other of order 6. Let's denote these cyclic groups as H and K, respectively. Then, we have:\n\nG ≅ H × K, where |H| = 3 and |K| = 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of H and K. Since H is a cyclic group of order 3, it has a unique element of order 3, say h. Similarly, K is a cyclic group of order 6, so it has an element of order 6, say k.\n\nNow, consider the element (h, k) in the group G. Since G is isomorphic to the direct product H × K, the order of (h, k) in G is the least common multiple of the orders of h and k, which is:\n\nlcm(3, 6) = 6.\n\nThis means that there exists an element of order 6 in G. However, by the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, a group is cyclic if and only if it has an element whose order is equal to the order of the group. Since G has an element of order 6, it cannot be cyclic, as its order is 18.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow theorems. By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G must divide the order of G (18) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 6. However, we know that G is not cyclic, so it cannot have a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (as that would imply that G is a cyclic group of order 18). Therefore, G must have 6 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G must divide the order of G (18) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, and 9. Again, since G is not cyclic, it cannot have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Therefore, G must have either 3 or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the normal subgroups of G. Since G has 6 Sylow 3-subgroups, there must be a normal subgroup of G of order 3, say N. Also, since G has either 3 or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, there must be a normal subgroup of G of order 6, say M.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. If G has normal subgroups of orders 3 and 6, then by the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we have:\n\nG / N ≅ M.\n\nBut this implies that G is isomorphic to a group of order 6, which contradicts the assumption that G has order 18.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists a group G of order 18 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, one of order 3 and the other of order 6, must be false."
