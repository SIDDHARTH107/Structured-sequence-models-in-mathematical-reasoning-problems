    "message_2": "To find the sample mean weight of the dogs, you need to add up all the weights and then divide by the number of dogs.\n\nThe sum of the weights is: 75 + 85 + 78 + 90 + 92 + 80 + 73 + 89 + 83 + 88 = 833\n\nThere are 10 dogs in the sample, so the sample mean weight is:\n\n833 / 10 = 83.3 pounds\n\nThe sample mean weight of the dogs is 83.3 pounds."
