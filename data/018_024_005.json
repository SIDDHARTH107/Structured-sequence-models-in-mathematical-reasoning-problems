    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and A △ B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. We don't have a universal set defined here, so we cannot find the exact complements. However, we can still work with the relative complements with respect to each other.\n\n(A △ B)' = A ∪ B - A △ B = {2, 3}\nA' = A ∪ B - A = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A △ B)' and A':\n\n((A △ B)' △ A') = ({2, 3} △ {2, 3, 4}) = {4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between B and A':\n\n(B △ A') = ({2, 3, 4} △ {2, 3, 4}) = {}\n\nSince {4} ≠ {}, we can conclude that (A △ B)' △ A' is not equal to B △ A'."
