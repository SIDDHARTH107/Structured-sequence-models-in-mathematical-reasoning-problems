    "message_1": "Given the encrypted message \"DMQSWJMTVWVE\" that was encrypted using a Playfair cipher with the key \"EXAMPLE\", determine the original message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Playfair cipher, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square using the key \"EXAMPLE\". \n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters from left to right, top to bottom in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill in the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher) in alphabetical order.\n\nThe resulting Playfair square with the key \"EXAMPLE\" is:\n\nE X A M P\nL B C D F\nG H I K N\nO Q R S T\nU V W Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message \"DMQSWJMTVWVE\" using the Playfair square:\n\n1. Break the encrypted message into pairs of letters: DM QS WJ MT VW VE\n2. For each pair, locate the letters in the Playfair square and apply the decryption rules:\n   a. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrap around if necessary).\n   b. If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrap around if necessary).\n   c. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other pair's column.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the following decrypted pairs:\n\nDM -> HE\nQS -> LL\nWJ -> OI\nMT -> ME\nVW -> TA\nVE -> KE\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HELLOIMEETAKE\". Since the Playfair cipher may add an extra 'X' at the end of the original message to make the number of letters even, we should check if the last letter makes sense in the context of the message. In this case, it doesn't, so we can remove it.\n\nThe original message is \"HELLOIMEETAK\"."
