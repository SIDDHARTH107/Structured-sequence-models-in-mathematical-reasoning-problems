    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. First, let's find the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards without any restrictions. This can be done using combinations:\n\nTotal ways = C(52, 5) = 52! / (5! * 47!) = 2,598,960\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose 5 cards that violate the condition of having at least one card from each suit. There are 4 suits, so there are 4 cases where we miss one suit:\n\n1. No hearts: C(39, 5) ways (since there are 13 cards of each suit, there are 52 - 13 = 39 cards left)\n2. No clubs: C(39, 5) ways\n3. No diamonds: C(39, 5) ways\n4. No spades: C(39, 5) ways\n\nSum of these cases = 4 * C(39, 5) = 4 * (39! / (5! * 34!)) = 211,876\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the cases where two suits are missing. There are C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 suits to miss, and for each of these cases, there are C(26, 5) ways to choose 5 cards from the remaining 26 cards (13 cards from each of the two remaining suits).\n\nDouble-counted cases = C(4, 2) * C(26, 5) = 6 * (26! / (5! * 21!)) = 32,760\n\nNow, we can apply the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n\nNumber of ways with at least one card from each suit = Total ways - Sum of cases with one suit missing + Double-counted cases\n= 2,598,960 - 211,876 + 32,760\n= 2,419,844\n\nSo, there are 2,419,844 ways to choose 5 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards with at least one card from each suit."
