Determine the possible divisors of 96: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of order n: n(G) = p(n(2^5)) * p(n(3^1)), where p(n) is the partition function.\n\nFor 2^5, the partitions are {5}, {4, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 1}, {2, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}. So, p(n(2^5)) = 7.\n\nFor 3^1, the partitions are {1}. So, p(n(3^1)) = 1.\n\nUsing the formula, n(G) = 7 * 1 = 7.\n\nHowever, this only gives us the number of abelian groups of order 96. To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups, we can use the following theorem:\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^aq^b is given by the sum of the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^a and q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are positive integers.\n\nUsing this theorem, we can find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 2^5 and 3^1:\n\nFor 2^5, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups (as calculated above).\nFor 3^1, there is only 1 non-isomorphic group (the cyclic group of order 3).\n\nSo, the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 is 7 + 1 = 8."
