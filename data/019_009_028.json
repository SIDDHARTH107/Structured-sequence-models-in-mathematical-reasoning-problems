    "message_2": "Let's denote the rate at which John solves the problem as J and the rate at which Anna solves the problem as A. \n\nSince John can solve the problem in 4 hours, his rate is:\nJ = 1/4 (problems per hour)\n\nSimilarly, since Anna can solve the problem in 6 hours, her rate is:\nA = 1/6 (problems per hour)\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate (R) is the sum of their individual rates:\nR = J + A = (1/4) + (1/6)\n\nTo find the common denominator, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6, which is 12. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:\nR = (3/12) + (2/12)\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\nR = (3+2)/12 = 5/12 (problems per hour)\n\nTo find the time it takes for them to solve the problem together, we can use the formula:\nTime = Work/Rate\n\nIn this case, the work is 1 problem, and the rate is 5/12 problems per hour. So, the time it takes for them to solve the problem together is:\nTime = 1/(5/12)\n\nTo solve this, we can multiply by the reciprocal of the rate:\nTime = 1 * (12/5) = 12/5\n\nSo, it will take them 12/5 hours, or 2.4 hours, to solve the problem together using intuitionistic logic."
