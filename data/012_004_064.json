    "message_2": "To find the minimum weight spanning tree of this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. Edge 2-5: weight 1\n2. Edge 1-2: weight 2\n3. Edge 3-4: weight 2\n4. Edge 3-5: weight 2\n5. Edge 1-4: weight 3\n6. Edge 2-4: weight 3\n7. Edge 4-5: weight 3\n8. Edge 2-3: weight 4\n9. Edge 1-3: weight 5\n10. Edge 1-5: weight 6\n\nNow, we add edges to the spanning tree while ensuring that we don't create any cycles:\n\n1. Add edge 2-5 (weight 1)\n2. Add edge 1-2 (weight 2)\n3. Add edge 3-4 (weight 2)\n4. Add edge 3-5 (weight 2) - this would create a cycle with edges 2-5 and 3-4, so we skip it.\n5. Add edge 1-4 (weight 3)\n\nNow we have a spanning tree that includes all 5 vertices. The minimum weight spanning tree consists of the following edges:\n\n- Edge 1-2: weight 2\n- Edge 2-5: weight 1\n- Edge 3-4: weight 2\n- Edge 1-4: weight 3\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8."
