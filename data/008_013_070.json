    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the form of a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be written as:\n\n[2  1] [x]   [5]\n[4  3] [y]   [13]\n\nNow, let's find the LU decomposition of matrix A, where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix.\n\nStep 1: Initialize L and U matrices\n\nL = [1  0]\n      [0  1]\n\nU = [2  1]\n      [4  3]\n\nStep 2: Perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix\n\nWe want to eliminate the 4 in the second row of the U matrix. To do this, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row.\n\nNew second row of U = (4  3) - 2 * (2  1) = (0  1)\n\nSo, the updated U matrix is:\n\nU = [2  1]\n      [0  1]\n\nStep 3: Update the L matrix\n\nSince we subtracted 2 times the first row from the second row, we need to update the L matrix accordingly.\n\nL = [1  0]\n      [2  1]\n\nNow we have the LU decomposition of matrix A:\n\nA = LU = [1  0] [2  1]\n               [2  1] [0  1]\n\nStep 4: Solve the system Ly = b for y\n\n[1  0] [y1]   [5]\n[2  1] [y2]   [13]\n\ny1 = 5\ny2 = 13 - 2 * y1 = 13 - 2 * 5 = 3\n\nSo, y = [5, 3]\n\nStep 5: Solve the system Ux = y for x\n\n[2  1] [x1]   [5]\n[0  1] [x2]   [3]\n\nx2 = 3\nx1 = (5 - x2) / 2 = (5 - 3) / 2 = 1\n\nSo, x = [1, 3]\n\nThe solution to the given system of linear equations is (x, y) = (1, 3)."
