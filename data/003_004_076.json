    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the equation 2cos(3x) = √3 in the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the cosine function:\ncos(3x) = (√3)/2\n\n2. Find the general solutions for x:\nSince cos(π/6) = cos(5π/6) = (√3)/2, we have two solutions for the cosine function in the interval [0, 2π]:\n3x = π/6 + 2nπ and 3x = 5π/6 + 2nπ, where n is an integer.\n\n3. Solve for x:\nx = (π/18) + (2nπ/3) and x = (5π/18) + (2nπ/3)\n\n4. Find all specific solutions in the interval [0, 2π]:\nFor the first equation, x = (π/18) + (2nπ/3), we have:\nn = 0: x = π/18\nn = 1: x = π/18 + 2π/3 = 13π/18\nn = 2: x = π/18 + 4π/3 = 25π/18 > 2π (out of the interval)\n\nFor the second equation, x = (5π/18) + (2nπ/3), we have:\nn = 0: x = 5π/18\nn = 1: x = 5π/18 + 2π/3 = 17π/18\nn = 2: x = 5π/18 + 4π/3 = 29π/18 > 2π (out of the interval)\n\nSo, the solutions of the equation 2cos(3x) = √3 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/18, 13π/18, 5π/18, and 17π/18."
