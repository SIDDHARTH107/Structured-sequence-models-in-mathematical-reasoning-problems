    "message_2": "Let Q be the proposition \"n is an odd number\".\n\nNow we need to determine the truth value of Q -> ¬P when n = 25.\n\nFirst, let's find the truth values of P and Q when n = 25.\n\nP: \"n is a multiple of 5\"\nSince 25 is a multiple of 5, P is true.\n\nQ: \"n is an odd number\"\nSince 25 is an odd number, Q is also true.\n\nNow, let's find the truth value of ¬P.\n¬P: \"n is not a multiple of 5\"\nSince 25 is a multiple of 5, ¬P is false.\n\nFinally, let's determine the truth value of Q -> ¬P.\nQ -> ¬P: \"If n is an odd number, then n is not a multiple of 5\"\nIn this case, Q is true and ¬P is false. According to the truth table for the implication (->), if the antecedent (Q) is true and the consequent (¬P) is false, then the implication (Q -> ¬P) is false.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of Q -> ¬P when n = 25 is false."
