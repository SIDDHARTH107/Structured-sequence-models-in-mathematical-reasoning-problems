The mean monthly sales\n2. The median monthly sales\n3. The seasonal index of the month of August\n4. The trend rate of sales",
    "message_2": "1. The mean monthly sales:\nTo calculate the mean, we sum up all the sales and divide by the total number of months.\n\nMean = (500 + 700 + 820 + 630 + 720 + 830 + 920 + 870 + 750 + 690 + 800 + 900 + 550 + 750 + 840 + 660 + 760 + 880 + 970 + 900 + 800 + 720 + 840 + 950) / 24\nMean = 18980 / 24\nMean ≈ 791.67\n\nThe mean monthly sales are approximately 791.67.\n\n2. The median monthly sales:\nTo find the median, we first arrange the sales in ascending order and then find the middle value. Since there are 24 months, the median will be the average of the 12th and 13th values.\n\nSorted sales: 500, 550, 630, 660, 690, 700, 720, 720, 750, 750, 760, 800, 800, 820, 830, 840, 840, 870, 880, 900, 900, 920, 950, 970\n\nMedian = (800 + 800) / 2\nMedian = 1600 / 2\nMedian = 800\n\nThe median monthly sales are 800.\n\n3. The seasonal index of the month of August:\nTo calculate the seasonal index, we first find the average sales for the month of August and then divide it by the overall mean sales.\n\nAugust sales: 870 (2018) and 900 (2019)\nAugust average sales = (870 + 900) / 2 = 1770 / 2 = 885\n\nSeasonal index for August = August average sales / Mean sales\nSeasonal index for August = 885 / 791.67 ≈ 1.118\n\nThe seasonal index of the month of August is approximately 1.118.\n\n4. The trend rate of sales:\nTo calculate the trend rate, we can use linear regression. However, this requires more advanced calculations. A simpler approach is to calculate the average increase in sales per month.\n\nTotal increase in sales from Jan-18 to Dec-19 = 950 - 500 = 450\nNumber of months between Jan-18 and Dec-19 = 24 - 1 = 23\n\nTrend rate = Total increase in sales / Number of months\nTrend rate = 450 / 23 ≈ 19.57\n\nThe trend rate of sales is approximately 19.57 per month."
