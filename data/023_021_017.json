    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the wave with a wavelength of 0.5m, we first need to rewrite the given equation in terms of angular frequency (ω) and wave number (k). The equation is given as:\n\nE(x,t) = 10cos(200πt - 4πx) + 5sin(200πt - 4πx)\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) is the coefficient of the time variable t, and the wave number (k) is the coefficient of the spatial variable x. In this case, ω = 200π and k = 4π.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) using the following relationships:\n\nλ = 2π/k\nf = ω/2π\n\nPlugging in the values of k and ω, we get:\n\nλ = 2π/(4π) = 1/2 m\nf = (200π)/(2π) = 100 Hz\n\nNow, we can see that the given equation already represents a wave with a wavelength of 0.5m. Therefore, we can directly read the amplitude of the wave from the equation. The amplitude is the sum of the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms:\n\nAmplitude = √(10^2 + 5^2) = √(100 + 25) = √125 = 5√5\n\nSo, the amplitude of the wave with a wavelength of 0.5m is 5√5."
