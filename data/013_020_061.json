    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, a group of 10 students are tasked with choosing a number between 0 and 100. The winner will be the student whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average number chosen by all participants. If a tie occurs, the tied participants will split the prize equally. If the prize is worth $100, what number should each student choose to have the best chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To have the best chance of winning, each student should try to predict what the other students will choose and then select a number that is 2/3 of that predicted average.\n\nLet's assume that all students think rationally and believe that the other students will choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. In this case, the average number chosen would be 50. So, a rational student would choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all students think one step further and believe that everyone else will choose 33.33, then the new average would be 33.33, and the best choice would be 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, and each time the chosen number will get closer to 0. In practice, the best choice would depend on how many \"levels of thinking\" the students go through. However, choosing a number around 22.22 would be a reasonable strategy, as it accounts for two levels of rational thinking."
