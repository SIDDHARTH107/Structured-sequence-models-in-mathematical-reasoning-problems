    "message_1": "A company conducts quality control inspections on 10% of its products before shipping them to customers. Suppose a customer orders 50 products. What is the probability that at least one of the inspected products is defective if the defect rate among all products is 5%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will first find the probability that none of the inspected products are defective and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one inspected product is defective.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. The company inspects 10% of the products, so they will inspect 10% * 50 = 5 products.\n2. The defect rate among all products is 5%, so the probability of a product being non-defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we will find the probability that all 5 inspected products are non-defective:\n\n(0.95)^5 ≈ 0.7737809375\n\nFinally, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability that at least one of the inspected products is defective:\n\n1 - 0.7737809375 ≈ 0.2262190625\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the inspected products is defective is approximately 22.62%."
