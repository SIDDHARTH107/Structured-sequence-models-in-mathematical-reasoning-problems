    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3 = E\n\nwhere x, y are the position coordinates, px, py are the momentum coordinates, and E is the energy constant. In this case, E = 1.0.\n\nTo compute the first three Lyapunov exponents, we need to numerically integrate the equations of motion and the variational equations for the system. This is a complex task that requires specialized numerical methods and software.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a general idea of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. Convert the Hamiltonian system into a set of first-order differential equations using Hamilton's equations:\n\ndx/dt = ∂H/∂px = px\ndy/dt = ∂H/∂py = py\ndpx/dt = -∂H/∂x = -x - 2*x*y\ndpy/dt = -∂H/∂y = -y - x^2 + y^2\n\n2. Linearize the system around a reference trajectory by introducing small perturbations (δx, δy, δpx, δpy) and computing the Jacobian matrix of the system.\n\n3. Integrate the equations of motion and the variational equations using a suitable numerical method (e.g., Runge-Kutta) for a range of initial conditions.\n\n4. Compute the Lyapunov exponents by analyzing the growth rate of the perturbations along the reference trajectory.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for different initial conditions and average the results to obtain the first three Lyapunov exponents.\n\nDue to the complexity of this task, it is not possible to provide a direct answer with three decimal places. I recommend using specialized software or libraries for numerical integration and Lyapunov exponent computation, such as the Python package \"nolds\" or the C++ library \"Boost.Numeric.Odeint\"."
