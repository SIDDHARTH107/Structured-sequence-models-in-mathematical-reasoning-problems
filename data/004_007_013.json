    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. In this case, f(x) = sin(x) and g(x) = 3x - 7. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(sin(x))/dx = cos(x)\ng'(x) = d(3x - 7)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we will apply the chain rule to find the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the derivatives at x = 2:\n\ng(2) = 3(2) - 7 = 6 - 7 = -1\ng'(2) = 3\n\nf'(-1) = cos(-1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x when x = 2 is:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = cos(-1) * 3\n\nThe exact value is 3*cos(-1)."
