    "message_2": "To determine if there exists a perfect matching in G, we can use Tutte's theorem. Tutte's theorem states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of its vertices, the number of odd-degree components of G - U is less than or equal to the size of U.\n\nSince we don't have the specific graph G, we cannot provide the exact set of edges that form the perfect matching. However, we can analyze the conditions for the existence of a perfect matching.\n\nA graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges can have a perfect matching because a perfect matching requires exactly 5 disjoint edges (10 vertices / 2) to cover all vertices. Since there are 18 edges, there are enough edges to potentially form a perfect matching.\n\nHowever, without the specific graph G, we cannot guarantee the existence of a perfect matching or provide the set of edges that form the perfect matching. The actual structure of the graph would be needed to determine this."
