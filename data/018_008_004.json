    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find A x B:\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find B x A:\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB x A = {(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. The elements in the Cartesian product are different, which shows that the Cartesian product is not commutative."
