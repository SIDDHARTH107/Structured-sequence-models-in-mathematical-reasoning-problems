    "message_2": "In linear logic, the tensor connective (⊗) represents a kind of \"and\" operation, and the turnstile connective (⊢) represents a logical consequence or provability. However, linear logic is not directly applicable to numerical values like 2 and 3, as it is a system of logic that deals with propositions and their relationships, not arithmetic operations.\n\nIf you are looking for an arithmetic operation to replace the tensor connective, you might consider using multiplication or addition. However, this would no longer be a linear logic formula, but rather a simple arithmetic expression. In that case, substituting A with 2 and B with 3 would result in:\n\nFor multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6\nFor addition: 2 + 3 = 5"
