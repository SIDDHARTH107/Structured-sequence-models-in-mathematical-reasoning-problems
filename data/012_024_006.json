    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 10 and E = 20. However, we do not know if the graph is planar or not. To check this, we can use the inequality for non-planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n20 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n20 ≤ 30 - 6\n20 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality is not satisfied, the graph is non-planar. Now, we need to find the genus of the graph. The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles that need to be added to a sphere to embed the graph without any edge crossings. We can use the Heawood's formula to find an upper bound for the genus:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nwhere g is the genus. Rearranging the formula to solve for g, we get:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\ng ≥ (20 - 3(10) + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (20 - 30 + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (-4) / 6\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the minimum value for g is 0. However, we already know that the graph is non-planar, so g cannot be 0. Therefore, the minimum genus for this graph is 1."
