    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 5 -4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    | -14 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -4) - (2 * 5) = -12 - 10 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.\n\nadj(A) = | -4 -2 |\n         | -5  3 |\n\nNow, multiply adj(A) by the scalar (1/det(A)):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -4 -2 |\n                   | -5  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 2/11  1/11 |\n         | 5/22 -3/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   |  2/11  1/11 |   |  8  |\n| y | = |  5/22 -3/22 | * | -14 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices:\n\nx = (2/11 * 8) + (1/11 * -14) = 16/11 - 14/11 = 2/11\ny = (5/22 * 8) + (-3/22 * -14) = 40/22 + 42/22 = 82/22 = 41/11\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 2/11\ny = 41/11"
