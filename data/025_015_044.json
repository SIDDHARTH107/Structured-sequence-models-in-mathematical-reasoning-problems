    "message_2": "To find the points on the surface x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 6 where the tangent plane is parallel to the xy-plane, we first need to find the gradient of the surface. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇f(x, y, z) = (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz)\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\ndf/dx = 2x\ndf/dy = 4y\ndf/dz = 6z\n\nNow, the tangent plane is parallel to the xy-plane when the normal vector of the tangent plane is parallel to the z-axis. This means that the x and y components of the gradient must be zero:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n4y = 0 => y = 0\n\nNow we can plug these values back into the equation of the surface to find the corresponding z values:\n\n0^2 + 2(0)^2 + 3z^2 = 6\n3z^2 = 6\nz^2 = 2\nz = ±√2\n\nSo, the points on the surface where the tangent plane is parallel to the xy-plane are (0, 0, √2) and (0, 0, -√2)."
