    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal pattern created by recursively removing triangles from an equilateral triangle. The number of triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid of height n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = (3^n - 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, the height of the Sierpinski pyramid is 4. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal triangles = (3^4 - 1) / 2\nTotal triangles = (81 - 1) / 2\nTotal triangles = 80 / 2\nTotal triangles = 40\n\nSo, there are 40 total triangles present in the construction of a Sierpinski pyramid of height 4 with an original equilateral triangle side length of 6 units."
