    "message_1": "A circular garden has a diameter of 10 meters. What is its perimeter in meters?",
    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle is also known as its circumference. To find the circumference, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and d is the diameter of the circle.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the circular garden is 10 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(10)\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 10\nC ≈ 31.4159\n\nTherefore, the perimeter (circumference) of the circular garden is approximately 31.42 meters."
