    "message_1": "Suppose a furniture company produces two types of chairs: a wooden chair and a metal chair. The wooden chair requires 8 feet of lumber and 2 hours of labor to produce, and the metal chair requires 6 feet of metal and 3 hours of labor to produce. The company has 80 feet of lumber and 60 feet of metal available for production, and has 24 hours of labor available. The profit for each wooden chair is $50 and the profit for each metal chair is $60. How many chairs of each type should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wooden chairs and y be the number of metal chairs.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Lumber constraint: 8x ≤ 80\n2. Metal constraint: 6y ≤ 60\n3. Labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 24\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 60y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. 8x ≤ 80 => x ≤ 10\n2. 6y ≤ 60 => y ≤ 10\n3. 2x + 3y ≤ 24\n\nNow we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (10, 0)\nC. (0, 10)\nD. Intersection of 2x + 3y = 24 and x = 10\n\nTo find point D, we substitute x = 10 into the labor constraint equation:\n\n2(10) + 3y = 24\n20 + 3y = 24\n3y = 4\ny = 4/3 ≈ 1.33\n\nSo, point D is (10, 4/3).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each corner point:\n\nA. P(0, 0) = 50(0) + 60(0) = $0\nB. P(10, 0) = 50(10) + 60(0) = $500\nC. P(0, 10) = 50(0) + 60(10) = $600\nD. P(10, 4/3) = 50(10) + 60(4/3) ≈ $500 + $240 = $740\n\nThe maximum profit is $740, which occurs when the company produces 10 wooden chairs and approximately 1.33 metal chairs. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a chair, they should produce 10 wooden chairs and 1 metal chair to achieve a profit of $50(10) + $60(1) = $560."
