    "message_2": "To find the distance between two points in a 3D space, we can use the Euclidean distance formula:\n\ndistance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)\n\nIn this case, the coordinates of Point A are (-5.93328, -5.29891, 24.53754) and the coordinates of Point B are (-5.88142, -6.10218, 24.43635). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ndistance = sqrt((-5.88142 - (-5.93328))^2 + (-6.10218 - (-5.29891))^2 + (24.43635 - 24.53754)^2)\n\ndistance = sqrt((0.05186)^2 + (-0.80327)^2 + (-0.10119)^2)\n\ndistance = sqrt(0.002689 + 0.645246 + 0.010239)\n\ndistance = sqrt(0.658174)\n\ndistance â‰ˆ 0.8107\n\nSo, the approximate distance between the two points on the Lorenz attractor is 0.8107 units."
