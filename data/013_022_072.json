    "message_1": "Suppose two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a dictator game. Alice has $20 and can decide how much money to give to Bob. If Alice gives $x to Bob, Bob will receive $x and Alice will keep $(20 - x). What is the optimal amount of money to give, assuming Bob's utility is directly proportional to the amount of money he receives?",
    "message_2": "In a dictator game, the decision solely lies with Alice, as she has the power to decide how much money to give to Bob. The optimal amount of money to give depends on Alice's preferences and her goal in the game. If her goal is to maximize Bob's utility, then she should give all $20 to Bob, as Bob's utility is directly proportional to the amount of money he receives. If her goal is to maximize her own utility, then she should keep all $20 for herself. If her goal is to balance both their utilities, then she can choose any amount between $0 and $20, depending on her preferences and how much weight she gives to Bob's utility compared to her own."
