    "message_1": "I apologize, but it's not possible to provide a numerical problem for the subject of modal logic as it deals with concepts such as necessity and possibility, which are not easily quantifiable in numerical terms. However, here's an example of a logical problem related to modal logic that a math student can solve:\n\nIf it is necessary that A implies B, and it is possible that A is true, then what can we conclude about B?",
    "message_2": "Given the information provided:\n\n1. It is necessary that A implies B (Necessarily, if A is true, then B is true).\n2. It is possible that A is true.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that it is possible that B is true. Here's the reasoning:\n\nSince it is necessary that A implies B, if A is true in any possible situation, then B must also be true in that situation. Now, we know that it is possible that A is true, which means there is at least one situation where A is true. In that situation, since A implies B necessarily, B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that B is true."
