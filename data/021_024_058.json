    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products, A and B. The company's objective is to maximize its profit. The production of product A takes 4 hours on machine 1 and 2 hours on machine 2. The production of product B takes 3 hours on machine 1 and 3 hours on machine 2. The company has 30 hours on machine 1 and 24 hours on machine 2 per week to manufacture the products. Product A generates a profit of $10 and product B generates a profit of $12. What should be the weekly production of A and B to maximize the profit using bat algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. However, for this linear programming problem, we can solve it using the simplex method or graphical method to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet x be the number of product A and y be the number of product B produced per week. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 30 (Machine 1 constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 24 (Machine 2 constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo solve this problem graphically, we can plot the constraints on a graph and find the feasible region:\n\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 30\ny ≤ (30 - 4x) / 3\n\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 24\ny ≤ (24 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon formed by the intersection of these constraints and the non-negativity constraints. The vertices of this polygon are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 8)\nC(6, 2)\nD(7.5, 0)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function P at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 10(0) + 12(0) = 0\nP(B) = 10(0) + 12(8) = 96\nP(C) = 10(6) + 12(2) = 84\nP(D) = 10(7.5) + 12(0) = 75\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B, where the company should produce 0 units of product A and 8 units of product B per week. The maximum weekly profit will be $96."
