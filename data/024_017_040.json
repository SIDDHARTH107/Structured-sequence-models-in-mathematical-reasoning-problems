    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve r(t), we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve r(t). The tangent vector is given by the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2t)\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector v(t) remains parallel to the curve at each point. This means that the derivative of v(t) with respect to t should be orthogonal to the tangent vector T(t). Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as:\n\nv'(t) · T(t) = 0\n\nLet v(t) = (a(t), b(t), c(t)). Then, v'(t) = (a'(t), b'(t), c'(t)). Now, we can write the orthogonality condition:\n\n(a'(t), b'(t), c'(t)) · (-sin(t), cos(t), 2t) = 0\n\nExpanding the dot product, we get:\n\n-a'(t)sin(t) + b'(t)cos(t) + 2tc'(t) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of differential equations with the initial condition v(0) = (1, 0, 0):\n\na(0) = 1, b(0) = 0, c(0) = 0\n\nTo solve the system of differential equations, we can use the integrating factor method. We can rewrite the system as:\n\na'(t) = sin(t)b(t) - 2t*sin(t)c(t)\nb'(t) = -cos(t)a(t)\nc'(t) = 0\n\nThe third equation implies that c(t) = constant. Since c(0) = 0, we have c(t) = 0 for all t.\n\nNow, we can solve the second equation for b(t). Integrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\nb(t) = ∫ -cos(t)a(t) dt\n\nTo find a(t), we can differentiate the equation for b(t) with respect to t:\n\nb'(t) = -cos(t)a(t) - sin(t)a'(t)\n\nSubstituting the expression for a'(t) from the first equation, we get:\n\nb'(t) = -cos(t)a(t) - sin(t)(sin(t)b(t) - 2t*sin(t)c(t))\n\nSince c(t) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nb'(t) = -cos(t)a(t) - sin^2(t)b(t)\n\nNow, we can solve this first-order linear differential equation for b(t) using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫ -sin^2(t) dt) = e^(∫ (1 - cos^2(t)) dt) = e^(t - (1/2)sin(2t))\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\ne^(t - (1/2)sin(2t))b'(t) + e^(t - (1/2)sin(2t))(-cos(t)a(t) - sin^2(t)b(t)) = 0\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the derivative of the product e^(t - (1/2)sin(2t))b(t) with respect to t. Integrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\ne^(t - (1/2)sin(2t))b(t) = ∫ 0 dt = constant\n\nSince b(0) = 0, the constant is 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nb(t) = 0\n\nFinally, we can find a(t) by integrating the first equation:\n\na(t) = ∫ (sin(t)b(t) - 2t*sin(t)c(t)) dt = ∫ 0 dt = constant\n\nSince a(0) = 1, the constant is 1. Therefore, we have:\n\na(t) = 1\n\nSo, the parallel transported vector v(t) is given by:\n\nv(t) = (1, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we can find the parallel transport of vector v when t = 0 and t = π/2:\n\nv(0) = (1, 0, 0)\nv(π/2) = (1, 0, 0)\n\nThus, the parallel transport of vector v remains unchanged as (1, 0, 0) at both t = 0 and t = π/2."
