    "message_1": "A ladder leaning against a wall makes an angle of 60 degrees with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 6 meters away from the wall, how long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function sine. In this case, we have the angle (60 degrees) and the length of the side adjacent to the angle (6 meters). We want to find the length of the ladder, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the ladder, the ground, and the wall.\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall, which is 6 meters, and the angle θ is 60 degrees.\n\nsin(60) = 6 / hypotenuse\n\nWe know that sin(60) = √3/2, so:\n\n(√3/2) = 6 / hypotenuse\n\nNow, we can solve for the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder):\n\nhypotenuse = 6 / ( √3/2 )\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\nhypotenuse = (6 * 2) / √3\n\nhypotenuse = 12 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nhypotenuse = (12 * √3) / (√3 * √3)\n\nhypotenuse = (12 * √3) / 3\n\nFinally, we can simplify:\n\nhypotenuse = 4 * √3\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is 4√3 meters."
