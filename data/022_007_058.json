    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of $|z^2 - 2z + 2|$ for any complex number $z$, we first complete the square:\n\n$|z^2 - 2z + 2| = |(z - 1)^2 + 1|$\n\nNow, let $w = z - 1$. Then, we have:\n\n$|(z - 1)^2 + 1| = |w^2 + 1|$\n\nWe want to find the minimum value of $|w^2 + 1|$ for any complex number $w$. \n\nNotice that $|w^2 + 1| \\geq 1$ for any complex number $w$. This is because $|w^2 + 1| = |w^2 - (-1)| \\geq ||w^2| - |-1|| = |w^2 - 1|$. Since $|w^2|$ is non-negative, we have $|w^2 - 1| \\geq 0$, and thus $|w^2 + 1| \\geq 1$. \n\nNow, we want to show that there exists a complex number $w$ such that $|w^2 + 1| = 1$. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, the polynomial $w^2 + 1$ has two complex roots. Let $w_1$ and $w_2$ be these roots. Then, we have:\n\n$w^2 + 1 = (w - w_1)(w - w_2)$\n\nTaking the absolute value of both sides, we get:\n\n$|w^2 + 1| = |(w - w_1)(w - w_2)|$\n\nSince $|w^2 + 1|$ has a minimum value of 1, there must exist a complex number $w$ such that $|(w - w_1)(w - w_2)| = 1$. This implies that $|w^2 + 1| = 1$ for some complex number $w$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $|z^2 - 2z + 2|$ for any complex number $z$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
