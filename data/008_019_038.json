    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n```\n(5x - 3yi) * 2 = (7 + 2i) * 2\n(2x + 4yi) * 5 = (3 - 5i) * 5\n```\n\nThis results in:\n\n```\n10x - 6yi = 14 + 4i\n10x + 20yi = 15 - 25i\n```\n\nNow, we will subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:\n\n```\n(10x + 20yi) - (10x - 6yi) = (15 - 25i) - (14 + 4i)\n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n```\n26yi = 1 - 29i\n```\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 26i to find the value of y:\n\n```\ny = (1 - 29i) / 26i\n```\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary unit in the denominator, we will multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of 26i, which is -26i:\n\n```\ny = ((1 - 29i) * -26i) / (26i * -26i)\n```\n\nThis results in:\n\n```\ny = (-26i + 754i^2) / 676\n```\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can simplify this to:\n\n```\ny = (-26i - 754) / 676\n```\n\nSo, y = -1.115 - 0.0385i.\n\nNow, we will substitute the value of y back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\n```\n5x - 3(-1.115 - 0.0385i) = 7 + 2i\n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n```\n5x + 3.345 + 0.1155i = 7 + 2i\n```\n\nSubtract 3.345 and 0.1155i from both sides:\n\n```\n5x = 3.655 + 1.8845i\n```\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n```\nx = (3.655 + 1.8845i) / 5\n```\n\nSo, x = 0.731 + 0.3769i.\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 0.731 + 0.3769i\ny = -1.115 - 0.0385i"
