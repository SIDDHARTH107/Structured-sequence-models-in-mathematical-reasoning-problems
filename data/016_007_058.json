    "message_2": "The Menger Sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face, as well as the central cube of the entire structure, is removed. This leaves 20 cubes in the first iteration.\n\nFor the fifth iteration, the total number of cubes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nTotal cubes in the fifth iteration = 20^5 = 3,200,000 cubes."
