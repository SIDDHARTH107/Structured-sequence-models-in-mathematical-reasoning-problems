Suppose that the ends of the rod are held at fixed temperatures: \n\nu(0, t) = 0  and  u(L, t) = 100\n\nwith an initial temperature: \n\nu(x, 0) = x(1-x) \n\nUse the Fourier transform to find an expression for u(x, t). Determine the temperature distribution of the rod for t = 1.5, L = 2, and k = 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the heat equation:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = k X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by kXT:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ^2\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ^2\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ^2 X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + λ^2 k T(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx)\n\nApply the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0 (since u(0, t) = 0)\nX(L) = A sin(λL) = 100 (since u(L, t) = 100)\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we get B = 0, so:\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx)\n\nFrom the second boundary condition, we get:\n\nA sin(λL) = 100\n\nNow, we need to find λ. Since sin(λL) must be nonzero, λL must be an odd multiple of π/2:\n\nλL = (2n + 1)π/2, n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThus, λ_n = (2n + 1)π/(2L), and:\n\nX_n(x) = A_n sin(λ_n x)\n\nNow, solve the second equation for T(t):\n\nT'(t) + λ^2 k T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n exp(-λ_n^2 k t)\n\nNow, the solution u(x, t) is a sum of the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(λ_n x) * C_n exp(-λ_n^2 k t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n and C_n, we use the initial condition:\n\nu(x, 0) = x(1-x) = Σ [A_n sin(λ_n x) * C_n]\n\nSince T_n(0) = C_n, we have:\n\nx(1-x) = Σ [A_n sin(λ_n x)]\n\nWe can find A_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[0, L] x(1-x) sin(λ_n x) dx\n\nNow, we have all the ingredients to write the solution:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(2/L) ∫[0, L] x(1-x) sin(λ_n x) dx * sin(λ_n x) * exp(-λ_n^2 k t)]\n\nFor the given values of t = 1.5, L = 2, and k = 1, we can plug in the values and compute the sum numerically to find the temperature distribution of the rod. Note that the sum converges quickly, so only a few terms are needed for a good approximation."
