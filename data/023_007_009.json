    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 2 sin(4πt) + 4 cos(6πt), we can use the Fourier transform. However, since the given function is already in the time domain and consists of sinusoidal components, we can directly identify the frequencies from the function itself.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere X(ω) is the Fourier transform of x(t), ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf), and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nIn our case, the function f(t) is already given as a sum of sinusoidal components:\n\nf(t) = 2 sin(4πt) + 4 cos(6πt)\n\nWe can identify the frequencies directly from the function:\n\n1. The first component is 2 sin(4πt). The angular frequency is ω1 = 4π, so the frequency is f1 = ω1 / (2π) = 4π / (2π) = 2 Hz.\n\n2. The second component is 4 cos(6πt). The angular frequency is ω2 = 6π, so the frequency is f2 = ω2 / (2π) = 6π / (2π) = 3 Hz.\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal f(t) is 2 Hz and 3 Hz."
