    "message_1": "In a country, 60% of citizens support a proposed policy change. If a random sample of 100 citizens is taken, what is the probability that at least 55% of them support the proposed policy change?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we want at least 55% of 100, which is 55)\n\nHowever, since we want the probability of at least 55% support, we need to calculate the probability for each value from 55 to 100 and sum them up.\n\nSo, the probability of at least 55% support is:\n\nP(X ≥ 55) = P(X = 55) + P(X = 56) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nLet's calculate this using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ 55) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.6)^k * (0.4)^(100-k)] for k = 55 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 55) ≈ 0.9826\n\nSo, the probability that at least 55% of the random sample of 100 citizens support the proposed policy change is approximately 98.26%."
