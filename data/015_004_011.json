    "message_2": "To find the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, we can use the polar equation of the cardioid and the formula for the area of a polar curve.\n\nThe given parametric equations are:\n\nx = 1/4 * (1 - cos(a))\ny = 1/4 * sin(a)\n\nWe can convert these parametric equations to a polar equation by using the relationships x = r * cos(a) and y = r * sin(a). \n\nx = r * cos(a) = 1/4 * (1 - cos(a))\ny = r * sin(a) = 1/4 * sin(a)\n\nNow, we can square both equations and add them together:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = (r * cos(a))^2 + (r * sin(a))^2\n(1/4 * (1 - cos(a)))^2 + (1/4 * sin(a))^2 = r^2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(1/16) * (1 - 2cos(a) + cos^2(a)) + (1/16) * sin^2(a) = r^2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n(1/16) * (1 - 2cos(a) + cos^2(a) + sin^2(a)) = r^2\n\nSince sin^2(a) + cos^2(a) = 1, the equation becomes:\n\n(1/16) * (1 - 2cos(a) + 1) = r^2\n(1/16) * (2 - 2cos(a)) = r^2\n(1/8) * (1 - cos(a)) = r^2\n\nNow we have the polar equation r^2 = (1/8) * (1 - cos(a)). To find the area of the cardioid, we can use the formula for the area of a polar curve:\n\nArea = (1/2) * ∫[r^2] da, from 0 to 2π\n\nIn our case, r^2 = (1/8) * (1 - cos(a)), so the integral becomes:\n\nArea = (1/2) * ∫[(1/8) * (1 - cos(a))] da, from 0 to 2π\n\nFactor out the constant (1/8):\n\nArea = (1/16) * ∫(1 - cos(a)) da, from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, integrate with respect to 'a':\n\nArea = (1/16) * [a - sin(a)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nArea = (1/16) * [(2π - sin(2π)) - (0 - sin(0))]\n\nSince sin(2π) = sin(0) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nArea = (1/16) * 2π\n\nFinally, multiply:\n\nArea = π/8\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is π/8."
