    "message_2": "Since X is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional ball of radius 1, we can consider the De Rham cohomology of the 2-dimensional ball B² instead. The De Rham cohomology groups are topological invariants, so they will be the same for homeomorphic spaces.\n\nRecall that the De Rham cohomology groups are defined as the quotient of the closed forms by the exact forms in each degree. In our case, we are interested in the second De Rham cohomology group H²(X), which corresponds to 2-forms on the 2-dimensional ball B².\n\nFirst, note that any closed 2-form on B² is automatically exact. This is because B² is contractible, meaning it can be continuously deformed to a point. Since the 2-form is closed, its exterior derivative is zero, and it can be written as the exterior derivative of a 1-form. Thus, any closed 2-form on B² is exact.\n\nNow, we need to compute the second De Rham cohomology group H²(X) = H²(B²) = closed 2-forms / exact 2-forms. Since any closed 2-form on B² is exact, the quotient is trivial, and we have:\n\nH²(X) = H²(B²) = {0}\n\nSo the second De Rham cohomology group of X is trivial."
