    "message_1": "A basketball coach must schedule 15 practice games for her team of 10 players, with each player playing exactly 9 games. How many different schedules are possible if no two players play in the same combination of games more than once?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider each game as a combination of 5 pairs of players (since there are 10 players and each game has 2 teams of 5 players). We need to find the number of ways to form 15 games such that each player plays in exactly 9 games and no two players play in the same combination of games more than once.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible pairs of players. There are 10 players, so the number of pairs is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 45\n\nNow, we need to distribute these 45 pairs among the 15 games. Since each game consists of 5 pairs, we can use the following equation:\n\n15 * 5 = 75\n\nSo, we need to distribute 75 \"pair slots\" among the 45 pairs. We can do this using the stars and bars method. We have 45 pairs (stars) and we need to divide them into 15 games (bars). So, we have:\n\nC(75 - 1, 15 - 1) = C(74, 14)\n\nC(74, 14) = 74! / (14!(74-14)!) ≈ 2.63 * 10^12\n\nHowever, this number includes schedules where some pairs play together more than once, which is not allowed. To account for this, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nLet A_i be the set of schedules where the i-th pair plays together more than once. Then, we want to find the number of schedules in the complement of the union of all A_i:\n\n|A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_45| = |U| - |A_1| - |A_2| - ... - |A_45| + |A_1 ∩ A_2| + ... - ... + |A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ ... ∩ A_45|\n\nHowever, calculating this directly is very complicated. Instead, we can use a simpler approach by noticing that the problem is equivalent to finding a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) with parameters (v, k, λ) = (10, 5, 3), where v is the number of players, k is the number of players per game, and λ is the number of games each player plays together.\n\nFor this specific BIBD, there is a well-known solution called the \"Desargues configuration,\" which consists of 15 games with the following pairings:\n\n1. (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)\n2. (1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 7), (6, 9), (8, 10)\n3. (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 8), (5, 9), (7, 10)\n4. (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 9), (4, 8), (6, 10)\n5. (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 7)\n6. (1, 7), (2, 9), (3, 6), (4, 10), (5, 8)\n7. (1, 8), (2, 10), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 9)\n8. (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 5), (6, 8), (7, 10)\n9. (1, 10), (2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9)\n\n10. (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 1), (7, 9), (8, 10)\n11. (3, 5), (4, 1), (6, 2), (7, 8), (9, 10)\n12. (5, 4), (6, 1), (7, 2), (8, 3), (9, 10)\n13. (5, 3), (6, 4), (7, 1), (8, 2), (9, 10)\n14. (7, 6), (8, 5), (9, 4), (10, 3), (1, 2)\n15. (7, 5), (8, 6), (9, 3), (10, 4), (1, 2)\n\nThis configuration satisfies the conditions of the problem, and it is unique up to relabeling the players. Therefore, there is only 1 possible schedule that meets the given conditions."
