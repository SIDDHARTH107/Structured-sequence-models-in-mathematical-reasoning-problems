The initial condition is u(x,0) = f(x) and the boundary conditions are u(-π,t) = u(π,t) = 0 for all t.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π]. Since f(x) is an odd function, we only need to find the sine coefficients. The Fourier series representation of f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients. Since f(x) is an odd function, a_n = 0 for all n. To find the b_n coefficients, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(2 * π^2)/(n^2) * (-1)^n]\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, we need to solve the partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k∂^2u/∂x^2\n\nwith the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x) and the boundary conditions u(-π,t) = u(π,t) = 0 for all t.\n\nWe can represent the solution u(x,t) as a Fourier series:\n\nu(x,t) = (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * sin(n * x) * F_n(t)]\n\nNow, we need to find F_n(t) such that the PDE is satisfied. Differentiating u(x,t) with respect to t and x, we get:\n\n∂u/∂t = (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * sin(n * x) * dF_n(t)/dt]\n\n∂^2u/∂x^2 = (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * (-n^2) * sin(n * x) * F_n(t)]\n\nPlugging these expressions into the PDE, we get:\n\n(2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * sin(n * x) * dF_n(t)/dt] = k * (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * (-n^2) * sin(n * x) * F_n(t)]\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(n * x), we get:\n\ndF_n(t)/dt = -k * n^2 * F_n(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for F_n(t). The general solution is:\n\nF_n(t) = C_n * exp(-k * n^2 * t)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x):\n\nf(x) = (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * sin(n * x) * C_n]\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get:\n\nC_n = ((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2)\n\nSo, the solution u(x,t) is given by:\n\nu(x,t) = (2/π) * Σ[((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * sin(n * x) * ((-1)^n * 2 * π^2)/(n^2) * exp(-k * n^2 * t)]\n\nu(x,t) = (4 * π^2) * Σ[((-1)^n)/(n^2) * sin(n * x) * exp(-k * n^2 * t)]"
