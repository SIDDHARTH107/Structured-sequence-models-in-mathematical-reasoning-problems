    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature as follows:\n\nK = 1/(5^2)\nK = 1/25\nK = 0.04\n\nTherefore, the Gaussian curvature at any point on the surface of the sphere is 0.04 (in units of cm^(-2))."
