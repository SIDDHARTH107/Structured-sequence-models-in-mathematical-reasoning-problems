If the student anticipates making $500 in sales over the summer, which job offer should they accept if they plan to work for 80 hours?",
    "message_2": "Let's calculate the total earnings for each job offer.\n\nOffer A:\nThe student will earn $10 per hour for 80 hours.\nTotal earnings = hourly rate × hours worked = $10 × 80 = $800\n\nOffer B:\nThe student will earn $8 per hour for 80 hours, plus a 5% commission on $500 in sales.\nHourly earnings = hourly rate × hours worked = $8 × 80 = $640\nCommission earnings = 5% of $500 = 0.05 × $500 = $25\nTotal earnings = hourly earnings + commission earnings = $640 + $25 = $665\n\nComparing the total earnings for each job offer:\nOffer A: $800\nOffer B: $665\n\nThe student should accept Offer A, as it provides higher earnings ($800) compared to Offer B ($665)."
