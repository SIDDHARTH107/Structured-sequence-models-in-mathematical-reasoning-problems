    "message_2": "A perfect match in a bipartite graph is a set of edges that connects every vertex in the graph exactly once. In this case, since there are three vertices in each set, a perfect match would consist of three edges, one for each vertex.\n\nLet's examine the given edges:\n\n1. (A,1) connects vertex A to vertex 1.\n2. (A,2) connects vertex A to vertex 2.\n3. (B,1) connects vertex B to vertex 1.\n4. (B,3) connects vertex B to vertex 3.\n5. (C,2) connects vertex C to vertex 2.\n\nWe can see that vertex A is connected to vertices 1 and 2, vertex B is connected to vertices 1 and 3, and vertex C is connected to vertex 2. To form a perfect match, we need to find a set of edges that connects each vertex exactly once.\n\nOne possible perfect match is:\n\n1. (A,1)\n2. (B,3)\n3. (C,2)\n\nThis set of edges connects each vertex in the graph exactly once, forming a perfect match."
