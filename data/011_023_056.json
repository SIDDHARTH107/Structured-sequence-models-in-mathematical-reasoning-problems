    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinatorics and the PÃ³lya Enumeration Theorem (PET). \n\nConsider a cycle of 6 vertices. Let's label the vertices as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. We have 3 colors to choose from for each vertex, let's call them A, B, and C.\n\nWe can start by coloring the first vertex (V1) with color A. Now, we have 2 choices for the second vertex (V2), either color B or color C. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: V2 is colored with B.\nNow, V3 can be colored with either A or C. If V3 is colored with A, then V4 can be colored with B or C, and so on. This pattern will continue, and we will have an alternating sequence of colors A and B. In this case, there are 2 ways to color the cycle.\n\nCase 2: V2 is colored with C.\nNow, V3 can be colored with either A or B. If V3 is colored with A, then V4 can be colored with B or C, and so on. This pattern will continue, and we will have an alternating sequence of colors A and C. In this case, there are 2 ways to color the cycle.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the cycle is rotationally symmetric, which means that if we rotate the cycle, the same color pattern will appear. In both cases, we have counted the same color pattern twice (once for starting with A and once for starting with B or C). Therefore, we need to divide the total number of ways by 2 to account for this overcounting.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to color the cycle is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2 ways."
