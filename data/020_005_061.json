    "message_1": "A sporting goods store wants to maximize their profit by choosing which products to stock on their shelves. They have a budget of $10,000 to purchase inventory. The store sells three products: soccer balls, basketballs and footballs. The profit and cost for each product are as follows:\n\n- Soccer balls: profit of $5 per unit, cost of $15 per unit\n- Basketball: profit of $10 per unit, cost of $25 per unit\n- Football: profit of $12 per unit, cost of $30 per unit\n\nThe store wants to know how many of each product they should stock to maximize their profit, while staying within their budget. Write a linear programming model and find the optimal solution for the store.",
    "message_2": "Let's define the variables for the number of each product to be stocked:\nx1 = number of soccer balls\nx2 = number of basketballs\nx3 = number of footballs\n\nObjective function (total profit):\nMaximize P = 5x1 + 10x2 + 12x3\n\nConstraints (budget and non-negativity):\n15x1 + 25x2 + 30x3 <= 10,000 (budget constraint)\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\nx3 >= 0\n\nNow we can solve the linear programming problem using the simplex method or any other linear programming solver.\n\nSolution:\nUsing a linear programming solver, we find the optimal solution to be:\nx1 = 0\nx2 = 250\nx3 = 166.67 (approximately)\n\nSince the store cannot stock a fraction of a football, they should stock 166 footballs and round down. The store should stock 0 soccer balls, 250 basketballs, and 166 footballs to maximize their profit.\n\nThe maximum profit will be:\nP = 5(0) + 10(250) + 12(166) = 0 + 2,500 + 1,992 = $4,492"
