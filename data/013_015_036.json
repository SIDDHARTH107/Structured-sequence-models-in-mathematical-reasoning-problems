    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The success of the task is represented by a payout of $10,000 for the principal, and a cost of $8,000 for the agent. The probability of success depends on the effort level of the agent, which can be high or low. The probability of success is 0.9 if the effort level is high and 0.6 if it is low. However, the agent's effort level is unobservable by the principal. If the principal offers the agent a fixed wage, what is the minimum wage offer required such that the agent chooses to exert high effort level, assuming the agent is risk-neutral?",
    "message_2": "Let W be the fixed wage offered to the agent. The agent is risk-neutral, so they will choose the effort level that maximizes their expected utility. We need to find the minimum wage W such that the agent's expected utility from exerting high effort is greater than or equal to the expected utility from exerting low effort.\n\nExpected utility from high effort:\nEU_high = 0.9 * (W - 8000)\n\nExpected utility from low effort:\nEU_low = 0.6 * (W - 8000)\n\nTo ensure the agent chooses high effort, we need EU_high ≥ EU_low:\n\n0.9 * (W - 8000) ≥ 0.6 * (W - 8000)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.6:\n1.5 * (W - 8000) ≥ (W - 8000)\n\nNow, distribute the 1.5 on the left side:\n1.5W - 12000 ≥ W - 8000\n\nSubtract W from both sides:\n0.5W - 12000 ≥ -8000\n\nAdd 12000 to both sides:\n0.5W ≥ 4000\n\nFinally, divide by 0.5:\nW ≥ 8000\n\nSo, the minimum fixed wage offer required for the agent to choose high effort level is $8,000."
