    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nArc length = ∫[√(1 + (dy/dx)^2)] dx from x = 1 to x = 4\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we will square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = [(3/2)x^(1/2)]^2 = (9/4)x\n\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4)x\n\nNext, we will find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + (9/4)x)\n\nNow, we will integrate the expression with respect to x from 1 to 4:\n\nArc length = ∫[√(1 + (9/4)x)] dx from x = 1 to x = 4\n\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. Therefore, we will use numerical integration to approximate the arc length. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integrator:\n\nArc length ≈ 6.51\n\nThus, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 6.51 (rounded to two decimal places)."
