    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product AxB. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nAxB = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A∩B. The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA∩B = {} (empty set, since there are no common elements between A and B)\n\nNow, we need to show that the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over their intersection. The distributive property states that A x (B ∩ C) = (A x B) ∩ (A x C) for any sets A, B, and C.\n\nIn our case, we want to show that A x (B ∩ A∩B) = (A x B) ∩ (A x A∩B).\n\nSince A∩B is an empty set, we have:\n\nA x (B ∩ {}) = (A x B) ∩ (A x {})\n\nA x {} = {} (Cartesian product with an empty set results in an empty set)\n\nSo, we get:\n\nA x {} = (A x B) ∩ {}\n\n(A x B) ∩ {} = {} (Intersection with an empty set results in an empty set)\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over their intersection, as we have shown that A x (B ∩ A∩B) = (A x B) ∩ (A x A∩B)."
