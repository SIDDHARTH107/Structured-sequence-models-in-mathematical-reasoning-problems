    "message_1": "One example of a numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subject Cryptography and subtopic Block ciphers is:\n\nSuppose you have a plaintext message of \"HELLO\" and you want to encrypt it using a block cipher with a key size of 8 bits. The following 8-bit key is used: 10101100. Using the block cipher algorithm, what is the encrypted message?\n\n(Hint: breaking the plaintext into 8-bit blocks may be helpful.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first convert the plaintext message \"HELLO\" into binary format (ASCII representation) and then apply the block cipher algorithm using the given 8-bit key.\n\nStep 1: Convert the plaintext message into binary format (ASCII representation)\nH - 01001000\nE - 01000101\nL - 01001100\nL - 01001100\nO - 01001111\n\nStep 2: Break the plaintext into 8-bit blocks\nSince the key size is 8 bits, we will break the plaintext into 8-bit blocks. In this case, we already have the 8-bit blocks from the ASCII representation.\n\nStep 3: Apply the block cipher algorithm using the 8-bit key\nThe block cipher algorithm is not specified in the problem, so we will use a simple XOR operation as an example.\n\nKey: 10101100\n\n01001000 (H) XOR 10101100 (Key) = 11100100\n01000101 (E) XOR 10101100 (Key) = 11101001\n01001100 (L) XOR 10101100 (Key) = 11100000\n01001100 (L) XOR 10101100 (Key) = 11100000\n01001111 (O) XOR 10101100 (Key) = 11100011\n\nStep 4: Convert the binary encrypted message back to text\n11100100 - ì\n11101001 - é\n11100000 - à\n11100000 - à\n11100011 - ã\n\nThe encrypted message is \"ìéààã\"."
