    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example question:\n\nA company produces two products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. Machine X can produce both products, while machine Y can only produce B. The company wants to maximize its production while meeting the following constraints: machine X can be used for at most 12 hours a day, while machine Y can only be used for 8 hours a day. Additionally, product A requires 3 hours of machine X and 2 hours of machine Y per unit, while product B requires 2 hours of machine X and 4 hours of machine Y per unit. What is the maximum number of units the company can produce in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Machine X: 3x + 2y ≤ 12 (since product A requires 3 hours of machine X and product B requires 2 hours of machine X)\n2. Machine Y: 2x + 4y ≤ 8 (since product A requires 2 hours of machine Y and product B requires 4 hours of machine Y)\n3. x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since the number of units produced cannot be negative)\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of units produced, which is x + y.\n\nFirst, let's solve the inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 12\n   y ≤ (12 - 3x)/2\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 8\n   y ≤ (8 - 2x)/4 = (2 - x)/2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. We can find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1. y = (12 - 3x)/2\n2. y = (2 - x)/2\n\nSolving for x:\n\n(12 - 3x)/2 = (2 - x)/2\n12 - 3x = 2 - x\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nNow, solving for y:\n\ny = (2 - x)/2\ny = (2 - 5)/2\ny = -3/2\n\nSince y cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. Now, let's find the intersection points of the constraints with the axes:\n\nFor x-axis (y = 0):\n3x + 2y ≤ 12\n3x ≤ 12\nx ≤ 4\n\nFor y-axis (x = 0):\n2x + 4y ≤ 8\n4y ≤ 8\ny ≤ 2\n\nThe feasible region has vertices at (0, 0), (0, 2), and (4, 0). Now, let's evaluate the objective function (x + y) at these vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0): x + y = 0\n2. (0, 2): x + y = 2\n3. (4, 0): x + y = 4\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 4, which occurs at the vertex (4, 0). Therefore, the company can produce a maximum of 4 units in a day (4 units of product A and 0 units of product B)."
