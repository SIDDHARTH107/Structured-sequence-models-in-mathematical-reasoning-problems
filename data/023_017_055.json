    "message_2": "The given wave pattern equation is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform. We can directly identify the amplitude, angular frequency, and phase of each wave component.\n\nThe equation is:\n$h(x,t) = 0.6 \\sin(6x - 20t) - 1.2 \\cos(20x - 5t) + 0.9 \\cos(50x + 10t)$\n\nThere are three wave components in the equation:\n\n1. $0.6 \\sin(6x - 20t)$\n   Amplitude: $0.6$\n   Angular frequency: $6$ for the spatial component and $20$ for the temporal component\n   Phase: $0$ (since it's a sine function)\n\n2. $-1.2 \\cos(20x - 5t)$\n   Amplitude: $1.2$\n   Angular frequency: $20$ for the spatial component and $5$ for the temporal component\n   Phase: $0$ (since it's a cosine function)\n\n3. $0.9 \\cos(50x + 10t)$\n   Amplitude: $0.9$\n   Angular frequency: $50$ for the spatial component and $10$ for the temporal component\n   Phase: $0$ (since it's a cosine function)\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the individual wave components are:\n\n1.
