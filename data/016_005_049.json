    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. After each iteration, the number of line segments increases by a factor of 2, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 2 line segments, each with a length of 27/3 = 9.\n\nAfter the second iteration, there are 2^2 = 4 line segments, each with a length of 9/3 = 3.\n\nAfter the third iteration, there are 2^3 = 8 line segments, each with a length of 3/3 = 1.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, there are 2^4 = 16 line segments, each with a length of 1/3.\n\nThe total length of all the line segments combined after the fourth iteration is 16 * (1/3) = 16/3. So, there will be 16 line segments with a total length of 16/3."
