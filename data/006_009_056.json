    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000, the probability of having a certain medical condition is 0.05. If 500 individuals are randomly selected from the population, what is the probability that at least 30 of them have the condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 500 (number of individuals randomly selected)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of having the medical condition)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 30 of them have the condition, which means we want to find P(X >= 30). To do this, we can find the complement probability, which is P(X < 30), and then subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - P(X < 30)\n\nP(X < 30) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 29)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 30) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.05)^k * (1-0.05)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 29\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 30) ≈ 0.3085\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 30 individuals having the condition:\n\nP(X >= 30) = 1 - P(X < 30) = 1 - 0.3085 ≈ 0.6915\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 of the 500 randomly selected individuals have the medical condition is approximately 0.6915 or 69.15%."
