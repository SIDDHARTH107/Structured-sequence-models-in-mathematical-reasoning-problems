    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven a diameter of 10 centimeters, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = πd\nC = 3.14159 × 10\nC ≈ 31.4159 centimeters\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 31.4159 centimeters."
