    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 4, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf(x) = (x^2 + 5)^7\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\nf'(x) = 7(x^2 + 5)^6 * (2x)\n\ng(x) = √x = x^(1/2)\nUsing the power rule, we get:\ng'(x) = (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find f'(g(x)) and g'(x) at x = 4.\n\ng(4) = √4 = 2\ng'(4) = (1/2)(4)^(-1/2) = (1/2)(2)^(-1) = 1/4\n\nf'(g(4)) = f'(2) = 7(2^2 + 5)^6 * (2*2) = 7(9)^6 * 4\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 4 using the chain rule:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n(f(g(4)))' = f'(g(4)) * g'(4) = (7(9)^6 * 4) * (1/4)\n\nThe 4 and 1/4 cancel out:\n\n(f(g(4)))' = 7(9)^6\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 4 is 7(9)^6."
