    "message_2": "To find all the points in the projective space P^3 over the field of complex numbers that lie on the variety X, we need to solve the equation:\n\nf(x, y, z, w) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyzw = 0\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when w â‰  0. We can divide the equation by w^3 to obtain:\n\n(x/w)^3 + (y/w)^3 + (z/w)^3 - 3(x/w)(y/w)(z/w) = 0\n\nLet X = x/w, Y = y/w, and Z = z/w. Then the equation becomes:\n\nX^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 - 3XYZ = 0\n\nThis is a well-known equation called the Fermat cubic, and its solutions are related to the so-called elliptic curves. To find the solutions, we can use the following trick:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation as X^3 + Y^3 = 3XYZ - Z^3\n2. Add (X + Y + Z)^3 to both sides: (X + Y + Z)^3 = 3XYZ - Z^3 + (X + Y + Z)^3\n3. Expand the left side: X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 + 3X^2Y + 3XY^2 + 3X^2Z + 3Y^2Z + 3XZ^2 + 3YZ^2 + 6XYZ = 3XYZ - Z^3 + (X + Y + Z)^3\n4. Cancel out terms: (X + Y + Z)^3 = 3X^2Y + 3XY^2 + 3X^2Z + 3Y^2Z + 3XZ^2 + 3YZ^2 + 9XYZ\n\nNow, we can use the following substitution:\n\nX = u - v, Y = v - w, Z = w - u\n\nSubstituting and simplifying, we get:\n\n(u^3 + v^3 + w^3 - 3uvw)^3 = 27(u^2v^2 + v^2w^2 + w^2u^2)\n\nNow, we can find the solutions (u, v, w) in the complex numbers, and then find the corresponding (X, Y, Z) coordinates. Finally, we can recover the original homogeneous coordinates (x, y, z, w) by multiplying (X, Y, Z) by w.\n\nIn the case when w = 0, the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0\n\nThis equation represents a plane curve in P^2, and its solutions can be found by intersecting the curve with lines in P^2. The solutions will be of the form (x, y, z, 0).\n\nIn conclusion, to find all the points in the projective space P^3 over the field of complex numbers that lie on the variety X, we need to solve the Fermat cubic equation and the plane curve equation, and then recover the homogeneous coordinates."
