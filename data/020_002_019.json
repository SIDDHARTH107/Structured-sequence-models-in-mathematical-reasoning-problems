    "message_1": "Here's one: \n\nA chemical company produces two types of chemicals A and B. The profit per unit of A and B are $10 and $15 respectively. The production process for A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time per unit, while the process for B requires 4 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time per unit. The company has 400 labor hours and 450 machine hours available to produce both chemicals. How many units of A and B should the company produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of chemical A produced and y be the number of units of chemical B produced. The profit function to be maximized is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine hours are:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 400 (labor hours)\n3x + 3y ≤ 450 (machine hours)\n\nWe can simplify the constraints:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 200\nx + y ≤ 150\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region for the production of chemicals A and B. The feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy the constraints. In this case, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 100), (50, 100), and (150, 0).\n\nWe will now evaluate the profit function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. (0, 100): Profit = 10(0) + 15(100) = $1500\n3. (50, 100): Profit = 10(50) + 15(100) = $2000\n4. (150, 0): Profit = 10(150) + 15(0) = $1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (50, 100), where the company produces 50 units of chemical A and 100 units of chemical B. The maximum profit is $2000."
