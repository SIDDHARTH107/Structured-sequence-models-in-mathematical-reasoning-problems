    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall and the angle between the ladder and the wall is 60 degrees. Using the Pythagorean theorem, what is the length of the ladder to the nearest hundredth of a foot?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder in this case). \n\nsin(60°) = opposite side (height) / hypotenuse (ladder length)\n\nWe know the base of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, and we can find the height using the sine function:\n\nheight = sin(60°) * ladder length\n\nSince sin(60°) = √3/2, we have:\n\nheight = (√3/2) * ladder length\n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nbase^2 + height^2 = ladder length^2\n\n6^2 + ((√3/2) * ladder length)^2 = ladder length^2\n\n36 + (3/4) * ladder length^2 = ladder length^2\n\nNow, we can solve for the ladder length:\n\nladder length^2 - (3/4) * ladder length^2 = 36\n\n(1/4) * ladder length^2 = 36\n\nladder length^2 = 36 * 4\n\nladder length^2 = 144\n\nladder length = √144\n\nladder length = 12\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is 12 feet."
