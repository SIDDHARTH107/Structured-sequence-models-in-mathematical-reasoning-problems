The demand function for the product is given by Q = 1000 - 4P, where P is the price per unit and Q is the quantity sold per month. Determine the optimal price that the company should charge to maximize its revenue, and calculate the maximum revenue.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize revenue, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue (R) is the product of price (P) and quantity (Q), so we have:\n\nR(P) = P * Q\n\nWe are given the demand function Q = 1000 - 4P. We can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nR(P) = P * (1000 - 4P)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function to determine the maximum revenue. To do this, we will take the derivative of R(P) with respect to P and set it equal to 0:\n\ndR(P)/dP = d(P * (1000 - 4P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\ndR(P)/dP = (1000 - 4P) + P * (-4)\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\ndR(P)/dP = 1000 - 8P\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n0 = 1000 - 8P\n8P = 1000\nP = 125\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize revenue is $125 per unit. Now, we need to find the maximum revenue. We can do this by plugging the optimal price back into the revenue function:\n\nR(125) = 125 * (1000 - 4 * 125)\n\nR(125) = 125 * (1000 - 500)\n\nR(125) = 125 * 500\n\nR(125) = 62500\n\nTherefore, the maximum revenue is $62,500 per month."
