    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean math score, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we have:\nx̄ = 75\nσ = 6\nn = 40\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 75 ± (1.96 * (6 / √40))\n\nFirst, calculate the square root of the sample size:\n\n√40 ≈ 6.32\n\nNow, divide the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size:\n\n6 / 6.32 ≈ 0.95\n\nNext, multiply the Z-score by the result:\n\n1.96 * 0.95 ≈ 1.86\n\nFinally, add and subtract this value from the sample mean to find the confidence interval:\n\nCI = 75 ± 1.86\n\nLower limit: 75 - 1.86 = 73.14\nUpper limit: 75 + 1.86 = 76.86\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean math score is approximately (73.14, 76.86)."
