    "message_1": "Consider a market where two firms produce the same product. The first firm acts as the leader and the second firm acts as the follower in a Stackelberg competition. The inverse demand function is given by P = 120 - Q, where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The leader has a constant marginal cost of $20 and the follower has a constant marginal cost of $30. What is the optimal quantity produced by the leader and the follower, and what will be the profit of each firm?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction function of the follower, then find the optimal quantity produced by the leader, and finally find the optimal quantity produced by the follower. After that, we can calculate the profit of each firm.\n\n1. Find the reaction function of the follower:\nThe profit function of the follower is given by:\nπ₂ = (P - MC₂)q₂ = (120 - Q - MC₂)q₂ = (120 - q₁ - q₂ - 30)q₂ = (90 - q₁ - q₂)q₂\n\nTo maximize the profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to q₂ and set it equal to zero:\ndπ₂/dq₂ = 90 - q₁ - 2q₂ = 0\n\nThe reaction function of the follower is:\nq₂ = (90 - q₁)/2\n\n2. Find the optimal quantity produced by the leader:\nThe profit function of the leader is given by:\nπ₁ = (P - MC₁)q₁ = (120 - Q - MC₁)q₁ = (120 - q₁ - q₂ - 20)q₁ = (100 - q₁ - q₂)q₁\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of the follower into the profit function of the leader:\nπ₁ = (100 - q₁ - (90 - q₁)/2)q₁ = (110 - (3/2)q₁)q₁\n\nTo maximize the profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to q₁ and set it equal to zero:\ndπ₁/dq₁ = 110 - 3q₁ = 0\n\nThe optimal quantity produced by the leader is:\nq₁ = 110/3 ≈ 36.67 units\n\n3. Find the optimal quantity produced by the follower:\nSubstitute the optimal quantity produced by the leader into the reaction function of the follower:\nq₂ = (90 - 110/3)/2 = (170/3)/2 = 85/3 ≈ 28.33 units\n\n4. Calculate the profit of each firm:\nThe market price is given by:\nP = 120 - Q = 120 - (q₁ + q₂) = 120 - (110/3 + 85/3) = 120 - 195/3 = 45\n\nThe profit of the leader is:\nπ₁ = (P - MC₁)q₁ = (45 - 20)(110/3) = 25(110/3) = 2750/3 ≈ 916.67\n\nThe profit of the follower is:\nπ₂ = (P - MC₂)q₂ = (45 - 30)(85/3) = 15(85/3) = 1275/3 ≈ 425\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal quantity produced by the leader is approximately 36.67 units, and the optimal quantity produced by the follower is approximately 28.33 units. The profit of the leader is approximately $916.67, and the profit of the follower is approximately $425."
