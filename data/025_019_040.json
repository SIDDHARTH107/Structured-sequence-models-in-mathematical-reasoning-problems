    "message_2": "To compute the self-intersection number $(H^3)$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the adjunction formula.\n\nLet $Q$ and $C$ be the quadric and cubic surfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, respectively. Then, the Fano threefold $X$ is given by $X = Q \\cap C$. Let $h$ be the hyperplane class in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. Since $Q$ is a quadric surface, it has degree 2, and since $C$ is a cubic surface, it has degree 3.\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have that $H = h|_X$, where $h|_X$ is the restriction of the hyperplane class $h$ to $X$. Now, we can use the adjunction formula to compute the self-intersection number $(H^3)$.\n\nThe adjunction formula states that for a complete intersection $X = Q \\cap C$ in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, we have:\n\n$(H^3) = (h^3) - (h^2 \\cdot Q) - (h^2 \\cdot C) + (h \\cdot Q \\cdot C)$.\n\nSince $h$ is the hyperplane class in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, we have $(h^3) = 1^3 = 1$. The intersection numbers $(h^2 \\cdot Q)$ and $(h^2 \\cdot C)$ are given by the degrees of the surfaces $Q$ and $C$, respectively. Thus, we have:\n\n$(h^2 \\cdot Q) = 2$ and $(h^2 \\cdot C) = 3$.\n\nFinally, the intersection number $(h \\cdot Q \\cdot C)$ is given by the product of the degrees of $Q$ and $C$, which is $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\n\nPlugging these values into the adjunction formula, we get:\n\n$(H^3) = 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the self-intersection number of the class $H$ on the Fano threefold $X$ is $(H^3) = 2$."
