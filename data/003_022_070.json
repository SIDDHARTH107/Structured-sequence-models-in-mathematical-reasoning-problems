    "message_2": "The dot product of two vectors A and B can be found using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 5, |B| = 3, and θ = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can find the dot product:\n\nA · B = 5 * 3 * cos(π/3)\nA · B = 15 * (1/2)\nA · B = 7.5\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors is 7.5."
