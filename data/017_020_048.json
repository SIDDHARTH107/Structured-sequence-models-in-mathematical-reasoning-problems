    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 5-subgroup, which we will denote as P_5.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 5^1 = 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 mod 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup, which we will denote as P_2.\n\nIf both P_2 and P_5 are normal, then the group is a direct product of P_2 and P_5. Since P_2 has order 8 and P_5 has order 5, the group is isomorphic to C_8 × C_5, which is the cyclic group C_40.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal. Let P_2 be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since P_5 is normal, we can form the semi-direct product of P_2 and P_5. The semi-direct product depends on the action of P_2 on P_5, which is determined by a homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_5). \n\nAut(P_5) is isomorphic to the group of units mod 5, which is a cyclic group of order 4. Since P_2 has order 8, there are three possible homomorphisms φ: the trivial homomorphism, one with image of order 2, and one with image of order 4.\n\n1. If φ is the trivial homomorphism, the semi-direct product is just the direct product, which we already considered (C_40).\n\n2. If φ has image of order 2, then the semi-direct product is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_20.\n\n3. If φ has image of order 4, then there are 8 different homomorphisms (one for each element of Aut(P_5)). Each of these homomorphisms gives a different non-abelian group of order 40, and these groups are not isomorphic to each other or to any other group we have considered.\n\nIn summary, there are 11 non-isomorphic groups of order 40:\n\n1. The cyclic group C_40\n2. The dihedral group D_20\n3. Eight non-abelian groups formed by the semi-direct product of P_2 and P_5 with φ having image of order 4.\n\nNo other groups of order 40 exist because we have exhausted all possibilities for the Sylow subgroups and their actions on each other."
