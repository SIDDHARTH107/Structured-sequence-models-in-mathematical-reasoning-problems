    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have $100,000 to invest in two assets: stocks and bonds. You want to maximize your expected return while keeping the risk (measured by the standard deviation of the return) below 10%. Historical data suggests that stocks have an expected return of 12% with a standard deviation of 15%, while bonds have an expected return of 5% with a standard deviation of 5%. What is the optimal allocation of your funds between stocks and bonds to achieve your investment goal?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the proportion of the investment in stocks and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in bonds. We want to maximize the expected return while keeping the risk below 10%.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by:\nE(R) = x * E(R_stocks) + (1-x) * E(R_bonds)\nE(R) = x * 12% + (1-x) * 5%\n\nThe risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio is given by:\nσ(R) = √[x^2 * σ(R_stocks)^2 + (1-x)^2 * σ(R_bonds)^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * Cov(R_stocks, R_bonds)]\n\nAssuming that stocks and bonds are uncorrelated (Cov(R_stocks, R_bonds) = 0), the equation simplifies to:\nσ(R) = √[x^2 * 15%^2 + (1-x)^2 * 5%^2]\n\nWe want to find the optimal x such that σ(R) ≤ 10%. \n\nx^2 * 15%^2 + (1-x)^2 * 5%^2 ≤ 10%^2\nx^2 * 0.0225 + (1-2x+x^2) * 0.0025 ≤ 0.01\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n0.0225x^2 - 0.005x + 0.0025x^2 ≤ 0.01\n0.025x^2 - 0.005x ≤ 0.0075\nx^2 - 0.2x + 0.3 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nx = [-(-0.2) ± √((-0.2)^2 - 4 * 1 * 0.3)] / (2 * 1)\nx = [0.2 ± √(0.04 - 1.2)] / 2\nx = [0.2 ± √(-1.16)] / 2\n\nSince there is no real solution for x, we need to consider the boundary conditions. We'll check the risk at x = 0 (100% bonds) and x = 1 (100% stocks).\n\nFor x = 0 (100% bonds):\nσ(R) = √[0^2 * 15%^2 + (1-0)^2 * 5%^2] = 5%\n\nFor x = 1 (100% stocks):\nσ(R) = √[1^2 * 15%^2 + (1-1)^2 * 5%^2] = 15%\n\nSince the risk constraint is 10%, and 100% bonds have a risk of 5%, which is below the constraint, we should invest 100% in bonds to minimize risk while still achieving some return. In this case, the optimal allocation is $0 in stocks and $100,000 in bonds. The expected return of the portfolio will be 5%."
