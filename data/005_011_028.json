    "message_1": "A pharmaceutical company is testing a new pain medication. They randomly assigned 100 participants to receive either the new medication or a placebo. After one hour, they recorded each participant's pain level on a scale of 1-10. The average pain level for the 50 participants who received the new medication was 3.2, while the average pain level for the 50 participants who received the placebo was 4.8. What is the difference in means between the pain levels of the two groups, and is this difference statistically significant?",
    "message_2": "To find the difference in means between the pain levels of the two groups, we simply subtract the average pain level of the new medication group from the average pain level of the placebo group:\n\nDifference in means = Mean of placebo group - Mean of new medication group\nDifference in means = 4.8 - 3.2\nDifference in means = 1.6\n\nThe difference in means between the pain levels of the two groups is 1.6.\n\nTo determine if this difference is statistically significant, we would need to conduct a hypothesis test, such as an independent samples t-test. However, to perform this test, we would also need the standard deviations of the pain levels for both groups, which are not provided in the problem statement. Without this information, we cannot determine if the difference is statistically significant."
