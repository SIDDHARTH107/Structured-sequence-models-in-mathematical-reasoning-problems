    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider a non-intersecting closed loop of rope made from a 20-meter long piece of rope. The loop is tied in such a way that it has a trefoil knot, and the knot is symmetric with respect to reflection in a plane. What is the length of the shortest rope one could use to tie this knot such that each point on the rope lies on the trefoil knot, and the rope does not loop back over itself?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest length of rope needed to tie a trefoil knot without looping back over itself, we need to consider the minimum diameter of the rope and the tightest possible configuration of the knot.\n\nA trefoil knot can be described as the simplest nontrivial knot, with a knot crossing number of 3. The knot crossing number is the minimum number of times the rope must cross itself to form the knot. In the case of the trefoil knot, it has three crossings.\n\nTo find the shortest length of rope needed, we can use the formula:\n\nL = C * D\n\nwhere L is the length of the rope, C is the knot crossing number, and D is the minimum diameter of the rope.\n\nSince the trefoil knot has a knot crossing number of 3, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nL = 3 * D\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum diameter of the rope. This can be determined by considering the tightest possible configuration of the knot. In the tightest configuration, the rope will be bent at each crossing, forming a right angle. This means that the minimum diameter of the rope will be equal to the length of the rope needed to make a right angle bend.\n\nFor a right angle bend, the rope will need to travel a distance equal to the sum of the two legs of a right triangle with a hypotenuse equal to the diameter of the rope. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the minimum diameter:\n\nD^2 = (D/2)^2 + (D/2)^2\nD^2 = 2 * (D/2)^2\nD^2 = D^2 / 2\nD = sqrt(2)\n\nNow that we have the minimum diameter of the rope, we can find the shortest length of rope needed to tie the trefoil knot:\n\nL = 3 * D\nL = 3 * sqrt(2)\n\nL â‰ˆ 4.24 meters\n\nTherefore, the shortest length of rope needed to tie a trefoil knot without looping back over itself is approximately 4.24 meters."
