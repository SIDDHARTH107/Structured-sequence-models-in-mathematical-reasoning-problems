    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the related rates method. First, let's find the volume of the conical water tank at any given time. The formula for the volume of a cone is:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nWe are given that the radius of the tank is 4 feet and the height is 10 feet. However, we need to find the relationship between the radius and height of the water in the tank as it drains. Since the tank is a cone, the radius and height are proportional:\n\nr/h = 4/10\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nr = (2/5)h\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into the volume formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π((2/5)h)^2h\n\nV = (1/3)π(4/25)h^3\n\nV = (4/75)πh^3\n\nNow, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = (4/75)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that the tank is being drained at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute, so dV/dt = -2 ft³/min. We want to find the rate at which the water level is decreasing (dh/dt) when the height of the water is 6 feet:\n\n-2 = (4/75)π(3(6)^2)(dh/dt)\n\n-2 = (4/75)π(108)(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = -2 / ((4/75)π(108))\n\ndh/dt = -2 / (432/75)π\n\ndh/dt = (-2 * 75) / (432π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ -0.109 ft/min\n\nSo, the water level is decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.109 feet per minute when the height of the water is 6 feet."
