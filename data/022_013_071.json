    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function $f(z)$, we can use the power rule and the sum rule for differentiation. The derivative of $f(z)$ is:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2 - 2z + 2) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2) - \\frac{d}{dz}(2z) + \\frac{d}{dz}(2)$\n\nUsing the power rule, we have:\n\n$f'(z) = 2z - 2$\n\nNow, we want to find a point $z_0$ such that $f'(z_0) = 2$. We can set up the equation:\n\n$2z_0 - 2 = 2$\n\nSolving for $z_0$, we get:\n\n$2z_0 = 4$\n\n$z_0 = 2$\n\nSo, the point $z_0 = 2$ in $\\mathbb{C}$ satisfies the condition that the derivative $f'(z_0) = 2$."
