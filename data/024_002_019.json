    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the surface and find the arc length functional.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface using the coordinates (x, y) as follows:\n\nr(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector dr/dt, where t is the parameter along the curve:\n\ndr/dt = (dx/dt, dy/dt, 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))\n\nNext, we find the magnitude of the tangent vector:\n\n|dr/dt|^2 = (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2\n\nNow, we can write the arc length functional L:\n\nL = ∫√|dr/dt|^2 dt = ∫√((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2) dt\n\nTo find the geodesic curve, we need to minimize the arc length functional L. We can do this by applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to L:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nAfter solving these equations, we obtain the geodesic equations:\n\n(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2 = C1\nx(dx/dt) + y(dy/dt) = C2\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants.\n\nNow, we need to find the geodesic curve that passes through the points (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1). We can do this by solving the geodesic equations with the boundary conditions:\n\nx(0) = 1, y(0) = 0, x(1) = 0, y(1) = 1\n\nAfter solving these equations, we find that the geodesic curve is given by:\n\nx(t) = cos(πt/2)\ny(t) = sin(πt/2)\nz(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nwhere 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.\n\nThus, the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 from the point (1, 0, 1) to the point (0, 1, 1) with the shortest distance is given by:\n\nr(t) = (cos(πt/2), sin(πt/2), cos^2(πt/2) + sin^2(πt/2)) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1."
