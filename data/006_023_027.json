    "message_1": "A survey of 100 customers at a store revealed that 70 of them prefer to buy brand A while 30 prefer brand B. What is the probability that the next customer who walks into the store will buy brand A?",
    "message_2": "Based on the survey results, the probability that the next customer who walks into the store will buy brand A can be estimated as the proportion of customers who prefer brand A. \n\nTo calculate this probability, divide the number of customers who prefer brand A (70) by the total number of customers surveyed (100).\n\nProbability = (Number of customers who prefer brand A) / (Total number of customers surveyed)\n\nProbability = 70 / 100\n\nProbability = 0.7 or 70%\n\nSo, there is a 70% probability that the next customer who walks into the store will buy brand A. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate based on the survey results and may not be the exact probability for the next customer."
