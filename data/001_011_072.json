    "message_2": "To solve for x, first find a common denominator for the two fractions. In this case, the common denominator is x^2. \n\nRewrite the equation with the common denominator:\n\n(6x + 3) / x^2 = 2\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the equation by x^2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n6x + 3 = 2x^2\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n2x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -6, and c = 3:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (6 ± √12) / 4\n\nx = (6 ± 2√3) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (6 + 2√3) / 4 or x = (6 - 2√3) / 4\n\nx ≈ 1.63 or x ≈ 0.37"
