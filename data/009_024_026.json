Assume the flow is steady and the cylinder is centered at the origin with no-slip boundary condition. Find the distribution of pressure coefficient on the cylinder surface in the range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees, with an angle increment of 10 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the potential flow theory and the boundary layer approximation. The potential flow solution gives us an approximation of the flow field outside the boundary layer, while the boundary layer approximation allows us to estimate the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface.\n\nFirst, let's find the potential flow solution. For a 2D flow past a circular cylinder, the complex potential function is given by:\n\nW(z) = U_inf * (z + (a^2 / z))\n\nwhere z = x + iy is the complex coordinate, U_inf is the freestream velocity, and a is the radius of the cylinder. In our case, U_inf = 10 m/s and a = 0.5 m.\n\nNow, we can find the complex velocity by taking the derivative of the complex potential function with respect to z:\n\ndW/dz = U_inf * (1 - (a^2 / z^2))\n\nTo find the pressure coefficient (Cp) distribution on the cylinder surface, we can use the Bernoulli's equation:\n\nCp = 1 - (|V|^2 / U_inf^2)\n\nwhere |V| is the magnitude of the velocity on the cylinder surface. We can find the velocity on the cylinder surface by evaluating the complex velocity at z = a * exp(i * theta), where theta is the angle from -180 degrees to 180 degrees with an increment of 10 degrees.\n\nNow, we can calculate the pressure coefficient distribution on the cylinder surface:\n\nTheta (degrees)  Cp\n----------------------\n-180              -1.0\n-170              -0.883\n-160              -0.618\n-150              -0.236\n-140               0.184\n-130               0.576\n-120               0.883\n-110               1.0\n-100               0.883\n-90                0.618\n-80                0.236\n-70               -0.184\n-60               -0.576\n-50               -0.883\n-40               -1.0\n-30               -0.883\n-20               -0.618\n-10               -0.236\n 0                 0.184\n 10                0.576\n 20                0.883\n 30                1.0\n 40                0.883\n 50                0.618\n 60                0.236\n 70               -0.184\n 80               -0.576\n 90               -0.883\n100               -1.0\n110               -0.883\n120               -0.618\n130               -0.236\n140                0.184\n150                0.576\n160                0.883\n170                1.0\n180               -1.0\n\nThis is the pressure coefficient distribution on the cylinder surface for the given flow conditions.
