    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot run simulations or execute code. However, I can guide you through the steps to solve the optimization problem using genetic algorithms.\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of 20 random individuals (x values) within the search space.\n\n2. Evaluation: Calculate the fitness of each individual in the population by evaluating the function f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 7.\n\n3. Selection: Select parents for reproduction based on their fitness. You can use methods like roulette wheel selection or tournament selection.\n\n4. Crossover: Perform crossover (recombination) on the selected parents with a probability of 0.8 to create offspring. You can use methods like single-point crossover, two-point crossover, or uniform crossover.\n\n5. Mutation: Apply mutation to the offspring with a probability of 0.1. You can use methods like bit-flip mutation or Gaussian mutation.\n\n6. Replacement: Replace the old population with the new offspring.\n\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 for 50 generations.\n\n8. After 50 generations, find the individual with the highest fitness in the final population. This individual represents the optimal value of x.\n\n9. Calculate the corresponding minimum value of f(x) using the optimal value of x.\n\nNote that the genetic algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution may vary depending on the initial population and random processes involved in crossover and mutation. You can run the algorithm multiple times and take the average of the solutions to get a more accurate result."
