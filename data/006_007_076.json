    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain stock's price increasing in a given day is 0.6, while the probability of it decreasing is 0.4. If the stock's current price is $100, what is the probability that it will increase to $110 in the next day?",
    "message_2": "The problem states that the probability of the stock's price increasing in a given day is 0.6. However, it does not provide any information about the amount by which the stock's price will increase or decrease. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the probability of the stock's price increasing to $110 in the next day based on the given information."
