    "message_1": "A company wants to introduce a new product in the market. They have two options of advertising: Option A cost $5000 and has a 80% chance of the product being successful, and Option B costs $7500 and has a 90% chance of success. Assuming the company wants to maximize profit, which option should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option the company should choose, we need to calculate the expected value of each option. The expected value is the probability of success multiplied by the potential profit, minus the cost of the advertising option.\n\nLet's assume the profit from a successful product launch is P. We don't know the exact value of P, but we can still compare the expected values of the two options.\n\nExpected value of Option A:\n= (0.8 * P) - $5000\n\nExpected value of Option B:\n= (0.9 * P) - $7500\n\nNow, we need to compare the expected values of both options to determine which one is better for maximizing profit.\n\nOption A is better if:\n(0.8 * P) - $5000 > (0.9 * P) - $7500\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n0.1 * P > $2500\nP > $25000\n\nSo, if the profit from a successful product launch (P) is greater than $25,000, Option A is the better choice for maximizing profit. If the profit is less than or equal to $25,000, Option B is the better choice."
