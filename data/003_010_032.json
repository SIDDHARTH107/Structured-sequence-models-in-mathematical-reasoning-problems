    "message_1": "A building is located 200 meters away from a person. If the person measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be 45 degrees, then what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. In this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the person to the building is 200 meters.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height of the building) to the adjacent side (distance from the person to the building). So, we have:\n\ntan(45) = height / 200\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 200\n\nTo find the height, multiply both sides by 200:\n\nheight = 200 * 1\n\nheight = 200 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is 200 meters."
