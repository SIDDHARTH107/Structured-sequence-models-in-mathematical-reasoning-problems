    "message_2": "The described fractal is not a Vicsek fractal, but rather a Cantor dust-like fractal. To find the Hausdorff dimension of this fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, each line segment is replaced by 4 segments of length 1/3, so N = 4 and the scaling factor s = 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of this fractal is approximately 1.2619."
