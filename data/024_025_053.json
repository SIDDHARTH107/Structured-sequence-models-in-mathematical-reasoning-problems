    "message_2": "To find the first Chern class of the tangent bundle of X, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem and the adjunction formula. \n\nLet X be a non-singular complex projective curve of genus 2. The genus g of X is given by the formula:\n\ng = (K_X * K_X + 2) / 2,\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical divisor of X, and * denotes the intersection product.\n\nSince X is a curve, the tangent bundle of X is isomorphic to its cotangent bundle, which is the dual of the canonical bundle. Therefore, the first Chern class of the tangent bundle, c_1(T_X), is equal to the first Chern class of the canonical bundle, c_1(K_X).\n\nNow, let's use the adjunction formula:\n\nK_X = (K_X + K_X) - K_X = 2K_X - K_X = K_X.\n\nThus, the self-intersection number of the canonical divisor is:\n\nK_X * K_X = 2g - 2 = 2(2) - 2 = 2.\n\nSo, the first Chern class of the tangent bundle of X is c_1(T_X) = c_1(K_X) = 2."
