    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_7)$, we will evaluate the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x + 1$ for all possible values of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$. For each value of $x$, we will check if there is a corresponding value of $y$ that satisfies the equation. If there is, we will count the point $(x, y)$ as a point on the curve.\n\nWe will also count the point at infinity, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$, which is always a point on an elliptic curve.\n\nLet's evaluate the equation for each value of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$:\n\n1. For $x = 0$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 1$. This has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$: $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So we have two points: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 6)$.\n\n2. For $x = 1$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 1$. This also has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$: $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So we have two more points: $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 6)$.\n\n3. For $x = 2$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 3$. This has no solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n4. For $x = 3$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 6$. This has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$: $y = 3$ and $y = 4$. So we have two more points: $(3, 3)$ and $(3, 4)$.\n\n5. For $x = 4$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 3$. This has no solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n6. For $x = 5$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 6$. This has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$: $y = 3$ and $y = 4$. So we have two more points: $(5, 3)$ and $(5, 4)$.\n\n7. For $x = 6$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 1$. This has two solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_7$: $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So we have two more points: $(6, 1)$ and $(6, 6)$.\n\nSo far, we have found 10 points on the curve: $(0, 1)$, $(0, 6)$, $(1, 1)$, $(1, 6)$, $(3, 3)$, $(3, 4)$, $(5, 3)$, $(5, 4)$, $(6, 1)$, and $(6, 6)$. Including the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, we have a total of 11 points on the curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_7)$."
