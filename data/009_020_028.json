    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function $u(t)$, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we need to define the Hamiltonian function $H$ as follows:\n\n$H(x, y, u, p_x, p_y, t) = x^2 + y^2 + u^2 + p_x \\cdot x(4 - 4t - 4y) + p_y \\cdot y(2 - t - x)$\n\nHere, $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the costate variables. According to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the necessary conditions for the optimal control are:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$\n3. $\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}$\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 2u + p_x \\cdot 0 + p_y \\cdot 0 = 2u$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 2x + p_x \\cdot (4 - 4t - 4y) + p_y \\cdot (-y) = 2x + 4p_x - 4tp_x - 4yp_x - yp_y$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 2y + p_x \\cdot (-4x) + p_y \\cdot (2 - t - x) = 2y - 4xp_x + 2p_y - tp_y - xp_y$\n\nNow, we can write the necessary conditions:\n\n1. $2u = 0 \\Rightarrow u = 0$\n2. $\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -2x - 4p_x + 4tp_x + 4yp_x + yp_y$\n3. $\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -2y + 4xp_x - 2p_y + tp_y + xp_y$\n\nSince $u = 0$, the system of differential equations becomes:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(4-4t-4y)$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = y(2-t-x)$\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of differential equations along with the costate equations:\n\n$\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -2x - 4p_x + 4tp_x + 4yp_x + yp_y$\n\n$\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -2y + 4xp_x - 2p_y + tp_y + xp_y$\n\nSubject to the initial conditions $x(0) = y(0) = 1$ and the final conditions $x(1) = y(1) = 2$. This is a two-point boundary value problem, which can be solved numerically using various techniques such as the shooting method or the finite difference method.\n\nOnce the system of differential equations is solved, we can find the optimal control function $u(t)$, which in this case is $u(t) = 0$. The cost function $J$ will be minimized with this control function."
