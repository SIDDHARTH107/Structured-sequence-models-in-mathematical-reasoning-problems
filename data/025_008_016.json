    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the Hodge cohomology group $H^{1,1}(C,\\mathbb{C})$, we first need to determine the genus of the curve $C$. The given equation is a cubic curve, which is an elliptic curve. For an elliptic curve, the genus is always 1.\n\nNow, we can use the Hodge diamond to find the dimension of the Hodge cohomology group $H^{1,1}(C,\\mathbb{C})$. The Hodge diamond for a curve of genus $g$ is given by:\n\n```\n  1\ng   g\n  1\n```\n\nIn our case, since the genus $g = 1$, the Hodge diamond is:\n\n```\n  1\n1   1\n  1\n```\n\nThe dimension of the Hodge cohomology group $H^{1,1}(C,\\mathbb{C})$ is the entry in the middle of the diamond, which is 1. Therefore, the dimension of $H^{1,1}(C,\\mathbb{C})$ is 1."
