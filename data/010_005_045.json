    "message_2": "Since A is a connected subset of X and A ⊆ U and A ⊆ V, we know that A ⊆ (U ∩ V). Now, we are given that A ∩ U and A ∩ V are disconnected. This means that there exist non-empty open sets W and Z in X such that:\n\n1. A ∩ U = W ∪ Z\n2. W ∩ Z = ∅\n3. W and Z are both open in X\n\nSince A is connected, either W or Z must be disjoint from A. Without loss of generality, let's assume A ∩ W = ∅. Then A ⊆ Z, and A ∩ U = Z.\n\nNow consider the connected components of U ∩ V. Since A ⊆ (U ∩ V) and A is connected, A must be a connected component of (U ∩ V). However, we also have W ⊆ (U ∩ V) and W is disjoint from A. Thus, W must be another connected component of (U ∩ V).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of connected components of (U ∩ V) is 2."
