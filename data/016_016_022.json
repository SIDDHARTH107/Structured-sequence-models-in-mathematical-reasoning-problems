    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is generated by repeatedly replacing segments of the curve with a specific pattern. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nThe length of the Gosper curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial side length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nThe multiplier for the Gosper curve is 7^(1/2), as each segment is replaced by 7 segments, each of which is scaled down by a factor of âˆš2.\n\nFor the given problem, the initial side length is 1, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (7^(1/2))^6\nLength = 1 * (7^3)\nLength = 1 * 343\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 6 iterations with an initial side length of 1 is 343 units."
