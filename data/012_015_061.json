    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices, so a connected graph would require at least 6 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 9 edges, which is more than the minimum required (6 edges), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, just because it has more than the minimum number of edges does not guarantee that it is connected.\n\nTo prove that the graph is connected, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges. Without that information, we cannot definitively say whether the graph is connected or disconnected."
