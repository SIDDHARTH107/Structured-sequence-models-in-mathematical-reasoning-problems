    "message_1": "Using Predicate Logic, write a statement that represents the following problem:\n\nThere are five apples on the table, and John ate one.\n\nSolution: Let A(x) be \"x is an apple\" and let J be \"John\". The statement can be represented as:\n\n∃x [A(x) ∧ ¬(x = 1) ∧ ¬(x = 2) ∧ ¬(x = 3) ∧ ¬(x = 4) ∧ ¬(x = 5)] ∧ ¬A(1) ∧ J ate 1. \n\nWhat is the statement in English, and how many apples are left on the table?",
    "message_2": "The statement in English is: \"There exists an apple x such that x is not the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth apple, and the first apple is not an apple anymore because John ate it.\"\n\nHowever, the given predicate logic statement is not an accurate representation of the problem. A more accurate representation would be:\n\n∃x [A(x) ∧ (x = 1 ∨ x = 2 ∨ x = 3 ∨ x = 4 ∨ x = 5)] ∧ J ate x ∧ ∀y [(A(y) ∧ y ≠ x) → (y = 1 ∨ y = 2 ∨ y = 3 ∨ y = 4 ∨ y = 5)]\n\nThis statement translates to: \"There exists an apple x, which is one of the five apples on the table, and John ate it. For all other apples y, if y is an apple and not the one John ate, then y is one of the five apples on the table.\"\n\nSince John ate one apple, there are now 4 apples left on the table."
