    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can first observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, as every point on the line is a solution.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\n3y = 7 - 2x\n\ny = (7 - 2x)/3\n\nNow we have an expression for y in terms of x. The solutions to this system of equations can be represented as:\n\n(x, (7 - 2x)/3)\n\nFor any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using this expression."
