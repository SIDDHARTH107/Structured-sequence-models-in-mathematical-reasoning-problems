    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given function y = 3 sin(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sine function, which is y = A sin(Bx + C).\n\nIn our given equation, A = 3, B = 2, and C = π/4.\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is |3|. So, the amplitude is 3.\n\n2. Period:\nThe period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In our case, B = 2. Therefore, the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function y = 3 sin(2x + π/4) is 3, and the period is π."
