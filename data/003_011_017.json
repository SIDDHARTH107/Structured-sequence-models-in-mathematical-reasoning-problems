    "message_1": "A building is 100 meters tall. From the top of the building, a person is looking at an airplane in the sky. The angle of elevation of the airplane from the person on the rooftop is 45 degrees. How far away is the airplane from the person on the rooftop? (Assuming the airplane is at the same height as the building)",
    "message_2": "Since the airplane is at the same height as the building (100 meters), we can use the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle to solve this problem. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are congruent, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg.\n\nLet x be the horizontal distance between the person on the rooftop and the airplane. Since the angle of elevation is 45 degrees and the height of the building is 100 meters, the horizontal distance (x) is also 100 meters (because the two legs are congruent in a 45-45-90 triangle).\n\nNow we can find the distance between the person on the rooftop and the airplane using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDistance² = (Horizontal distance)² + (Vertical distance)²\nDistance² = (100 meters)² + (100 meters)²\nDistance² = 10000 + 10000\nDistance² = 20000\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the distance:\n\nDistance = √20000\nDistance ≈ 141.42 meters\n\nSo, the airplane is approximately 141.42 meters away from the person on the rooftop."
