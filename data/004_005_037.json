    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + 3y = 12x with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we will first find the integrating factor and then find the particular solution.\n\n1. Find the integrating factor (IF):\nThe integrating factor is given by the formula IF = e^(∫P(x)dx), where P(x) is the coefficient of y in the given differential equation. In this case, P(x) = 3.\n\nIF = e^(∫3dx) = e^(3x)\n\n2. Multiply the given differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(3x)(y' + 3y) = 12x * e^(3x)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(e^(3x)y)' = 12x * e^(3x)\n\n3. Integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(e^(3x)y)'dx = ∫12x * e^(3x)dx\n\nTo integrate the right side, we will use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 12x, dv = e^(3x)dx\ndu = 12dx, v = (1/3)e^(3x)\n\nNow, using the integration by parts formula (uv - ∫vdu):\n\n∫12x * e^(3x)dx = 12x * (1/3)e^(3x) - ∫(1/3)e^(3x) * 12dx\n= 4xe^(3x) - 4e^(3x)\n\nSo, we have:\n\ne^(3x)y = 4xe^(3x) - 4e^(3x) + C\n\n4. Solve for y:\n\ny = 4x - 4 + Ce^(-3x)\n\n5. Apply the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = 4(0) - 4 + Ce^(-3*0)\n1 = -4 + C\nC = 5\n\n6. Write the particular solution:\n\ny(x) = 4x - 4 + 5e^(-3x)\n\nSo, the particular solution of the given differential equation with the initial condition y(0) = 1 is:\n\ny(x) = 4x - 4 + 5e^(-3x)"
