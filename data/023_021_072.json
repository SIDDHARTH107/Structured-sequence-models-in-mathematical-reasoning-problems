    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the electric field along the length of the cable, we first need to determine the electric field as a function of time and position. The voltage applied at one end of the cable is given as a sine wave with frequency 10 MHz and amplitude 5 V. The voltage can be represented as:\n\nV(t) = 5 * sin(2 * π * 10^7 * t)\n\nThe electric field E(t) along the length of the cable can be determined from the voltage using the relation:\n\nE(t) = -dV/dx\n\nwhere x is the position along the length of the cable. Since the voltage is applied at one end of the cable, we can assume that the electric field is constant along the length of the cable. Therefore, the electric field can be represented as:\n\nE(t) = -5 * (2 * π * 10^7) * cos(2 * π * 10^7 * t)\n\nNow, we can calculate the Fourier transform of the electric field E(t). The Fourier transform F(ω) of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nApplying this to the electric field E(t), we get:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[-5 * (2 * π * 10^7) * cos(2 * π * 10^7 * t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\ncos(A) = (e^(jA) + e^(-jA)) / 2\n\nApplying this identity to the integral, we get:\n\nF(ω) = -5 * (2 * π * 10^7) * ∫[((e^(j(2 * π * 10^7 * t - ωt)) + e^(-j(2 * π * 10^7 * t + ωt))) / 2] dt\n\nSeparating the two terms in the integral, we get:\n\nF(ω) = -5 * (2 * π * 10^7) * [∫(e^(j(2 * π * 10^7 * t - ωt)) dt) / 2 + ∫(e^(-j(2 * π * 10^7 * t + ωt)) dt) / 2]\n\nNow, we can solve the two integrals separately:\n\n∫(e^(j(2 * π * 10^7 * t - ωt)) dt) = (1 / (j(2 * π * 10^7 - ω))) * e^(j(2 * π * 10^7 * t - ωt))\n\n∫(e^(-j(2 * π * 10^7 * t + ωt)) dt) = (1 / (-j(2 * π * 10^7 + ω))) * e^(-j(2 * π * 10^7 * t + ωt))\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for F(ω), we get:\n\nF(ω) = -5 * (2 * π * 10^7) * [(1 / (j(2 * π * 10^7 - ω))) * e^(j(2 * π * 10^7 * t - ωt)) / 2 + (1 / (-j(2 * π * 10^7 + ω))) * e^(-j(2 * π * 10^7 * t + ωt)) / 2]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the electric field along the length of the coaxial cable."
