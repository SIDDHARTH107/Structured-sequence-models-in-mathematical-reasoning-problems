    "message_2": "To compute the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them. \n\nThe antiderivative of a function is found by applying the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nThe antiderivative is (3/3) * (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3.\n\nFor the second term, -2x:\nThe antiderivative is (-2/2) * (x^(1+1))/(1+1) = -x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 5:\nThe antiderivative is 5 * (x^(0+1))/(0+1) = 5x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration (C):\n\nThe antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5 is F(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 5x + C."
