    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the graph G, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. The adjacency matrix represents the following graph:\n\n```\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nEdges: {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4)}\n```\n\nNow, let's compute the Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) using the recursive formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G\\e(x, y) + T_G/e(x, y) if e is a bridge\nT_G(x, y) = T_G\\e(x, y) + x * T_G/e(x, y) if e is a loop\nT_G(x, y) = T_G\\e(x, y) + y * T_G/e(x, y) if e is isthmus\nT_G(x, y) = x^(k-1) * y^(l-1) if G is a forest with k components and l loops\n\nIn our case, the graph G has no loops, and all edges are bridges. So, we can use the first formula for all edges:\n\n1. Remove edge (1, 2):\n```\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nEdges: {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4)}\n```\nT_G(1,2)(x, y) = T_G(1,3)(x, y) + T_G(2,3)(x, y) + T_G(3,4)(x, y)\n\n2. Remove edge (1, 3):\n```\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nEdges: {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)}\n```\nT_G(1,3)(x, y) = T_G(1,2)(x, y) + T_G(2,3)(x, y) + T_G(3,4)(x, y)\n\n3. Remove edge (2, 3):\n```\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nEdges: {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4)}\n```\nT_G(2,3)(x, y) = T_G(1,2)(x, y) + T_G(1,3)(x, y) + T_G(3,4)(x, y)\n\n4. Remove edge (3, 4):\n```\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\nEdges: {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n```\nT_G(3,4)(x, y) = T_G(1,2)(x, y) + T_G(1,3)(x, y) + T_G(2,3)(x, y)\n\nNow, we have 4 forests with 3 components and no loops, so the Tutte polynomial for each of them is x^2 * y^0 = x^2.\n\nFinally, the Tutte polynomial of the graph G is:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 = 4x^2"
