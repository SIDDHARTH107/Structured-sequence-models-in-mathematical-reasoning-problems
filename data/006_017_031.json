    "message_1": "Suppose that accidents occur randomly along a certain stretch of road, and that the probability of an accident occurring at any given point is 0.02. If the stretch of road is 5 km long, what is the probability that at least one accident will occur on this stretch of road?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will first find the probability that no accidents occur on this stretch of road and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring.\n\nLet's assume that the stretch of road is divided into 5 equal segments of 1 km each. The probability of no accident occurring in a 1 km segment is (1 - 0.02) = 0.98.\n\nNow, for no accidents to occur on the entire 5 km stretch of road, there should be no accidents in each of the 5 segments. The probability of this happening is the product of the probabilities of no accidents in each segment:\n\nP(no accidents in 5 km) = 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.98^5 ≈ 0.9039\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we subtract the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\nP(at least one accident in 5 km) = 1 - P(no accidents in 5 km) = 1 - 0.9039 ≈ 0.0961\n\nSo, the probability that at least one accident will occur on this 5 km stretch of road is approximately 0.0961 or 9.61%."
