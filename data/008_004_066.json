    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n| 2 -1  4 | 0\n|-3  5 -1 | 0\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get the matrix into its row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n| 2 -1  4 | 0\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n|-3  5 -1 | 0\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-1/2) * Row 1 + Row 2:\n\n|  2  -1   4 | 0\n|  0   1.5 -5 | 0\n| -3   5  -1 | 0\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (3/2) * Row 1 + Row 3:\n\n|  2  -1   4 | 0\n|  0  1.5 -5 | 0\n|  0   3.5 -5 | 0\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (-7/3) * Row 2 + Row 3:\n\n|  2  -1   4 | 0\n|  0  1.5 -5 | 0\n|  0   0   0 | 0\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix:\n\n|  2  -1   4 | 0\n|  0  1.5 -5 | 0\n|  0   0   0 | 0\n\nFrom the second row, we have the equation:\n\n1.5y - 5z = 0\n\nDivide by 1.5:\n\ny - (10/3)z = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we have the equation:\n\n2x - y + 4z = 0\n\nSince there is no unique solution for z, we can express the solution in terms of z:\n\nLet z = t, where t is any real number.\n\nThen, y = (10/3)t\n\nSubstitute y into the first equation:\n\n2x - (10/3)t + 4t = 0\n\n2x = (10/3)t - 4t\n\n2x = (2/3)t\n\nx = (1/3)t\n\nSo, the solution to the system of homogeneous linear equations is:\n\nx = (1/3)t\ny = (10/3)t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
