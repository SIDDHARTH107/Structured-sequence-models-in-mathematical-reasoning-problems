Determine a degree sequence for this graph that satisfies the following conditions: \n\n- It is graphical, meaning that there exists a graph with this degree sequence.\n- Each vertex has degree between 1 and 4, inclusive.\n- No two vertices have the same degree.",
    "message_2": "To satisfy the conditions, we can create a degree sequence as follows:\n\n1. It is graphical: A degree sequence is graphical if it satisfies the Handshaking Lemma (sum of all degrees is even) and the Havel-Hakimi theorem (removing the highest degree vertex and decreasing the degrees of its neighbors results in another graphical sequence).\n\n2. Each vertex has degree between 1 and 4, inclusive.\n\n3. No two vertices have the same degree.\n\nLet's create a degree sequence that satisfies these conditions:\n\nDegree sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3\n\nThis sequence satisfies the Handshaking Lemma since the sum of all degrees is 14, which is even. Now, let's check if it satisfies the Havel-Hakimi theorem:\n\n1. Remove the highest degree vertex (4) and decrease the degrees of its neighbors by 1:\n\nNew sequence: 0, 1, 2, 0, 2\n\n2. Remove the next highest degree vertex (2) and decrease the degrees of its neighbors by 1:\n\nNew sequence: 0, 0, 0, 1\n\n3. Remove the next highest degree vertex (1) and decrease the degrees of its neighbors by 1:\n\nNew sequence: 0, 0, 0\n\nThe sequence has been reduced to all zeros, which means it is graphical according to the Havel-Hakimi theorem. Additionally, the degree sequence has each vertex with a degree between 1 and 4, inclusive, and no two vertices have the same degree.\n\nThus, the degree sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3 satisfies all the given conditions."
