    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 6x^2 + 11x - 10, we can use the \"ac method\" or \"factoring by grouping.\"\n\nStep 1: Multiply the leading coefficient (6) and the constant term (-10) to get -60.\n\nStep 2: Find two numbers that multiply to -60 and add up to the middle coefficient (11). These numbers are 15 and -4.\n\nStep 3: Rewrite the middle term (11x) as the sum of the two numbers found in step 2: 6x^2 + 15x - 4x - 10.\n\nStep 4: Factor by grouping. Group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(6x^2 + 15x) + (-4x - 10).\n\nStep 5: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group:\n\n3x(2x + 5) - 2(2x + 5).\n\nStep 6: Notice that (2x + 5) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:\n\n(2x + 5)(3x - 2).\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 6x^2 + 11x - 10 is (2x + 5)(3x - 2)."
