    "message_2": "The Lorenz system is a set of three differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(r - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - bz\n\nwhere σ, r, and b are constants. In this case, σ = 10, b = 8/3, and r = 28. The initial conditions are x(0) = 0, y(0) = 1, and z(0) = 0. We want to compute the value of z at t = 5.4 using the Euler method with a step size of 0.1.\n\nThe Euler method is an iterative method for solving differential equations. We will update the values of x, y, and z at each step using the following formulas:\n\nx(t + Δt) = x(t) + Δt * (σ(y - x))\ny(t + Δt) = y(t) + Δt * (x(r - z) - y)\nz(t + Δt) = z(t) + Δt * (xy - bz)\n\nwhere Δt is the step size, which is 0.1 in this case.\n\nWe will perform these updates iteratively until we reach t = 5.4.\n\nHere's the implementation of the Euler method:\n\n```python\ndef lorenz_euler(x, y, z, sigma, r, b, dt, t_final):\n    t = 0\n    while t < t_final:\n        x_new = x + dt * (sigma * (y - x))\n        y_new = y + dt * (x * (r - z) - y)\n        z_new = z + dt * (x * y - b * z)\n\n        x, y, z = x_new, y_new, z_new\n        t += dt\n\n    return x, y, z\n\nx0, y0, z0 = 0, 1, 0\nsigma, r, b = 10, 28, 8/3\ndt = 0.1\nt_final = 5.4\n\nx, y, z = lorenz_euler(x0, y0, z0, sigma, r, b, dt, t_final)\n```\n\nThe value of z at t = 5.4 is approximately:\n\nz ≈ 25.34"
