    "message_2": "To determine the Chern classes of the tangent bundle $T_M$ of a non-singular complex projective curve M of degree d in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we can use the adjunction formula and the fact that the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ has known Chern classes.\n\nFirst, recall that the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is given by $T_{\\mathbb{P}^2} \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^2}(1)^{\\oplus 3}$, and its first Chern class is $c_1(T_{\\mathbb{P}^2}) = 3H$, where $H$ is the hyperplane class.\n\nNow, let $i: M \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{P}^2$ be the inclusion map of the curve M into $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The normal bundle of M in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is given by $N_{M/\\mathbb{P}^2} = \\mathcal{O}_M(d)$, where $d$ is the degree of the curve.\n\nThe adjunction formula relates the tangent bundle of M, the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{P}^2$, and the normal bundle of M in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ as follows:\n\n$$T_M = i^*T_{\\mathbb{P}^2} \\otimes N_{M/\\mathbb{P}^2}^*$$\n\nNow, we can compute the first Chern class of $T_M$:\n\n$$c_1(T_M) = i^*c_1(T_{\\mathbb{P}^2}) - c_1(N_{M/\\mathbb{P}^2}) = i^*(3H) - dH = (3-d)H$$\n\nSince M is a curve, its tangent bundle is a rank 2 vector bundle, and thus it has only two Chern classes: $c_0(T_M) = 1$ and $c_1(T_M) = (3-d)H$. The second Chern class $c_2(T_M)$ is not relevant in this case, as it would correspond to a rank 3 or higher vector bundle."
