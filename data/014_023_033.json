    "message_1": "In a Rail Fence cipher with a key of 4, the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" was encrypted into the following ciphertext: \"MEAHTMTASCI\". Using cryptanalysis techniques for Rail Fence cipher, can you determine the key used to encrypt the plaintext and decrypt the ciphertext to reveal the original message?",
    "message_2": "Yes, we can determine the key used to encrypt the plaintext and decrypt the ciphertext to reveal the original message. In this case, the key is already given as 4. To decrypt the ciphertext \"MEAHTMTASCI\" using the Rail Fence cipher with a key of 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of rows (which is equal to the key) and the number of columns. In this case, there are 4 rows and the number of columns can be calculated by dividing the length of the ciphertext (11) by the key (4) and rounding up: ceil(11/4) = 3 columns.\n\n2. Create a zigzag pattern with the given number of rows and columns:\n\n   M . . . E . . . A\n   . H . T . M . T .\n   . . A . . . S . .\n   . . . C . . . I .\n\n3. Fill in the ciphertext characters in the zigzag pattern:\n\n   M . . . E . . . A\n   . H . T . M . T .\n   . . A . . . S . .\n   . . . C . . . I .\n\n4. Read the plaintext message by following the zigzag pattern from the top-left corner:\n\n   M A T H E M A T I C S\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext message is \"MATHEMATICS\"."
