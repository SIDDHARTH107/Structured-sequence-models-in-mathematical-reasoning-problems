    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(2x) = 1 for x, where x is between 0 and 360 degrees, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\nsin(2x) = 1/2\n\n2. Take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides:\n2x = arcsin(1/2)\n\n3. Find the value of arcsin(1/2):\n2x = 30° (since sin(30°) = 1/2)\n\n4. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\nx = 15°\n\nHowever, since the sine function is periodic with a period of 360°, we need to consider all possible solutions for x within the given range (0 to 360 degrees). The sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants, so we need to find the corresponding angle in the second quadrant as well:\n\n5. Find the supplementary angle in the second quadrant:\n180° - 30° = 150°\n\n6. Divide by 2 to find the corresponding x value:\nx = 75°\n\nSo, the two solutions for x within the given range are x = 15° and x = 75°."
