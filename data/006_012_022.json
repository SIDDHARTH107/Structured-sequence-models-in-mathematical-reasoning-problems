    "message_2": "To find the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood with 100 houses, we can use the historical average of 5 burglaries per month. \n\nProbability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood = (Number of burglaries per month) / (Total number of houses)\n\nProbability = 5 burglaries / 100 houses\n\nProbability = 0.05 or 5%\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood with 100 houses is 5%."
