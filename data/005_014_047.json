    "message_1": "A researcher wants to study the relationship between students' academic performance and their study habits. The researcher conducted a survey asking students about their study habits and obtained data on the number of hours they studied per week, the number of study sessions they had in a week, and their overall academic performance measured using their GPA (Grade Point Average) scores. \n\nUsing Factor Analysis, the researcher wants to determine if there is any underlying factor influencing study habits that can explain why some students have higher GPAs than others. \n\nThe researcher has computed the correlation matrix among study habits variables and wants to extract factors using the Principal Component method. The researcher has decided to retain only the factors that have an Eigenvalue greater than 1.\n\nThe correlation matrix is shown below:\n\n|Variable|Study hours per week|Number of study sessions per week|GPA|\n|--------|-------------------|---------------------------------|---|\n|Study hours per week|1.00|0.80|0.65|\n|Number of study sessions per week|0.80|1.00|0.55|\n|GPA|0.65|0.55|1.00|\n\nWhat are the number of factors to be extracted using Principal Component Method?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of factors to be extracted using the Principal Component Method, we need to calculate the Eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. The Eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each factor. We will retain only the factors with an Eigenvalue greater than 1.\n\nThe correlation matrix is:\n\n| 1.00 | 0.80 | 0.65 |\n|------|------|------|\n| 0.80 | 1.00 | 0.55 |\n| 0.65 | 0.55 | 1.00 |\n\nCalculating the Eigenvalues of this matrix, we get:\n\nEigenvalue 1: 2.49\nEigenvalue 2: 0.43\nEigenvalue 3: 0.08\n\nSince the researcher has decided to retain only the factors with an Eigenvalue greater than 1, we will retain only the first factor (Eigenvalue 1: 2.49).\n\nTherefore, the number of factors to be extracted using the Principal Component Method is 1."
