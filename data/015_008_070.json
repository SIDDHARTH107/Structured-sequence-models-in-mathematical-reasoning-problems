    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by Î´, is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 4.6692016091. It is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcations in dynamical systems, specifically in the logistic map model. The value of the Feigenbaum constant does not depend on the bifurcation parameter (r) value, such as 3.55 in this case. The constant remains the same, approximately 4.6692016091, regardless of the specific parameter value."
