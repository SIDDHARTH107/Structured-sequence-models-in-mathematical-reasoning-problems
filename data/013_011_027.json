    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, producing identical products. Each firm has to set a price for its product. The market demand for the product is given by the equation, Q = 100 - P (where Q is the demand and P is the price). If both firms set the same price, they split the market equally. However, if they set different prices, the firm with the lower price captures the entire market. \n\nSuppose the firms have to choose between two prices, $10 and $15. What price should each firm set to maximize its profit, and what will be the resulting profits for each firm?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible outcomes for each firm based on the prices they set.\n\n1. Both firms set a price of $10:\nIn this case, they will split the market equally. The demand will be Q = 100 - 10 = 90. Each firm will have a demand of 45 units. The profit for each firm will be Price × Quantity = $10 × 45 = $450.\n\n2. Both firms set a price of $15:\nIn this case, they will also split the market equally. The demand will be Q = 100 - 15 = 85. Each firm will have a demand of 42.5 units. The profit for each firm will be Price × Quantity = $15 × 42.5 = $637.50.\n\n3. Firm A sets a price of $10, and Firm B sets a price of $15:\nIn this case, Firm A will capture the entire market since its price is lower. The demand for Firm A will be Q = 100 - 10 = 90, and the profit will be $10 × 90 = $900. Firm B will have no demand and a profit of $0.\n\n4. Firm A sets a price of $15, and Firm B sets a price of $10:\nIn this case, Firm B will capture the entire market since its price is lower. The demand for Firm B will be Q = 100 - 10 = 90, and the profit will be $10 × 90 = $900. Firm A will have no demand and a profit of $0.\n\nNow let's analyze the best strategy for each firm:\n\nFor Firm A:\n- If Firm A sets a price of $10, it will either earn $450 (if Firm B also sets a price of $10) or $900 (if Firm B sets a price of $15).\n- If Firm A sets a price of $15, it will either earn $637.50 (if Firm B also sets a price of $15) or $0 (if Firm B sets a price of $10).\n\nFor Firm B:\n- If Firm B sets a price of $10, it will either earn $450 (if Firm A also sets a price of $10) or $900 (if Firm A sets a price of $15).\n- If Firm B sets a price of $15, it will either earn $637.50 (if Firm A also sets a price of $15) or $0 (if Firm A sets a price of $10).\n\nTo maximize their profits, both firms should set a price of $10. In this case, each firm will have a guaranteed profit of $450, which is higher than the worst-case scenario of earning $0 if they set a price of $15 and the other firm sets a price of $10. The resulting profits for each firm will be $450."
