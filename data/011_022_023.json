    "message_1": "A student is going on a trip and has a backpack that can hold a maximum of 10 kg. The student has 5 items to pack with weights of 2 kg, 3 kg, 4 kg, 5 kg, and 6 kg respectively. What is the maximum weight the student can pack in the backpack using the Knapsack problem?",
    "message_2": "To solve the Knapsack problem, we need to find the combination of items that gives the maximum value without exceeding the weight capacity of the backpack. In this case, the weight capacity is 10 kg, and we have 5 items with weights 2 kg, 3 kg, 4 kg, 5 kg, and 6 kg.\n\nLet's consider all possible combinations of items:\n\n1. 2 kg + 3 kg = 5 kg (total weight)\n2. 2 kg + 4 kg = 6 kg\n3. 2 kg + 5 kg = 7 kg\n4. 2 kg + 6 kg = 8 kg\n5. 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg\n6. 3 kg + 5 kg = 8 kg\n7. 3 kg + 6 kg = 9 kg\n8. 4 kg + 5 kg = 9 kg\n9. 4 kg + 6 kg = 10 kg\n10. 5 kg + 6 kg = 11 kg (exceeds the weight capacity)\n\nThe combination with the maximum weight that does not exceed the backpack's capacity is the 9th combination (4 kg + 6 kg), which has a total weight of 10 kg. Therefore, the maximum weight the student can pack in the backpack is 10 kg."
