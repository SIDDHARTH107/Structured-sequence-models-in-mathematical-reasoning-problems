    "message_1": "In a dictator game, player A is given $100 to split between themselves and player B. What is the Nash equilibrium in this scenario and how much money is player A likely to give to player B?",
    "message_2": "In a dictator game, there is no Nash equilibrium because it is a one-sided decision-making process. Player A has full control over the allocation of the $100 and player B has no influence on the decision. Therefore, the concept of Nash equilibrium, which involves each player making their best decision given the decisions of others, does not apply in this scenario.\n\nThe amount of money player A is likely to give to player B depends on player A's preferences and sense of fairness. In practice, the amount given to player B can vary widely, from nothing to a significant portion of the $100. There is no specific prediction for how much player A will give to player B in this game."
