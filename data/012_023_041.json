    "message_2": "To find the maximum size of a complete subgraph or clique, we need to identify the largest set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Let's analyze the given edges:\n\nVertices A, B, C, D, and E are all connected to each other:\n- A is connected to B, C, D, and E.\n- B is connected to A, C, D, and E.\n- C is connected to A, B, D, and E.\n- D is connected to A, B, C, and E.\n- E is connected to A, B, C, and D.\n\nTherefore, we have a complete subgraph or clique of size 5, which includes vertices A, B, C, D, and E. There are no larger cliques in this graph, as vertices F and G are only connected to D and F, respectively.\n\nSo, the maximum size of a complete subgraph or clique that can be formed from this graph is 5."
