    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles. So, after 9 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^number of iterations\nLength = 1 * 2^9\nLength = 1 * 512\nLength = 512 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after 9 iterations is 512 units."
