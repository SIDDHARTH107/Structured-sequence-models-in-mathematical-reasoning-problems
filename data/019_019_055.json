    "message_2": "A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts the language of all binary strings that end with 101 requires a minimum of 4 states. Here's a description of the DFA:\n\n1. State q0: The initial state. If a 1 is read, move to state q1. If a 0 is read, stay in state q0.\n2. State q1: If a 0 is read, move to state q2. If a 1 is read, stay in state q1.\n3. State q2: If a 1 is read, move to state q3 (the accepting state). If a 0 is read, move back to state q0.\n4. State q3: The accepting state. If a 1 is read, move back to state q1. If a 0 is read, move to state q2.\n\nThis DFA has 4 states and can recognize all binary strings that end with 101."
