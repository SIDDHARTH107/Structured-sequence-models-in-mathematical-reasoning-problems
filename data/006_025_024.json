    "message_1": "A magician has 6 red balls, 8 blue balls and 10 yellow balls in his bag. He randomly selects a ball from the bag and tosses it in the air. What is the probability of selecting a red ball and tossing it in the air?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a red ball, we need to divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls in the bag.\n\nTotal number of balls = 6 red balls + 8 blue balls + 10 yellow balls = 24 balls\n\nProbability of selecting a red ball = (Number of red balls) / (Total number of balls) = 6/24\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability of selecting a red ball = 1/4 or 0.25\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a red ball and tossing it in the air is 1/4 or 25%."
