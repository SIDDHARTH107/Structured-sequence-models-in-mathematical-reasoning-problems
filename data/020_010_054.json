    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nA shipping company operates a fleet of trucks that carry packages of different weights from one city to another. Each truck can carry a maximum weight limit of 10,000 kg. The weight of the packages can vary up to ± 5% of the predicted weight. The company is designing a robust transportation plan that ensures that no truck is overloaded, even when the weight of the packages varies. \n\nIf the company needs to transport 100 packages with an average predicted weight of 50 kg each, what is the maximum weight deviation that the company can tolerate from the predicted weight to ensure that no truck is overloaded?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many packages can be carried by a single truck without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nThe total weight of 100 packages with an average predicted weight of 50 kg each is:\n100 * 50 kg = 5000 kg\n\nThe maximum weight limit of a truck is 10,000 kg. So, let's find out how many packages a truck can carry without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nLet x be the number of packages a truck can carry. Then, the total weight of the packages on the truck would be 50x kg. We want to find the maximum x such that 50x ≤ 10,000 kg.\n\n50x ≤ 10,000\nx ≤ 200\n\nSo, a truck can carry up to 200 packages without exceeding the weight limit. However, since the weight of the packages can vary up to ± 5% of the predicted weight, we need to take this into account to ensure that no truck is overloaded.\n\nLet's find the maximum weight deviation that the company can tolerate. Let d be the maximum weight deviation in kg. Then, the total weight of the packages on the truck, including the deviation, would be (50 + d)x kg. We want to find the maximum d such that (50 + d)x ≤ 10,000 kg for x = 200.\n\n(50 + d) * 200 ≤ 10,000\n10,000 + 200d ≤ 10,000\n\n200d ≤ 0\nd ≤ 0\n\nSince the weight deviation cannot be negative, the maximum weight deviation that the company can tolerate is 0 kg. This means that the company must ensure that the actual weight of the packages does not deviate from the predicted weight to prevent overloading the trucks."
