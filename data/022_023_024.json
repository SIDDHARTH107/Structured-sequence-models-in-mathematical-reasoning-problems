    "message_2": "The given wave equation is a superposition of two waves with different frequencies. To find the frequencies of these waves, we need to look at the coefficients of the time variable $t$ in the arguments of the cosine and sine functions.\n\nFor the first wave, we have $3x - 6t$. The coefficient of $t$ is $-6$. The angular frequency $\\omega_1$ is given by the absolute value of this coefficient, so $\\omega_1 = 6$.\n\nFor the second wave, we have $6x + 12t$. The coefficient of $t$ is $12$. The angular frequency $\\omega_2$ is given by the absolute value of this coefficient, so $\\omega_2 = 12$.\n\nNow, we can find the frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ of these waves using the relation between angular frequency and frequency: $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n\nFor the first wave, we have $f_1 = \\frac{\\omega_1}{2\\pi} = \\frac{6}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\nFor the second wave, we have $f_2 = \\frac{\\omega_2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{12}{2\\pi} = \\frac{6}{\\pi}$.\n\nSo, the frequencies of the waves traveling on this cable are $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$ and $\\frac{6}{\\pi}$."
