The Fourier transform of the signal is given as follows:\n\nF(w) = ∫[0,∞] f(t)*e^(-jwt) dt\n\nwhere `j` is the imaginary unit and `w` is the frequency.\n\nCalculate the Fourier transform of the signal `f(t) = 3t^2 - 5t + 2` using the definition of Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the signal f(t) = 3t^2 - 5t + 2, we will substitute f(t) into the definition of the Fourier transform and then evaluate the integral.\n\nF(w) = ∫[0,∞] (3t^2 - 5t + 2) * e^(-jwt) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can break it up into three separate integrals:\n\nF(w) = ∫[0,∞] 3t^2 * e^(-jwt) dt - ∫[0,∞] 5t * e^(-jwt) dt + ∫[0,∞] 2 * e^(-jwt) dt\n\nNow, we will solve each integral separately using integration by parts.\n\nFor the first integral, let u = t^2 and dv = e^(-jwt) dt.\nThen, du = 2t dt and v = -1/(jw) * e^(-jwt).\n\n∫[0,∞] 3t^2 * e^(-jwt) dt = 3 * [-t^2 * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) - ∫[0,∞] -2t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) dt]\n\nFor the second integral in the first integral, let u = t and dv = e^(-jwt) dt.\nThen, du = dt and v = -1/(jw) * e^(-jwt).\n\n∫[0,∞] -2t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) dt = -2/(jw) * [-t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) - ∫[0,∞] -1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) dt]\n\nNow, we can solve the third integral in the second integral:\n\n∫[0,∞] -1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) dt = -1/(jw) * [-1/(jw) * e^(-jwt)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nPlugging this back into the second integral:\n\n∫[0,∞] -2t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) dt = -2/(jw) * [-t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) + 1/(jw^2) * e^(-jwt)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nAnd plugging this back into the first integral:\n\n∫[0,∞] 3t^2 * e^(-jwt) dt = 3 * [-t^2 * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) + 2t/(jw^2) * e^(-jwt) - 2/(jw^3) * e^(-jwt)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can solve the second and third integrals in the original expression for F(w):\n\n∫[0,∞] 5t * e^(-jwt) dt = 5 * [-t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) + 1/(jw^2) * e^(-jwt)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\n∫[0,∞] 2 * e^(-jwt) dt = 2 * [-1/(jw) * e^(-jwt)] evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can plug these results back into the original expression for F(w):\n\nF(w) = 3 * [-t^2 * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) + 2t/(jw^2) * e^(-jwt) - 2/(jw^3) * e^(-jwt)] - 5 * [-t * 1/(jw) * e^(-jwt) + 1/(jw^2) * e^(-jwt)] + 2 * [-1/(jw) * e^(-jwt)]\n\nFinally, we will evaluate each term at the limits of integration (0 and ∞):\n\nF(w) = 3 * [0 - 0 + 2/(jw^3)] - 5 * [0 + 1/(jw^2)] + 2 * [0]\n\nF(w) = 6/(jw^3) - 5/(jw^2)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the signal f(t) = 3t^2 - 5t + 2."
