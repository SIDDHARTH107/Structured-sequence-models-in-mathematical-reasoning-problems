    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the home team scoring exactly 2 goals in the game, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of scoring exactly k goals\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of goals attempted)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of goals scored)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of scoring a goal, which is 0.6)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of not scoring a goal, which is 0.4)\n\nHowever, we need to know the total number of goals attempted (n) in the game to use this formula. Without this information, we cannot calculate the probability of the home team scoring exactly 2 goals."
