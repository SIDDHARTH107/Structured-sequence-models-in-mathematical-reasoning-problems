    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these Cartesian products.\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal, as they both result in the same set of ordered pairs. However, this does not mean that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union.\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union, we need to show that A × B ≠ B × A. From our calculations above, we can see that:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nA × B and B × A are not equal, as their ordered pairs are different. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
