    "message_2": "To determine the singular points of the surface defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z are all simultaneously zero.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2 - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n3z^2 - 3xy = 0\n\nDivide each equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\nz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible solutions:\n\n1. If x = 0, then from the first equation, yz = 0, which implies either y = 0 or z = 0.\n2. If y = 0, then from the second equation, xz = 0, which implies either x = 0 or z = 0.\n3. If z = 0, then from the third equation, xy = 0, which implies either x = 0 or y = 0.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the singular points are when at least two of the variables are equal to zero. Therefore, the singular points are (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, z), (0, y, 0), and (x, 0, 0)."
