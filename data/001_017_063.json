    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+3) - log2(x-1) = 4, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the subtraction property of logarithms, which states that logb(a) - logb(c) = logb(a/c). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\nlog2((x+3)/(x-1)) = 4\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form. This gives us:\n\n2^4 = (x+3)/(x-1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n16 = (x+3)/(x-1)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x-1):\n\n16(x-1) = x+3\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n16x - 16 = x + 3\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n15x - 16 = 3\n\nAdding 16 to both sides, we get:\n\n15x = 19\n\nFinally, dividing by 15, we get:\n\nx = 19/15\n\nSo the solution to the equation is x = 19/15."
