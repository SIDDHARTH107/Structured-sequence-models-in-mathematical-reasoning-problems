    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p, or in other words, (p-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p).\n\nGiven x = 7, we want to check if Wilson's theorem holds. Since 7 is a prime number, we can apply the theorem:\n\n(7-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n6! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we compute 6!:\n\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nSo, we have:\n\n720 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\n721 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nChecking if 721 is divisible by 7:\n\n721 ÷ 7 = 103\n\nSince 721 is divisible by 7, we can conclude that:\n\n721 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nThus, Wilson's theorem holds for x = 7."
