    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-k)!]\n\nHere, n = 7 and k = 5. So, we have:\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4! * 2!)\n\nC(6, 4) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / [(4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)]\n\nC(6, 4) = (720) / (24 * 2)\n\nC(6, 4) = 720 / 48\n\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nSo, the value in the 7th row and 5th column of Pascal's triangle is 15."
