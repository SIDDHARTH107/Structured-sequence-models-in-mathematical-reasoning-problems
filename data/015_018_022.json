    "message_2": "The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear oscillator described by the equation:\n\nx''(t) + δx'(t) + αx(t) + βx(t)^3 = γcos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, δ is the damping coefficient, α is the linear stiffness, β is the nonlinearity parameter, γ is the amplitude of the external force, and ω is the angular frequency of the external force.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the nonlinearity parameter (β = 0.5), the angular frequency (ω = 1.2), the initial displacement (x(0) = 0.5), and the initial velocity (x'(0) = 0.8). However, we do not have enough information to determine the amplitude of the Duffing oscillator. We would need more information about the other parameters (α, δ, and γ) or a specific solution to the equation to find the amplitude."
