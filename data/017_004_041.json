    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which is 25/5 = 5.\n\nThe only possibility for n_5 that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup in G, say H. Since H is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of G/H is 25/5 = 5. Thus, G/H is a cyclic group of order 5, say generated by the coset gH.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then we are done, as this is one of the possibilities we wanted to show.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then there must be an element x in G that is not in H and does not generate G. Since the order of G is 25, the order of x must be either 1, 5, or 25. The order cannot be 1, as x would be the identity element, and it cannot be 25, as G is not cyclic. Thus, the order of x must be 5.\n\nLet K be the subgroup of G generated by x. Then K is a cyclic group of order 5. Since the order of H is 5 and the order of K is 5, and both are prime, H and K must be disjoint except for the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from H and K, say hk, where h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Since H is normal in G, we have that hkh⁻¹ ∈ K. Thus, the product of elements from H and K generates a subgroup of G, which we will denote as L.\n\nThe order of L can be computed using the formula |L| = (|H| * |K|) / |H ∩ K|. Since |H| = |K| = 5 and |H ∩ K| = 1 (as they only share the identity element), we have |L| = (5 * 5) / 1 = 25. Since |L| = |G|, we have that L = G.\n\nTherefore, G is generated by the elements of H and K, and since H and K are both cyclic groups of order 5, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, which is the second possibility we wanted to show.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
