So, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 5 is:\n\nv1 = [1, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[3 - (-1), 2], [4, 1 - (-1)]])v2 = 0\n([[4, 2], [4, 2]])v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n4x1 + 2x2 = 0\n4x1 + 2x2 = 0\n\nBoth equations are equivalent, so we can use just one of them:\n\n4x1 + 2x2 = 0\n\nLet x1 = 1, then x2 = -2. So, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = -1 is:\n\nv2 = [1, -2]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 5, Eigenvector v1 = [1, 1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = -1, Eigenvector v2 = [1, -2]"
