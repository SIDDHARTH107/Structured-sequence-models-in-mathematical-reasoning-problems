The intuitionistic implication operator → is defined as follows: A → B is true if and only if there is no proof of A and a disproof of B. If A is true, then A → B is also true for any proposition B. If B is false, then A → B is also true for any proposition A. Assume that A is false and B is true. What can we say about A → B?",
    "message_2": "Since A is false and B is true, there is no proof of A and no disproof of B. According to the definition of the intuitionistic implication operator →, A → B is true if and only if there is no proof of A and a disproof of B. In this case, there is no proof of A and no disproof of B, so A → B is true."
