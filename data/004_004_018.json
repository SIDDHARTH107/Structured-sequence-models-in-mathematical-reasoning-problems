    "message_2": "To solve this problem using integration, we need to find a function that represents the shape of the trapezium. Since the trapezium has parallel sides of length 10m and 15m, we can represent it as a linear function.\n\nLet's consider the trapezium to be on the coordinate plane with one of the parallel sides lying on the x-axis. Let the vertices of the trapezium be A(0, 0), B(10, 0), C(x2, 8), and D(x1, 8), where x1 and x2 are the x-coordinates of points C and D, respectively.\n\nThe slope of the line passing through points A and D is (8 - 0) / (x1 - 0) = 8 / x1. Similarly, the slope of the line passing through points B and C is (8 - 0) / (x2 - 10) = 8 / (x2 - 10).\n\nSince the lines AD and BC are parallel, their slopes are equal:\n\n8 / x1 = 8 / (x2 - 10)\n\nx1 = x2 - 10\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of points C and D. Since the length of the parallel side AD is 10m and the length of the parallel side BC is 15m, we can use the following equations:\n\nx1 = 0 + 10 = 10\nx2 = 10 + 15 = 25\n\nNow we have the coordinates of points C and D: C(25, 8) and D(10, 8).\n\nThe equation of the line passing through points A and D is:\n\ny = (8 / 10) * x\n\nThe equation of the line passing through points B and C is:\n\ny = (8 / 15) * (x - 10)\n\nNow we can set up the integral to find the area of the trapezium:\n\nArea = ∫[y2 - y1] dx from x = 0 to x = 10 + ∫[y2 - y1] dx from x = 10 to x = 25\n\nArea = ∫[(8 / 15) * (x - 10) - (8 / 10) * x] dx from x = 0 to x = 10 + ∫[(8 / 15) * (x - 10) - (8 / 10) * x] dx from x = 10 to x = 25\n\nArea = ∫[-(2 / 30) * x + (8 / 15) * 10] dx from x = 0 to x = 10 + ∫[(8 / 15) * (x - 10)] dx from x = 10 to x = 25\n\nArea = [-(1 / 15) * x^2 + (8 / 15) * 10 * x] from 0 to 10 + [(4 / 15) * (x - 10)^2] from 10 to 25\n\nArea = [-(1 / 15) * 100 + (8 / 15) * 10 * 10] - [0] + [(4 / 15) * (15)^2] - [(4 / 15) * (0)]\n\nArea = (-100 / 15 + 800 / 15) + (4 / 15) * 225\n\nArea = (700 / 15) + (900 / 15)\n\nArea = 1600 / 15\n\nArea = 320 / 3 square meters\n\nSo, the total area of the field is 320/3 square meters."
