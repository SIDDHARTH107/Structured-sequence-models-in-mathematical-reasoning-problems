    "message_2": "To find the image of the unit disc under the Riemann map corresponding to f(z), we first need to find the boundary of the image. The boundary of the unit disc is given by the circle |z| = 1. We can parameterize this circle using z = e^(iθ), where θ is a real parameter in the range [0, 2π).\n\nNow, let's find the image of the boundary under f(z):\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^2 - 3e^(iθ) + 2\n= e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2\n\nTo find the image of the unit disc, we need to find the region enclosed by the curve traced by f(e^(iθ)) as θ varies from 0 to 2π. To do this, we can find the critical points of f(z) and check if they lie inside the unit disc.\n\nThe critical points of f(z) are the solutions to f'(z) = 0:\n\nf'(z) = 2z - 3\n2z - 3 = 0\nz = 3/2\n\nSince 3/2 is not in the unit disc, there are no critical points of f(z) inside the unit disc. Therefore, the image of the unit disc under f(z) is simply the region enclosed by the curve traced by f(e^(iθ)) as θ varies from 0 to 2π.\n\nTo find this region, we can consider the real and imaginary parts of f(e^(iθ)):\n\nRe(f(e^(iθ))) = e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2 = (cos(2θ) - 3cos(θ) + 2) + i(sin(2θ) - 3sin(θ))\n\nIm(f(e^(iθ))) = sin(2θ) - 3sin(θ)\n\nNow, we can plot the curve traced by f(e^(iθ)) in the complex plane as θ varies from 0 to 2π. The image of the unit disc under the Riemann map corresponding to f(z) will be the region enclosed by this curve.\n\nUnfortunately, finding an explicit description of this region is not straightforward, as the curve is not a simple geometric shape. However, we can approximate the region numerically or graphically using software tools like Mathematica or MATLAB."
