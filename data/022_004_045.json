    "message_2": "To find the nature and classification of the singularity at z=4 for the function f(z) = 1/((z-4)^3 * sin(z)), we first need to identify the type of singularity at z=4.\n\nThere are three types of singularities: removable, pole, and essential.\n\n1. Removable singularity: If the function can be redefined at the singular point such that it becomes analytic, then the singularity is removable.\n\n2. Pole: If the function has a non-removable singularity and can be written as a quotient of two analytic functions, where the denominator has a zero of order m at the singular point, then the singularity is a pole of order m.\n\n3. Essential singularity: If the singularity is neither removable nor a pole, then it is an essential singularity.\n\nNow, let's analyze the function f(z) = 1/((z-4)^3 * sin(z)) at z=4.\n\nAt z=4, the function has a singularity because the denominator becomes zero. The function can be written as a quotient of two analytic functions:\n\nf(z) = g(z)/h(z), where g(z) = 1 and h(z) = (z-4)^3 * sin(z).\n\nThe function h(z) has a zero of order 3 at z=4 due to the (z-4)^3 term. Since sin(z) is an entire function (analytic everywhere), the zero at z=4 is not affected by the sin(z) term.\n\nTherefore, the singularity at z=4 is a pole of order 3."
