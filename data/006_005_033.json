    "message_1": "A bakery makes an average of 10 cakes per hour. If a customer arrives at the bakery and wants to buy a cake, what is the probability that the customer will have to wait 7 minutes or less for a cake to be available? Assume that the time between making cakes follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 6 minutes.",
    "message_2": "Let X be the time between making cakes, which follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 6 minutes. The probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is given by:\n\nf(x) = (1/λ) * e^(-x/λ)\n\nwhere λ is the mean of the distribution. In this case, λ = 6 minutes.\n\nWe want to find the probability that the customer will have to wait 7 minutes or less for a cake to be available, which is equivalent to finding the probability that X ≤ 7. To do this, we need to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution, which is given by:\n\nF(x) = 1 - e^(-x/λ)\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the customer will have to wait 7 minutes or less:\n\nP(X ≤ 7) = F(7) = 1 - e^(-7/6)\n\nP(X ≤ 7) ≈ 1 - e^(-1.1667) ≈ 1 - 0.3125 ≈ 0.6875\n\nSo, the probability that the customer will have to wait 7 minutes or less for a cake to be available is approximately 68.75%."
