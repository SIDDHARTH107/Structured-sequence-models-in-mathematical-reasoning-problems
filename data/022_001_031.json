    "message_2": "To find the values of f(z) as z approaches 1, we can first simplify the function by factoring the numerator:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - 1) = ((z - 1)(z + 1))/(z - 1)\n\nSince z ≠ 1, we can cancel out the (z - 1) terms:\n\nf(z) = z + 1\n\nNow, let's find the values of f(z) as z approaches 1 from below, from above, and along the real line.\n\n1. As z approaches 1 from below (on the real line), we have:\n\nz → 1^(-) => f(z) = (1^-) + 1 = 1\n\n2. As z approaches 1 from above (on the real line), we have:\n\nz → 1^(+) => f(z) = (1^+) + 1 = 1\n\n3. Along the real line, as z approaches 1, we have:\n\nz → 1 => f(z) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nIn all cases, the value of f(z) approaches 2 as z approaches 1."
