    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x² + 4x - 1) / (2x² - 5x + 2) as x approaches 2, we can simply substitute the value of x into the function and simplify:\n\nf(2) = (3(2)² + 4(2) - 1) / (2(2)² - 5(2) + 2)\n\nf(2) = (3(4) + 8 - 1) / (2(4) - 10 + 2)\n\nf(2) = (12 + 8 - 1) / (8 - 10 + 2)\n\nf(2) = (19) / (0)\n\nSince the denominator is zero, the limit does not exist."
