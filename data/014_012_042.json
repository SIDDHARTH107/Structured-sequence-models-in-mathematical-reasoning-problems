    "message_1": "Suppose you are using the Vigenere cipher with a keyword of \"MATH\" to encrypt a plaintext message that reads, \"THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG\". What is the ciphertext that you would obtain?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG\" using the Vigenere cipher with a keyword of \"MATH\", we first remove the spaces and then repeat the keyword to match the length of the plaintext message:\n\nPlaintext:  THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG\nKeyword:    MATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMATHMATHM\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere cipher table to find the corresponding ciphertext for each letter. The table is a 26x26 grid of letters, where the row represents the plaintext letter, and the column represents the keyword letter. The intersection of the row and column gives the ciphertext letter.\n\nCiphertext: WIQCEXGVRTTOSYDCYWIYTYWYXQYQXQYQXQYQX\n\nSo, the ciphertext obtained using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\" for the given plaintext message is \"WIQCEXGVRTTOSYDCYWIYTYWYXQYQXQYQXQYQX\"."
