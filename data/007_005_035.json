    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 24 and 36, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 24: 2^3 * 3^1\nPrime factorization of 36: 2^2 * 3^2\n\nNow, take the highest powers of each prime factor present in the factorizations:\n\n2^3 and 3^2\n\nMultiply these together:\n\n2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, the LCM of 24 and 36 is 72."
