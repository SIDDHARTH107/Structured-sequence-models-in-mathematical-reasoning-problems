    "message_2": "To find the Fourier sine series representation of the function f(x) = x over the interval [0, π], we first need to find the coefficients B_n of the sine series:\n\nf(x) = ∑(B_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere B_n is given by:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π\n\nTo find B_n, we'll use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) = uv - ∫(v * du)\n\n= x * (-1/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫((-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx)\n\n= (-x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate this from 0 to π:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * [((-π/n) * cos(n * π) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * π)) - ((-0/n) * cos(0) + (1/n^2) * sin(0))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, we get:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * (-π/n) * (-1)^n\n\nSo, the Fourier sine series representation of f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = ∑((-2 * (-1)^n * x) / n) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, we'll use this representation to solve the heat equation with initial temperature distribution f(x) and boundary conditions u(0,t) = 0 and u(π,t) = 0 for t > 0, assuming thermal conductivity k and heat capacity c are both equal to 1. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = ∂²u/∂x²\n\nWe'll use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x,t) = X(x) * T(t). Plugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x) * T(t), we get:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -λ * T(t)\nX''(x) = -λ * X(x)\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(√λ * x) + B * cos(√λ * x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0,t) = 0 and u(π,t) = 0, we get:\n\nX(0) = B * cos(0) = 0 => B = 0\nX(π) = A * sin(√λ * π) = 0\n\nSince A ≠ 0, we must have sin(√λ * π) = 0, which implies that √λ * π = n * π for some integer n. Thus, λ = n².\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C * e^(-n² * t)\n\nSo, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑(C_n * e^(-n² * t) * sin(n * x))\n\nNow, we'll use the initial temperature distribution f(x) = x:\n\nx = ∑(C_n * sin(n * x))\n\nComparing this with the Fourier sine series representation of f(x) = x, we get:\n\nC_n = -2 * (-1)^n / n\n\nThus, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑((-2 * (-1)^n / n) * e^(-n² * t) * sin(n * x))"
