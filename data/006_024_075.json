    "message_1": "Let's say the probability of Tom getting a flight delay on a business trip is 0.2, the probability of his train being cancelled is 0.1, and the probability of his rental car breaking down is 0.05. What is the probability of Tom experiencing at least one of these travel mishaps on his trip?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of Tom experiencing at least one of these travel mishaps, we can first find the probability of none of these events happening and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of Tom not experiencing a flight delay is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\nThe probability of his train not being cancelled is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\nThe probability of his rental car not breaking down is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we find the probability of all these events not happening simultaneously:\n0.8 * 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.684\n\nFinally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one mishap occurring:\n1 - 0.684 = 0.316\n\nSo, the probability of Tom experiencing at least one travel mishap on his trip is 0.316 or 31.6%."
