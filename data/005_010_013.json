    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs with a 2% defect rate. A quality inspector randomly selects 10 light bulbs from a box. What is the probability that at least one of the light bulbs is defective using Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one light bulb is defective, we can use the complementary probability that none of the light bulbs are defective. Let A be the event that at least one light bulb is defective, and A' be the event that none of the light bulbs are defective.\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A')\n\nThe probability of a single light bulb being defective is 2%, so the probability of a single light bulb not being defective is 98% (1 - 0.02 = 0.98).\n\nSince the light bulbs are selected randomly and independently, we can find the probability of all 10 light bulbs not being defective by multiplying the individual probabilities:\n\nP(A') = (0.98)^10 ≈ 0.817\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one light bulb being defective:\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 0.817 ≈ 0.183\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the light bulbs is defective is approximately 18.3%."
