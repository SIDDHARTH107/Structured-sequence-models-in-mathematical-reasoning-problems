    "message_2": "To solve the given complex differential equation using Laplace transforms, we first take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. Let $Y(s)$ be the Laplace transform of $y(z)$, then we have:\n\n$L\\{\\frac{d^2y}{dz^2}\\} + 2L\\{\\frac{dy}{dz}\\} + 2L\\{y\\} = 0$\n\nUsing the properties of Laplace transforms, we get:\n\n$s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + 2(sY(s) - y(0)) + 2Y(s) = 0$\n\nNow, we plug in the initial conditions $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = i$:\n\n$s^2Y(s) - s - i + 2(sY(s) - 1) + 2Y(s) = 0$\n\nRearrange the terms and factor out $Y(s)$:\n\n$Y(s)(s^2 + 2s + 2) = s + i + 2$\n\nNow, we solve for $Y(s)$:\n\n$Y(s) = \\frac{s + i + 2}{s^2 + 2s + 2}$\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$, we first complete the square in the denominator:\n\n$Y(s) = \\frac{s + i + 2}{(s + 1)^2 + 1}$\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$:\n\n$y(z) = L^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = L^{-1}\\{\\frac{s + i + 2}{(s + 1)^2 + 1}\\}$\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform table, we can identify this as a combination of the transforms of $e^{-z}\\cos(z)$ and $e^{-z}\\sin(z)$:\n\n$y(z) = e^{-z}(\\cos(z) + i\\sin(z))$\n\nSo, the solution to the given complex differential equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$y(z) = e^{-z}(\\cos(z) + i\\sin(z))$"
