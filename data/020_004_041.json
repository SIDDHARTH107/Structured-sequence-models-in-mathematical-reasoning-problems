    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. Each unit of X requires 2 kg of material A, 3 kg of material B, and 1 kg of material C. Each unit of Y requires 1 kg of material A, 4 kg of material B, and 2 kg of material C. The company has 120 kg of material A, 180 kg of material B, and 50 kg of material C available for production. If the profit per unit of X is $5 and the profit per unit of Y is $4, how many units of each product should be produced to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. We have the following constraints based on the available materials:\n\n2x + y <= 120 (Material A constraint)\n3x + 4y <= 180 (Material B constraint)\nx + 2y <= 50 (Material C constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 4y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y <= 120\ny <= -2x + 120\n\n2. 3x + 4y <= 180\ny <= (-3/4)x + 45\n\n3. x + 2y <= 50\ny <= (-1/2)x + 25\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 25), (20, 20), (40, 0), and (60, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 25) = 5(0) + 4(25) = 100\n3. P(20, 20) = 5(20) + 4(20) = 180\n4. P(40, 0) = 5(40) + 4(0) = 200\n5. P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 4(0) = 300\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (60, 0), with a profit of $300. Therefore, the company should produce 60 units of product X and 0 units of product Y to maximize the profit."
