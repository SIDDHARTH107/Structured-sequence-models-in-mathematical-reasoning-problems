    "message_2": "First, we need to find the Cartesian product (A x B) and the complements of A and B (A' and B').\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B. Assuming the universal set U contains A and B, we can find the complements as follows:\n\nA' = U - A\nB' = U - B\n\nWithout knowing the universal set U, we cannot find the exact complements of A and B. However, we can still express the result in terms of A' and B':\n\n(A x B)' = (A' ∪ B') = (A' x B') ∪ (A' x B) ∪ (A x B')\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between (A x B)' and (A' x B'):\n\n(A x B)' - (A' x B') = ((A' x B') ∪ (A' x B) ∪ (A x B')) - (A' x B')\n\nSince (A' x B') is a part of (A x B)', subtracting it from the union will leave us with:\n\n(A' x B) ∪ (A x B')\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n(A x B)' - (A' x B') = (A' x B) ∪ (A x B')"
