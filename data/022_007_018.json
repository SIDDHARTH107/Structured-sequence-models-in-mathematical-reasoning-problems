Prove that f(z) is a polynomial function of degree at most 2.\n\nHere's a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\nLet f(z) = 3z + 2z² + 4. Determine whether f(z) is an entire function, and if so, find its degree.",
    "message_2": "First, let's prove that f(z) is a polynomial function of degree at most 2.\n\nSince f(z) is entire, it has a power series representation converging to f(z) for all z in the complex plane:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + ...\n\nWe want to show that a_n = 0 for all n > 2. To do this, we will use the Cauchy's estimates for the derivatives of f(z).\n\nLet's consider a circle with radius R centered at the origin. By the Cauchy's estimates, we have:\n\n|a_n * n!| ≤ (M/R^n) * R\n\nwhere M is the maximum of |f(z)| on the circle, and M ≤ 2R^2 (given by the condition |f(z)| ≤ 2|z|^2).\n\nSo, |a_n * n!| ≤ 2R^2. Now, let's take the limit as R goes to infinity:\n\nlim (R→∞) |a_n * n!| / R^2 ≤ 2\n\nSince n > 2, the left side of the inequality goes to infinity, which implies that a_n = 0 for all n > 2. Therefore, f(z) is a polynomial function of degree at most 2.\n\nNow, let's solve the numerical problem:\n\nf(z) = 3z + 2z² + 4\n\nTo determine whether f(z) is an entire function, we need to check if it is holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable) everywhere in the complex plane. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is holomorphic everywhere, and thus, f(z) is an entire function.\n\nTo find its degree, we look at the highest power of z in the polynomial. In this case, the highest power is 2 (from the term 2z²). Therefore, the degree of f(z) is 2."
