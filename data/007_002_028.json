    "message_2": "The divisibility rule for 6 states that a number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\nFirst, let's check for divisibility by 2:\nA number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). The last digit of 4781 is 1, which is not even. Therefore, 4781 is not divisible by 2.\n\nSince 4781 is not divisible by 2, it is not divisible by 6. Now, let's find the remainder when 4781 is divided by 6:\n\n4781 รท 6 = 796 with a remainder of 5.\n\nSo, the remainder when 4781 is divided by 6 is 5."
