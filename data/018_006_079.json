    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Given a set A = {2, 4}, find the complement of set A and then calculate the union of A and its complement. Prove that the resulting set is the same as the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nSet A = {2, 4}\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found by comparing the elements of set A with the elements of the universal set U:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5} (These are the elements in U that are not in A)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. In this case, we are finding the union of A and A':\n\nA âˆª A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nAs we can see, the resulting set of the union of A and A' is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which is the same as the universal set U. This proves that the union of a set and its complement is equal to the universal set."
