    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle can be found using the sine function. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nsin(30°) = (opposite side) / 10 cm\n\nWe know that sin(30°) = 1/2, so:\n\n1/2 = (opposite side) / 10 cm\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side:\n\nopposite side = 1/2 * 10 cm\nopposite side = 5 cm\n\nThe length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 5 cm."
