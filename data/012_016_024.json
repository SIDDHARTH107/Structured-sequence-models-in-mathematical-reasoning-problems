    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial of a graph G, denoted as T_G(x, y), is a two-variable polynomial that contains information about the graph's structure. It is defined recursively using deletion and contraction operations on the edges of the graph.\n\nFor the given graph, let's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\n      A\n     / \\\n  e1/   \\e2\n   /     \\\n  B-------C\n    e3\n```\n\nNow, we will compute the Tutte polynomial using the recursive formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G-e(x, y) + T_G/e(x, y)\n\nwhere G-e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nWe will start by computing T_G(x, y) for the given graph using edge e1:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_(G-e1)(x, y) + T_(G/e1)(x, y)\n\nG-e1 is the graph obtained by deleting edge e1:\n\n```\n      A\n       \n   1/   \n   /     \n  B-------C\n      3\n```\n\nG/e1 is the graph obtained by contracting edge e1:\n\n```\n      A\n       \n   1/   \n   /     \n  B-------C\n      3\n```\n\nNotice that G-e1 and G/e1 are isomorphic, so their Tutte polynomials are the same. Let's compute T_(G-e1)(x, y):\n\nT_(G-e1)(x, y) = T_(G-e1-e2)(x, y) + T_(G-e1/e2)(x, y)\n\nG-e1-e2 is the graph obtained by deleting edges e1 and e2:\n\n```\n      A\n       \n   1/   \n   /     \n  B       C\n```\n\nG-e1/e2 is the graph obtained by contracting edge e2 in G-e1:\n\n```\n      A\n       \n   1/   \n   /     \n  B-------C\n```\n\nNow, T_(G-e1-e2)(x, y) = (x-1)(y-1) since it is a graph with two isolated vertices and no edges. T_(G-e1/e2)(x, y) = y since it is a graph with one edge and no cycles. Therefore, T_(G-e1)(x, y) = (x-1)(y-1) + y.\n\nSince G-e1 and G/e1 are isomorphic, we have T_G(x, y) = 2 * T_(G-e1)(x, y) = 2 * ((x-1)(y-1) + y).\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT_G(x, y) = 2((x-1)(y-1) + y)"
