    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 12 centimeters, we can plug it into the formula:\n\nC = π * 12\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14159, we get:\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 12\nC ≈ 37.69908\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 37.7 centimeters."
