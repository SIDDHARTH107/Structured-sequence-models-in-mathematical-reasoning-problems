    "message_2": "To find the degree of the map $f: S^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}P^1$ associated to the complex line bundle $E$, we can use the fact that the degree of this map is equal to the first Chern class of the pullback bundle $f^*E$.\n\nRecall that the first Chern class is a homomorphism from the set of isomorphism classes of complex line bundles to the second cohomology group $H^2(S^2, \\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we have $c_1(f^*E) = f^*c_1(E)$.\n\nSince $c_1(E) = 3$, we have $f^*c_1(E) = 3f^*1 = 3$. Thus, the degree of the map $f: S^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}P^1$ associated to the complex line bundle $E$ is equal to the first Chern class of the pullback bundle $f^*E$, which is $3$."
