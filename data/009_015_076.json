    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive element has an initial mass of 100 grams and its half-life is 6 days. Write a differential equation to model the decay of the element, and use it to determine how much of the element remains after 18 days.",
    "message_2": "To model the decay of the radioactive element, we can use the following exponential decay formula:\n\nm(t) = m_0 * e^(-λt)\n\nwhere:\n- m(t) is the mass of the element at time t\n- m_0 is the initial mass of the element (100 grams in this case)\n- λ is the decay constant\n- t is the time in days\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant λ. We know that the half-life of the element is 6 days. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the initial mass to decay. So, when t = 6 days, m(t) = m_0 / 2. We can use this information to find λ:\n\nm_0 / 2 = m_0 * e^(-λ * 6)\n\nDivide both sides by m_0:\n\n1/2 = e^(-λ * 6)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/2) = -λ * 6\n\nNow, solve for λ:\n\nλ = -ln(1/2) / 6 ≈ 0.1155\n\nNow that we have the decay constant, we can write the differential equation for the decay of the element:\n\nm(t) = 100 * e^(-0.1155t)\n\nTo find the mass of the element remaining after 18 days, plug t = 18 into the equation:\n\nm(18) = 100 * e^(-0.1155 * 18) ≈ 100 * e^(-2.079) ≈ 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 18 days, approximately 12.5 grams of the radioactive element remain."
