    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z)$ is constant, we will use Liouville's theorem. Liouville's theorem states that if a function is entire and bounded, then it must be constant.\n\nFirst, we are given that $f(z)$ is entire, which means it is holomorphic on the entire complex plane. Next, we are given that $|f(z)| \\leq e^{|z|}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This inequality shows that $f(z)$ is bounded, as $e^{|z|}$ is a bound for the absolute value of $f(z)$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is entire and bounded, by Liouville's theorem, we can conclude that $f(z)$ is constant. Let's denote this constant value as $c$.\n\nNow, using the fundamental theorem of algebra, we want to show that there exists a complex number such that $f(z) = c$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root.\n\nHowever, since we have already shown that $f(z)$ is constant, it is not a non-constant polynomial. Therefore, the fundamental theorem of algebra does not apply in this case. Instead, we can directly conclude that $f(z) = c$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, as we have already shown that $f(z)$ is constant.\n\nIn summary, we have used Liouville's theorem to prove that $f(z)$ is constant, and we have shown that there exists a complex number such that $f(z) = c$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, where $c$ is the constant value of $f(z)$."
