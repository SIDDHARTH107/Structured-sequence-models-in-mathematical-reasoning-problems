    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of a smooth projective curve X of genus g = 3 over the field of complex numbers, we need to consider the canonical embedding of X into projective space.\n\nThe canonical divisor class K_X is given by the degree 2g - 2 = 4 divisor on X. By Riemann-Roch theorem, the dimension of the space of global sections of the canonical line bundle L(K_X) is g - 1 = 2. Therefore, the canonical map φ_K: X → ℙ^2 is an embedding of X into the projective plane as a smooth plane quartic curve.\n\nThe minimal model of X is the curve itself, as it is already embedded in the projective plane as a smooth plane quartic curve. In other words, the minimal model of X is the smooth plane quartic curve given by the canonical embedding φ_K."
