    "message_2": "To prove that X is compact, we need to show that every open cover of X has a finite subcover. In other words, given any collection of open sets {U_i} such that X is a subset of the union of these open sets, we need to find a finite number of these open sets whose union still contains X.\n\nLet {U_i} be an open cover of X. We will show that there exists a finite subcover of {U_i} that covers X.\n\nConsider the set A = {x in X : [0, x] is covered by a finite subcover of {U_i}}. Since 0 is in X and X is a subset of the union of the open sets {U_i}, there must be some U_i0 that contains 0. Thus, [0, 0] is covered by a finite subcover (just U_i0), so 0 is in A. Therefore, A is non-empty.\n\nNow, let b = sup A. Since X is a closed interval, it is bounded, so b exists and 0 <= b <= 1.\n\nWe will show that b is in A. Since X is a subset of the union of the open sets {U_i}, there must be some U_ib that contains b. Since U_ib is an open set, there exists an open interval (b - δ, b + δ) contained in U_ib for some δ > 0.\n\nNow, consider the point b - δ/2. Since b is the supremum of A, there must be an element a in A such that b - δ/2 < a <= b. Since a is in A, there exists a finite subcover {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik} that covers [0, a]. Then, the set {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik, U_ib} is a finite subcover that covers [0, b]. Thus, b is in A.\n\nSince b is in A, [0, b] is covered by a finite subcover of {U_i}. Now, we will show that b = 1. If b < 1, then there must be some U_ic that contains b + δ/2 (since X is a subset of the union of the open sets {U_i}). Then, the set {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik, U_ib, U_ic} is a finite subcover that covers [0, b + δ/2], which contradicts the definition of b as the supremum of A. Therefore, b = 1.\n\nSince b = 1, we have shown that [0, 1] is covered by a finite subcover of {U_i}. Thus, X is compact."
