The distances between the locations are given in the following table:\n\n| Location | A    | B    | C     | D     | E     | F     | G    |\n|----------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|\n| A        | 0    | 10   | 20    | 5     | 25    | 15    | 30   |\n| B        | 10   | 0    | 15    | 20    | 10    | 25    | 10   |\n| C        | 20   | 15   | 0     | 30    | 5     | 10    | 20   |\n| D        | 5    | 20   | 30    | 0     | 20    | 15    | 30   |\n| E        | 25   | 10   | 5     | 20    | 0     | 25    | 15   |\n| F        | 15   | 25   | 10    | 15    | 25    | 0     | 10   |\n| G        | 30   | 10   | 20    | 30    | 15    | 10    | 0    |\n\nWhat is the optimal route the courier can take to deliver all the packages and return to the starting location, given that the courier wants to take the shortest route possible? Calculate the total distance traveled.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm as a simple approach. Starting from location A, we will choose the nearest location that has not been visited yet, and repeat this process until all locations have been visited. Finally, we will return to the starting location A.\n\n1. Start at A, nearest unvisited location is D (5)\n2. From D, nearest unvisited location is B (20)\n3. From B, nearest unvisited location is E (10)\n4. From E, nearest unvisited location is C (5)\n5. From C, nearest unvisited location is F (10)\n6. From F, nearest unvisited location is G (10)\n7. Return to A from G (30)\n\nThe optimal route is A -> D -> B -> E -> C -> F -> G -> A.\n\nTotal distance traveled: 5 + 20 + 10 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 90."
