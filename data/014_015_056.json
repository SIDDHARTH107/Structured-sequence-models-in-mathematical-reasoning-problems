    "message_2": "To encode the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Rail Fence cipher with three rails, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern along three lines, and then read the letters from left to right along each line.\n\nHere's the arrangement:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the letters from left to right along each line:\n\nHOR ELWLDO LLO\n\nSo, the Rail Fence cipher of the message \"HELLO WORLD\" with three rails is \"HORELWLLO\"."
