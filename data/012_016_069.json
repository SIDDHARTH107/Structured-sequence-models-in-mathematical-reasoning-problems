    "message_2": "To calculate the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we will use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G / e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G is the graph, e is an edge, G - e is the graph obtained by removing edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the graph as follows:\n\n```\n  A---B\n  |\\ /|\n  | X |\n  |/ \\|\n  C---D\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate the Tutte polynomial step by step:\n\n1. Choose edge AB as e. It's not a loop or a bridge, so we have:\n   T(G; x, y) = T(G - AB; x, y) + T(G / AB; x, y)\n\n2. For T(G - AB; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A   B\n   \\ / \n    X  \n   / \\\n  C---D\n```\n\nChoose edge AC as e. It's not a loop or a bridge, so we have:\n   T(G - AB; x, y) = T(G - AB - AC; x, y) + T(G - AB / AC; x, y)\n\n3. For T(G - AB - AC; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A   B\n     / \n    X  \n   / \n  C---D\n```\n\nChoose edge CD as e. It's a bridge, so we have:\n   T(G - AB - AC; x, y) = x * T(G - AB - AC / CD; x, y)\n\n4. For T(G - AB - AC / CD; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A   B\n     / \n    X  \n```\n\nThis graph has no edges, so its Tutte polynomial is (x - 1) * (y - 1).\n\n5. For T(G - AB / AC; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A---B\n  |   |\n  C---D\n```\n\nChoose edge AD as e. It's not a loop or a bridge, so we have:\n   T(G - AB / AC; x, y) = T(G - AB / AC - AD; x, y) + T(G - AB / AC / AD; x, y)\n\n6. For T(G - AB / AC - AD; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A---B\n      |\n  C---D\n```\n\nThis graph has one component with a cycle, so its Tutte polynomial is (x - 1) * y.\n\n7. For T(G - AB / AC / AD; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A---B\n  |   |\n  C---D\n```\n\nThis graph has two components with a cycle, so its Tutte polynomial is (x - 1)^2.\n\nNow, let's combine the results:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - AB; x, y) + T(G / AB; x, y)\n           = T(G - AB - AC; x, y) + T(G - AB / AC; x, y) + T(G / AB; x, y)\n           = x * (x - 1) * (y - 1) + ((x - 1) * y + (x - 1)^2) + T(G / AB; x, y)\n\nTo find T(G / AB; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n  A---C\n  |\\ /|\n  | X |\n  |/ \\|\n  B---D\n```\n\nThis graph is isomorphic to the original graph, so we have:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x * (x - 1) * (y - 1) + ((x - 1) * y + (x - 1)^2) + T(G; x, y)\n\nNow, let's solve for T(G; x, y):\n\nT(G; x, y) - T(G; x, y) = x * (x - 1) * (y - 1) + ((x - 1) * y + (x - 1)^2)\n0 = x * (x - 1) * (y - 1) + ((x - 1) * y + (x - 1)^2) - T(G; x, y)\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = x * (x - 1) * (y - 1) + ((x - 1) * y + (x - 1)^2)"
