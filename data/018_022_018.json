    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A.\n\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNext, we will find the symmetric difference between (A x B) and (B x A). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\n(A x B) ∆ (B x A) = { (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) } - { (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3) }\n\n(A x B) ∆ (B x A) = { (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) }\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference between (A x B) and (B x A) is not equal to the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference between A and B, which would be:\n\n(A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) = {1, 4} x {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
