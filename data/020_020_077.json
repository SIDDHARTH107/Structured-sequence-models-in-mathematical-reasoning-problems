    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to design a rectangular box with a volume of 1200 cubic cm. The top and bottom of the box will be made from a material that costs $0.05 per square cm, while the sides are made of a material that costs $0.025 per square cm. What are the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials?",
    "message_2": "Let the length, width, and height of the box be l, w, and h, respectively. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = lwh = 1200\n\nThe cost of the top and bottom of the box is given by:\n\nC_top_bottom = 2 * (lw) * 0.05\n\nThe cost of the sides of the box is given by:\n\nC_sides = 2 * (lh + wh) * 0.025\n\nThe total cost of the box is given by:\n\nC_total = C_top_bottom + C_sides\n\nWe want to minimize C_total with respect to the dimensions l, w, and h. To do this, we can first eliminate one of the variables using the volume constraint. Let's solve for h:\n\nh = 1200 / (lw)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the total cost equation:\n\nC_total = 0.05 * 2 * (lw) + 0.025 * 2 * (l * (1200 / (lw)) + w * (1200 / (lw)))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nC_total = 0.1lw + 0.05 * (1200 * (l + w) / (lw))\n\nNow, we can use calculus to find the dimensions that minimize the cost. Take the partial derivatives of C_total with respect to l and w, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂C_total/∂l = 0.1w - 0.05 * (1200 * w / (l^2w)) = 0\n∂C_total/∂w = 0.1l - 0.05 * (1200 * l / (lw^2)) = 0\n\nSolve these equations simultaneously for l and w:\n\n0.1w = 0.05 * (1200 * w / (l^2w))\n0.1l = 0.05 * (1200 * l / (lw^2))\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 = 1200 / (l^2)\n2 = 1200 / (w^2)\n\nSolve for l and w:\n\nl^2 = 600\nw^2 = 600\n\nl = sqrt(600)\nw = sqrt(600)\n\nNow, substitute l and w back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 1200 / (lw)\nh = 1200 / (sqrt(600) * sqrt(600))\nh = sqrt(600)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of materials are:\n\nl = sqrt(600) cm\nw = sqrt(600) cm\nh = sqrt(600) cm"
