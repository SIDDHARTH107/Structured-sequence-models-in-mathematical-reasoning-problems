    "message_1": "Suppose you are a manufacturer who produces two types of products, X and Y. You have 120 hours of machine time and 100 hours of labor time each week available for production. Each unit of X requires 4 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time, while each unit of Y requires 3 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor time. The profit per unit of X is $30 and the profit per unit of Y is $40. How many units of each product should be produced each week to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor time can be represented as follows:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 120 (machine time constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 100 (labor time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 30x + 40y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then find the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraints in slope-intercept form:\n\ny ≤ (120 - 4x) / 3\ny ≤ (100 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we will graph the constraints:\n\n1. y = (120 - 4x) / 3\n2. y = (100 - 3x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the lines intersect each other and the axes.\n\n1. Intersection of line 1 and the x-axis: (120/4, 0) = (30, 0)\n2. Intersection of line 1 and the y-axis: (0, 120/3) = (0, 40)\n3. Intersection of line 2 and the x-axis: (100/3, 0) = (33.33, 0)\n4. Intersection of line 2 and the y-axis: (0, 100/4) = (0, 25)\n5. Intersection of line 1 and line 2:\n\n(120 - 4x) / 3 = (100 - 3x) / 4\n4(120 - 4x) = 3(100 - 3x)\n480 - 16x = 300 - 9x\n180 = 7x\nx = 180 / 7 ≈ 25.71\ny = (120 - 4(180/7)) / 3 ≈ 12.86\n\nSo, the intersection point is approximately (25.71, 12.86).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 30x + 40y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(30, 0) = 30(30) + 40(0) = 900\n2. P(0, 40) = 30(0) + 40(40) = 1600\n3. P(33.33, 0) = 30(33.33) + 40(0) ≈ 1000\n4. P(0, 25) = 30(0) + 40(25) = 1000\n5. P(25.71, 12.86) ≈ 30(25.71) + 40(12.86) ≈ 1285.7\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 40) with a profit of $1600. Therefore, the manufacturer should produce 0 units of product X and 40 units of product Y each week to maximize the profit."
