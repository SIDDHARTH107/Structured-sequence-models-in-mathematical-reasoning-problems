    "message_1": "The production manager at a car manufacturer wants to optimize the fuel efficiency of a new car model. The car's firmware has 4 parameters that affect fuel efficiency, which can take values between 0-100. The production manager wants to find the optimal combination of these parameters that maximize fuel efficiency. \n\nUsing the cuckoo search algorithm, find the optimal combination of parameter values that maximizes fuel efficiency, given the following performance metric: the sum of squares of the difference between the actual fuel efficiency and the target fuel efficiency, where the target fuel efficiency is 30 km/l. The production manager has provided you with the actual fuel efficiency measurements for a sample of 50 cars with different combination of parameter values.",
    "message_2": "To use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal combination of parameter values that maximize fuel efficiency, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of cuckoos (solutions) randomly within the search space (parameter values between 0-100).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each cuckoo (solution) using the performance metric provided (sum of squares of the difference between the actual fuel efficiency and the target fuel efficiency).\n3. Perform the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy):\n\n   a. Select a cuckoo (solution) randomly and generate a new solution by performing a random walk (Levy flight) in the search space.\n   \n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   \n   c. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the original cuckoo (solution) with the new solution.\n   \n   d. Randomly choose a cuckoo (solution) from the population and replace it with a new cuckoo (solution) generated randomly within the search space with a probability p (e.g., p = 0.25).\n   \n   e. Evaluate the fitness of the new cuckoo (solution) and update the population accordingly.\n   \n   f. Keep track of the best solution (cuckoo) found so far.\n\n4. Return the best solution (cuckoo) found as the optimal combination of parameter values that maximize fuel efficiency.\n\nPlease note that I cannot perform the actual calculations without the actual fuel efficiency measurements for the sample of 50 cars with different combinations of parameter values. However, you can follow the steps above and implement the cuckoo search algorithm in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, MATLAB) to find the optimal combination of parameter values that maximize fuel efficiency."
