    "message_2": "To calculate the transfer function of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the input and output signals.\n\nThe input signal is given by u(t) = 5sin(2t). The Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF{sin(at)} = (j/2) * (δ(ω - a) - δ(ω + a))\n\nwhere F is the Fourier transform, a is the frequency, ω is the angular frequency, and δ is the Dirac delta function. In our case, a = 2, so the Fourier transform of the input signal is:\n\nU(ω) = F{5sin(2t)} = (5j/2) * (δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2))\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal y(t) = 3cos(2t) + 4cos(4t). The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF{cos(at)} = (1/2) * (δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a))\n\nApplying this to both cosine terms in y(t):\n\nY(ω) = F{3cos(2t) + 4cos(4t)} = (3/2) * (δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)) + (4/2) * (δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4))\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing the Fourier transform of the output signal Y(ω) by the Fourier transform of the input signal U(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / U(ω)\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the different cases for ω:\n\n1. ω = ±2:\nH(ω) = [(3/2) * (δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2))] / [(5j/2) * (δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2))]\nH(ω) = (3/5j)\n\n2. ω = ±4:\nH(ω) = [(4/2) * (δ(ω - 4) + δ(ω + 4))] / [(5j/2) * (δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2))]\nH(ω) = 0\n\n3. ω ≠ ±2, ±4:\nH(ω) = 0 / 0 = undefined\n\nSo, the transfer function H(ω) of the system is:\n\nH(ω) = (3/5j) * (δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)) for ω = ±2\nH(ω) = 0 for ω = ±4\nH(ω) = undefined for ω ≠ ±2, ±4"
