The company has found that 95% of the bulbs manufactured have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours. A quality control team selects a random sample of 50 bulbs and finds that 47 of them have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours. Using Bayesian statistics, what is the probability that at least 95% of the bulbs produced by the company have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nWhere:\n- P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has occurred.\n- P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has occurred.\n- P(A) is the probability of event A happening.\n- P(B) is the probability of event B happening.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the probability that at least 95% of the bulbs produced by the company have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours, given that 47 out of 50 bulbs in the sample have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours. Let's define the events:\n\n- Event A: At least 95% of the bulbs produced by the company have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours.\n- Event B: 47 out of 50 bulbs in the sample have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours.\n\nWe want to find P(A|B). To do this, we need to find P(B|A), P(A), and P(B).\n\n1. P(B|A): If at least 95% of the bulbs produced have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours, then the probability of selecting a bulb with a lifetime of at least 1000 hours is at least 0.95. In a sample of 50 bulbs, the probability of finding exactly 47 bulbs with a lifetime of at least 1000 hours can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(B|A) = C(50, 47) * (0.95)^47 * (0.05)^3\nWhere C(50, 47) is the number of combinations of selecting 47 bulbs out of 50, which is equal to 50! / (47! * 3!).\n\nC(50, 47) = 19600\nP(B|A) = 19600 * (0.95)^47 * (0.05)^3 ≈ 0.185\n\n2. P(A): The problem states that 95% of the bulbs manufactured have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours. This is the prior probability of event A.\n\nP(A) = 0.95\n\n3. P(B): The probability of selecting 47 bulbs with a lifetime of at least 1000 hours out of 50 bulbs can be calculated using the binomial probability formula, assuming a general probability p of a bulb having a lifetime of at least 1000 hours:\n\nP(B) = C(50, 47) * p^47 * (1-p)^3\n\nSince we don't have a specific value for p, we cannot calculate an exact value for P(B). However, we can still express P(A|B) in terms of P(B):\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (0.185 * 0.95) / P(B)\n\nNow, we know that P(B) must be less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the probability P(A|B) will be greater than or equal to:\n\nP(A|B) ≥ (0.185 * 0.95) / 1 ≈ 0.176\n\nSo, the probability that at least 95% of the bulbs produced by the company have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours, given that 47 out of 50 bulbs in the sample have a lifetime of at least 1000 hours, is at least 17.6%."
