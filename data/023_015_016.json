    "message_1": "A guitar string is modeled as a 50 cm-long taut wire with a mass of 300 g. If the tension applied to the string is 200 N, find the fundamental frequency of the string when it is plucked. Use the formula for the fundamental frequency of a string fixed at two ends: \n\nf = 1/2L * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere L is the length of the string, T is the tension applied to the string, and μ is the linear mass density of the string (mass per unit length).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. We have the mass (m) and the length (L) of the string:\n\nm = 300 g = 0.3 kg (converting grams to kilograms)\nL = 50 cm = 0.5 m (converting centimeters to meters)\n\nNow, we can find the linear mass density (μ):\n\nμ = m / L\nμ = 0.3 kg / 0.5 m\nμ = 0.6 kg/m\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the fundamental frequency (f) of a string fixed at two ends:\n\nf = 1 / (2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nPlugging in the values for L, T, and μ:\n\nf = 1 / (2 * 0.5 m) * sqrt(200 N / 0.6 kg/m)\nf = 1 / 1 m * sqrt(200 N / 0.6 kg/m)\nf = sqrt(200 N / 0.6 kg/m)\n\nCalculating the square root:\n\nf = sqrt(333.33 Nm/kg)\n\nf ≈ 18.26 Hz\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency of the guitar string when it is plucked is approximately 18.26 Hz."
