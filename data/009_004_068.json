    "message_1": "A mass attached to a spring oscillates with a frequency of 4 Hz and has an amplitude of 2 cm. If the mass is initially displaced 3 cm from its equilibrium position and its initial velocity is zero, what will be the equation of its motion?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for a mass-spring system, we can use the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(2πft + φ)\n\nwhere:\nx(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t\nA is the amplitude of the oscillation\nf is the frequency of the oscillation\nt is the time\nφ is the phase angle\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The frequency (f) is 4 Hz\n- The amplitude (A) is 2 cm\n- The initial displacement (x(0)) is 3 cm\n- The initial velocity (v(0)) is 0 cm/s\n\nFirst, let's find the phase angle (φ). Since the initial velocity is zero, we can use the following equation:\n\nv(t) = -A * 2πf * sin(2πft + φ)\n\nAt t = 0, the velocity is 0:\n\n0 = -A * 2πf * sin(φ)\n\nSince A and f are non-zero, we can divide both sides by -A * 2πf:\n\n0 = sin(φ)\n\nThe sine function is zero at φ = 0 and φ = π. Since the initial displacement is greater than the amplitude, the phase angle must be π. Therefore, φ = π.\n\nNow we can write the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(2πft + φ)\nx(t) = 2 * cos(2π(4)t + π)\n\nSo, the equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 2 * cos(8πt + π)"
