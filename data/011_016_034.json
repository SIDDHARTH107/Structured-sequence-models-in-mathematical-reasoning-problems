    "message_1": "A company is making employee ID badges with three colored stripes (blue, green, and red). Each stripe must be one of the three colors and the order of the stripes is important. How many different ID badge designs can be made if the company wants to have 8 blue stripes, 5 green stripes, and 3 red stripes on their badges?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of different ID badge designs, we can use the counting principle. For each stripe, there are a certain number of color choices. Since there are three stripes and each stripe can be one of the three colors, we can calculate the total number of designs as follows:\n\n1st stripe: 3 color choices (blue, green, or red)\n2nd stripe: 3 color choices (blue, green, or red)\n3rd stripe: 3 color choices (blue, green, or red)\n\nTotal number of designs = 3 choices (1st stripe) × 3 choices (2nd stripe) × 3 choices (3rd stripe) = 3^3 = 27 different ID badge designs."
