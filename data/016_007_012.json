    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nThe first iteration removes 1 cube from the center and 6 cubes from the faces, which is a total of 1 + 6 = 7 cubes removed. So, there are 27 - 7 = 20 smaller cubes left.\n\nIn the 4th iteration, the process has been applied 4 times. The volume of the original cube is V = side_length^3 = 3^3 = 27 cubic units.\n\nEach iteration scales the volume by a factor of 20/27, so the volume of the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge is:\n\nV_4 = V * (20/27)^4 = 27 * (20/27)^4 â‰ˆ 8.005 cubic units."
