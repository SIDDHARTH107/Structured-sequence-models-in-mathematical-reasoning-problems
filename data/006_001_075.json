    "message_1": "Suppose you flip a fair coin three times. What is the probability of getting at least two heads in those three flips?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least two heads in three flips, we can first find the probabilities of getting exactly two heads and exactly three heads, and then add those probabilities together.\n\nThere are three possible ways to get exactly two heads: HHT, HTH, and THH. The probability of each of these outcomes is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8, since each coin flip is independent and has a 1/2 chance of being heads. So the probability of getting exactly two heads is 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.\n\nThere is only one possible way to get exactly three heads: HHH. The probability of this outcome is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of getting exactly two heads and exactly three heads together: 3/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of getting at least two heads in three flips of a fair coin is 1/2."
