Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using the formula n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where p is the prime factor and k is its exponent in the prime factorization.\n\nFor p = 2, k = 2: n_2 = (2^(2+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 7\nFor p = 3, k = 1: n_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = 4\nFor p = 5, k = 1: n_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1) / (5 - 1) = 6\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: n = (n_p1 * n_p2 * ... * n_pk) / (n_p1 - 1), where n_pi is the number of possible groups for each prime factor.\n\nn = (7 * 4 * 6) / (7 - 1) = 168 / 6 = 28\n\nTherefore, there are 28 non-isomorphic groups of order 60."
