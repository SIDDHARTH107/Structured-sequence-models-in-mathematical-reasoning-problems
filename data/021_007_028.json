    "message_1": "The problem is to find the root of the function f(x) = e^(-x) - x, accurate to four decimal places using Newton-Raphson method, starting with an initial guess of x0 = 1. Use the formula x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) to calculate the successive approximations of the root until the absolute error between two consecutive solutions is less than 0.0001.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = e^(-x) - x. \n\nThe derivative of e^(-x) is -e^(-x), and the derivative of x is 1. So, the derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = -e^(-x) - 1.\n\nNow, we will use the formula x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) to find the successive approximations of the root. We start with an initial guess of x0 = 1.\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 1\nf(x0) = e^(-1) - 1 ≈ 0.3679 - 1 = -0.6321\nf'(x0) = -e^(-1) - 1 ≈ -0.3679 - 1 = -1.3679\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) ≈ 1 - (-0.6321)/(-1.3679) ≈ 0.5385\n\nIteration 2:\nx0 = 0.5385\nf(x0) = e^(-0.5385) - 0.5385 ≈ 0.5836 - 0.5385 = 0.0451\nf'(x0) = -e^(-0.5385) - 1 ≈ -0.5836 - 1 = -1.5836\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) ≈ 0.5385 - (0.0451)/(-1.5836) ≈ 0.5663\n\nIteration 3:\nx0 = 0.5663\nf(x0) = e^(-0.5663) - 0.5663 ≈ 0.5684 - 0.5663 = 0.0021\nf'(x0) = -e^(-0.5663) - 1 ≈ -0.5684 - 1 = -1.5684\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) ≈ 0.5663 - (0.0021)/(-1.5684) ≈ 0.5671\n\nIteration 4:\nx0 = 0.5671\nf(x0) = e^(-0.5671) - 0.5671 ≈ 0.5674 - 0.5671 = 0.0003\nf'(x0) = -e^(-0.5671) - 1 ≈ -0.5674 - 1 = -1.5674\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) ≈ 0.5671 - (0.0003)/(-1.5674) ≈ 0.5671\n\nThe absolute error between the last two solutions is |0.5671 - 0.5663| = 0.0008, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, the root of the function f(x) = e^(-x) - x, accurate to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 0.5671."
