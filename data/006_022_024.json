    "message_1": "In a school of 500 students who took a test on probability, it was observed that 50% of the students got an A grade, 30% got a B grade, and the remaining got a C grade. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student from the school got a C grade?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen student got a C grade, we need to determine the percentage of students who got a C grade. Since 50% got an A grade and 30% got a B grade, the remaining percentage of students got a C grade.\n\n100% (total students) - 50% (A grade) - 30% (B grade) = 20% (C grade)\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen student got a C grade is 20% or 0.20."
