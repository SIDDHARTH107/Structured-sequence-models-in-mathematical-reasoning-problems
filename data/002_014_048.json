    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm and a height of 3 cm. Find its surface area in square centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width. The rectangular prism has three pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions: length × width, length × height, and width × height.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 40 cm² × 2 = 80 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height): 8 cm × 3 cm = 24 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 24 cm² × 2 = 48 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height): 5 cm × 3 cm = 15 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 15 cm² × 2 = 30 cm².\n\nNow, add the total areas of all three pairs of opposite faces: 80 cm² + 48 cm² + 30 cm² = 158 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 158 square centimeters."
