    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each interval. In the first six iterations, we will remove the following fractions of the initial interval:\n\n1. 1/3\n2. 1/3 * 1/3 (two intervals, each 1/3 of the remaining 2/3)\n3. 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 (four intervals, each 1/3 of the remaining 4/9)\n4. 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 (eight intervals, each 1/3 of the remaining 8/27)\n5. 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 (sixteen intervals, each 1/3 of the remaining 16/81)\n6. 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 (thirty-two intervals, each 1/3 of the remaining 32/243)\n\nTo find the sum of the lengths of all the removed intervals, we multiply each fraction by the initial length (81 units) and sum them up:\n\n1. 81 * 1/3 = 27\n2. 81 * 2/9 = 18\n3. 81 * 4/27 = 12\n4. 81 * 8/81 = 8\n5. 81 * 16/243 = 5.3333 (repeating)\n6. 81 * 32/729 = 3.5555 (repeating)\n\nSum = 27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + 5.3333 + 3.5555 = 74 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo, the sum of the lengths of all the removed intervals in the first six iterations of the construction of the Cantor set is approximately 74 units."
