    "message_1": "What is the probability of getting a head in a coin toss within the first three tosses? Assume that the coin is fair and each toss is independent of each other.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of getting at least one head in the first three tosses, we can find the probability of not getting any heads in the first three tosses (i.e., getting all tails) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of getting a tail in one toss is 1/2 (since the coin is fair). Since each toss is independent, the probability of getting all tails in three tosses is:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability:\n\n1 - (probability of all tails) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one head in the first three tosses is 7/8 or 87.5%."
