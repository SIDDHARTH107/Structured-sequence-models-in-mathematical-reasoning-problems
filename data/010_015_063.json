    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the second De Rham cohomology group of a closed surface with genus 2, we can use the Betti numbers. The Betti numbers are topological invariants that give information about the structure of a topological space, and in particular, they are related to the dimensions of the De Rham cohomology groups.\n\nFor a closed surface of genus g, the Betti numbers are given by:\n\nb_0 = 1 (connected components)\nb_1 = 2g (number of independent cycles)\nb_2 = 1 (number of \"voids\" enclosed by the surface)\n\nIn our case, the genus g is 2, so the Betti numbers are:\n\nb_0 = 1\nb_1 = 4\nb_2 = 1\n\nThe dimension of the second De Rham cohomology group is given by the second Betti number, b_2. Therefore, the dimension of the second De Rham cohomology group of a closed surface with genus 2 is 1."
