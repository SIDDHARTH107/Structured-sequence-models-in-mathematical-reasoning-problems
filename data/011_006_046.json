    "message_2": "Let G(x) be the generating function of the sequence. Then we can write:\n\nG(x) = 1 + x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 5x^4 + 8x^5 + ...\n\nSince each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, we have the following recurrence relation:\n\nG(x) - xG(x) - x^2G(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can factor G(x) from the left side:\n\nG(x)(1 - x - x^2) = 1\n\nTo find G(x), we can divide both sides by (1 - x - x^2):\n\nG(x) = 1 / (1 - x - x^2)\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^3 in G(x). We can do this by using partial fraction decomposition:\n\nG(x) = A / (1 - x) + B / (1 + x)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 - x)(1 + x) to clear the denominators:\n\n1 = A(1 + x) + B(1 - x)\n\nExpanding and equating coefficients:\n\n1 = A + B (constant term)\n0 = A - B (coefficient of x)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get A = 1/2 and B = 1/2. So,\n\nG(x) = (1/2) / (1 - x) + (1/2) / (1 + x)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficient of x^3 in G(x) by expanding each term using the geometric series formula:\n\nG(x) = (1/2)(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...) + (1/2)(1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ...)\n\nThe coefficient of x^3 in G(x) is the sum of the coefficients of x^3 in each term:\n\n(1/2)(1) + (1/2)(-1) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^3 in the generating function of the sequence is 0."
