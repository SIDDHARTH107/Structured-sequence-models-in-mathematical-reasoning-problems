    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group of order 15, we know that G = {e, g, g^2, ..., g^14}, where e is the identity element. The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. By the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, G has exactly one subgroup of each order that divides 15.\n\n1. The subgroup of order 1 is {e}, which is trivially cyclic.\n\n2. The subgroup of order 3: We need to find an element in G with order 3. Since the order of g^k is 15/gcd(15, k), we can find the order of each element in G by calculating the gcd with 15. We find that the order of g^5 is 3 (since gcd(15, 5) = 3). So, the subgroup of order 3 is generated by g^5 and is given by H_3 = {e, g^5, (g^5)^2} = {e, g^5, g^10}. This subgroup is cyclic, and its generator is g^5.\n\n3. The subgroup of order 5: Similarly, we need to find an element in G with order 5. We find that the order of g^3 is 5 (since gcd(15, 3) = 5). So, the subgroup of order 5 is generated by g^3 and is given by H_5 = {e, g^3, (g^3)^2, (g^3)^3, (g^3)^4} = {e, g^3, g^6, g^9, g^12}. This subgroup is cyclic, and its generator is g^3.\n\n4. The subgroup of order 15: The whole group G itself is a subgroup of order 15, and it is cyclic with generator g.\n\nIn conclusion, all subgroups of G are cyclic, and their generators are as follows:\n- Subgroup of order 1: {e}\n- Subgroup of order 3: {e, g^5, g^10}, generated by g^5\n- Subgroup of order 5: {e, g^3, g^6, g^9, g^12}, generated by g^3\n- Subgroup of order 15: G, generated by g"
