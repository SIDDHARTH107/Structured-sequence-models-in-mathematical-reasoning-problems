Suppose that $f$ can be extended analytically to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ except for the point $x = 1$. Use the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $f$ analytically to the whole complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$. What is the extended function of $f(z)$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$?",
    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find an analytic function that agrees with $f(z)$ on the real line except for the point $x=1$. We can do this by considering the function $g(z) = (z-1)^2$. Notice that $g(z) = f(z)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$ except for $x=1$. \n\nNow, we can define the reflection of $g(z)$ across the real axis as $g^*(z) = g(\\overline{z}) = (\\overline{z}-1)^2$. Since $g(z)$ is analytic on the upper half plane and continuous on the real line, the Schwarz reflection principle states that the function $h(z) = g(z)$ for $z \\in H$ and $h(z) = g^*(z)$ for $z \\in \\overline{H}$ is analytic on the whole complex plane except for the point $x=1$.\n\nThus, the extended function of $f(z)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by:\n\n$$\nh(z) = \\begin{cases}\n(z-1)^2 & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\n(\\overline{z}-1)^2 & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis function is analytic on the whole complex plane except for the point $x=1$."
