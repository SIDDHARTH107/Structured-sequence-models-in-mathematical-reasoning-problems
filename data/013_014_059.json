    "message_1": "In a sealed bid auction, there are 5 bidders who can bid any amount they want. The highest bidder wins the item, but pays the second-highest bid. Suppose the bidders' valuations for the item are $100, $150, $200, $250, and $300. Determine the bidder who wins the auction and the amount they pay.",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid auction, bidders submit their bids without knowing the bids of others. Since the bidders can bid any amount they want, we can assume that they will bid slightly below their valuations to maximize their profit. Let's assume the bidders bid as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $99\nBidder 2: $149\nBidder 3: $199\nBidder 4: $249\nBidder 5: $299\n\nThe highest bid is $299 from Bidder 5, so they win the auction. However, they pay the second-highest bid, which is $249 from Bidder 4. Therefore, the bidder who wins the auction is Bidder 5, and they pay $249."
