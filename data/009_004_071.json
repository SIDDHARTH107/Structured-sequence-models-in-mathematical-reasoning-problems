The object is initially attached to the spring at its equilibrium position, and then the object is pulled 0.1 meters below the equilibrium position and released. Find the equation of motion for the object and determine its time period of oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the object, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and a is its acceleration.\n\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nSince acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can rewrite this as:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nNow, we can write the equation of motion as:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 + (k/m)x = 0\n\nGiven the values for the mass (m = 2 kg) and the spring constant (k = 100 N/m), we can plug them into the equation:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 + (100/2)x = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 + 50x = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution for this type of equation is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time.\n\nSince the object is initially at a displacement of 0.1 meters below the equilibrium position, we have:\n\nx(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = 0.1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nA = 0.1\n\nSince the object is initially at rest, its velocity is 0. The first derivative of the displacement with respect to time represents the velocity:\n\nv(t) = dx/dt = -A*ω*sin(ωt) + B*ω*cos(ωt)\n\nAt t = 0, the velocity is 0:\n\nv(0) = -0.1*ω*sin(0) + B*ω*cos(0) = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nB = 0\n\nNow we have the equation of motion for the object:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*cos(ωt)\n\nTo find the time period of oscillation, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can use the equation:\n\nω^2 = k/m\n\nPlugging in the values for k and m, we get:\n\nω^2 = 100/2 = 50\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nω = √50\n\nThe time period T is related to the angular frequency by the equation:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value for ω, we get:\n\nT = 2π/√50 ≈ 0.89 s\n\nSo, the equation of motion for the object is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*cos(√50*t)\n\nAnd the time period of oscillation is approximately 0.89 seconds."
