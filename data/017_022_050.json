    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 60: 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups of order 60: This can be done by finding the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. For 60, there is only one partition for each exponent: (2), (1), and (1). Thus, there is only one abelian group of order 60, which is the cyclic group Z_60.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 60: To do this, we can use the following formula for the number of groups of order p^aq^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are positive integers:\n\n   G(p^aq^b) = (p^(a-1)(p-1))(q^(b-1)(q-1))\n\n   For our case, we have two distinct prime factors: 2 and 3. We can apply the formula for each pair of prime factors and their corresponding exponents:\n\n   G(2^2 * 3) = (2^(2-1)(2-1))(3^(1-1)(3-1)) = (2^1)(3^0) = 2\n   G(2^2 * 5) = (2^(2-1)(2-1))(5^(1-1)(5-1)) = (2^1)(5^0) = 2\n   G(3 * 5) = (3^(1-1)(3-1))(5^(1-1)(5-1)) = (3^0)(5^0) = 1\n\n   Adding these results, we get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n4. Combine the number of abelian and non-abelian groups: We found 1 abelian group and 5 non-abelian groups, so there are a total of 1 + 5 = 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 60."
