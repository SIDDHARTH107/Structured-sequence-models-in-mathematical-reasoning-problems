    "message_1": "Assuming a normal distribution, a manager of a store records that the average time a customer spends in the store is 25 minutes with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. If a random sample of 50 customers is selected, what is the probability that the sample mean time exceeds 28 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 5 minutes and n = 50 customers. So, the standard error is:\n\nSE = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 28 minutes. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 28 minutes, μ = 25 minutes, and SE ≈ 0.7071. So, the z-score is:\n\nz = (28 - 25) / 0.7071 ≈ 4.24\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean time exceeds 28 minutes, which is the same as finding the area to the right of the z-score of 4.24 in the standard normal distribution table. \n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in z-score function, we find that the area to the left of z = 4.24 is approximately 0.99998. Since the total area under the curve is 1, the area to the right of z = 4.24 is:\n\n1 - 0.99998 = 0.00002\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean time exceeds 28 minutes is approximately 0.00002, or 0.002%."
