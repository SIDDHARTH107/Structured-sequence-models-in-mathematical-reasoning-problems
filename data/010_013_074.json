    "message_1": "Let E be a real vector bundle over a space X such that the fiber over each point in X is R^n (n dimensional real Euclidean space). If the dimension of E is m (so the total space is R^n × X), show that the set of all linearly independent sections of E is open and dense in the set of all smooth sections. \n\nSuppose X is the unit circle S^1 and n = 2. If m = 3, how many linearly independent sections does E have?",
    "message_2": "To show that the set of all linearly independent sections of E is open and dense in the set of all smooth sections, we will use the transversality theorem. Let M be the set of all smooth sections of E, and let N be the set of all linearly independent sections of E. We want to show that N is open and dense in M.\n\nConsider the evaluation map ev: M × X → R^n given by ev(σ, x) = σ(x), where σ is a section and x is a point in X. This map is smooth, and its differential at a point (σ, x) is given by the derivative of the section at x, which is a linear map from the tangent space T_x(X) to R^n.\n\nNow, let W ⊂ R^n be the subspace of vectors that are linearly dependent on the vectors in the fiber E_x over x. The transversality theorem states that if the differential of ev is transverse to W, then the set of sections σ for which ev(σ, x) is transverse to W is open and dense in M.\n\nTo see that the differential of ev is transverse to W, note that the image of the differential is a subspace of R^n, and since the dimension of E is m, the image has dimension m. Since m > n, the image must intersect W only at the origin. Thus, the differential of ev is transverse to W.\n\nBy the transversality theorem, the set of sections σ for which ev(σ, x) is transverse to W is open and dense in M. But this set is precisely the set of linearly independent sections of E, so N is open and dense in M.\n\nNow, suppose X is the unit circle S^1 and n = 2. If m = 3, we want to find the number of linearly independent sections of E. Since the fibers of E are 2-dimensional, we can have at most 2 linearly independent sections. However, since m > n, there must be at least one linearly independent section. Therefore, E has exactly 2 linearly independent sections."
