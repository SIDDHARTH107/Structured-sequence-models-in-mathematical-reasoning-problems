    "message_1": "A trapezium has one side of length 3 cm, another side of length 7 cm, and the height of the trapezium is 4 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the shorter base a (3 cm) and the length of the longer base b (7 cm). The height (h) is 4 cm.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the longer base to the shorter base. Let's call the length of this line x. Now, we have two right triangles with heights 4 cm and bases x and (7 - 3) = 4 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the lengths of the other two sides of the trapezium (the legs of the right triangles).\n\nFor the first right triangle with base x and height 4 cm:\nx^2 + 4^2 = side1^2\n\nFor the second right triangle with base (7 - 3) = 4 cm and height 4 cm:\n4^2 + 4^2 = side2^2\n\nNow, we can solve for side1 and side2:\n\nside1^2 = x^2 + 4^2\nside1 = sqrt(x^2 + 16)\n\nside2^2 = 4^2 + 4^2\nside2^2 = 16 + 16\nside2^2 = 32\nside2 = sqrt(32)\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding all the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + side1 + side2\nPerimeter = 3 + 7 + sqrt(x^2 + 16) + sqrt(32)\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine the value of x, so we cannot find the exact perimeter of the trapezium. The perimeter will be in the form:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + sqrt(x^2 + 16) + sqrt(32)"
