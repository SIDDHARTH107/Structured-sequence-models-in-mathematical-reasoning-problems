    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. So, we can rewrite the second equation as:\n\n2(5x + 3y) = 2(19)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10x + 6y = 38\n\nSince both equations are the same, this system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. However, we can express y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n5x + 3y = 19\n\n3y = 19 - 5x\n\ny = (19 - 5x)/3\n\nSo, for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using the equation y = (19 - 5x)/3."
