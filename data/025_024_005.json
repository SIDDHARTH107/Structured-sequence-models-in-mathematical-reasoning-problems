    "message_2": "a) To show that the point (x, y) = (1, 0) lies on the curve defined by f(x, y) = 0, we need to substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation and check if it satisfies the equation.\n\nf(1, 0) = (1)^4 - 4(1)^2(0) + 5(0)^2 - 4(0) - 1\nf(1, 0) = 1 - 0 + 0 - 0 - 1\nf(1, 0) = 0\n\nSince f(1, 0) = 0, the point (x, y) = (1, 0) lies on the curve defined by f(x, y) = 0.\n\nb) To find the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, 0), we need to find the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y.\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x^3 - 8xy\n∂f/∂y = -4x^2 + 10y - 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 0):\n\n∂f/∂x(1, 0) = 4(1)^3 - 8(1)(0) = 4\n∂f/∂y(1, 0) = -4(1)^2 + 10(0) - 4 = -8\n\nThe gradient vector at the point (1, 0) is (4, -8). The tangent line to the curve at this point can be written as:\n\ny - 0 = -2(x - 1)\ny = -2x + 2\n\nc) To find the intersection of the tangent line with the x-axis, we need to find the point where y = 0:\n\n0 = -2x + 2\n2x = 2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the intersection of the tangent line with the x-axis is at the point (x, y) = (1, 0)."
