    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of vertices that can cover all the edges of the graph, we can use the vertex cover algorithm. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest possible vertex cover.\n\nFor the given graph, one possible minimum vertex cover is {1, 5, 4}. This set of vertices covers all the edges of the graph:\n\n- Vertex 1 covers edges (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5)\n- Vertex 5 covers edges (3,5) and (5,6)\n- Vertex 4 covers edges (2,4) and (4,6)\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices that can cover all the edges of the graph is 3."
