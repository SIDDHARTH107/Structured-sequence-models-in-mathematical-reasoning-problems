    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of f(z) along the path from z = 2 to z = 5 + i, we first need to simplify the function f(z) and find a function g(z) that agrees with f(z) on the segment [2, 5 + i] and is analytic on a domain containing the path.\n\nWe have f(z) = (z^2 - 3)/(z - 2). We can factor the numerator as follows:\n\nz^2 - 3 = (z - √3)(z + √3)\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n          z + 2\n        _________\nz - 2 | z^2 - 0z - 3\n        - (z^2 - 2z)\n        ___________\n               2z - 3\n               - (2z - 4)\n               _________\n                      1\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf(z) = z + 2 + 1/(z - 2)\n\nNow, let's find a function g(z) that agrees with f(z) on the segment [2, 5 + i] and is analytic on a domain containing the path. Since f(z) is already analytic everywhere except at z = 2, we can define g(z) as follows:\n\ng(z) = z + 2 + 1/(z - 2) for z ≠ 2\n\ng(z) is analytic everywhere except at z = 2, and it agrees with f(z) on the segment [2, 5 + i]. Therefore, g(z) is the analytic continuation of f(z) along the path from z = 2 to z = 5 + i."
