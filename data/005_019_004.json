    "message_1": "Consider a basketball player who has a free-throw shooting percentage of 80%. The player attempts 10 free throws in a game. \n\nIf the player makes a free throw, there is an 80% chance that they will make their next free throw attempt. If they miss a free throw, there's a 60% chance that they will make their next free throw attempt.\n\nWhat is the probability that the player makes exactly 7 out of their 10 free throw attempts?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the binomial theorem. Let's denote the probability of making a free throw after a successful attempt as P(S) = 0.8 and the probability of making a free throw after a missed attempt as P(M) = 0.6.\n\nWe need to find the probability of making exactly 7 out of 10 free throw attempts. There are multiple ways this can happen, and we need to consider all possible sequences of 7 successes (S) and 3 misses (M). We can represent these sequences as a string of S and M, for example, SSSSSSSMMM.\n\nThere are C(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 ways to arrange 7 successes and 3 misses in a sequence of 10 attempts. For each of these sequences, we can calculate the probability of that specific sequence occurring and then sum up the probabilities of all sequences.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of a specific sequence. For example, consider the sequence SSSSSSSMMM. The probability of this sequence occurring is:\n\nP(SSSSSSSMMM) = P(S) * P(S|S) * P(S|S) * P(S|S) * P(S|S) * P(S|S) * P(S|S) * P(M|S) * P(M|M) * P(M|M)\n\nSince the first attempt has an 80% chance of success, P(S) = 0.8. For the next 6 successful attempts, the probability is P(S|S) = 0.8. For the first miss after a successful attempt, the probability is P(M|S) = 0.2. For the next two misses after a miss, the probability is P(M|M) = 0.4.\n\nSo, P(SSSSSSSMMM) = 0.8 * 0.8^6 * 0.2 * 0.4^2 = 0.8^7 * 0.2 * 0.4^2.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability of all 120 possible sequences and sum them up. Since each sequence has the same probability structure (7 successes and 3 misses), we can multiply the probability of one sequence by the number of sequences:\n\nP(7 out of 10) = 120 * (0.8^7 * 0.2 * 0.4^2) â‰ˆ 0.2466\n\nSo, the probability that the player makes exactly 7 out of their 10 free throw attempts is approximately 24.66%."
