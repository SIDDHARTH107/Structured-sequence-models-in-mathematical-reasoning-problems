    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function $f(z) = e^{iz}$, we need to compute the integral:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(z) e^{-i\\omega z} dz$$\n\nwhere $F(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(z)$.\n\nSubstitute the given function $f(z) = e^{iz}$:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iz} e^{-i\\omega z} dz$$\n\nCombine the exponentials:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(z - \\omega)z} dz$$\n\nNow, we want to find the Fourier transform evaluated at $\\omega = 1$. So, substitute $\\omega = 1$:\n\n$$F(1) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(z - 1)z} dz$$\n\nThis integral does not converge, as the integrand does not decay to zero as $z \\to \\pm \\infty$. Therefore, the Fourier transform of $f(z) = e^{iz}$ evaluated at $\\omega = 1$ does not exist."
