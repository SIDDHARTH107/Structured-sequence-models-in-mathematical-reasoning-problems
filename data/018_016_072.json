    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A x B, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. Similarly, for B x A, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A x B and B x A. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nUnion(A x B, B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A. We can see that the elements in A x B are not the same as the elements in B x A. For example, (1, 3) is in A x B but not in B x A, and (3, 1) is in B x A but not in A x B.\n\nTherefore, A x B and B x A are not equal."
