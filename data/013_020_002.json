    "message_1": "In the Beauty Contest Game, there are 100 players who are all trying to guess what 2/3 of the average guess of everyone's number is. The numbers that can be guessed range from 0 to 100 inclusive. What is the optimal strategy for a player to use in order to win the game? If each player uses this strategy, what is the expected winning number that is guessed by all players?",
    "message_2": "In the Beauty Contest Game, the optimal strategy is to iteratively apply the reasoning of guessing 2/3 of the average guess. Let's go through the iterations:\n\n1. First, assume that all players guess randomly and uniformly between 0 and 100. The average guess would be 50, so a rational player would guess 2/3 of 50, which is 33.33 (rounded to 33).\n\n2. However, if all players are rational and think similarly, they would also guess 33. So, the new average guess would be 33, and a rational player would guess 2/3 of 33, which is 22.\n\n3. Continuing this process, the next guesses would be 2/3 of 22, which is 14.67 (rounded to 15), and then 2/3 of 15, which is 10.\n\n4. This process converges to 0 as the number of iterations increases. In practice, the optimal strategy would be to guess a number close to 0, as the iterative process suggests that players will keep lowering their guesses.\n\nIf each player uses this strategy, the expected winning number would also converge to 0. In reality, the winning number might not be exactly 0, but it would be close to 0 as players iteratively lower their guesses."
