    "message_1": "Suppose that you are a thief and you have a knapsack with a capacity of 10 pounds. You are trying to steal some valuable items with different weights and values. You have the following items:\n\n- A laptop that is worth $1000 and weighs 3 pounds\n- A camera that is worth $800 and weighs 2 pounds\n- A watch that is worth $200 and weighs 1 pound\n- A vase that is worth $500 and weighs 5 pounds\n\nYou can only carry items that have a total weight of 10 pounds or less. What is the maximum value of items you can steal? Use the 0-1 knapsack problem algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve the 0-1 knapsack problem, we will use dynamic programming. We will create a table with rows representing the items and columns representing the weight capacity of the knapsack. The cell at the ith row and jth column will represent the maximum value that can be obtained by considering the first i items and a knapsack capacity of j.\n\nHere is the table for the given problem:\n\n|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |1000|1000|1000|1000|1000|1000|1000|1000|\n| 2 | 0 | 0 |800|1000|1000|1800|1800|1800|1800|1800|1800|\n| 3 | 0 |200|800|1000|1200|1800|2000|2000|2000|2000|2000|\n| 4 | 0 |200|800|1000|1200|1800|2000|2000|2000|2000|2500|\n\nNow, we will fill the table using the following rules:\n\n1. If the weight of the current item is greater than the current knapsack capacity, the maximum value will be the same as the value obtained without the current item.\n2. If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current knapsack capacity, the maximum value will be the maximum of the value obtained without the current item and the value obtained by including the current item.\n\nAfter filling the table, the maximum value that can be obtained is in the bottom-right cell, which is $2500. Therefore, the maximum value of items you can steal is $2500."
