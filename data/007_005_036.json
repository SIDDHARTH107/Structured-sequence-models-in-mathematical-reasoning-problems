    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 16 and 24, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 16: 2^4 (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)\nPrime factorization of 24: 2^3 × 3 (2 × 2 × 2 × 3)\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\nLCM(16, 24) = 2^4 × 3 = 16 × 3 = 48\n\nSo, the LCM of 16 and 24 is 48."
