    "message_2": "To find the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 8, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element in a group must divide the order of the group.\n2. A group of order p^k, where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer, is called a p-group. In our case, 8 = 2^3, so we are looking for 2-groups.\n3. The number of elements of order p in a p-group is a multiple of p-1.\n\nNow, let's find the isomorphism classes of groups of order 8:\n\n1. Cyclic group: There exists an element of order 8 in the group. This group is isomorphic to Z_8, the additive group of integers modulo 8. This is the first isomorphism class.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: There are no elements of order 4 or 8, but there are 7 elements of order 2 (excluding the identity element). This group is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2. However, this group has 7 elements of order 2, which is not a multiple of 2-1 = 1. Therefore, there is no group of order 8 that is a direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2: There are no elements of order 8, but there is an element of order 4. This group is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_2. This is the second isomorphism class.\n\n4. Dihedral group: This group has 8 elements, with 4 elements of order 2 and 4 elements of order 4. It is the group of symmetries of a square and is denoted by D_4 or D_8 (depending on the notation used). This is the third isomorphism class.\n\nNow, we have found three isomorphism classes of groups of order 8:\n\n1. Z_8 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_4 × Z_2 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2)\n3. D_4 or D_8 (dihedral group)\n\nWe can show that there are no other isomorphism classes by considering the possible orders of elements in a group of order 8. Since the order of an element must divide the order of the group, the possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. We have already found representatives for each possible combination of element orders, so there are exactly three isomorphism classes of groups of order 8."
