    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the given function. The function is f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5. \n\nThe derivative of f(x) is:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nGiven that the initial guess is x0 = 1.5, we can calculate x1:\n\nf(x0) = (1.5)^3 - 2(1.5)^2 + 5 = 0.375\nf'(x0) = 3(1.5)^2 - 4(1.5) = 2.25\n\nx1 = 1.5 - (0.375 / 2.25) = 1.5 - 0.1667 = 1.3333\n\nNow, we will repeat the process until we reach the desired accuracy of 4 decimal places:\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\n\nf(x1) = (1.3333)^3 - 2(1.3333)^2 + 5 ≈ 1.1852\nf'(x1) = 3(1.3333)^2 - 4(1.3333) ≈ 0.4444\n\nx2 = 1.3333 - (1.1852 / 0.4444) ≈ 1.0000\n\nSince x2 is already correct to 4 decimal places, we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5, given the initial guess x0 = 1.5, is approximately x = 1.0000."
