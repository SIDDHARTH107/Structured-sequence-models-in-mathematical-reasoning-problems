    "message_2": "To find the missing angle of a triangle using the Law of Sines, we first need to find the angle opposite one of the given sides. Let's call the angles A, B, and C, and the sides opposite to them a, b, and c, respectively. Let's say side a = 8, side b = 12, and side c = x. We need to find angle A or B first.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find one of the angles. Let's find angle A:\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2 * b * c)\n\nHowever, we don't have the value of side c (x). We need to find the value of x first. We can use the Pythagorean theorem if the triangle is a right triangle. Let's check if it's a right triangle by seeing if the Pythagorean theorem holds true for the given sides:\n\n8^2 + 12^2 = x^2\n64 + 144 = x^2\n208 = x^2\n\nx = √208 ≈ 14.42\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find angle A using the Law of Cosines:\n\ncos(A) = (12^2 + 14.42^2 - 8^2) / (2 * 12 * 14.42)\ncos(A) ≈ 0.799\n\nA = arccos(0.799) ≈ 37.1°\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find angle B:\n\nsin(A) / a = sin(B) / b\nsin(37.1°) / 8 = sin(B) / 12\n\nsin(B) = (sin(37.1°) / 8) * 12\nsin(B) ≈ 0.799\n\nB = arcsin(0.799) ≈ 52.9°\n\nFinally, we can find angle C by subtracting the other two angles from 180°:\n\nC = 180° - A - B\nC = 180° - 37.1° - 52.9°\nC ≈ 90°\n\nThe missing angle of the triangle is approximately 90°."
