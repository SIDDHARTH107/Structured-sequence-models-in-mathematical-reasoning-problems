    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since the problem does not provide a specific universal set, we will assume that the universal set is the set of all integers, U = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. In other words, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set A:\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}\nA' = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 6, 7, 8, ...}\n\nNow we need to prove that the complement of set A is unique. To do this, we will use a proof by contradiction. Suppose there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also the complement of set A.\n\nThis means that there must be at least one element in B that is not in A' or vice versa. Let's say x is an element in B but not in A'. Since B is the complement of A, x must not be in A. However, since x is not in A', it means that x must be in A according to the definition of A'. This is a contradiction because we assumed that x is not in A.\n\nSimilarly, if there is an element y in A' but not in B, then y must be in A according to the definition of B being the complement of A. However, since y is in A', it means that y is not in A according to the definition of A'. This is also a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also the complement of set A is false. This means that the complement of set A is unique, and we have proven it."
