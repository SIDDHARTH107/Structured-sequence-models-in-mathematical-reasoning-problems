    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3x\n$$\n\nNow, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n3x^2 - 3y = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y\n$$\n\n$$\n3y^2 - 3x = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 = x\n$$\n\nWe can substitute $y^2$ for $x$ in the first equation:\n\n$$\nx^2 = y \\Rightarrow (y^2)^2 = y \\Rightarrow y^4 - y = 0\n$$\n\nFactoring the equation, we get:\n\n$$\ny(y^3 - 1) = 0 \\Rightarrow y(y - 1)(y^2 + y + 1) = 0\n$$\n\nThis gives us three possible values for $y$: $0$, $1$, and the roots of the quadratic equation $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$. The quadratic equation has no real roots, so we only need to consider $y = 0$ and $y = 1$. \n\nFor $y = 0$, we have $x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$. So, one critical point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nFor $y = 1$, we have $x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 1$. So, we have two more critical points: $(1, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points using the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -3\n$$\n\nWe can use the Hessian matrix to determine the type of each critical point:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor the critical point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -3 \\\\\n-3 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(f)) = 9 > 0$, and the trace is $\\text{tr}(H(f)) = 0$. Since the determinant is positive and the trace is zero, this critical point is a saddle point.\n\nFor the critical point $(1, 1)$:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & -3 \\\\\n-3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(f)) = 27 > 0$, and the trace is $\\text{tr}(H(f)) = 12 > 0$. Since the determinant is positive and the trace is positive, this critical point is a local minimum.\n\nFor the critical point $(-1, 1)$:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-6 & -3 \\\\\n-3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(f)) = 27 > 0$, and the trace is $\\text{tr}(H(f)) = 0$. Since the determinant is positive and the trace is zero, this critical point is also a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy$ has three critical points: one local minimum at $(1, 1)$ and two saddle points at $(0, 0)$ and $(-1, 1)$."
