    "message_2": "To find the determinant of matrix A using the Laplace expansion method, we will expand along the first row. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as follows:\n\ndet(A) = a11 * C11 - a12 * C12 + a13 * C13\n\nwhere a11, a12, and a13 are the elements of the first row, and C11, C12, and C13 are their respective cofactors.\n\nFirst, let's find the cofactors:\n\nC11 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing the first row and first column:\nC11 = det([[4, 2], [0, 2]]) = (4 * 2) - (2 * 0) = 8\n\nC12 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing the first row and second column:\nC12 = det([[0, 2], [1, 2]]) = (0 * 2) - (2 * 1) = -2\n\nC13 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing the first row and third column:\nC13 = det([[0, 4], [1, 0]]) = (0 * 0) - (4 * 1) = -4\n\nNow, let's substitute these cofactors into the determinant formula:\n\ndet(A) = a11 * C11 - a12 * C12 + a13 * C13\ndet(A) = 3 * 8 - 2 * (-2) + 1 * (-4)\ndet(A) = 24 + 4 - 4\ndet(A) = 24\n\nSo, the determinant of matrix A is 24."
