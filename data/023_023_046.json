    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve related to Fourier transform analysis of networks:\n\nConsider a communication network with a transfer function given by H(f) = 5/(1 + 4π^2f^2) where f is the frequency in Hz. \n\na) Find the bandwidth of the network.\n\nb) Determine the maximum data rate that can be transmitted through this network.\n\nc) Suppose the network is used to transmit a signal with a bandwidth of 1000 Hz. What is the maximum signal power that can be transmitted without causing distortion?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the bandwidth of the network, we need to find the frequency at which the transfer function H(f) is reduced to half of its maximum value. The maximum value of H(f) occurs when f = 0, which is H(0) = 5. Therefore, we need to find the frequency at which H(f) = 5/2.\n\n5/(1 + 4π^2f^2) = 5/2\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 + 4π^2f^2):\n\n5 = 5/2 * (1 + 4π^2f^2)\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n1 = 1/2 * (1 + 4π^2f^2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2 = 1 + 4π^2f^2\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n1 = 4π^2f^2\n\nDivide both sides by 4π^2:\n\n1/(4π^2) = f^2\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nf = 1/(2π)\n\nThe bandwidth of the network is 1/(2π) Hz.\n\nb) To determine the maximum data rate that can be transmitted through this network, we can use the Nyquist formula:\n\nData Rate = 2 * Bandwidth * log2(M)\n\nwhere M is the number of signal levels. Since we don't have information about the number of signal levels, we can only express the data rate in terms of M:\n\nData Rate = 2 * (1/(2π)) * log2(M) = (1/π) * log2(M) bps\n\nc) To find the maximum signal power that can be transmitted without causing distortion, we need to find the value of H(f) at the given bandwidth of 1000 Hz:\n\nH(1000) = 5/(1 + 4π^2(1000)^2)\n\nH(1000) ≈ 5/(1 + 4π^2 * 10^6) ≈ 5/(1 + 39.478 * 10^6) ≈ 5/(39.478 * 10^6)\n\nH(1000) ≈ 1.266 * 10^(-7)\n\nThe maximum signal power that can be transmitted without causing distortion is approximately 1.266 * 10^(-7) W."
