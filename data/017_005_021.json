    "message_2": "To determine whether G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 125, which is 5^3, we know that G is a p-group with p = 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 125.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. In this case, G would be a cyclic group of order 125.\n\nIf n_5 = 25, then there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, and we need to analyze the structure of G further. Let H be one of these Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the order of H is 5, H is cyclic, and we can write H = ⟨a⟩, where a has order 5.\n\nNow, let K be a normal subgroup of G with order 25 (which exists since G is a p-group). Since the order of K is 25, K is also a p-group, and it must have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say L. Since L is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of K, L must be normal in K. Let b be an element of order 25 in K, so K = ⟨b⟩.\n\nNow, we can consider the elements of G as pairs (a^i, b^j), where 0 ≤ i < 5 and 0 ≤ j < 25. The group operation in G can be defined as (a^i, b^j) * (a^k, b^l) = (a^(i+k), b^(j+l)). This operation makes G isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic group of order 5, generated by a, and the group of order 25, generated by b.\n\nIn conclusion, G can either be a cyclic group of order 125 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25, depending on the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G."
