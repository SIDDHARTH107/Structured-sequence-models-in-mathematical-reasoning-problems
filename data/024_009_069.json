    "message_2": "Since $M$ is diffeomorphic to the unit sphere $S^3$, we can assume that the Riemannian metric on $M$ is induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Let's use the standard spherical coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta, \\phi, \\psi)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^4$, where $\\rho \\in [0, \\infty)$, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi]$, and $\\psi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The unit sphere $S^3$ is given by $\\rho = 1$. \n\nThe metric tensor in these coordinates is given by:\n\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\rho^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\rho^2 \\sin^2 \\theta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\rho^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSince we are considering the unit sphere, we can set $\\rho = 1$. Thus, the metric tensor becomes:\n\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\sin^2 \\theta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\sin^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\phi\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to compute the Christoffel symbols, the Riemann curvature tensor, and finally, the scalar curvature. The Christoffel symbols are given by:\n\n$\\Gamma^i_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{il} (\\partial_j g_{lk} + \\partial_k g_{lj} - \\partial_l g_{jk})$\n\nAfter computing the Christoffel symbols, we can compute the Riemann curvature tensor components:\n\n$R^i_{jkl} = \\partial_k \\Gamma^i_{jl} - \\partial_l \\Gamma^i_{jk} + \\Gamma^i_{mk} \\Gamma^m_{jl} - \\Gamma^i_{ml} \\Gamma^m_{jk}$\n\nFinally, the scalar curvature is given by the contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor with the metric tensor:\n\n$R = g^{ij} R^k_{ikj}$\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the scalar curvature of the unit sphere $S^3$ is:\n\n$R = 6$"
