    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 10x, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative, f'(x)\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4) - d/dx(8x^3) + d/dx(6x^2) - d/dx(10x)\nf'(x) = 4*3x^(4-1) - 3*8x^(3-1) + 2*6x^(2-1) - 10\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 10\n\nStep 2: Find the second derivative, f''(x)\nNow, we differentiate f'(x) to find the second derivative:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3) - d/dx(24x^2) + d/dx(12x) - d/dx(10)\nf''(x) = 3*12x^(3-1) - 2*24x^(2-1) + 12\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 10x is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12."
