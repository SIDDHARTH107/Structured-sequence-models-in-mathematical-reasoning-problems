    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x, we get:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(4x)/dx\nf'(x) = 3 * 2 * x^(2-1) - 4 * 1 * x^(1-1)\nf'(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative of f(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 4\nf'(2) = 12 - 4\nf'(2) = 8\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) at x = 2 is 8."
