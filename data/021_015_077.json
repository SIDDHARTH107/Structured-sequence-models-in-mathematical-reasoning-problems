    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm with random positions and velocities for each particle within the given domain.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (i.e., the value of the function f(x, y) at the particle's position).\n3. Update the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions.\n4. Update the velocities and positions of each particle based on the pbest and gbest positions.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, y):\n    return x**2 + 4*y**2 - 3*x*y - 5*x - 6*y + 10\n\ndef pso(num_particles, num_iterations, w, c1, c2, x_bounds, y_bounds):\n    particles = []\n    for _ in range(num_particles):\n        x = random.uniform(x_bounds[0], x_bounds[1])\n        y = random.uniform(y_bounds[0], y_bounds[1])\n        vx = random.uniform(-abs(x_bounds[1] - x_bounds[0]), abs(x_bounds[1] - x_bounds[0]))\n        vy = random.uniform(-abs(y_bounds[1] - y_bounds[0]), abs(y_bounds[1] - y_bounds[0]))\n        particles.append({'pos': np.array([x, y]), 'vel': np.array([vx, vy]), 'pbest': np.array([x, y])})\n\n    gbest = particles[0]['pbest']\n    for particle in particles:\n        if f(*particle['pbest']) < f(*gbest):\n            gbest = particle['pbest']\n\n    for _ in range(num_iterations):\n        for particle in particles:\n            r1, r2 = random.random(), random.random()\n            particle['vel'] = w * particle['vel'] + c1 * r1 * (particle['pbest'] - particle['pos']) + c2 * r2 * (gbest - particle['pos'])\n            particle['pos'] += particle['vel']\n\n            if f(*particle['pos']) < f(*particle['pbest']):\n                particle['pbest'] = particle['pos']\n\n            if f(*particle['pbest']) < f(*gbest):\n                gbest = particle['pbest']\n\n    return gbest, f(*gbest)\n\nnum_particles = 50\nnum_iterations = 100\nw = 0.7\nc1 = 1.5\nc2 = 1.5\nx_bounds = (-10, 10)\ny_bounds = (-5, 5)\n\ngbest, min_value = pso(num_particles, num_iterations, w, c1, c2, x_bounds, y_bounds)\nprint(\"Minimum value found at position:\", gbest)\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function:\", min_value)\n```\n\nThis code initializes a swarm of 50 particles and runs the PSO algorithm for 100 iterations. The inertia weight (w) is set to 0.7, and the acceleration coefficients (c1 and c2) are set to 1.5. The x and y bounds are set according to the problem domain.\n\nNote that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution may not be the exact global minimum. However, it should provide a good approximation of the minimum value and its location."
