    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of the given graph, we can use the recursive deletion-contraction algorithm. The graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, and the edges as e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, and e9.\n\nWe start by choosing an edge, say e1 (connecting vertices A and B). We will compute the Tutte polynomial for the graph with e1 deleted (G\\e1) and the graph with e1 contracted (G/e1), and then combine the results.\n\nFor G\\e1, we have the graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E, and F, and edges e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, and e9. This graph is a cycle of length 6 (a hexagon). The Tutte polynomial for a cycle of length n is given by (x-1)^{n-1} + (y-1)^{n-1}. In this case, n = 6, so the Tutte polynomial for G\\e1 is (x-1)^5 + (y-1)^5.\n\nFor G/e1, we have the graph with vertices A (and B merged into A), C, D, E, and F, and edges e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, and e9. This graph is a 5-cycle with an additional edge connecting two non-adjacent vertices (a pentagon with a diagonal). The Tutte polynomial for this graph can be computed as T(x, y) = xT_1(y) + yT_2(x), where T_1(y) is the Tutte polynomial of a 4-cycle and T_2(x) is the Tutte polynomial of a 3-cycle. T_1(y) = (y-1)^3 and T_2(x) = (x-1)^2, so the Tutte polynomial for G/e1 is x(y-1)^3 + y(x-1)^2.\n\nNow, we combine the results for G\\e1 and G/e1 to get the Tutte polynomial for the original graph:\n\nT(x, y) = (x-1)^5 + (y-1)^5 + x(y-1)^3 + y(x-1)^2\n\nThis is the Tutte polynomial for the given graph."
