    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. Let's divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\nx + y = 5\nx + y = 5 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\nx + y = 5 (after dividing the third equation by 3)\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that there are infinitely many solutions along the line x + y = 5. To express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 5 - x\n\nSo the solutions can be any values of x and y that satisfy the equation y = 5 - x."
