    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A ∆ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nA ∆ B = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4})\nA ∆ B = ({1, 2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3})\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B. Let's assume the universal set U contains all the elements from 1 to 5 (for simplicity). Then:\n\nAc = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {4, 5}\nBc = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of Ac and Bc (Ac ∆ Bc):\n\nAc ∆ Bc = (Ac ∪ Bc) - (Ac ∩ Bc)\nAc ∆ Bc = ({4, 5} ∪ {1, 5}) - ({4, 5} ∩ {1, 5})\nAc ∆ Bc = ({1, 4, 5}) - ({5})\nAc ∆ Bc = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A ∆ B:\n\n(A ∆ B)c = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 4} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we can see that:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\nAc ∆ Bc = {1, 4}\n(A ∆ B)c = {2, 3, 5}\n\nThe symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (Ac ∆ Bc) is:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (Ac ∆ Bc) = ({1, 4} ∪ {1, 4}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {1, 4})\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (Ac ∆ Bc) = ({1, 4}) - ({1, 4})\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (Ac ∆ Bc) = {}\n\nThe symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (Ac ∆ Bc) is the empty set {}. However, (A ∆ B)c is {2, 3, 5}. Therefore, the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (Ac ∆ Bc) is not equal to (A ∆ B)c."
