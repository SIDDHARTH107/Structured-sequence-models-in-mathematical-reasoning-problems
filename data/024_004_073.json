    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the given point, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the surface equation.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^2 - y^2, we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = -2y\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 0), these partial derivatives become:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2\n∂z/∂y = 2\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = -2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we need to compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms. Let's denote the coefficients of the first fundamental form as E, F, and G, and the coefficients of the second fundamental form as L, M, and N.\n\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 = 1 + 2^2 = 5\nF = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y) = 2 * 2 = 4\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2 = 1 + 2^2 = 5\n\nL = ∂²z/∂x² / sqrt(E) = 2 / sqrt(5)\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y / sqrt(E*G - F^2) = 0 / sqrt(5*5 - 4^2) = 0\nN = ∂²z/∂y² / sqrt(G) = -2 / sqrt(5)\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature H using the following formula:\n\nH = (E*N + G*L - 2*F*M) / (2*(E*G - F^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nH = (5*(-2/5) + 5*(2/5) - 2*4*0) / (2*(5*5 - 4^2))\nH = (-2 + 2) / (2*(25 - 16))\nH = 0 / (2*9)\nH = 0\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, -1, 0) is 0."
