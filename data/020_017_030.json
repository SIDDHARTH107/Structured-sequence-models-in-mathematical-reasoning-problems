    "message_2": "To find the value of x that minimizes the integral of f(x) over the interval [1, 5], we first need to find the critical points of the function f(x) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, set f'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [1, 5] and the critical point x = 2 to determine which value of x minimizes the integral of f(x).\n\nEvaluate f(x) at x = 1, 2, and 5:\n\nf(1) = 1^2 - 4(1) + 5 = 2\nf(2) = 2^2 - 4(2) + 5 = 1\nf(5) = 5^2 - 4(5) + 5 = 20\n\nSince f(2) is the smallest value among f(1), f(2), and f(5), the value of x that minimizes the integral of f(x) over the interval [1, 5] is x = 2."
