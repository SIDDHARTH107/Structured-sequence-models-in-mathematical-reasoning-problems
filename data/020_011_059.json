The profit made from selling each unit of Product A is $5, and the profit made from selling each unit of Product B is $8. The company has 500 units of raw material available to manufacture these two products. \n\nNow, the goal is to maximize profit while utilizing all of the available raw material. However, the company also wants to maintain a minimum profit margin of $6 per unit. What is the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B that the company should manufacture to achieve this goal?",
    "message_2": "Since the company wants to maintain a minimum profit margin of $6 per unit, it cannot produce Product A, as its profit margin is only $5 per unit. Therefore, the company should focus on producing Product B, which has a profit margin of $8 per unit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The company has 500 units of raw material available, so the constraint is:\n\nx + y = 500\n\nSince the company cannot produce Product A due to the minimum profit margin requirement, x = 0. Therefore, the company should produce:\n\ny = 500\n\nSo, the optimal number of units to manufacture is 0 units of Product A and 500 units of Product B. This will result in a total profit of 500 * $8 = $4,000."
