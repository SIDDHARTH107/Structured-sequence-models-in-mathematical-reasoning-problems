    "message_2": "To determine the period and amplitude of the sine function y = 4sin(3x + pi/4), we need to analyze the equation.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 4. Therefore, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |coefficient of x|. So, the period of this function is (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the amplitude of the function y = 4sin(3x + pi/4) is 4, and the period is (2π) / 3."
