    "message_2": "There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, which are:\n\n1. Q32: The generalized quaternion group of order 32.\n2. D16 × Z2: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 16 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n3. (Z4 × Z4) ⋊ Z2: The semidirect product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n4. Z16 ⋊ Z2: The semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n5. Z8 ⋊ Z4: The semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n6. Z4 ⋊ Z8: The semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 8.\n\nTo prove that every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of these six non-abelian groups, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. If a group G of order 32 is abelian, then by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C32, C16 × C2, C8 × C4, C8 × C2 × C2, C4 × C4 × C2, or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2 × C2. The first one is the cyclic group C32, and the rest are not isomorphic to any of the six non-abelian groups listed above.\n\n2. If G is non-abelian, then by Sylow's Theorems, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P. Since the order of P is 32, P is a p-group, and by the Burnside's Basis Theorem, P has a minimal generating set of size 5 or less.\n\n3. If P has a minimal generating set of size 5, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16.\n\n4. If P has a minimal generating set of size 4, then G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups listed above.\n\n5. If P has a minimal generating set of size 3 or less, then G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups listed above."
