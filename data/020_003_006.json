Both products require two types of resources X and Y, as shown in the table below:\n\n|Product|Resource X (units)|Resource Y (units)|\n|-------|----------------|----------------|\n|A      |1               |2               |\n|B      |3               |1               |\n\nThe factory has 100 units of resource X and 80 units of resource Y. What is the maximum profit that the factory can earn? Use convex optimization to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using convex optimization, we need to formulate it as a linear programming problem. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the total profit:\n\nP = 5x + 10y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx + 3y ≤ 100 (Resource X constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 80 (Resource Y constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. We will use the graphical method here.\n\nFirst, we plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0: This constraint defines the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n2. x + 3y ≤ 100: The line x + 3y = 100 intersects the x-axis at (100, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 33.33). The region below this line satisfies the constraint.\n3. 2x + y ≤ 80: The line 2x + y = 80 intersects the x-axis at (40, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 80). The region below this line satisfies the constraint.\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these constraints. Now, we find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA (0, 0)\nB (0, 33.33)\nC (20, 20)\nD (40, 0)\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function P at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 5(0) + 10(0) = 0\nP(B) = 5(0) + 10(33.33) = 333.3\nP(C) = 5(20) + 10(20) = 300\nP(D) = 5(40) + 10(0) = 200\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at vertex B, with a profit of $333.3. Therefore, the factory should produce 0 units of product A and 33.33 units of product B to maximize its profit. However, since the factory can only produce whole units, it should produce 0 units of product A and 33 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $330."
