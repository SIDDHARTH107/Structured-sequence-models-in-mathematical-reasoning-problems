They collect the following data:\n\nNumber of hours studied | Test grade\n------------------------|--------------\n         3              |     75\n         5              |     81\n         2              |     62\n         4              |     74\n         6              |     89\n\nUsing the correlation coefficient formula, what is the correlation coefficient between the hours studied and the test grade? Is it a positive, negative or zero correlation?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the hours studied and the test grade, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere x represents the number of hours studied, y represents the test grade, x̄ is the mean of x, and ȳ is the mean of y.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of x (hours studied) and y (test grade):\n\nx̄ = (3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 6) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4\nȳ = (75 + 81 + 62 + 74 + 89) / 5 = 381 / 5 = 76.2\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nΣ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] = (3-4)(75-76.2) + (5-4)(81-76.2) + (2-4)(62-76.2) + (4-4)(74-76.2) + (6-4)(89-76.2)\n= (-1)(-1.2) + (1)(4.8) + (-2)(-14.2) + (0)(-2.2) + (2)(12.8)\n= 1.2 + 4.8 + 28.4 + 0 + 25.6 = 60\n\nΣ(x - x̄)² = (3-4)² + (5-4)² + (2-4)² + (4-4)² + (6-4)²\n= 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 10\n\nΣ(y - ȳ)² = (75-76.2)² + (81-76.2)² + (62-76.2)² + (74-76.2)² + (89-76.2)²\n= 1.44 + 23.04 + 201.64 + 4.84 + 163.84 = 394.8\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 60 / √(10 * 394.8) = 60 / √(3948) ≈ 0.955\n\nThe correlation coefficient is approximately 0.955, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the number of hours studied and the test grade."
