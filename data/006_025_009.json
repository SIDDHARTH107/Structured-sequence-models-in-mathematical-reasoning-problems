    "message_2": "There are 4 suits in a standard deck of 52 cards: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. If the magician has only one guess, he can choose one of the 4 suits. The probability that he will guess the correct suit is the number of successful outcomes (choosing the correct suit) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all 4 suits).\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1 (correct suit) / 4 (total suits)\n\nProbability = 1/4 or 0.25\n\nSo, the probability that the magician will correctly guess the suit of a randomly chosen card from a standard deck of 52 cards with only one guess is 1/4 or 0.25 (25%)."
