    "message_2": "To determine the number of odd natural numbers between 1 and 50 using inductive logic, the student can follow these steps:\n\n1. Establish a base case: There is one odd natural number between 1 and 1 (inclusive), which is 1 itself.\n\n2. Assume the statement is true for some natural number n: There are n odd natural numbers between 1 and 2n - 1 (inclusive).\n\n3. Prove the statement is true for n + 1: We need to show that there are n + 1 odd natural numbers between 1 and 2(n + 1) - 1 (inclusive).\n\nNotice that 2(n + 1) - 1 = 2n + 1. Since 2n - 1 is the last odd number in the range of 1 to 2n - 1, the next odd number is 2n + 1. Therefore, there are n + 1 odd natural numbers between 1 and 2n + 1 (inclusive).\n\n4. By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of n for which 2n + 1 is closest to 50 without exceeding it. In this case, n = 24, because 2(24) + 1 = 49. So, there are 24 odd natural numbers between 1 and 50 (inclusive)."
