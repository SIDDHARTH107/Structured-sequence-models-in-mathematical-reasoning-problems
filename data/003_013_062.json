    "message_1": "A tower is located at a distance of 20 meters from a point on the ground. The angle of elevation of the top of the tower from this point is 60 degrees. Find the height of the tower to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the height of the tower (opposite side) and the distance from the point on the ground to the tower (adjacent side).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\nIn this problem, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and the distance from the point on the ground to the tower is 20 meters. We want to find the height of the tower (opposite side).\n\ntan(60) = height / 20\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangent of 60 degrees. You can use a calculator or a trigonometry table to find the value.\n\ntan(60) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\n1.732 = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nheight ≈ 1.732 * 20\n\nheight ≈ 34.64\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tower is approximately 35 meters."
