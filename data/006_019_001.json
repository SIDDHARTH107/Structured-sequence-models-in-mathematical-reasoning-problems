    "message_1": "In a certain country, the probability of a random citizen supporting a political party A is 0.6, while the probability of supporting a political party B is 0.4. If a survey is conducted with a sample of 1000 citizens, what is the probability that at least 550 of them support political party A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, supporting party A)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size of 1000 citizens)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of citizens supporting party A)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 550 citizens support party A, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for 550 to 1000 citizens supporting party A. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(X ≥ 550) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 550 to 1000\n\nHowever, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability.\n\nThe binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ, where:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = √(n * p * (1-p))\n\nIn this case:\n\nμ = 1000 * 0.6 = 600\nσ = √(1000 * 0.6 * 0.4) ≈ 15.49\n\nNow, we can standardize the value we're interested in (550) by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\nz = (550 - 600) / 15.49 ≈ -3.23\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability of a z-score being less than or equal to -3.23:\n\nP(Z ≤ -3.23) ≈ 0.0006\n\nHowever, we want the probability of at least 550 citizens supporting party A, so we need to find the complement:\n\nP(X ≥ 550) = 1 - P(Z ≤ -3.23) = 1 - 0.0006 = 0.9994\n\nSo, the probability that at least 550 citizens out of 1000 support political party A is approximately 0.9994 or 99.94%."
