    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B:\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's confirm that the symmetric difference is commutative, i.e., A △ B = B △ A:\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince union and intersection are commutative, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, B △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nThus, A △ B = B △ A = {1, 2, 6, 7}, confirming that the symmetric difference is commutative."
