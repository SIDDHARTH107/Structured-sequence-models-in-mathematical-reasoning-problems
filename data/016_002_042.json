    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. After each iteration, the length of each side of the snowflake is multiplied by 4/3.\n\nLet's denote the length of the original equilateral triangle's side as L, which is given as 3 units. The perimeter of the original triangle is P = 3L.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each side is multiplied by 4/3, so the new perimeter is P1 = 3L * (4/3) = 4L.\n\nAfter the second iteration, the length of each side is again multiplied by 4/3, so the new perimeter is P2 = 4L * (4/3) = (16/3)L.\n\nWe can continue this pattern for six iterations:\n\nP3 = (16/3)L * (4/3) = (64/9)L\nP4 = (64/9)L * (4/3) = (256/27)L\nP5 = (256/27)L * (4/3) = (1024/81)L\nP6 = (1024/81)L * (4/3) = (4096/243)L\n\nNow, we can plug in the original side length L = 3 units:\n\nP6 = (4096/243) * 3 = 4096/81\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after six iterations is 4096/81 units."
