    "message_2": "To graph the function y = 2sin(x) on the interval [-2π, 2π], we first need to identify the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift of the function.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude of the function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which in this case is 2. So, the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of the function is the length of one complete cycle of the sine wave. Since there is no coefficient in front of the x inside the sine function, the period is the same as the period of the basic sine function, which is 2π.\n\nPhase Shift: The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the function. Since there is no constant added or subtracted inside the sine function, the phase shift is 0.\n\nVertical Shift: The vertical shift is the constant added or subtracted outside the sine function. Since there is no constant added or subtracted outside the sine function, the vertical shift is 0.\n\nNow, let's find the x and y intercepts and label the key points.\n\nX-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2sin(x)\nsin(x) = 0\n\nThe x-intercepts occur when x = nπ, where n is an integer. On the interval [-2π, 2π], the x-intercepts are -2π, -π, 0, π, and 2π.\n\nY-intercept: To find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y.\n\ny = 2sin(0)\ny = 0\n\nThe y-intercept is (0, 0).\n\nReference angles and key points: The key points of the sine function are the maximum, minimum, and the points where the function crosses the x-axis. We can use the reference angles of 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π to find these points.\n\n1. x = 0: y = 2sin(0) = 0, point (0, 0)\n2. x = π/2: y = 2sin(π/2) = 2, point (π/2, 2)\n3. x = π: y = 2sin(π) = 0, point (π, 0)\n4. x = 3π/2: y = 2sin(3π/2) = -2, point (3π/2, -2)\n5. x = 2π: y = 2sin(2π) = 0, point (2π, 0)\n\nFor the interval [-2π, 0], we can use the symmetry of the sine function to find the key points:\n\n1. x = -π/2: y = 2sin(-π/2) = -2, point (-π/2, -2)\n2. x = -π: y = 2sin(-π) = 0, point (-π, 0)\n3. x = -3π/2: y = 2sin(-3π/2) = 2, point (-3π/2, 2)\n4. x = -2π: y = 2sin(-2π) = 0, point (-2π, 0)\n\nNow, we can plot these key points and sketch the graph of the function y = 2sin(x) on the interval [-2π, 2π]."
