    "message_2": "To find the probability of encountering traffic at least once, we can first find the probability of not encountering traffic and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of not encountering traffic is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.\n\nNow, the probability of encountering traffic at least once is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7."
