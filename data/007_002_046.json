According to the problem, we have:\n\n420 = x * a + 3\n588 = x * b + 4\n882 = x * c + 5\n\nwhere a, b, and c are integers.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equations as:\n\nx * a = 420 - 3 = 417\nx * b = 588 - 4 = 584\nx * c = 882 - 5 = 877\n\nWe need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 417, 584, and 877, which will give us the value of x.\n\nPrime factorization of the numbers:\n\n417 = 3 * 139\n584 = 2^3 * 73\n877 = 877 (prime number)\n\nSince there are no common prime factors among 417, 584, and 877, their GCD is 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer that divides 420, 588, and 882 leaving remainders 3, 4, and 5, respectively, is 1."
