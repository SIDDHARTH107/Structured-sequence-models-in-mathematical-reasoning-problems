    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), G is a p-group. In this case, p = 5.\n\nAccording to the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 25.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. However, since n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5, we can eliminate 25 as a possibility. Thus, n_5 = 1.\n\nThis means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which we will call H. Since H is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. The order of H is 5, so H is a cyclic group of order 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of G/H is 25/5 = 5. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group of order 5.\n\nBy the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a subgroup K of G such that K/H is isomorphic to G/H. Since G/H is cyclic, K/H is also cyclic. The order of K/H is 5, so the order of K is 5^2 = 25.\n\nSince K is a subgroup of G and has the same order as G, K = G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 25.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is not cyclic. If G is not cyclic, then it cannot have an element of order 25. The possible orders of elements in G are 1, 5, and 25. Since G is not cyclic, it cannot have an element of order 25. Thus, all non-identity elements of G must have order 5.\n\nLet a and b be two non-identity elements of G such that a ≠ b and a ≠ b^(-1). Then, the subgroups generated by a and b, denoted by <a> and <b>, are both cyclic of order 5. Moreover, since a ≠ b and a ≠ b^(-1), <a> and <b> are distinct subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the set {ab : a ∈ <a>, b ∈ <b>}. This set has 5 * 5 = 25 elements, which is the same as the order of G. Moreover, since all elements of G have order 5, the set {ab : a ∈ <a>, b ∈ <b>} is closed under the group operation. Therefore, this set forms a group, which we will call G'.\n\nSince G' has the same order as G and is a subgroup of G, G' = G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of <a> and <b>, which are both cyclic groups of order 5. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 25, then G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
