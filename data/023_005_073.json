    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we first find the complementary solution and then the particular solution.\n\n1. Complementary solution:\nThe complementary equation is the homogeneous equation associated with the given differential equation:\n\n$y'' + 4y = 0$\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$r = \\pm 2i$\n\nThe complementary solution is of the form:\n\n$y_c(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x)$\n\n2. Particular solution:\nTo find the particular solution, we use the method of undetermined coefficients. We guess a solution of the form:\n\n$y_p(x) = A \\cos(3x) + B \\sin(3x)$\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\n$y_p'(x) = -3A \\sin(3x) + 3B \\cos(3x)$\n$y_p''(x) = -9A \\cos(3x) - 9B \\sin(3x)$\n\nSubstituting the particular solution and its derivatives into the given differential equation:\n\n$(-9A \\cos(3x) - 9B \\sin(3x)) + 4(A \\cos(3x) + B \\sin(3x)) = 2\\sin(3x)$\n\nSimplifying and equating coefficients:\n\n$-5A \\cos(3x) - 5B \\sin(3x) = 2\\sin(3x)$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$-5A = 0$\n$-5B = 2$\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\n$A = 0$\n$B = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nThus, the particular solution is:\n\n$y_p(x) = -\\frac{2}{5} \\sin(3x)$\n\n3. General solution:\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\n$y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x) - \\frac{2}{5} \\sin(3x)$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n$y(0) = 0 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) - \\frac{2}{5} \\sin(0)$\n$0 = C_1$\n\n$y'(0) = 1 = -2C_1 \\sin(0) + 2C_2 \\cos(0) - 3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} \\sin(0)$\n$1 = 2C_2$\n\nSolving for $C_1$ and $C_2$, we get:\n\n$C_1 = 0$\n$C_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the general solution with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2x) - \\frac{2}{5} \\sin(3x)$"
