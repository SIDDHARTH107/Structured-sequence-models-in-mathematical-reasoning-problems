    "message_1": "A dance team consisting of 5 boys and 5 girls want to create groups of 5 dancers each. How many distinct groups can they form if each group should have at least 2 boys and 2 girls? Use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Polya's enumeration theorem is not the most suitable method to solve this problem. Instead, we can use simple combinatorics to find the solution.\n\nWe need to form groups of 5 dancers with at least 2 boys and 2 girls. There are three possible scenarios for the composition of the groups:\n\n1. 2 boys and 3 girls\n2. 3 boys and 2 girls\n3. 4 boys and 1 girl\n\nWe will calculate the number of distinct groups for each scenario and then sum them up.\n\nScenario 1: 2 boys and 3 girls\nWe have 5 boys and need to choose 2, which can be done in C(5,2) ways. Similarly, we have 5 girls and need to choose 3, which can be done in C(5,3) ways. So, the total number of distinct groups for this scenario is C(5,2) * C(5,3).\n\nScenario 2: 3 boys and 2 girls\nWe have 5 boys and need to choose 3, which can be done in C(5,3) ways. Similarly, we have 5 girls and need to choose 2, which can be done in C(5,2) ways. So, the total number of distinct groups for this scenario is C(5,3) * C(5,2).\n\nScenario 3: 4 boys and 1 girl\nWe have 5 boys and need to choose 4, which can be done in C(5,4) ways. Similarly, we have 5 girls and need to choose 1, which can be done in C(5,1) ways. So, the total number of distinct groups for this scenario is C(5,4) * C(5,1).\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of distinct groups by summing up the results from all three scenarios:\n\nTotal distinct groups = C(5,2) * C(5,3) + C(5,3) * C(5,2) + C(5,4) * C(5,1)\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, we can compute the values:\n\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\nC(5,4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5\nC(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = 5\n\nSubstitute the values back into the equation:\n\nTotal distinct groups = 10 * 10 + 10 * 10 + 5 * 5 = 100 + 100 + 25 = 225\n\nSo, there are 225 distinct groups that can be formed with at least 2 boys and 2 girls."
