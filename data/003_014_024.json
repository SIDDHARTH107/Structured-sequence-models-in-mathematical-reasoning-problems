    "message_2": "To draw the graph of y = 2 sin(3x) in the domain [0, 2π], we first need to find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function.\n\nAmplitude: The amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 2, so the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is found by dividing 2π by the absolute value of the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3, so the period is 2π / |3| = 2π/3.\n\nPhase Shift: Since there is no horizontal shift in the function (i.e., it is not in the form sin(3x - c) or sin(3x + c)), the phase shift is 0.\n\nNow that we have the amplitude, period, and phase shift, we can draw the graph of y = 2 sin(3x) in the domain [0, 2π].\n\n1. Start by drawing the x-axis and y-axis.\n2. Mark the x-axis with the period, which is 2π/3. Divide the period into 4 equal parts to represent the critical points of the sine function (i.e., 0, π/3, 2π/3, and 2π).\n3. Mark the y-axis with the amplitude, which is 2. This means the maximum and minimum values of the function will be 2 and -2, respectively.\n4. Plot the critical points of the sine function:\n   - At x = 0, y = 2 sin(3 * 0) = 2 sin(0) = 0.\n   - At x = π/3, y = 2 sin(3 * π/3) = 2 sin(π) = 0.\n   - At x = 2π/3, y = 2 sin(3 * 2π/3) = 2 sin(2π) = 0.\n   - At x = π, y = 2 sin(3 * π) = 2 sin(3π) = 0.\n5. Connect the critical points with a smooth curve to complete the graph of y = 2 sin(3x) in the domain [0, 2π].\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 2, the period is 2π/3, and the phase shift is 0."
