    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (x^3 - 8) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator.\n\nThe numerator is a difference of cubes, so we can factor it as follows:\n\nx^3 - 8 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)) / (x - 2)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 2x + 4\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x^2 + 2x + 4)\n\nPlug in x = 2:\n\n(2)^2 + 2(2) + 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^3 - 8) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 12."
