    "message_2": "The logistic map function is given by the equation:\n\nx_n+1 = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the population at time n, and r is the growth parameter. When r = 3.6, the logistic map function exhibits chaotic behavior.\n\nTo find the first value of x_n that exhibits bifurcation to chaos, we need to iterate the logistic map function for a range of initial values of x_n (usually between 0 and 1) and observe the behavior of the function.\n\nLet's start with an initial value of x_0 = 0.5:\n\nx_1 = 3.6 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.9\nx_2 = 3.6 * 0.9 * (1 - 0.9) = 0.324\nx_3 = 3.6 * 0.324 * (1 - 0.324) = 0.790\nx_4 = 3.6 * 0.790 * (1 - 0.790) = 0.599\n...\n\nAs we continue iterating the function, we can observe that the values of x_n do not settle into a stable pattern or periodic cycle, but rather exhibit chaotic behavior. Therefore, the first value of the logistic map function that exhibits bifurcation to chaos when r = 3.6 is x_0 = 0.5."
