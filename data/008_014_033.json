    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\nA = | 1  2 -3 |\n    | 2  5  1 |\n    | 3 -1  2 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  6 |\n    | -4 |\n    |  7 |\n\nNow, we need to find the QR decomposition of matrix A, where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix. We can use the Gram-Schmidt process to find the QR decomposition.\n\n1. Normalize the first column of A:\nu1 = a1 = (1, 2, 3)\n||u1|| = √(1² + 2² + 3²) = √14\nq1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (1/√14, 2/√14, 3/√14)\n\n2. Subtract the projection of the second column of A onto q1, and normalize the result:\nu2 = a2 - (a2·q1)q1 = (2, 5, -1) - (11/7)(1/√14, 2/√14, 3/√14)\nu2 = (2 - 11/7, 5 - 22/7, -1 - 33/7)\n||u2|| = √(9/49 + 1/49 + 36/49) = √(46/49)\nq2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (9/7√46, 1/7√46, -6/7√46)\n\n3. Subtract the projection of the third column of A onto q1 and q2, and normalize the result:\nu3 = a3 - (a3·q1)q1 - (a3·q2)q2 = (-3, 1, 2) - (-1/7)(1/√14, 2/√14, 3/√14) - (-5/7)(9/7√46, 1/7√46, -6/7√46)\nu3 = (-3 + 1/7 - 45/49, 1 - 2/7 + 5/49, 2 - 3/7 + 30/49)\n||u3|| = √(16/49 + 9/49 + 1/49) = √(26/49)\nq3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (-8/7√26, 4/7√26, 2/7√26)\n\nNow, we have the orthogonal matrix Q:\n\nQ = | 1/√14  9/7√46 -8/7√26 |\n    | 2/√14  1/7√46  4/7√26 |\n    | 3/√14 -6/7√46  2/7√26 |\n\nThe upper triangular matrix R can be found by multiplying Q^T (transpose of Q) with A:\n\nR = Q^T * A\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b for x:\n\nx = R^(-1) * Q^T * b\n\nAfter solving this system, we get the values for x, y, and z:\n\nx ≈ 1\ny ≈ -1\nz ≈ 2\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = -1, and z = 2."
