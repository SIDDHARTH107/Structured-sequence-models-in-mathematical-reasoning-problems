    "message_1": "Suppose there exists a topological quantum field theory defined on the 3-sphere $S^3$ that assigns a number $Z(S^3)$ to $S^3$. If $Z(S^3) = 5$ and $Z(M) = 2$ for any closed 3-manifold $M$ homeomorphic to the connected sum of two copies of $S^1 \\times S^2$, what is the value of $Z(T^3)$, the number assigned to the 3-torus $T^3$?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of $Z(T^3)$, we can use the properties of topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) and the given information. In particular, we can use the fact that TQFTs are multiplicative under connected sums, meaning that if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two 3-manifolds, then $Z(M_1 \\# M_2) = Z(M_1) \\cdot Z(M_2)$.\n\nFirst, note that the 3-torus $T^3$ can be expressed as the connected sum of two copies of $S^1 \\times S^2$. To see this, consider the following decomposition of $T^3$:\n\n$T^3 = (S^1 \\times S^2) \\# (S^1 \\times S^2)$.\n\nNow, using the multiplicative property of TQFTs, we have:\n\n$Z(T^3) = Z((S^1 \\times S^2) \\# (S^1 \\times S^2)) = Z(S^1 \\times S^2) \\cdot Z(S^1 \\times S^2)$.\n\nSince we are given that $Z(M) = 2$ for any closed 3-manifold $M$ homeomorphic to the connected sum of two copies of $S^1 \\times S^2$, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n$Z(T^3) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $Z(T^3)$ is 4."
