    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the partial derivatives of the coefficients of $\\omega$ with respect to the variables $x$ and $y$, and then wedge them with the corresponding basis 1-forms.\n\n$\\omega = x^2y^2dx + xy^3dy$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2y^2) = 2x^1y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2y^2) = 2x^2y^1$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy^3) = y^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(xy^3) = 3xy^2$\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2y^2) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy^3)\\right)dx \\wedge dy$\n\n$d\\omega = (2x^2y^1 - y^3)dx \\wedge dy$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $d\\omega$ at the point $(2,1)$:\n\n$d\\omega(2,1) = (2(2)^2(1)^1 - (1)^3)dx \\wedge dy = (8 - 1)dx \\wedge dy = 7dx \\wedge dy$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ at the point $(2,1)$ is $7dx \\wedge dy$."
