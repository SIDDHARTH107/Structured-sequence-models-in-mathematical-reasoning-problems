    "message_2": "The iterative formula for constructing the 3rd order Hilbert curve is based on the L-system rules. The L-system rules for the Hilbert curve are as follows:\n\nVariables: A, B\nConstants: F, +, -\nAxiom: A\nRules: A -> -BF+AFA+FB-, B -> +AF-BFB-FA+\n\nTo construct the 3rd order Hilbert curve, we need to apply these rules three times.\n\n1st iteration: A -> -BF+AFA+FB-\n2nd iteration: -BF+AFA+FB- -> --BFBF-+AF-AFAF-AF+FB--BF+AFA+FB-FB+AF-AFAF-AF-BFBF++\n3rd iteration: Apply the rules to the result of the 2nd iteration.\n\nAfter the 3rd iteration, we will have the string representing the 3rd order Hilbert curve. The 'F' character in the string represents a line segment.\n\nTo find the number of line segments, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^n - 1\n\nwhere n is the order of the Hilbert curve.\n\nFor the 3rd order Hilbert curve:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^3 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63\n\nSo, the 3rd order Hilbert curve consists of 63 line segments."
