    "message_2": "To show that the degree of the canonical divisor is given by 2g-2-n, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) denotes the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles bounded by D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nNow, let's consider the canonical divisor K itself. Applying the Riemann-Roch theorem to K, we get:\n\nl(K) - l(K - K) = deg(K) + 1 - g.\n\nSince K - K is the zero divisor, l(K - K) = 1. Also, l(K) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic differentials on X, which is equal to the genus g. Therefore, we have:\n\ng - 1 = deg(K) + 1 - g.\n\nSolving for deg(K), we get:\n\ndeg(K) = 2g - 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the curve X has n points. Let P_1, P_2, ..., P_n be these points, and let D = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n be the divisor corresponding to these points. We want to compute the degree of the canonical divisor K - D.\n\nThe degree of D is the sum of the degrees of its points, which is n. Therefore, the degree of K - D is:\n\ndeg(K - D) = deg(K) - deg(D) = (2g - 2) - n.\n\nThus, the degree of the canonical divisor in this case is given by 2g-2-n."
