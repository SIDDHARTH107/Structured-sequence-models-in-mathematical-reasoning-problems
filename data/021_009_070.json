    "message_2": "To perform gradient descent, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any given point x.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, we will perform 10 iterations of gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1, starting at x = 0.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - learning_rate * f'(x0)\nx1 = 0 - 0.1 * (3(0)^2 - 8(0) + 5)\nx1 = 0 - 0.1 * 5\nx1 = -0.5\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - learning_rate * f'(x1)\nx2 = -0.5 - 0.1 * (3(-0.5)^2 - 8(-0.5) + 5)\nx2 = -0.5 - 0.1 * (3(0.25) + 4 + 5)\nx2 = -0.5 - 0.1 * (6.75)\nx2 = -1.175\n\nContinuing this process for 10 iterations:\n\nIteration 3: x3 = -1.505\nIteration 4: x4 = -1.619\nIteration 5: x5 = -1.659\nIteration 6: x6 = -1.673\nIteration 7: x7 = -1.677\nIteration 8: x8 = -1.679\nIteration 9: x9 = -1.679\nIteration 10: x10 = -1.679\n\nAfter 10 iterations, our final x value is approximately -1.679. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) at this point:\n\nf(x10) = (-1.679)^3 - 4(-1.679)^2 + 5(-1.679) + 2\nf(x10) â‰ˆ 3.746\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) after 10 iterations of gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1, starting at x = 0, is approximately 3.746."
