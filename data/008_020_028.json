    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the inverse method, we first need to find the inverse of the matrix of coefficients, and then multiply it by the matrix of constants.\n\nThe matrix of coefficients is:\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n      | 5  6  7 |\n      | 8  9 10 |\n\nThe matrix of constants is:\n\nB = | 14 |\n      | 32 |\n      | 50 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we will first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 2(6*10 - 7*9) - 3(5*10 - 7*8) + 4(5*9 - 6*8)\ndet(A) = 2(60 - 63) - 3(50 - 56) + 4(45 - 48)\ndet(A) = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\ndet(A) = -6 + 18 - 12\ndet(A) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is 0, the matrix A is singular, and it does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse method to solve this system of linear equations."
