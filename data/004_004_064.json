    "message_2": "To find the exact value of the area under the curve of f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1 between the limits x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of f(x) is:\n\n∫(3x^2 - 2x + 1) dx = ∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(2x) dx + ∫(1) dx\n\nNow, we find the antiderivatives of each term:\n\n∫(3x^2) dx = x^3 + C1\n∫(2x) dx = x^2 + C2\n∫(1) dx = x + C3\n\nSo, the integral of f(x) is:\n\nF(x) = x^3 - x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we evaluate F(x) at the limits x = 0 and x = 2:\n\nF(2) = (2)^3 - (2)^2 + (2) = 8 - 4 + 2 = 6\nF(0) = (0)^3 - (0)^2 + (0) = 0\n\nFinally, we find the area under the curve by subtracting F(0) from F(2):\n\nArea = F(2) - F(0) = 6 - 0 = 6\n\nThe exact value of the area under the curve of f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1 between the limits x = 0 and x = 2 is 6."
