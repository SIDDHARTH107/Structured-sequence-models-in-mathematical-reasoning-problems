    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a space-filling curve that can be constructed using an iterative process. The length of the Gosper curve increases with each iteration or order.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle of side length 1, the length of the Gosper curve of order 1 is given by the formula:\n\nLength (order 1) = side length * (7/3)\n\nLength (order 1) = 1 * (7/3) = 7/3\n\nFor each subsequent order, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of (7/3). So, to find the length of the Gosper curve of order 4, we can use the formula:\n\nLength (order n) = Length (order 1) * (7/3)^(n-1)\n\nLength (order 4) = (7/3) * (7/3)^(4-1)\nLength (order 4) = (7/3) * (7/3)^3\nLength (order 4) = (7/3) * (343/27)\nLength (order 4) = 2401/81\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve of order 4 for an equilateral triangle of side length 1 is 2401/81, which is approximately 29.641975."
