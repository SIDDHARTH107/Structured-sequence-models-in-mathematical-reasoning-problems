    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a key stream of length 8 bits to encrypt messages. The key stream is generated using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with polynomial x^5 + x^2 + 1. If the initial state of the LFSR is 10010 and the plaintext to be encrypted is 10111010, what is the corresponding ciphertext generated by the stream cipher?",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext, we need to first generate the key stream using the given LFSR polynomial and initial state, and then XOR the key stream with the plaintext.\n\nThe LFSR polynomial is x^5 + x^2 + 1, which means that the feedback is calculated from the 5th and 2nd bits. The initial state of the LFSR is 10010.\n\nLet's generate the key stream:\n\n1. Initial state: 10010\n2. Shift right and calculate feedback: 01001, feedback = 1 (1st and 4th bits are 1)\n3. Shift right and calculate feedback: 10100, feedback = 0 (1st and 4th bits are 0)\n4. Shift right and calculate feedback: 11010, feedback = 1 (1st and 4th bits are 1)\n5. Shift right and calculate feedback: 11101, feedback = 1 (1st and 4th bits are 1)\n6. Shift right and calculate feedback: 11110, feedback = 0 (1st and 4th bits are 0)\n7. Shift right and calculate feedback: 01111, feedback = 1 (1st and 4th bits are 1)\n8. Shift right and calculate feedback: 10111, feedback = 1 (1st and 4th bits are 1)\n\nThe key stream is 01001101.\n\nNow, we XOR the plaintext with the key stream:\n\nPlaintext:  10111010\nKey stream: 01001101\nCiphertext: 11110111\n\nSo, the ciphertext generated by the stream cipher is 11110111."
