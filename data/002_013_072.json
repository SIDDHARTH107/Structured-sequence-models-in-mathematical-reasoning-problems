    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base with dimensions of 10 cm by 6 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the volume of this pyramid in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base area can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase_area = 10 cm * 6 cm = 60 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 60 cm² * 8 cm = (1/3) * 480 cm³ = 160 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
