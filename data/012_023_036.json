    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (or clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nIn a graph G with 5 vertices, the maximum number of edges it can have without being a complete graph is 9 (since a complete graph on 5 vertices, K5, has 10 edges). Given that G has 6 edges, it is not a complete graph, so the clique number must be less than 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for the largest complete subgraph:\n\n1. A complete subgraph with 4 vertices (K4): This would require 6 edges (4 choose 2 = 6). Since G has 6 edges, it is possible that G contains a K4 subgraph. If we find such a subgraph, the clique number will be 4.\n\n2. A complete subgraph with 3 vertices (K3): This would require 3 edges (3 choose 2 = 3). If we don't find a K4 subgraph, we will check for a K3 subgraph.\n\nTo determine the clique number, we need more information about the specific connections between the vertices in G. However, based on the number of vertices and edges, the clique number of G is either 3 or 4."
