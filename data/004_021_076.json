    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x) with respect to x, which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nGiven the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 2, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = (3 * 2)x^(3-1) - (2 * 5)x^(2-1) + 3x^(1-1)\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 10x + 3)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = (2 * 6)x^(2-1) - 10x^(1-1)\n\nf''(x) = 12x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f''(x) = 12x - 10."
