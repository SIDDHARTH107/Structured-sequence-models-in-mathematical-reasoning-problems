    "message_2": "To minimize the surface area of the cylindrical can, we first need to find the expression for the surface area of the can. The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n$A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh$\n\nwhere $A$ is the surface area, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height. In this case, we have $r = 5\\text{ cm}$ and $h = 10\\text{ cm}$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$A = 2\\pi (5)^2 + 2\\pi (5)(10)$\n$A = 50\\pi + 100\\pi$\n$A = 150\\pi$\n\nNow that we have the surface area, we can find the volume of the can. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n$V = \\pi r^2h$\n\nPlugging in the values for $r$ and $h$, we get:\n\n$V = \\pi (5)^2(10)$\n$V = 250\\pi$\n\nSo, the volume of the can with minimum surface area is $250\\pi \\text{ cm}^3$. Rounded to two decimal places, this is approximately $785.40 \\text{ cm}^3$."
