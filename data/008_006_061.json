    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. \n\nA - λI = [3-λ  6; 1  4-λ]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\n|(A - λI)| = (3-λ)(4-λ) - (6)(1) = λ^2 - 7λ + 12 - 6 = λ^2 - 7λ + 6\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 6 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored as:\n\n(λ - 1)(λ - 6) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 6.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([2  6; 1  3]v1 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n2x + 6y = 0\nx + 3y = 0\n\nThese two equations are linearly dependent, so we can remove one of them:\n\nx + 3y = 0 => x = -3y\n\nLet y = 1, then x = -3. So, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 = 1 is:\n\nv1 = [-3; 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 6:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([-3  6; 1  -2]v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n-3x + 6y = 0\nx - 2y = 0\n\nThese two equations are linearly dependent, so we can remove one of them:\n\nx - 2y = 0 => x = 2y\n\nLet y = 1, then x = 2. So, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 = 6 is:\n\nv2 = [2; 1]\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of matrix A are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 6, with corresponding eigenvectors v1 = [-3; 1] and v2 = [2; 1]."
