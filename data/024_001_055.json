    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivatives:\nx'(t) = -2 sin t + 3 cos t\ny'(t) = 2 cos t + 3 sin t\nz'(t) = 4\n\nSecond derivatives:\nx''(t) = -2 cos t - 3 sin t\ny''(t) = -2 sin t + 3 cos t\nz''(t) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) at t = π/4.\n\nCurvature formula: k = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\n\nx'(π/4) = -2 sin(π/4) + 3 cos(π/4) = -√2 + 3√2 = 2√2\ny'(π/4) = 2 cos(π/4) + 3 sin(π/4) = 2√2 + 3√2 = 5√2\nz'(π/4) = 4\n\nx''(π/4) = -2 cos(π/4) - 3 sin(π/4) = -2√2 - 3√2 = -5√2\ny''(π/4) = -2 sin(π/4) + 3 cos(π/4) = -√2 + 3√2 = 2√2\nz''(π/4) = 0\n\nNow, we find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (0, -20, 20)\n\nThe magnitude of the cross product is:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = √(0^2 + (-20)^2 + 20^2) = 20√2\n\nThe magnitude of r'(t) is:\n\n||r'(t)|| = √((2√2)^2 + (5√2)^2 + 4^2) = √(8 + 50 + 16) = √74\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk = (20√2) / (74√74) = 10 / (37√74)\n\nNext, we find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n\nτ = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nThe dot product of r'(t) and (r'(t) x r''(t)) is:\n\n(2√2, 5√2, 4) • (0, -20, 20) = 0 - 100√2 + 80 = 80 - 100√2\n\nNow, we find the torsion:\n\nτ = (80 - 100√2) / (20√2)^2 = (80 - 100√2) / 800 = (2 - 5√2) / 20\n\nSo, the curvature k and torsion τ of the space curve at t = π/4 are:\n\nk = 10 / (37√74)\nτ = (2 - 5√2) / 20"
