    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem for a math student to solve using the firefly algorithm:\n\nSuppose we have a production function y = x1^(0.5) * x2^(0.5) where x1 represents the amount of labor and x2 represents the amount of capital used in a firm's production process. The cost of hiring labor is $10 per unit while the cost of capital is $20 per unit. Determine the optimal values of x1 and x2 that will minimize the cost of production while maintaining a production level of y = 100 units. Use the firefly algorithm to solve this optimization problem with a maximum of 50 iterations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the firefly algorithm, we first need to set up the problem and define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Minimize the cost function C(x1, x2) = 10x1 + 20x2\nConstraints: y = x1^(0.5) * x2^(0.5) = 100\nParameters: Number of fireflies (n) = 20, Maximum iterations (MaxIter) = 50, Absorption coefficient (gamma) = 1, Attraction coefficient (beta0) = 2, Randomization parameter (alpha) = 0.5\n\nNow, let's implement the firefly algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the fireflies' positions (x1 and x2) randomly within the feasible search space.\n2. Evaluate the objective function for each firefly.\n3. Sort the fireflies based on their objective function values.\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Update the attractiveness of each firefly based on their objective function values.\n   b. Move the less attractive fireflies towards the more attractive ones using the update equations:\n      x1_new = x1_old + beta * (x1_best - x1_old) + alpha * (rand() - 0.5)\n      x2_new = x2_old + beta * (x2_best - x2_old) + alpha * (rand() - 0.5)\n   c. Ensure the new positions are within the feasible search space.\n   d. Evaluate the objective function for the updated positions.\n   e. Update the best solution if a better one is found.\n   f. Repeat steps a-e for the specified number of iterations (MaxIter).\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm for 50 iterations, we will obtain the optimal values of x1 and x2 that minimize the cost function while maintaining the production level of y = 100 units. Note that the firefly algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution may not be the exact global minimum but should be close to it."
