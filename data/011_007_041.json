    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We have 10 people, and we want to divide them into 5 pairs. We can think of this as choosing the first person in each pair and then the second person in each pair.\n\nFirst, we choose the first person in the first pair. There are 10 choices for this. Then, we choose the second person in the first pair. There are 9 choices for this since we can't choose the person we already chose for the first person in the pair.\n\nNow, we move on to the second pair. There are 8 people left to choose from for the first person in the second pair. Then, there are 7 choices for the second person in the second pair.\n\nWe continue this process for all 5 pairs. So, the total number of ways to divide the group of 10 people into 5 pairs is:\n\n10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nHowever, we have over-counted the number of ways to divide the group into pairs. This is because the order in which we choose the pairs does not matter. For example, if we choose pairs (A, B), (C, D), (E, F), (G, H), (I, J) in that order, it is the same as choosing pairs (C, D), (A, B), (E, F), (G, H), (I, J) in that order.\n\nThere are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the 5 pairs, so we need to divide the total number of ways by 5! to account for this over-counting:\n\n(10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 / 120 = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to divide a group of 10 people into 5 pairs."
