    "message_2": "An Apollonian Gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the gaps between tangent circles with new circles. The number of circles in an Apollonian Gasket can be infinite as the process can be repeated indefinitely. However, I can help you find the radius of the next circle that would be added to the gasket.\n\nFor the starting three circles with radii R1, R2, and R3, the radius R4 of the next circle can be found using the formula:\n\n1/R4 = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + 2 * sqrt((1/R1 * 1/R2) + (1/R2 * 1/R3) + (1/R3 * 1/R1))\n\nGiven the radii of the starting circles as 1, 1, and 2, we can find the radius of the next circle:\n\n1/R4 = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/2 + 2 * sqrt((1/1 * 1/1) + (1/1 * 1/2) + (1/2 * 1/1))\n1/R4 = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 * sqrt((1) + (0.5) + (1))\n1/R4 = 2.5 + 2 * sqrt(2.5)\n1/R4 ≈ 7.071\nR4 ≈ 1/7.071 ≈ 0.141\n\nSo, the radius of the next circle added to the Apollonian Gasket would be approximately 0.141. Remember that the total number of circles in an Apollonian Gasket can be infinite as the process can be repeated indefinitely."
