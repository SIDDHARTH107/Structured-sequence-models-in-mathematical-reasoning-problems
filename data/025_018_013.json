    "message_2": "To find the intersection points between the curve X and the line L, we first need to find the equation of the line L. Since L passes through the points P(0,0) and Q(1,1), we can use the slope-point form of a line equation:\n\nL: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope of the line and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. In this case, we can use P(0,0) as our point:\n\nL: y - 0 = m(x - 0)\nL: y = mx\n\nNow we need to find the slope m. Since L passes through P and Q, we can use the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the coordinates of P and Q:\n\nm = (1 - 0) / (1 - 0)\nm = 1\n\nSo the equation of the line L is:\n\nL: y = x\n\nNow we need to find the intersection points between the curve X and the line L. To do this, we can substitute the equation of L into the equation of X:\n\nx² = (x³ - 2x)\n\nNow we need to solve this equation for x:\n\nx² - x³ + 2x = 0\nx(x² - x - 2) = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic part:\n\nx(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us three possible x-values for the intersection points: x = 0, x = 2, and x = -1.\n\nNow we can find the corresponding y-values using the equation of the line L:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny = 0\n\nFor x = 2:\ny = 2\n\nFor x = -1:\ny = -1\n\nSo the intersection points between the curve X and the line L are:\n\n(0, 0), (2, 2), and (-1, -1)."
