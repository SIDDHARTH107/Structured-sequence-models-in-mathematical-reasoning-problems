    "message_2": "In a soccer league with 10 teams, each team has to play against the other 9 teams exactly once. Since there are two teams in each match (home and away), we can use the combination formula to determine the total number of matches to be played in the league.\n\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams, k is the number of teams in each match, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 2.\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9) / (2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 2) = 90 / 2\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there will be a total of 45 matches to be played in the league."
