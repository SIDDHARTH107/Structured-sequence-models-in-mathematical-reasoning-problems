    "message_2": "Let's use the formula for finding the remainder:\n\nremainder = (3a + 7b) % 23\n\nwhere % denotes the modulo operation, which gives the remainder when the left side is divided by the right side.\n\nTo find the remainder, we need the values of a and b. Please provide the values of a and b."
