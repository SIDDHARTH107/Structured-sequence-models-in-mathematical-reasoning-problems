    "message_1": "A store owner wants to determine the optimal price to sell a certain product. The cost to produce each item is $5. The demand for the product is given by the equation Q = 120 - 2P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. Determine the price that maximizes the store owner's profit. How many units of the product should be produced and sold at this price to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the store owner's profit, we need to find the price (P) that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue can be calculated as the product of the price (P) and the quantity demanded (Q), which is given by the equation Q = 120 - 2P. The cost can be calculated as the product of the cost per item ($5) and the quantity demanded (Q).\n\nSo, the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = P * Q - 5 * Q\n\nNow, we need to substitute the demand equation (Q = 120 - 2P) into the profit function:\n\nProfit = P * (120 - 2P) - 5 * (120 - 2P)\n\nNext, we need to find the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and set it equal to 0 to find the maximum profit:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 0\n\nTo find the derivative, we first expand the profit function:\n\nProfit = 120P - 2P^2 - 600 + 10P\n\nNow, we find the derivative:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 120 - 4P + 10\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n0 = 130 - 4P\n\nNow, we solve for P:\n\n4P = 130\nP = 32.5\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize the store owner's profit is $32.5. Now, we need to find the quantity demanded (Q) at this price:\n\nQ = 120 - 2P\nQ = 120 - 2(32.5)\nQ = 120 - 65\nQ = 55\n\nTherefore, the store owner should produce and sell 55 units of the product at a price of $32.5 to maximize their profit."
