    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 3. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 2\n\nNow, we will use the following formula for the Newton-Raphson method:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nOur initial guess is x0 = 1.5, and we want to find the root with a tolerance of 0.0001. We will iterate until the absolute difference between consecutive x values is less than the tolerance.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^2 - 2*1.5 - 3) / (2*1.5 - 2)\nx1 = 1.5 - (-0.25) / (1)\nx1 = 1.75\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 1.75 - (1.75^2 - 2*1.75 - 3) / (2*1.75 - 2)\nx2 = 1.75 - (0.0625) / (1.5)\nx2 ≈ 1.708333\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 1.708333 - (1.708333^2 - 2*1.708333 - 3) / (2*1.708333 - 2)\nx3 ≈ 1.707107\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = 1.707107 - (1.707107^2 - 2*1.707107 - 3) / (2*1.707107 - 2)\nx4 ≈ 1.707107\n\nSince the absolute difference between x3 and x4 is less than the tolerance (0.0001), we can stop iterating. The root of the equation f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 1.5 and a tolerance of 0.0001 is approximately x ≈ 1.707107."
