The production process involves two machines, X and Y. The company has 120 hours of machine X and 150 hours of machine Y per week. It takes 2 hours of machine X and 1 hour of machine Y to produce a unit of type A, while it takes 1 hour of machine X and 3 hours of machine Y to produce a unit of type B. The profit per unit of type A is $6 and the profit per unit of type B is $8. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. Determine the optimal number of units of type A and type B the company should produce per week.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of type A and y be the number of units of type B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 6x + 8y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 120 (machine X constraint)\nx + 3y <= 150 (machine Y constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y <= 120\ny <= -2x + 120\n\n2. x + 3y <= 150\ny <= (-1/3)x + 50\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area enclosed by the lines y = -2x + 120, y = (-1/3)x + 50, x = 0, and y = 0.\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -2x + 120 and y = (-1/3)x + 50:\n-2x + 120 = (-1/3)x + 50\n(5/3)x = 70\nx = 42\ny = -2(42) + 120 = 36\n\n2. Intersection of y = -2x + 120 and x = 0:\ny = -2(0) + 120 = 120\n\n3. Intersection of y = (-1/3)x + 50 and x = 0:\ny = (-1/3)(0) + 50 = 50\n\n4. Intersection of y = (-1/3)x + 50 and y = 0:\n0 = (-1/3)x + 50\nx = 150\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 6x + 8y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(42, 36) = 6(42) + 8(36) = 252 + 288 = 540\n2. P(0, 120) = 6(0) + 8(120) = 960\n3. P(0, 50) = 6(0) + 8(50) = 400\n4. P(150, 0) = 6(150) + 8(0) = 900\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (42, 36), with a profit of $540. Therefore, the company should produce 42 units of type A and 36 units of type B per week to maximize its profit."
