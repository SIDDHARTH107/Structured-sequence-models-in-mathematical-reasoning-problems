    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\nThe half-life of a certain radioactive substance is 3 days. If there are initially 500 grams of the substance, how much will be left after 9 days? Round your answer to the nearest gram.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 500 grams, the time elapsed is 9 days, and the half-life is 3 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^(9/3)\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 62.5 grams\n\nRounding to the nearest gram, there will be approximately 63 grams of the radioactive substance left after 9 days."
