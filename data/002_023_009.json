    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 7 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (7 cm)²\nSurface area = 4 * π * 49 cm²\nSurface area ≈ 4 * 3.14159 * 49 cm²\nSurface area ≈ 12.56636 * 49 cm²\nSurface area ≈ 615.752 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 7 cm is approximately 615.752 cm²."
