    "message_2": "To determine if the statement P(x): \"x + 5 = 9\" is true or false when the domain is restricted to the set of positive integers, we need to find a positive integer value for x that satisfies the equation.\n\nx + 5 = 9\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\nx = 9 - 5\n\nx = 4\n\nSince 4 is a positive integer, the statement P(x): \"x + 5 = 9\" is true when the domain is restricted to the set of positive integers."
