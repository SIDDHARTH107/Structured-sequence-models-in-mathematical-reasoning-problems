    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first add x to both sides of the equation to get all the x terms on one side:\n\n2x + x + 4 = 10 - x + x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x + 4 = 10\n\nNext, we will subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x terms:\n\n3x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x = 6\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:\n\n3x / 3 = 6 / 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution for x in the equation 2x + 4 = 10 - x is x = 2."
