    "message_2": "Let $S = k\\langle x, y \\rangle \\setminus (x)$ be the complement of the prime ideal $(x)$ in the noncommutative polynomial ring $k\\langle x, y \\rangle$. We want to find the generators and relations for the Ore localization $S^{-1}k\\langle x, y \\rangle$.\n\nFirst, note that $S$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ since it contains $1$ and is closed under multiplication. Now, we can form the Ore localization $S^{-1}k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ as a set of fractions of the form $as^{-1}$, where $a \\in k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ and $s \\in S$. The multiplication in the localization is defined as $(as^{-1})(bs^{-1}) = (ab)(ss)^{-1}$.\n\nNow, let's find the generators and relations for the Ore localization. We will have the generators $x, y, s^{-1}$, where $s \\in S$. The relations will be the same as in the original ring, along with the relations coming from the localization process.\n\n1. $xy - qyx = 1$: This relation comes from the original ring $k\\langle x, y \\rangle$.\n\n2. $s^{-1}a = as^{-1}$ for all $a \\in k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ and $s \\in S$: This relation comes from the localization process.\n\n3. $s^{-1}as' = as'^{-1}s$ for all $a \\in k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ and $s, s' \\in S$: This relation comes from the localization process and ensures that the multiplication in the localization is well-defined.\n\nSo, the generators for the Ore localization of $k\\langle x, y \\rangle$ at the prime ideal $(x)$ are $x, y, s^{-1}$, where $s \\in S$, and the relations are given by (1), (2), and (3) above."
