    "message_1": "A student is given the following problem based on Bezout's Theorem:\n\n\"Two curves, represented by the equations x^2 + y^2 = 25 and 2x - y + 7 = 0, intersect each other at two points. Find the coordinates of these points using Bezout's Theorem.\"\n\nCan you solve the problem for the student?",
    "message_2": "Bezout's Theorem is not the appropriate method to solve this problem. Instead, we can use the method of substitution or elimination to find the intersection points of the two curves. Let's use substitution in this case.\n\nWe have the following equations:\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 = 25\n2) 2x - y + 7 = 0\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = 2x + 7\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into equation (1):\n\nx^2 + (2x + 7)^2 = 25\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\nx^2 + 4x^2 + 28x + 49 = 25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5x^2 + 28x + 24 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = 28, and c = 24:\n\nx = (-28 ± √(28^2 - 4 * 5 * 24)) / (2 * 5)\n\nx = (-28 ± √(784 - 480)) / 10\n\nx = (-28 ± √304) / 10\n\nx ≈ -0.8, x ≈ 6\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y values by plugging these x values back into the equation y = 2x + 7:\n\nFor x ≈ -0.8:\ny ≈ 2(-0.8) + 7\ny ≈ 5.6\n\nFor x ≈ 6:\ny ≈ 2(6) + 7\ny ≈ 19\n\nSo, the two intersection points are approximately (-0.8, 5.6) and (6, 19)."
