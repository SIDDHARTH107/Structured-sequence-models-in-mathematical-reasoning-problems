    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface along the curve at the point (0,0,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by (u,v) as follows:\n\nS(u,v) = (u, v, u*cos(v))\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nS_u = ∂S/∂u = (1, 0, cos(v))\nS_v = ∂S/∂v = (0, 1, -u*sin(v))\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nS_uu = ∂²S/∂u² = (0, 0, 0)\nS_uv = ∂²S/∂u∂v = (0, 0, -sin(v))\nS_vv = ∂²S/∂v² = (0, 0, -u*cos(v))\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <S_u, S_u> = 1^2 + 0^2 + cos^2(v) = 1 + cos^2(v)\nF = <S_u, S_v> = 0\nG = <S_v, S_v> = 1^2 + (-u*sin(v))^2 = 1 + u^2*sin^2(v)\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = <S_uu, N> = 0\nf = <S_uv, N> = -sin(v) / sqrt(1 + u^2*sin^2(v))\ng = <S_vv, N> = -u*cos(v) / sqrt(1 + u^2*sin^2(v))\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface S, given by the cross product of S_u and S_v, divided by its magnitude:\n\nN = (S_u × S_v) / ||S_u × S_v|| = (cos(v), -u*sin(v), 1) / sqrt(1 + u^2*sin^2(v))\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature K:\n\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2) = (0 - (-sin(v)*(-u*cos(v))) / ((1 + cos^2(v))*(1 + u^2*sin^2(v)))\n\nAt the point (0,0,0), we have u = 0 and v = 0, so sin(v) = 0 and cos(v) = 1:\n\nK(0,0) = (0 - 0) / ((1 + 1^2)*(1 + 0^2)) = 0 / 2 = 0\n\nTherefore, the sectional curvature of the surface along the curve at the point (0,0,0) is 0."
