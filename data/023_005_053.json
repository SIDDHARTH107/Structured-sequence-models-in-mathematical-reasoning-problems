    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (XT)}{\\partial t} = a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 (XT)}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nDividing both sides by $a^2 XT$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{a^2 T} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $\\frac{1}{X} \\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial x^2} = -\\lambda^2$\n\n2) $\\frac{1}{a^2 T} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(1,t) = 0$, we get:\n\n$X(0) = B = 0$ and $X(1) = A\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$. Thus, $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. So, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nNow, solving the second equation, we get:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n e^{-a^2 n^2 \\pi^2 t}$\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these solutions:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin(n\\pi x) e^{-a^2 n^2 \\pi^2 t}$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(20\\pi x)$:\n\n$\\sin(20\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nComparing both sides, we see that $C_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 20$ and $C_{20} = 1$. Thus, the temperature distribution in the rod for $t > 0$ is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(20\\pi x) e^{-a^2 (20\\pi)^2 t}$"
