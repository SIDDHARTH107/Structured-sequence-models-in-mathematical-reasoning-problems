    "message_2": "To determine if the group G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group G has order p * q, where p and q are prime numbers, then G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.\n\n2. A group G of order p * q is cyclic if and only if gcd(p, q) = 1 and there exists an element of order p * q in the group.\n\nIn our case, the order of the group G is 35, which is the product of two prime numbers, 5 and 7. Since gcd(5, 7) = 1, we can proceed to check if there exists an element of order 35 in the group.\n\nLet's assume that G has an element a of order 5 and an element b of order 7. Since gcd(5, 7) = 1, the elements a and b commute, i.e., ab = ba. Now, consider the element c = ab. The order of c is the smallest positive integer n such that c^n = e (the identity element of the group).\n\nWe have:\n\nc^n = (ab)^n = a^n * b^n (since a and b commute)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that a^n = e and b^n = e. Since the order of a is 5, a^5 = e, and since the order of b is 7, b^7 = e. Therefore, we need to find the smallest n such that n is a multiple of both 5 and 7. The smallest such n is the least common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35.\n\nThus, c^35 = a^35 * b^35 = (a^5)^7 * (b^7)^5 = e^7 * e^5 = e.\n\nSince there exists an element c of order 35 in the group G, the group G is cyclic."
