    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) is a measure of the rate of divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories in a dynamical system. In the context of a weather system, it can be used to quantify the predictability of the system. A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates chaotic behavior, while a negative exponent indicates stable behavior.\n\nGiven the divergence rate of 0.03, the Lyapunov exponent for this weather system is λ = 0.03. This positive value suggests that the system exhibits chaotic behavior, making it difficult to predict the future state of the system based on the initial conditions of 20°C in temperature and 60% humidity."
