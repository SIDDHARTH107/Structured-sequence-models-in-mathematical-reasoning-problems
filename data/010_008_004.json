    "message_2": "A simplicial complex is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in the complex is a face of both of them.\n\nIn this problem, we have a simplicial complex K with 21 vertices and 33 edges. We want to find the minimum number of faces that K must have in order to be a simplicial complex.\n\nLet's denote the number of faces by F. Since every edge is a face of some simplex, we know that F must be at least 33. However, we need to consider the condition that every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, each edge is part of a distinct triangle (2-simplex). In this case, we would need an additional 33 faces (the triangles themselves) to satisfy the condition that every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex. Therefore, the minimum number of faces that K must have in order to be a simplicial complex is 33 + 33 = 66."
