    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B, are playing the game of matching pennies. A wins if the coins match, and B wins if the coins are different. Each player has two coins - one labeled H (for heads) and the other labeled T (for tails). If both players play randomly, what is the probability that A wins the game?",
    "message_2": "In the game of matching pennies, there are 4 possible outcomes when both players play randomly:\n\n1. A chooses H and B chooses H (A wins)\n2. A chooses T and B chooses T (A wins)\n3. A chooses H and B chooses T (B wins)\n4. A chooses T and B chooses H (B wins)\n\nSince each player has 2 choices (H or T), there are a total of 2 x 2 = 4 possible outcomes. Out of these 4 outcomes, A wins in 2 of them. Therefore, the probability that A wins the game is:\n\n(Number of outcomes where A wins) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%."
