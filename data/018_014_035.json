    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B)'.\n\nTo find the complement of a set, we need to know the universal set U. Since we are not given a specific universal set, we will assume that the universal set is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in {1, 2} and b is in {3, 4}. Therefore, U = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\n(A x B)' is the set of all elements in U that are not in A x B. Since A x B contains all elements of U, (A x B)' is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNow let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively.\n\nAgain, we need to know the universal sets for A and B. Since we are not given specific universal sets, we will assume that the universal set for A is {1, 2} and the universal set for B is {3, 4}.\n\nA' is the set of all elements in the universal set for A that are not in A. Since A contains all elements of its universal set, A' is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nSimilarly, B' is the set of all elements in the universal set for B that are not in B. Since B contains all elements of its universal set, B' is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product A' x B', which is the set of all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' is in A' and b' is in B'.\n\nSince both A' and B' are empty sets, there are no elements to form ordered pairs. Therefore, A' x B' is also the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNow we can compare (A x B)' and A' x B'. We found that both (A x B)' and A' x B' are the empty set (∅). In this specific case, it appears that the Cartesian product is distributive over complement. However, this is not true in general.\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement, consider the following counterexample:\n\nLet A = {1} and B = {2}. Let the universal set for A be {1, 3} and the universal set for B be {2, 4}.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2)}\n\n(A x B)' = {(1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nA' = {3} and B' = {4}\n\nA' x B' = {(3, 4)}\n\nIn this example, (A x B)' ≠ A' x B', which demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement in general."
