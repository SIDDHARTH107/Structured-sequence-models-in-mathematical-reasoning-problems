The standard deviations of the returns for the three stocks are 15%, 20%, and 25% respectively. If you have a total investment budget of $100,000 and want to minimize the risk of the portfolio, what is the optimal allocation of funds for each stock?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the risk of the portfolio, we need to find the optimal allocation of funds for each stock that minimizes the portfolio's variance. We can use the concept of portfolio variance, which is given by the following formula:\n\nPortfolio Variance = w1^2 * σ1^2 + w2^2 * σ2^2 + w3^2 * σ3^2 + 2 * w1 * w2 * Cov(A, B) + 2 * w1 * w3 * Cov(A, C) + 2 * w2 * w3 * Cov(B, C)\n\nwhere w1, w2, and w3 are the weights of stocks A, B, and C in the portfolio, σ1, σ2, and σ3 are the standard deviations of the returns for the three stocks, and Cov(A, B), Cov(A, C), and Cov(B, C) are the covariances between the returns of the stocks.\n\nHowever, we do not have information about the covariances between the stocks. In this case, we can use the concept of diversification to minimize the risk. Diversification suggests that we should allocate funds to different stocks in such a way that the overall risk of the portfolio is minimized.\n\nSince we do not have information about the correlations between the stocks, we can assume that they are uncorrelated. In this case, the optimal allocation would be to invest in the stock with the lowest risk (lowest standard deviation) to minimize the overall risk of the portfolio.\n\nIn this case, stock A has the lowest standard deviation (15%). Therefore, to minimize the risk of the portfolio, we should allocate the entire investment budget of $100,000 to stock A.\n\nOptimal allocation:\nStock A: $100,000\nStock B: $0\nStock C: $0"
