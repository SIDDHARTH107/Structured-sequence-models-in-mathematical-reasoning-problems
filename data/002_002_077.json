    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)³\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV = 500/3π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nV ≈ 500/3 * 3.14\nV ≈ 166.67 * 3.14\nV ≈ 523.33 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.33 cm³, rounded to two decimal places."
