    "message_1": "In a public goods game, there are 5 players with $10 each. Each player decides how much money they will contribute to a common fund. The common fund is then multiplied by a factor of 2 and equally distributed among all players, regardless of how much they individually contributed. If all players contribute the same amount, what is the maximum amount each player can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume all players contribute the maximum amount, which is their entire $10. The common fund would then have a total of 5 * $10 = $50. The fund is then multiplied by a factor of 2, resulting in $50 * 2 = $100. This amount is then equally distributed among all 5 players, so each player would receive $100 / 5 = $20. Therefore, the maximum amount each player can earn is $20."
