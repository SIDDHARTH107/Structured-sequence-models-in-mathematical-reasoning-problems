    "message_1": "Suppose that a company has 50 computers connected to its network. The probability of a cyber attack occurring on any given computer per month is 0.1. What is the probability that at least 5 computers on the network will experience a cyber attack in a given month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 5 computers experiencing a cyber attack, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of fewer than 5 computers experiencing a cyber attack. Then, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 computers experiencing a cyber attack.\n\nLet X be the number of computers experiencing a cyber attack. We want to find P(X ≥ 5). We can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of computers (50), k is the number of computers experiencing a cyber attack, p is the probability of a cyber attack on a single computer (0.1), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, we find the complementary probability P(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4).\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.1)^0 * (0.9)^50\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.1)^1 * (0.9)^49\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.1)^2 * (0.9)^48\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * (0.1)^3 * (0.9)^47\nP(X = 4) = C(50, 4) * (0.1)^4 * (0.9)^46\n\nCalculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.000002\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.000045\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.000516\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.003647\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.016272\n\nNow, find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) ≈ 0.000002 + 0.000045 + 0.000516 + 0.003647 + 0.016272 ≈ 0.020482\n\nFinally, find the probability of at least 5 computers experiencing a cyber attack:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) ≈ 1 - 0.020482 ≈ 0.979518\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 computers on the network will experience a cyber attack in a given month is approximately 0.979518 or 97.95%."
