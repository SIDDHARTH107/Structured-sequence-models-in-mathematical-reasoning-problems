    "message_1": "A math student is asked to classify the degree 3 rational curves passing through 5 given points in the projective plane. How many types of degree 3 rational curves pass through the given points?",
    "message_2": "In the projective plane, a degree 3 rational curve can be represented by a map from the projective line P^1 to the projective plane P^2. The map can be given by three homogeneous polynomials of degree 3 in two variables, say [f(x,y):g(x,y):h(x,y)]. Since the curve is rational, we can assume that the polynomials have no common factors.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of types of degree 3 rational curves that pass through 5 given points. Let's denote these points as p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5.\n\nFor a curve to pass through a point, the polynomials f, g, and h must satisfy the equation of the point. So, we have 5 equations for the 5 points:\n\nf(p1) = g(p1) = h(p1) = 0\nf(p2) = g(p2) = h(p2) = 0\nf(p3) = g(p3) = h(p3) = 0\nf(p4) = g(p4) = h(p4) = 0\nf(p5) = g(p5) = h(p5) = 0\n\nSince the curve is of degree 3, there are 4 degrees of freedom for the curve. However, we have 5 conditions from the 5 points, so we need to find the number of types of curves that satisfy these conditions.\n\nBy the theorem of BeÃÅzout, the number of intersection points of two curves of degrees m and n is equal to m*n, provided that the curves have no common components. In our case, we have a degree 3 curve and a degree 1 curve (the line at infinity), so the number of intersection points is 3*1 = 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 types of degree 3 rational curves that pass through the 5 given points in the projective plane."
