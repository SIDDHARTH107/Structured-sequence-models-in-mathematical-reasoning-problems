    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we first need to find the largest side, which is already given as 20 cm. The smallest angle will be opposite to the largest side. Let's denote the angles opposite to the sides of length 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm as A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe will use the Law of Cosines to find the smallest angle (C) first:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nwhere a = 10 cm, b = 15 cm, and c = 20 cm.\n\ncos(C) = (10^2 + 15^2 - 20^2) / (2 * 10 * 15)\ncos(C) = (100 + 225 - 400) / 300\ncos(C) = (-75) / 300\n\nNow, we find the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nC = arccos(-75/300)\nC ≈ 106.26°\n\nNow that we have the largest angle, we can use the Law of Sines to find the other angles:\n\nsin(A) / a = sin(B) / b = sin(C) / c\n\nWe can find angle A using:\n\nsin(A) / 10 = sin(106.26°) / 20\n\nsin(A) = (10 * sin(106.26°)) / 20\n\nNow, we find the inverse sine (arcsin) of the value:\n\nA = arcsin((10 * sin(106.26°)) / 20)\nA ≈ 30.47°\n\nFinally, we can find angle B using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nB = 180° - A - C\nB = 180° - 30.47° - 106.26°\nB ≈ 43.27°\n\nThe smallest angle in the triangle is angle A, which is approximately 30.47°."
