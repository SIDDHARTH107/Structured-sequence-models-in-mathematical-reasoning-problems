    "message_2": "To determine the dimensions of the cohomology groups H^k(X,ℚ) for k = 0,1,2, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic χ(X) is equal to the alternating sum of the dimensions of the cohomology groups. That is:\n\nχ(X) = dim H^0(X,ℚ) - dim H^1(X,ℚ) + dim H^2(X,ℚ)\n\nSince X is a compact connected surface without boundary, we know that:\n\n1. H^0(X,ℚ) is isomorphic to ℚ, so dim H^0(X,ℚ) = 1.\n2. H^2(X,ℚ) is isomorphic to ℚ, so dim H^2(X,ℚ) = 1.\n\nNow, we are given that χ(X) = 2. Plugging in the dimensions of H^0(X,ℚ) and H^2(X,ℚ) into the formula, we get:\n\n2 = 1 - dim H^1(X,ℚ) + 1\n\nSolving for dim H^1(X,ℚ), we find that:\n\ndim H^1(X,ℚ) = 0\n\nThus, the dimensions of the cohomology groups H^k(X,ℚ) for k = 0,1,2 are:\n\ndim H^0(X,ℚ) = 1\ndim H^1(X,ℚ) = 0\ndim H^2(X,ℚ) = 1"
