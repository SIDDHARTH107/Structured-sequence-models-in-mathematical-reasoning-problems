    "message_2": "To find the edge connectivity of the given graph, we need to identify the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\n```\n    A - B - C\n    |     |    \n    D - E - F\n```\n\nWe can see that by removing the edges (A, B), (B, C), and (B, E), the graph will be disconnected. There are no other combinations of fewer edges that can be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the edge connectivity of the given graph is 3."
