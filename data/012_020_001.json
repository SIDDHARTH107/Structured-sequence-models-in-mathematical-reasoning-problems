    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a complete graph K_n is the symmetric group S_n, which consists of all possible permutations of the n vertices. This is because any permutation of the vertices of K_n will result in an isomorphic graph, as all vertices are connected to each other.\n\nFor the complete graph K_7, its automorphism group is the symmetric group S_7. The order of S_7 is 7! (7 factorial), which is equal to 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040.\n\nTherefore, the automorphism group of K_7 is S_7, and it has 5,040 elements (symmetries)."
