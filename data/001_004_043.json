    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x^2 + 5x + 6, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give the original expression. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term (6) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (5).\n\nThe two numbers that satisfy these conditions are 2 and 3, since 2 * 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n(x + 2)(x + 3)"
