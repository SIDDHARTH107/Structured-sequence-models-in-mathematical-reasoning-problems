    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. Each round uses a 48-bit key. If we use 16 rounds in this Feistel cipher, how many total keys are used in the encryption and decryption processes?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, each round uses a unique subkey derived from the main key. Since there are 16 rounds in this Feistel cipher, there will be 16 unique subkeys used for the encryption process. \n\nFor the decryption process, the same 16 subkeys are used but in the reverse order. Therefore, no additional unique keys are needed for decryption.\n\nSo, the total number of keys used in both encryption and decryption processes is 16."
