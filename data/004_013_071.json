    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 5 on the interval [0, 4], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function. \n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 5) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, we have one critical point at x = 2. Now, we need to evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^2 - 12(0) + 5 = 5\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 5 = 3(4) - 24 + 5 = 12 - 24 + 5 = -7\nf(4) = 3(4)^2 - 12(4) + 5 = 3(16) - 48 + 5 = 48 - 48 + 5 = 5\n\nNow, we can compare the values of the function at these points:\n\nf(0) = 5\nf(2) = -7\nf(4) = 5\n\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is -7, which occurs at x = 2. The maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is 5, which occurs at both x = 0 and x = 4."
