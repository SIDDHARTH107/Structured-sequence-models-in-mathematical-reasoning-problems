    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA restaurant owner recorded the hourly sales for 30 consecutive days. The average hourly sales for the period was $100, with a standard deviation of $10. However, one day the restaurant made an unusually high hourly sale of $250. Determine whether this sale is an outlier or not using the 3-sigma rule.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the unusually high hourly sale of $250 is an outlier using the 3-sigma rule, we need to calculate the range within which 99.7% of the data should fall.\n\nThe 3-sigma rule states that approximately 99.7% of the data should fall within three standard deviations (σ) of the mean (μ). In this case, the mean is $100, and the standard deviation is $10.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the 3-sigma range:\n\nLower bound = μ - 3σ = 100 - 3(10) = 100 - 30 = $70\nUpper bound = μ + 3σ = 100 + 3(10) = 100 + 30 = $130\n\nNow, we can determine if the unusually high hourly sale of $250 is an outlier:\n\nSince $250 is outside the range of $70 to $130, it is considered an outlier according to the 3-sigma rule."
