    "message_2": "To find the intersection of A and its complement, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. In this case, let's consider the universal set U to be the set of the first 11 natural numbers, as the largest prime number in A is 11.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, denoted as A'. A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the intersection of A and A', denoted as A ∩ A'. This is the set of all elements that are common to both A and A'.\n\nA ∩ A' = {}\n\nAs there are no common elements between A and A', the intersection is the empty set, denoted as {}. This proves that the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set."
