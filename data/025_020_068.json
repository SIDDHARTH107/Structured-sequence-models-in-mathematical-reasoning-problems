    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the middle cohomology group H^3(X,C), we can use the Hodge diamond, which relates the Hodge numbers of a Calabi-Yau variety. The Hodge diamond for a Calabi-Yau n-fold is given by:\n\nh^{p,q}(X) = h^{n-p,n-q}(X)\n\nIn our case, X is a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, so n = 3. We are given h^{1,1}(X) = 3 and h^{2,1}(X) = 243. Using the Hodge diamond, we can find the other Hodge numbers:\n\nh^{0,0}(X) = h^{3,3}(X) = 1 (since X is a Calabi-Yau variety)\nh^{1,2}(X) = h^{2,1}(X) = 243\nh^{2,0}(X) = h^{1,1}(X) = 3\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of the middle cohomology group H^3(X,C) using the Hodge numbers:\n\ndim H^3(X,C) = h^{3,0}(X) + h^{2,1}(X) + h^{1,2}(X) + h^{0,3}(X)\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\ndim H^3(X,C) = 1 + 243 + 243 + 1 = 488\n\nSo, the dimension of the middle cohomology group H^3(X,C) is 488."
