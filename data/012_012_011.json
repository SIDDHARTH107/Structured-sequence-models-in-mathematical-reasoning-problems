    "message_2": "To find the girth of a graph, we need to find the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In this case, we have a graph with 12 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 4.\n\nLet's consider the smallest possible cycle in a graph with degree 4 vertices: a 3-cycle. In a 3-cycle, each vertex is connected to two other vertices, forming a triangle. However, since each vertex in our graph has a degree of 4, it must be connected to two more vertices outside the triangle. This means that a 3-cycle cannot exist in our graph.\n\nNow let's consider a 4-cycle. In a 4-cycle, each vertex is connected to two other vertices, forming a square. Since each vertex has a degree of 4, it must be connected to two more vertices outside the square. It is possible to construct a graph with 12 vertices and degree 4 vertices that contains a 4-cycle.\n\nHere's an example of such a graph:\n\n1. Divide the 12 vertices into two sets of 6 vertices each: {A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6} and {B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6}.\n2. Connect each vertex in set A to its two neighbors in set A (e.g., A1 to A2 and A6, A2 to A1 and A3, etc.), forming a 6-cycle.\n3. Connect each vertex in set B to its two neighbors in set B, forming another 6-cycle.\n4. Connect each vertex in set A to the corresponding vertex in set B (e.g., A1 to B1, A2 to B2, etc.), forming 6 4-cycles.\n\nIn this graph, each vertex has a degree of 4, and the shortest cycle is a 4-cycle. Therefore, the girth of the graph is 4."
