    "message_2": "To find the intersection of set A and its complement A', we first need to find the complement of set A. The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nSet A = {3, 5, 7, 9}\nUniversal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSo, A' = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, we find the intersection of set A and A', which means we are looking for elements that are common to both sets. However, by definition, the complement of a set contains elements that are not in the original set. Therefore, there are no common elements between set A and its complement A'.\n\nThus, A ∩ A' = ∅ (the empty set)"
