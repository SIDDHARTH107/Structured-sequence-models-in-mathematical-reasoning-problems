    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we will use the deletion-contraction method. The graph G can be represented as follows:\n\n```\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 5\n      \\\n       4\n```\n\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of G, where k is the number of colors. We will first consider the edge connecting vertices 2 and 3.\n\n1. Delete the edge (2, 3). The resulting graph G' is a tree, and the chromatic polynomial of a tree is P(T, k) = k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 5, so P(G', k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\n2. Contract the edge (2, 3). The resulting graph G'' has 4 vertices, and it is a cycle of length 4. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of even length is P(C, k) = (k-1)^n - (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 4, so P(G'', k) = (k-1)^4 - (-1)^4(k-1).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G using the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - [(k-1)^4 - (k-1)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1)."
