    "message_1": "What is the probability that a hurricane will hit a coastal region within a given year, based on historical data showing that an average of 2 hurricanes hit the region every 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane hitting the coastal region within a given year, we can use the historical data provided.\n\nOn average, 2 hurricanes hit the region every 5 years. To find the average number of hurricanes per year, we can divide the total number of hurricanes by the total number of years:\n\n2 hurricanes / 5 years = 0.4 hurricanes per year\n\nNow, we can express this as a probability by considering that there is a 0.4 chance of a hurricane hitting the coastal region in any given year. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:\n\n0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nSo, based on historical data, there is a 40% probability that a hurricane will hit the coastal region within a given year."
