    "message_1": "A company offers two types of contracts to its employees. Contract A pays a base salary of $50,000 per year, while contract B pays a base salary of $40,000 per year. For both contracts, the employee can receive a bonus of up to $10,000 if certain performance targets are met. The probabilities of meeting the performance targets are as follows:\n\n-Contract A: 0.8 probability of meeting targets\n-Contract B: 0.6 probability of meeting targets\n\nAssuming that the employee's goal is to maximize their expected income, which contract should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which contract the employee should choose, we need to calculate the expected income for each contract.\n\nExpected income for Contract A:\nBase salary: $50,000\nBonus: $10,000 * 0.8 (probability of meeting targets) = $8,000\nTotal expected income for Contract A: $50,000 + $8,000 = $58,000\n\nExpected income for Contract B:\nBase salary: $40,000\nBonus: $10,000 * 0.6 (probability of meeting targets) = $6,000\nTotal expected income for Contract B: $40,000 + $6,000 = $46,000\n\nSince the expected income for Contract A ($58,000) is higher than the expected income for Contract B ($46,000), the employee should choose Contract A to maximize their expected income."
