    "message_1": "Let A be a set of even numbers between 1 and 10. Find the complement of A and verify that the union of A and its complement results in the universal set of all numbers between 1 and 10.",
    "message_2": "The set A consists of even numbers between 1 and 10, so A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The universal set U in this case consists of all numbers between 1 and 10, so U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Therefore, A' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and A', denoted as A ∪ A'. The union of two sets consists of all elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, A ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nAs we can see, the union of A and A' results in the universal set U, which consists of all numbers between 1 and 10. This verifies that the union of A and its complement A' indeed results in the universal set U."
