    "message_2": "To determine the possible values of the torsion subgroup $T \\subset H_2(M)$, we will use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) for homology. The UCT states that for any abelian group $G$, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n$0 \\rightarrow H_n(M) \\otimes G \\rightarrow H_n(M;G) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Tor}(H_{n-1}(M), G) \\rightarrow 0$\n\nIn our case, we are interested in the homology group $H_2(M)$, so we will set $n = 2$. We are given that $H_1(M)$ is a free abelian group of rank 2, which means $H_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. We are also given that $H_2(M)$ is a torsion group, so we will denote it as $T$.\n\nNow, we will apply the UCT with $G = \\mathbb{Z}$:\n\n$0 \\rightarrow H_2(M) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Tor}(H_1(M), \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow 0$\n\nSince $H_2(M) = T$ is a torsion group, we have $H_2(M) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = 0$. Moreover, $\\operatorname{Tor}(H_1(M), \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ because $H_1(M)$ is a free abelian group. Therefore, the short exact sequence becomes:\n\n$0 \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow 0$\n\nThis implies that $H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong T$. So, the torsion subgroup $T \\subset H_2(M)$ is isomorphic to the integral homology group $H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTo determine the possible values of $T$, we will use the fact that $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented 3-manifold. By Poincar√© duality, we have:\n\n$H^k(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_{3-k}(M;\\mathbb{Z})$\n\nIn particular, we have:\n\n$H^1(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_2(M;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong T$\n\nSince $H^1(M;\\mathbb{Z})$ is the first cohomology group of $M$ with integer coefficients, it is also a free abelian group. Therefore, the possible values of the torsion subgroup $T \\subset H_2(M)$ are isomorphic to free abelian groups. However, we cannot determine the rank of $T$ without more information about the manifold $M$."
