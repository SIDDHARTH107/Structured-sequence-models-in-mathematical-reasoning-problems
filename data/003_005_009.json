    "message_2": "To find the value of x in radians using inverse trigonometric functions, we can use the arcsin (also written as sin^(-1)) function. \n\nsin^(-1)(sin(x)) = sin^(-1)(0.5)\n\nx = sin^(-1)(0.5)\n\nThere are two possible values for x in the range of 0 to 2π:\n\nx = π/6 (or 30°) and x = 5π/6 (or 150°)\n\nSo, the values of x in radians are π/6 and 5π/6."
