    "message_1": "Consider the metric $g = dx^2 + 2dxdy + dy^2$ on a coordinate plane. Find the Levi-Civita connection of this metric at point $(1,1)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n\n$$\\Gamma^i_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{il} (\\partial_j g_{lk} + \\partial_k g_{jl} - \\partial_l g_{jk})$$\n\nHere, $g^{il}$ is the inverse of the metric tensor $g_{il}$. For the given metric, the metric tensor is:\n\n$$g_{il} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nComputing the inverse of this matrix, we get:\n\n$$g^{il} = \\frac{1}{0} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nHowever, the determinant of the metric tensor is 0, which means that the metric tensor is not invertible. This implies that the given metric is degenerate, and the Levi-Civita connection is not defined for degenerate metrics.\n\nTherefore, the Levi-Civita connection for the given metric at point $(1,1)$ does not exist."
