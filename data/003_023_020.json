    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nC = A × B = (A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y)i - (A_x * B_z - A_z * B_x)j + (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)k\n\nGiven the vectors A = 3i + 4j - 2k and B = 2i - 5j + 6k, we can find the cross product C as follows:\n\nC_x = (4 * 6) - (-2 * -5) = 24 - 10 = 14\nC_y = -((3 * 6) - (-2 * 2)) = -(18 - 4) = -14\nC_z = (3 * -5) - (4 * 2) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSo, the cross product C = 14i - 14j - 23k.\n\nNow, to find the magnitude of the cross product, we can use the formula:\n\n|C| = √(C_x^2 + C_y^2 + C_z^2)\n\n|C| = √(14^2 + (-14)^2 + (-23)^2) = √(196 + 196 + 529) = √921\n\nThe magnitude of the cross product is |C| = √921.\n\nTo find the direction of the cross product, we can calculate the angles α, β, and γ between the cross product vector C and the coordinate axes:\n\ncos(α) = C_x / |C| = 14 / √921\ncos(β) = C_y / |C| = -14 / √921\ncos(γ) = C_z / |C| = -23 / √921\n\nNow, we can find the angles α, β, and γ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the respective values:\n\nα = arccos(14 / √921)\nβ = arccos(-14 / √921)\nγ = arccos(-23 / √921)\n\nThe direction of the cross product is given by the angles α, β, and γ."
