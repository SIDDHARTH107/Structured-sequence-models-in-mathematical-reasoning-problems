    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed, leaving 20 smaller cubes.\n\nIn the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge, the following number of cubes are present:\n\n1st iteration: 20 cubes\n2nd iteration: 20^2 = 400 cubes\n3rd iteration: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes\n4th iteration: 20^4 = 160,000 cubes\n\nSo, there are 160,000 cubes in the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge.\n\nNow, let's find the edge length of the cubes in the 4th iteration. Since the initial cube has an edge length of 6 units, and each iteration divides the edge length by 3:\n\nEdge length in the 4th iteration = 6 / (3^3) = 6 / 27 = 2/9 units.\n\nSince the problem asks for the total number of cubes in the 4th iteration, the answer is 160,000 cubes."
