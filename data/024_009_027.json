    "message_2": "To calculate the scalar curvature of a 3-dimensional sphere, we can use the formula for the scalar curvature of an n-dimensional sphere:\n\nR = n(n-1) / r^2\n\nwhere R is the scalar curvature, n is the dimension of the sphere, and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, we have a 3-dimensional sphere (n = 3) with radius 2 (r = 2). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nR = 3(3-1) / 2^2\nR = 3(2) / 4\nR = 6 / 4\nR = 3/2\n\nSo the scalar curvature of the 3-dimensional sphere with radius 2 at any point on its surface is 3/2."
