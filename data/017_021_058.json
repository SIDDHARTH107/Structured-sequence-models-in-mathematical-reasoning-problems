    "message_2": "There are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 48. We can represent them as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group C48: This group is the group of integers modulo 48 under addition. It is abelian and has a single generator, for example, 1.\n\n2. Direct product of C24 and C2: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 24 and the cyclic group of order 2. It is also abelian.\n\n3. Direct product of C12 and C4: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 12 and the cyclic group of order 4. It is also abelian.\n\n4. Direct product of C8 and C6: This group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 6. It is also abelian.\n\n5. Direct product of C4 and C4 and C3: This group is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 3. It is also abelian.\n\n6. Semidirect product of C16 and C3: This group is a non-abelian group formed by the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n\n7. Semidirect product of C8 and C6: This group is a non-abelian group formed by the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 6.\n\n8. Semidirect product of C4 and C12: This group is a non-abelian group formed by the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 12.\n\n9. Alternating group A4 x C4: This group is the direct product of the alternating group A4 (which is the group of even permutations of 4 elements) and the cyclic group of order 4. It is non-abelian.\n\n10. One of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48: There are 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, and we have already listed 4 of them (6, 7, 8, and 9). So, there are 10 other non-abelian groups of order 48 that are not isomorphic to any of the groups listed above.\n\nIn summary, there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 48, which can be represented as the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 x C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
