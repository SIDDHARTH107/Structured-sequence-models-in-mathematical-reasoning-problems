    "message_1": "In a Trust Game scenario, Player 1 is given $10 and can choose to keep it all or send some portion to Player 2. Whatever amount Player 1 sends is tripled by Player 2's bank and then Player 2 can choose to send back any portion of the tripled amount to Player 1. What percentage of the tripled amount should Player 2 send back to maximize both players' earnings?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume Player 1 decides to send the entire $10 to Player 2. This is the best choice for maximizing the total earnings, as it allows the tripling effect to be applied to the largest possible amount.\n\nPlayer 2's bank triples the amount, so Player 2 now has $30. To maximize both players' earnings, Player 2 should send back an amount that results in an equal split of the $30.\n\nSo, Player 2 should send back $15 to Player 1. This way, both players end up with $15 each, maximizing their combined earnings.\n\nThe percentage of the tripled amount ($30) that Player 2 should send back is:\n\n(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%\n\nPlayer 2 should send back 50% of the tripled amount to maximize both players' earnings."
