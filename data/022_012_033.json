    "message_1": "Consider the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^3 - 8)/(z+2) on the complex plane. Determine the poles and zeros of f(z), their orders, and analyze the behavior of f(z) at infinity.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 8 = 0\n\nThis is a simple cubic equation, and we can factor it as follows:\n\n(z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0\n\nFrom this factorization, we can see that f(z) has a zero at z = 2 with order 1. The quadratic term (z^2 + 2z + 4) does not have any real roots, but we can find its complex roots using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4 * 1 * 4)) / (2 * 1)\nz = (-2 ± √(-12)) / 2\nz = -1 ± i√3\n\nSo, f(z) has two additional zeros at z = -1 + i√3 and z = -1 - i√3, both with order 1.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of f(z). A pole occurs when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz + 2 = 0\n\nThis gives us a single pole at z = -2 with order 1, since the denominator is a linear term.\n\nFinally, let's analyze the behavior of f(z) at infinity. To do this, we can look at the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 3 (from z^3), and the degree of the denominator is 1 (from z+2). Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, the function f(z) will go to infinity as z goes to infinity. In other words, f(z) has a pole at infinity with order equal to the difference in degrees, which is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has the following zeros and poles:\n\nZeros:\n- z = 2 with order 1\n- z = -1 + i√3 with order 1\n- z = -1 - i√3 with order 1\n\nPoles:\n- z = -2 with order 1\n- z = ∞ with order 2"
