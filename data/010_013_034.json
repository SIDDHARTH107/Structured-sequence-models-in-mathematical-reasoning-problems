    "message_2": "Since the student is working with a two-dimensional sphere (S^2), it is an even-dimensional sphere. According to the given fact, the Euler characteristic of the tangent bundle of an even-dimensional sphere is 2.\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the tangent bundle of the two-dimensional sphere (S^2) is 2."
