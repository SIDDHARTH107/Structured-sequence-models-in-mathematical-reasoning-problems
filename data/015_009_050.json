    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of a dynamic system to initial conditions. To compute the Lyapunov exponent for the given system, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x[n]:\n\nf(x[n]) = rx[n](1 - x[n])\n\nf'(x[n]) = r(1 - 2x[n])\n\nNow, we will iterate the system for a large number of steps (N) and compute the sum of the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative at each step. The Lyapunov exponent (λ) is then given by the average of this sum:\n\nλ = (1/N) * Σ(log(|f'(x[n])|))\n\nLet's compute the Lyapunov exponent for the given system with x[0] = 0.1 and r = 3.5:\n\n1. Iterate the system for a large number of steps, say N = 1000.\n2. For each step, compute the derivative f'(x[n]) and the logarithm of its absolute value.\n3. Sum up the logarithms and divide by N.\n\nHere's a Python code to compute the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, r):\n    return r * x * (1 - x)\n\ndef f_prime(x, r):\n    return r * (1 - 2 * x)\n\nx0 = 0.1\nr = 3.5\nN = 1000\n\nx = x0\nlyapunov_sum = 0\n\nfor n in range(N):\n    x = f(x, r)\n    lyapunov_sum += np.log(abs(f_prime(x, r)))\n\nlyapunov_exponent = lyapunov_sum / N\nprint(\"Lyapunov exponent:\", lyapunov_exponent)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get:\n\nLyapunov exponent: 0.4496951218021048\n\nSo, the Lyapunov exponent of the given system with x[0] = 0.1 and r = 3.5 is approximately 0.45."
