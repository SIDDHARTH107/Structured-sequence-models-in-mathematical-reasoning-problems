    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of each segment. After each iteration, the remaining segments have a total length of 2/3 of the previous length. \n\nLet's calculate the length of the Cantor set after 5 iterations:\n\nInitial length: 1\n\n1st iteration: 1 * (2/3) = 2/3\n2nd iteration: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n3rd iteration: (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27\n4th iteration: (8/27) * (2/3) = 16/81\n5th iteration: (16/81) * (2/3) = 32/243\n\nSo, the length of the Cantor set after 5 iterations is 32/243."
