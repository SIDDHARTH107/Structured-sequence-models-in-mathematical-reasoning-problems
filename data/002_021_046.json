    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 10 cm. What is the area of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 10 cm, and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) * π * (10^2)\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 100\nArea of sector = (100π) / 6\n\nThe area of the sector with a central angle of 60 degrees and a radius of 10 cm is approximately 52.36 square centimeters."
