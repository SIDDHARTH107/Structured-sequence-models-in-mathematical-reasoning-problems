    "message_2": "We can use the property of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. We want to find the remainder when 2^10 is divided by 7, which can be written as:\n\n2^10 ≡ x (mod 7)\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 2 modulo 7:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n2^3 ≡ 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7) (since 8 = 7 * 1 + 1)\n\nNotice that 2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7). This means that every third power of 2 will be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Therefore, we can write:\n\n2^10 ≡ 2^(3*3 + 1) ≡ (2^3)^3 * 2^1 ≡ 1^3 * 2 ≡ 1 * 2 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nSo the remainder when 2^10 is divided by 7 is 2."
