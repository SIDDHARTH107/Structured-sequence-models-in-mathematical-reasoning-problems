    "message_2": "To find the minimum and maximum values of the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^3 on the set S, we need to analyze the function on the boundary of the set and at the critical points inside the set.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n3y^2 = 0 => y = 0\n\nSo, the only critical point is (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's analyze the function on the boundary of the set S. There are four boundary lines:\n\n1. x = 0: f(0, y) = 0^2 + y^3 = y^3\n2. x = 1: f(1, y) = 1^2 + y^3 = 1 + y^3\n3. y = 0: f(x, 0) = x^2 + 0^3 = x^2\n4. y = 1: f(x, 1) = x^2 + 1^3 = x^2 + 1\n\nNow, let's find the minimum and maximum values on each boundary line:\n\n1. x = 0: The function f(0, y) = y^3 ranges from 0 to 1 as y ranges from 0 to 1.\n2. x = 1: The function f(1, y) = 1 + y^3 ranges from 1 to 2 as y ranges from 0 to 1.\n3. y = 0: The function f(x, 0) = x^2 ranges from 0 to 1 as x ranges from 0 to 1.\n4. y = 1: The function f(x, 1) = x^2 + 1 ranges from 1 to 2 as x ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nTaking into account the critical point (0, 0), we can see that the minimum value of the function f(x, y) on the set S is 0, which occurs at the point (0, 0). The maximum value of the function f(x, y) on the set S is 2, which occurs at the point (1, 1)."
