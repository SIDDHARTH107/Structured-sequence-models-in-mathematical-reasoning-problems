    "message_1": "A farmer wants to build a rectangular pen with two separate areas: one for chickens and the other for goats. The fence will cost her 20 pesos per meter for the rectangular area allocated to chickens, while the fence for part allocated to goats will cost 16 pesos per meter. If the farmer has 400 meters of fence, what are the dimensions of the rectangular pen that will maximize the total area of both sections, given that the section for chickens must be at least half the total area of the pen?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the width of the rectangular pen and y be the length of the rectangular pen. The total area of the pen is A = xy. Since the section for chickens must be at least half the total area of the pen, the width of the chicken section will be x/2 and the width of the goat section will be x/2.\n\nThe cost of the fence for the chicken section is 20 pesos per meter, and the cost of the fence for the goat section is 16 pesos per meter. The farmer has 400 meters of fence, so the total cost of the fence is 400 pesos. The cost of the fence can be represented as:\n\nCost = 20(2y + x/2) + 16(2y + x/2)\n\nSince the total cost is 400 pesos, we can set up the equation:\n\n400 = 20(2y + x/2) + 16(2y + x/2)\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n400 = 40y + 10x + 32y + 8x\n400 = 72y + 18x\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = (400 - 18x) / 72\n\nNow, let's find the area A in terms of x:\n\nA(x) = x * ((400 - 18x) / 72)\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = (400 - 18x) / 72 - (18x^2) / 72 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 72 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n0 = 400 - 18x - 18x^2\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n18x^2 + 18x - 400 = 0\n\nDividing by 18:\n\nx^2 + x - 400/18 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of x:\n\nx = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(-400/18))) / 2\n\nx ≈ 14.83 or x ≈ -27.16\n\nSince the width of the pen cannot be negative, we discard the negative value and use x ≈ 14.83 meters.\n\nNow, let's find the value of y:\n\ny = (400 - 18x) / 72\ny = (400 - 18(14.83)) / 72\ny ≈ 5.56 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular pen that will maximize the total area of both sections are approximately 14.83 meters by 5.56 meters."
