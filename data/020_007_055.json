    "message_1": "A student needs to distribute 20 identical apples among 4 children. However, the first child must receive at least 4 apples, the second child must receive at least 3 apples, and the third child must receive at least 5 apples. How many different ways can the student distribute the apples?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. First, we distribute the minimum required apples to each child: 4 to the first child, 3 to the second child, and 5 to the third child. This leaves us with 20 - 4 - 3 - 5 = 8 apples to distribute among the 4 children without any restrictions.\n\nNow, we can use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to distribute these 8 apples among the 4 children. We represent the apples as stars (*) and use bars (|) to separate the apples for each child. For example, **|*|***|* represents 2 apples for the first child, 1 apple for the second child, 3 apples for the third child, and 1 apple for the fourth child.\n\nThere are 8 stars (apples) and 3 bars needed to separate the apples among the 4 children. So, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these 8 stars and 3 bars, which is a combination problem. The total number of ways to arrange 8 stars and 3 bars is given by the formula:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(8 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(10, 2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 different ways to distribute the remaining 8 apples among the 4 children."
