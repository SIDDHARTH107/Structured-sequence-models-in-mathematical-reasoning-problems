    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of graph G, we need to find a tree decomposition of G with the smallest possible width. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from G, and the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of G.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in G, there exists a bag that contains both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in G, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nNow, let's find a tree decomposition of G with the smallest possible width:\n\n1. Create a bag {1, 2, 4} which covers the edges (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 4).\n2. Create a bag {2, 5, 6} which covers the edges (2, 5), (2, 6), and (5, 6).\n3. Create a bag {4, 5} which covers the edge (4, 5).\n4. Create a bag {1, 3} which covers the edge (1, 3).\n\nNow, connect the bags in a tree-like structure:\n\n      {1, 2, 4}\n     /       \\\n  {1, 3}   {2, 5, 6}\n           /\n        {4, 5}\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, the largest bags are {1, 2, 4} and {2, 5, 6}, both with 3 vertices. Therefore, the treewidth of graph G is 3 - 1 = 2."
