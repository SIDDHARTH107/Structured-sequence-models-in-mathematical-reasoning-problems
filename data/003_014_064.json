    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and vertical shift of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x) + 4, we can analyze the equation in the form of A*sin(Bx) + C, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, A = 3, B = 2, and C = 4.\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of the function is found by the formula (2π)/|B|. In this case, the period is (2π)/|2| = π.\n\nVertical Shift (C): The vertical shift is the value of C, which is 4.\n\nNow, let's graph one full cycle of the function over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π.\n\n1. Start by plotting the vertical shift (C) as a horizontal line at y = 4.\n2. The amplitude (A) tells us that the function will oscillate 3 units above and below the vertical shift line. So, the maximum value of the function will be at y = 4 + 3 = 7, and the minimum value will be at y = 4 - 3 = 1.\n3. The period tells us that one full cycle of the function will occur over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π. \n4. At x = 0, f(x) = 3sin(0) + 4 = 4. Plot the point (0, 4).\n5. At x = π/4, f(x) = 3sin(π/2) + 4 = 7. Plot the point (π/4, 7).\n6. At x = π/2, f(x) = 3sin(π) + 4 = 4. Plot the point (π/2, 4).\n7. At x = 3π/4, f(x) = 3sin(3π/2) + 4 = 1. Plot the point (3π/4, 1).\n8. At x = π, f(x) = 3sin(2π) + 4 = 4. Plot the point (π, 4).\n\nNow, connect the points with a smooth curve to complete one full cycle of the function over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π."
