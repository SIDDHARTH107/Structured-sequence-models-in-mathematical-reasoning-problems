    "message_2": "To compute the first Chern class $c_1(X)$ of the complex projective space $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$, we first need to find a line bundle on $X$. The tautological line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(-1)$ is a natural choice. The dual of the tautological line bundle is the hyperplane line bundle, denoted by $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the transition functions of the tautological line bundle. On the intersection of two coordinate charts $U_i$ and $U_j$, the transition function is given by $g_{ij} = z_j/z_i$. The transition functions of the dual line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ are the inverses of these, i.e., $g_{ij}^{-1} = z_i/z_j$.\n\nThe first Chern class $c_1(L)$ of a line bundle $L$ is defined as the cohomology class of the curvature form $F$ of a connection on $L$. For the hyperplane line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, we can choose the connection whose local connection 1-forms are given by $A_i = -\\partial \\log |z_i|^2$ on each coordinate chart $U_i$. The curvature form $F$ is then given by $F = dA_i$.\n\nOn the intersection $U_i \\cap U_j$, we have $A_i = A_j + d\\log g_{ij}^{-1}$. Therefore, the curvature form $F$ is globally well-defined, and we have\n\n$$F = dA_i = -d\\partial \\log |z_i|^2 = -\\frac{2}{|z_i|^2}dz_i \\wedge d\\bar{z}_i.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the first Chern class $c_1(X)$ as the cohomology class of the curvature form $F$:\n\n$$c_1(X) = \\frac{i}{2\\pi}F = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{1}{|z_i|^2}dz_i \\wedge d\\bar{z}_i.$$\n\nThis is the first Chern class of the complex projective space $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$. Note that the integral of $c_1(X)$ over a generator of the second cohomology group $H^2(\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C}), \\mathbb{Z})$ is equal to 1, which shows that the hyperplane line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is an ample line bundle."
