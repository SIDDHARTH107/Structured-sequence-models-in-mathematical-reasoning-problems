    "message_2": "The cosine function has a value of 1/2 at two angles in the range of 0 to 360 degrees. These angles are:\n\nx = 60 degrees (which is π/3 in radians)\nx = 300 degrees (which is 5π/3 in radians)\n\nSo, the values of x in degrees between 0 and 360 for which cos(x) = 1/2 are 60 degrees and 300 degrees."
