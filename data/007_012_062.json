    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a natural number p > 1, p is prime if and only if (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p).\n\nTo prove that 71 is a prime number, we need to show that (71-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 71).\n\nLet's calculate (70)! modulo 71:\n\n(70)! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × 68 × 69 × 70\n\nNotice that for each number a in the range 1 ≤ a ≤ 70, there exists a unique number b such that a × b ≡ 1 (mod 71). This is because 71 is a prime number, and every number less than 71 is coprime to 71. These pairs of numbers are called multiplicative inverses modulo 71.\n\nFor example, the multiplicative inverse of 2 is 36, because 2 × 36 ≡ 1 (mod 71). Similarly, the multiplicative inverse of 3 is 24, because 3 × 24 ≡ 1 (mod 71).\n\nNow, let's pair up the numbers in (70)! with their multiplicative inverses modulo 71:\n\n(1 × 70) × (2 × 36) × (3 × 24) × ... × (34 × 4) × (35 × 35) × ... × (68 × 3) × (69 × 2)\n\nNotice that each pair of numbers is congruent to 1 modulo 71. Therefore, the product of all these pairs is also congruent to 1 modulo 71:\n\n(70)! ≡ 1 × 1 × 1 × ... × 1 × 1 (mod 71)\n\nHowever, we need to show that (70)! ≡ -1 (mod 71). Since 71 is a prime number, -1 is congruent to 70 modulo 71:\n\n-1 ≡ 70 (mod 71)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the Wilson's theorem condition as:\n\n(70)! ≡ 70 (mod 71)\n\nAnd since we've shown that (70)! ≡ 1 (mod 71), we can conclude that 71 is a prime number according to Wilson's theorem."
