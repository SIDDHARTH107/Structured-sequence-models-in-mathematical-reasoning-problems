    "message_2": "To use the divisibility rule for 13, follow these steps:\n\n1. Take the last digit of the number (in this case, 9), multiply it by 4, and add the result to the remaining part of the number (28).\n\n2. If the resulting number is divisible by 13, then the original number is also divisible by 13.\n\nLet's apply the rule to the number 289:\n\n1. Multiply the last digit (9) by 4: 9 * 4 = 36\n2. Add the result (36) to the remaining part of the number (28): 28 + 36 = 64\n\nNow, we need to check if 64 is divisible by 13. Since 13 * 5 = 65, we know that 64 is not divisible by 13. The remainder when 64 is divided by 13 is 1 (64 - 13 * 4 = 1).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 289 is divided by 13 is also 1."
