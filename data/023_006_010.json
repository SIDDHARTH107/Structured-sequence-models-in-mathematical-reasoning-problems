    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal y(t) = sin(2πt) + 2sin(4πt) + cos(6πt), we'll use the definition of the continuous-time Fourier transform:\n\nY(f) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, where the integral is taken over all time t, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nSince the signal is composed of three separate components, we can find the Fourier transform of each component and then add them together.\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of each component:\n\n1) For sin(2πt):\nY1(f) = ∫[sin(2πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\n2) For 2sin(4πt):\nY2(f) = ∫[2sin(4πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\n3) For cos(6πt):\nY3(f) = ∫[cos(6πt) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nNow, we can use the following Fourier transform pairs to find the Fourier transforms of each component:\n\n1) sin(2πt) ↔ (j/2) * [δ(f - 1) - δ(f + 1)]\n2) sin(4πt) ↔ (j/2) * [δ(f - 2) - δ(f + 2)]\n3) cos(6πt) ↔ (1/2) * [δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the entire signal by adding the Fourier transforms of each component:\n\nY(f) = Y1(f) + Y2(f) + Y3(f)\n\nY(f) = (j/2) * [δ(f - 1) - δ(f + 1)] + (j) * [δ(f - 2) - δ(f + 2)] + (1/2) * [δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given signal y(t) = sin(2πt) + 2sin(4πt) + cos(6πt) is:\n\nY(f) = (j/2) * [δ(f - 1) - δ(f + 1)] + (j) * [δ(f - 2) - δ(f + 2)] + (1/2) * [δ(f - 3) + δ(f + 3)]"
