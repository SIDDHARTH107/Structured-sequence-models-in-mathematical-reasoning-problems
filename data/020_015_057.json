    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L and the width be W. The perimeter of the rectangular garden is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 100 feet of fencing, we can write the equation as:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for W:\n\nW = (100 - 2L) / 2\nW = 50 - L\n\nThe area of the rectangular garden is given by the formula:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for W in terms of L into the area formula:\n\nA = L * (50 - L)\n\nNow, we have the area in terms of one variable, L:\n\nA = 50L - L^2\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the critical points of this quadratic function. We can do this by finding the derivative of A with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = 50 - 2L\n\nSet the derivative equal to 0 and solve for L:\n\n0 = 50 - 2L\n2L = 50\nL = 25\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 50 - L\nW = 50 - 25\nW = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions that will maximize the area of the garden are 25 feet by 25 feet, which will result in a square garden."
