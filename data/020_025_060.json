The distance between each location is given in the table below:\n\n|          | Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 | Location 5 |\n|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Location 1 | -          | 12         | 19         | 8          | 25         |\n| Location 2 | 12         | -          | 13         | 17         | 21         |\n| Location 3 | 19         | 13         | -          | 10         | 9          |\n| Location 4 | 8          | 17         | 10         | -          | 20         |\n| Location 5 | 25         | 21         | 9          | 20         | -          |\n\nEach package needs to be delivered by the end of the day. What is the shortest distance the delivery company can travel to deliver all five packages, starting and ending at Location 1? Give your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance to deliver all five packages, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible routes and choose the one with the shortest distance. Since we start and end at Location 1, we have 4! (4 factorial) possible routes to consider. These are:\n\n1. Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 3 → Location 4 → Location 5 → Location 1\n2. Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 3 → Location 5 → Location 4 → Location 1\n3. Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 4 → Location 3 → Location 5 → Location 1\n4. Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 4 → Location 5 → Location 3 → Location 1\n5. Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 5 → Location 3 → Location 4 → Location 1\n6. Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 5 → Location 4 → Location 3 → Location 1\n\nNow, we calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. 12 + 13 + 10 + 9 + 19 = 63\n2. 12 + 13 + 9 + 20 + 8 = 62\n3. 12 + 17 + 10 + 9 + 19 = 67\n4. 12 + 17 + 20 + 9 + 19 = 77\n5. 12 + 21 + 9 + 10 + 8 = 60\n6. 12 + 21 + 20 + 10 + 19 = 82\n\nThe shortest distance is 60 units, which corresponds to the route Location 1 → Location 2 → Location 5 → Location 3 → Location 4 → Location 1."
