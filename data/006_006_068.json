    "message_1": "In a soccer game, a striker has a 30% chance of scoring a goal with each shot they take. What is the probability that the striker will score at least one goal if they take 5 shots during the game?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the striker scoring at least one goal in 5 shots, we can first find the probability of the striker not scoring any goals in those 5 shots and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability of not scoring a goal in a single shot is 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 (since there's a 30% chance of scoring, there's a 70% chance of not scoring).\n\nFor 5 shots, the probability of not scoring in all of them is 0.70^5 = 0.16807.\n\nNow, to find the probability of scoring at least one goal, we subtract the probability of not scoring any goals from 1:\n\n1 - 0.16807 = 0.83193.\n\nSo, the probability of the striker scoring at least one goal in 5 shots is approximately 83.19%."
