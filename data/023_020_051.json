    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/(1-x) on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\nHowever, the function f(x) = 1/(1-x) has a singularity at x = 1, which is outside the interval [-π, π]. To find the Fourier series of this function, we need to extend the function periodically to the entire real line. We can do this by defining a new function g(x) as follows:\n\ng(x) = f(x) if -π < x < π\ng(x + 2π) = g(x) for all x\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier coefficients of g(x):\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[g(x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[g(x) * cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[g(x) * sin(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\nSince g(x) = f(x) on the interval (-π, π), we can use the original function to compute the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[1/(1-x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[(1/(1-x)) * cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[(1/(1-x)) * sin(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\nThese integrals are difficult to compute directly. However, we can use the method of complex integration and the residue theorem to find the Fourier coefficients. This involves finding the residues of the function at its poles and summing them up.\n\nFor the function f(x) = 1/(1-x), the only pole is at x = 1. The residue of the function at this pole can be found using the formula:\n\nRes[f(x), x=1] = lim_(x->1) [(x-1) * f(x)]\n\nRes[f(x), x=1] = lim_(x->1) [(x-1) * (1/(1-x))]\nRes[f(x), x=1] = lim_(x->1) [1]\nRes[f(x), x=1] = 1\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to compute the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * 2π * Res[f(x), x=1] = 2\na_n = (1/π) * 2π * Res[f(x) * cos(nx), x=1] = 0\nb_n = (1/π) * 2π * Res[f(x) * sin(nx), x=1] = 0\n\nSo the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/(1-x) on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = 1 + Σ[0 * cos(nx) + 0 * sin(nx)]\n\nf(x) = 1\n\nThis result indicates that the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/(1-x) on the interval [-π, π] is a constant function with the value 1. This is because the singularity at x = 1 is outside the interval, and the function is periodic with period 2π."
