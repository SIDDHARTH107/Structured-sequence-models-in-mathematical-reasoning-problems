    "message_2": "To find all isometries of the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + 4dy^2$, we need to find all transformations that preserve the distance between points in the plane.\n\nLet's consider a transformation $(x, y) \\rightarrow (X(x, y), Y(x, y))$. The metric in the new coordinates $(X, Y)$ is given by:\n\n$$ds^2 = dX^2 + 4dY^2$$\n\nWe can use the chain rule to find the differentials $dX$ and $dY$:\n\n$$dX = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} dy$$\n$$dY = \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} dy$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the metric equation in the new coordinates, we get:\n\n$$ds^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + 2\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} dx dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + 8\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} dx dy + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2$$\n\nComparing this expression with the original metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + 4dy^2$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1. $\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 = 1$\n2. $2\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} + 8\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y} = 0$\n3. $\\left(\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 = 4$\n\nLet's analyze these equations:\n\n1. Equation (1) implies that $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}$ cannot both be zero. If one of them is zero, the other must be $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 2$.\n2. Equation (2) implies that if $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x} \\neq 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x} \\neq 0$, then $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y} = -4\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}/\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}$.\n3. Equation (3) implies that $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial y}$ cannot both be zero. If one of them is zero, the other must be $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 2$.\n\nNow, we can classify the isometries into four types:\n\n1. Translations: $X(x, y) = x + a$, $Y(x, y) = y + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n2. Dilations and contractions along the $x$ or $y$ axis: $X(x, y) = \\pm x$, $Y(x, y) = \\pm 2y$.\n3. Reflections across lines parallel to the $x$ or $y$ axis: $X(x, y) = x$, $Y(x, y) = -2y$ or $X(x, y) = -x$, $Y(x, y) = 2y$.\n4. Rotations by 180 degrees about points on the $x$ or $y$ axis: $X(x, y) = -x$, $Y(x, y) = -2y$.\n\nThese are all the isometries of the given metric."
