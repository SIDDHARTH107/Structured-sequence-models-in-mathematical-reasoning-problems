    "message_1": "What is the probability of a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) making landfall in South Florida during the upcoming hurricane season? The historical probability of a major hurricane making landfall between June 1 and November 30 in South Florida is 20%. If there are 10 major hurricanes predicted for the upcoming season, what is the probability that at least one of them will make landfall in South Florida?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of at least one major hurricane making landfall in South Florida, we can use the complementary probability method. This means we will find the probability of none of the 10 major hurricanes making landfall in South Florida and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single major hurricane not making landfall in South Florida is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (80%).\n\nFor 10 major hurricanes, the probability of none of them making landfall in South Florida is (0.80)^10 = 0.1074 (10.74%).\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one major hurricane making landfall in South Florida:\n\n1 - 0.1074 = 0.8926\n\nSo, the probability of at least one major hurricane making landfall in South Florida during the upcoming hurricane season is approximately 89.26%."
