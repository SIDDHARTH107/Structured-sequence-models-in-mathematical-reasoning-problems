    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - z = 0\n\nFactoring out z, we get:\n\nz(z^2 - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic term:\n\nz(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the zeros of the function are z = 0, z = 1, and z = -1. The order of each zero is 1 since each factor appears only once.\n\nNext, we need to find the poles of the function, which are the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic term, we get:\n\n(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nSo, the poles of the function are z = 1 and z = -1. However, since these values are also zeros of the function, we need to check if they are removable singularities or actual poles. To do this, we can simplify the function:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - z)/(z^2 - 1) = z(z^2 - 1)/[(z - 1)(z + 1)]\n\nSince the zeros and poles share the same factors, we can cancel them out:\n\nf(z) = z\n\nNow, we see that the function is actually equal to z, and there are no poles. The zeros at z = 1 and z = -1 were removable singularities, and the only zero of the function is z = 0 with order 1."
