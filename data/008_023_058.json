    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 11.6 |\n| 3  2  5 | 14.2 |\n| 4  5  3 | 19.3 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (3/2)R1\nR3 = R3 - 2R1\n\n| 2  3   4  | 11.6 |\n| 0 -1.5  1  | -3.4 |\n| 0 -1   -5  | -3.9 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (2/3)R2\n\n|  2   3    4  | 11.6 |\n|  0 -1.5  1   | -3.4 |\n|  0   0  -4.33| -0.6 |\n\nStep 3: Back-substitution\n\nz = -0.6 / -4.33 ≈ 0.14\ny = (-3.4 - 1 * 0.14) / -1.5 ≈ 2.36\nx = (11.6 - 3 * 2.36 - 4 * 0.14) / 2 ≈ 1.07\n\nSo, the solution is approximately x = 1.07, y = 2.36, and z = 0.14."
