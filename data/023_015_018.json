    "message_2": "The given wave signal is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the amplitudes and frequencies of the individual waves. We can directly read them from the given function.\n\nThe function is given as:\n\nf(t) = 6cos(2π(10)t) + 4sin(2π(20)t)\n\nHere, we have two sinusoidal functions:\n\n1) 6cos(2π(10)t)\n2) 4sin(2π(20)t)\n\nFor the first function, the amplitude is 6, and the frequency is 10 Hz (since the argument of the cosine function is 2π(10)t).\n\nFor the second function, the amplitude is 4, and the frequency is 20 Hz (since the argument of the sine function is 2π(20)t).\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the individual waves are:\n\n1) Amplitude: 6, Frequency: 10 Hz\n2) Amplitude: 4, Frequency: 20 Hz"
