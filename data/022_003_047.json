    "message_2": "Cauchy's integral formula states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and for any point a inside C, we have:\n\n∫C [f(z)/(z - a)]dz = 2πif(a)\n\nIn this problem, we have f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 2, and we want to evaluate the integral ∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)]dz, where C is the circle of radius 2 centered at z = 1. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is analytic everywhere, including inside and on the contour C. The point a = 1 is also inside C.\n\nNow, we can apply Cauchy's integral formula:\n\n∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)]dz = 2πif(1)\n\nTo find f(1), we substitute z = 1 into the function:\n\nf(1) = (1)^2 + 3(1) + 2 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\n∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)]dz = 2πif(1) = 2πi(6) = 12πi\n\nSo, the value of the integral ∫C [f(z)/(z - 1)]dz is 12πi."
