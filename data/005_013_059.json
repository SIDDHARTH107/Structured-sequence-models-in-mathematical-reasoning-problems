They surveyed 20 employees and recorded their average number of hours studied per week and their job performance rating on a scale of 1-10. The data is shown below:\n\n| Hours Studied | Performance Rating |\n|--------------|--------------------|\n|     10       |         6          |\n|     8        |         5          |\n|     15       |         8          |\n|     7        |         4          |\n|     13       |         7          |\n|     9        |         5          |\n|     11       |         6          |\n|     14       |         8          |\n|     6        |         3          |\n|     12       |         7          |\n|     5        |         2          |\n|     10       |         5          |\n|     6        |         4          |\n|     8        |         6          |\n|     9        |         4          |\n|     12       |         7          |\n|     7        |         3          |\n|     11       |         6          |\n|     14       |         8          |\n|     8        |         5          |\n\nUsing multivariate analysis techniques, determine if there is a significant correlation between the average number of hours studied per week and the job performance rating of employees.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant correlation between the average number of hours studied per week and the job performance rating of employees, we can use the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean of Hours Studied (X) and Performance Rating (Y):\n\nMean of X (Hours Studied) = (10+8+15+7+13+9+11+14+6+12+5+10+6+8+9+12+7+11+14+8) / 20 = 176 / 20 = 8.8\nMean of Y (Performance Rating) = (6+5+8+4+7+5+6+8+3+7+2+5+4+6+4+7+3+6+8+5) / 20 = 100 / 20 = 5\n\nNext, we need to calculate the covariance of X and Y, as well as the standard deviations of X and Y.\n\nCovariance(X, Y) = Σ[(Xi - Mean of X) * (Yi - Mean of Y)] / (n-1)\nStandard Deviation of X = sqrt(Σ(Xi - Mean of X)^2 / (n-1))\nStandard Deviation of Y = sqrt(Σ(Yi - Mean of Y)^2 / (n-1))\n\nAfter calculating the covariance and standard deviations, we can find the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) using the following formula:\n\nr = Covariance(X, Y) / (Standard Deviation of X * Standard Deviation of Y)\n\nIf the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive correlation; if it is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative correlation; and if it is close to 0, it indicates no correlation or a weak correlation.\n\nAfter calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for the given data, we get:\n\nr ≈ 0.92\n\nSince the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1, we can conclude that there is a strong positive correlation between the average number of hours studied per week and the job performance rating of employees."
