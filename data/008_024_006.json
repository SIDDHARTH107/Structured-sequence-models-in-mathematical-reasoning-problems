    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination.\n\nFirst, let's try to eliminate a variable from two of the equations. We can multiply the first equation by 2 and then subtract it from the second equation:\n\n(2x + 4y - 2z = 10) - 2*(x + 2y - z = 5)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation is always true, which means that the second equation is dependent on the first equation. Now let's try to eliminate the same variable from the first and third equations:\n\n(3x + 6y - 3z = 15) - 3*(x + 2y - z = 5)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0 = 0\n\nAgain, this equation is always true, which means that the third equation is also dependent on the first equation.\n\nSince the second and third equations are dependent on the first equation, we can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\nx + 2y - z = 5\n\nNow we can express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = x + 2y - 5\n\nSince there is no unique solution for x, y, and z, the solution set for this system of linear equations is infinite and can be represented as:\n\n{(x, y, x + 2y - 5) | x, y âˆˆ R}"
