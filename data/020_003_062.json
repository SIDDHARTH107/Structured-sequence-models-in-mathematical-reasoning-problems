    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 7, we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by taking the derivative of the function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0.\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 4\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n2x + 4 = 0\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n\nNow that we have the critical point x = -2, we can determine if it is a minimum or maximum by checking the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the critical point x = -2 corresponds to a global minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x = -2 back into the original function:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) - 7\nf(-2) = 4 - 8 - 7\nf(-2) = -11\n\nSo, the global minimum value of f(x) is -11, and it occurs at x = -2."
