What is the minimum cost of constructing this network?\n\nCity links:\n- City 1 to City 2: $5,000\n- City 1 to City 3: $2,000\n- City 2 to City 3: $1,500\n- City 2 to City 4: $3,000\n- City 3 to City 4: $1,000\n- City 3 to City 5: $2,500\n- City 4 to City 6: $4,000\n- City 5 to City 6: $3,000",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of constructing the network, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm. We will sort the edges by their weights and add them to the network one by one, as long as they don't create a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by weight:\n1. City 2 to City 3: $1,500\n2. City 3 to City 4: $1,000\n3. City 1 to City 3: $2,000\n4. City 3 to City 5: $2,500\n5. City 5 to City 6: $3,000\n6. City 2 to City 4: $3,000\n7. City 1 to City 2: $5,000\n8. City 4 to City 6: $4,000\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the network one by one, making sure not to create a cycle:\n\n1. Add City 2 to City 3: $1,500\n2. Add City 3 to City 4: $1,000\n3. Add City 1 to City 3: $2,000\n4. Add City 3 to City 5: $2,500\n5. Add City 5 to City 6: $3,000\n\nAt this point, all cities are connected, and adding any more edges would create a cycle. Therefore, the minimum cost of constructing the network is:\n\n$1,500 + $1,000 + $2,000 + $2,500 + $3,000 = $10,000"
