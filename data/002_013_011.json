    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a rectangular base that measures 6 cm by 8 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\n\nThe base area is the product of the length and width of the rectangular base, which is 6 cm × 8 cm = 48 cm².\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 48 cm² × 12 cm = 16 cm² × 12 cm = 192 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 192 cubic centimeters."
