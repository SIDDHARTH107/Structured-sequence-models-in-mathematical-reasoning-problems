    "message_2": "The treewidth of a graph is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of the graph minus one. To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition with the minimum width.\n\nA tree decomposition of the graph is a tree where each node is a subset of vertices of the graph, and the following conditions hold:\n\n1. The union of all subsets is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a subset containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the subsets containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nWe can construct a tree decomposition of the given graph as follows:\n\n```\n  {1, 2, 4} -- {2, 4, 5} -- {2, 3, 5} -- {3, 5, 6}\n```\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies all the conditions:\n\n1. The union of all subsets is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n2. All edges are covered: (1, 2) in {1, 2, 4}, (1, 4) in {1, 2, 4}, (2, 3) in {2, 3, 5}, (2, 5) in {2, 4, 5}, (3, 6) in {3, 5, 6}, (4, 5) in {2, 4, 5}, and (5, 6) in {3, 5, 6}.\n3. For each vertex, the subsets containing it form a connected subtree.\n\nThe width of this tree decomposition is the size of the largest subset minus one, which is 3 - 1 = 2. Since this is a minimal tree decomposition, the treewidth of the graph is 2."
