    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that the number of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, is given by the number of partitions of n. In this case, p = 2 and n = 5, since 32 = 2^5.\n\nThe partitions of 5 are:\n1. 5\n2. 4 + 1\n3. 3 + 2\n4. 3 + 1 + 1\n5. 2 + 2 + 1\n6. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n7. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThere are 7 partitions of 5, which means there are 7 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
