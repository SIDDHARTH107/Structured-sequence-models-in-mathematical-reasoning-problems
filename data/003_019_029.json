    "message_2": "To calculate the definite integral of 5sin(3x)cos(2x) from 0 to π/3, we can use the product-to-sum identity for trigonometric functions:\n\nsin(A)cos(B) = 1/2 [sin(A-B) + sin(A+B)]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n∫(5sin(3x)cos(2x) dx) from 0 to π/3 = 5/2 ∫(sin(x) + sin(5x) dx) from 0 to π/3\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C1\n∫sin(5x) dx = -1/5 cos(5x) + C2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n5/2 (-cos(x) - 1/5 cos(5x)) from 0 to π/3\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n5/2 (-cos(π/3) - 1/5 cos(5π/3)) - 5/2 (-cos(0) - 1/5 cos(0))\n\n= 5/2 (-1/2 - 1/5) - 5/2 (-1 - 1/5)\n\n= 5/2 (-7/10) + 5/2 (6/5)\n\n= -7/2 + 3\n\n= -1/2\n\nSo, the definite integral of 5sin(3x)cos(2x) from 0 to π/3 is -1/2."
