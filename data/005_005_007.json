    "message_1": "Suppose that the weights of all apples in a certain orchard follow a normal distribution with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 10 grams. If a random sample of 25 apples is selected from this orchard, what is the probability that the average weight of the sample is less than 145 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean (when the sample size is large enough) is approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 150 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 10 grams, and the sample size (n) is 25. \n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 2 grams\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 145 grams. To do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nwhere x is the value we want to find the probability for (145 grams in this case).\n\nz = (145 - 150) / 2\nz = -5 / 2\nz = -2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.5. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -2.5 is approximately 0.0062.\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the sample is less than 145 grams is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%."
