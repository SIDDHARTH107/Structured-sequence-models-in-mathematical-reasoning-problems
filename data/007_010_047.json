    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we can set up the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 5 (mod 9)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the three moduli: N = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products: N1 = N/5 = 63, N2 = N/7 = 45, and N3 = N/9 = 35.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products. We are looking for integers x1, x2, and x3 such that:\n\nN1 * x1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\nN2 * x2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nN3 * x3 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nWe can find these modular inverses using the extended Euclidean algorithm or by inspection:\n\n63 * x1 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => x1 = 3 (since 63 * 3 = 189 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n45 * x2 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => x2 = 5 (since 45 * 5 = 225 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n35 * x3 ≡ 1 (mod 9) => x3 = 2 (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 (mod 9))\n\nFinally, we can compute the solution x using the Chinese remainder theorem formula:\n\nx = (2 * N1 * x1) + (3 * N2 * x2) + (5 * N3 * x3) = (2 * 63 * 3) + (3 * 45 * 5) + (5 * 35 * 2)\n\nx = 378 + 675 + 350 = 1403\n\nSince 1403 is positive and smaller than the product of the moduli (315), it is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruences."
