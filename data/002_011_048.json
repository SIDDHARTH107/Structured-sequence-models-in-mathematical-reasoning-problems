    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that is 8 cm and the hypotenuse of the triangle is 10 cm. What is the length of the other leg using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the other leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that one leg (a) is 8 cm and the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n8^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n\n64 + b^2 = 100\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 64\nb^2 = 36\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš36\nb = 6\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (b) is 6 cm."
