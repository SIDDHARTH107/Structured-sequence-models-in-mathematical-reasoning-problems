    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is generated through a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 7.\n\nLet L_n be the length of the Gosper curve after n iterations, and L_0 be the initial length (1 in this case). The length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nL_n = L_0 * (sqrt(7))^n\n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations, we can plug in the values:\n\nL_5 = 1 * (sqrt(7))^5\nL_5 ≈ 1 * 168.053\n\nL_5 ≈ 168.053\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations is approximately 168.053."
