    "message_2": "To calculate the Jones polynomial of the given knot, we first need to simplify the knot using the skein relation. The knot in the diagram is a (7,4)-torus knot. We will use the skein relation to break down the knot into simpler knots and eventually unknots.\n\nFirst, we need to find a crossing in the knot where we can apply the skein relation. Let's focus on the crossing where the strand goes over another strand. We will label this crossing as L.\n\nNow, we will apply the skein relation to this crossing:\n\n$V_{L+} - V_{L-} = (q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2})V_{L0}$\n\nHere, $L_+$ is the original knot, $L_-$ is the knot with the crossing changed (i.e., the over-crossing strand becomes an under-crossing strand), and $L_0$ is the knot with the crossing removed (i.e., the strands are separated).\n\nWe will now calculate $V_{L-}$ and $V_{L0}$.\n\nFor $V_{L-}$, changing the crossing results in a simpler knot, which is a (3,4)-torus knot. We can further simplify this knot using the skein relation, and eventually, we will get a linear combination of unknots. The Jones polynomial of an unknot is 1. Therefore, $V_{L-}$ will be a linear combination of 1's.\n\nFor $V_{L0}$, removing the crossing results in two separate unknots. The Jones polynomial of an unknot is 1, and the Jones polynomial of the disjoint union of two knots is the product of their Jones polynomials. Therefore, $V_{L0} = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the skein relation:\n\n$V_{L+} - V_{L-} = (q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2})(1)$\n\n$V_{L+} = V_{L-} + (q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2})$\n\nSince $V_{L+}$ is the Jones polynomial of the original knot, we have found the Jones polynomial in terms of $V_{L-}$ and $q$. The exact expression for $V_{L-}$ depends on the coefficients of the linear combination of unknots, which can be determined by further applying the skein relation to the (3,4)-torus knot. However, the general form of the Jones polynomial for the given knot is:\n\n$V_{L+} = V_{L-} + (q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2})$"
