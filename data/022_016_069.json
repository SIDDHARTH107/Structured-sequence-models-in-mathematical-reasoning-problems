    "message_2": "To show that there exists a biholomorphic mapping from the square region $D$ onto the unit disk, we will use the Riemann Mapping Theorem. The Riemann Mapping Theorem states that any simply connected domain in the complex plane, which is not the whole plane, can be biholomorphically mapped onto the unit disk.\n\nFirst, we need to show that the region $D$ is simply connected. A region is simply connected if any simple closed curve in the region can be continuously deformed to a point within the region. Since $D$ is a square with vertices $z = \\pm 1 \\pm i$, it is a convex region, and any simple closed curve in $D$ can be continuously deformed to a point within the region. Therefore, $D$ is simply connected.\n\nNext, we need to find a biholomorphic mapping from $D$ onto the unit disk. One possible mapping is the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, which maps the upper half-plane onto polygonal regions. The transformation is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int_{z_0}^z \\frac{dz}{(z - z_1)^{1 - \\alpha_1} \\cdots (z - z_n)^{1 - \\alpha_n}} + B$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants, $z_1, \\dots, z_n$ are the vertices of the polygon, and $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n$ are the interior angles of the polygon in units of $\\pi$. For our square region $D$, we have:\n\n- Vertices: $z_1 = -1 - i, z_2 = -1 + i, z_3 = 1 + i, z_4 = 1 - i$\n- Interior angles: $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = \\alpha_3 = \\alpha_4 = 1$ (since all angles are $\\pi$)\n\nThe Schwarz-Christoffel transformation for our region is:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int_{z_0}^z \\frac{dz}{(z - (-1 - i))(z - (-1 + i))(z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))} + B$$\n\nTo map the square region $D$ onto the unit disk, we need to find the constants $A$ and $B$ such that the vertices of the square are mapped to the boundary of the unit disk. This can be done by solving a system of equations involving the boundary conditions.\n\nOnce the constants $A$ and $B$ are found, we have a biholomorphic mapping from the square region $D$ onto the unit disk, as required."
