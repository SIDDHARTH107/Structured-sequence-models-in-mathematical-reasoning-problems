C4 x C2 x C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and two cyclic groups of order 2. This group is abelian and has elements of orders 1, 2, and 4.\n\n5. Q16: The quaternion group of order 16. This group is non-abelian and has elements of orders 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\nNow, let's identify which of these groups are isomorphic to the given groups:\n\n- C16 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, as they are the same group.\n\n- The dihedral group D8 is not isomorphic to any of these groups, as it has order 8, not 16.\n\n- The non-abelian group of order 16 is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q16, as it is the only non-abelian group of order 16 in the list."
