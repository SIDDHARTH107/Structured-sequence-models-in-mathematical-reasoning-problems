    "message_1": "Sure, here is a specific question:\n\nA wave on a string is described by the wave equation: $y_{tt}=36y_{xx}$, subject to initial conditions $y(x,0)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $y_t(x,0)=0$. Find the displacement function $y(x,t)$ for $x\\in[0,1]$ and $t>0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$y(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we will substitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 36X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNext, we will divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 36\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. We will denote this constant as $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2$\n\n$36\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$\n\n$X''(x) - \\frac{k^2}{36}X(x) = 0$\n\nWe will solve the second equation first:\n\n$X''(x) - \\frac{k^2}{36}X(x) = 0$\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation with the general solution:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{k}{6}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{k}{6}x)$\n\nNow, we will solve the first equation:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is also a simple harmonic oscillator equation with the general solution:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(kt) + D\\sin(kt)$\n\nNow, we will apply the initial conditions:\n\n$y(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{k}{6}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{k}{6}x)$\n\n$T(0) = C\\cos(0) + D\\sin(0) = C$\n\nSince $T(0) = C = 1$, we have:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{k}{6}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{k}{6}x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\nComparing the two expressions, we can see that $A = 0$ and $\\frac{k}{6} = 2\\pi$. Therefore, $k = 12\\pi$.\n\nNow, we will apply the second initial condition:\n\n$y_t(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0$\n\n$X(x) = B\\sin(\\frac{k}{6}x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\n$T'(0) = -Ck\\sin(0) + Dk\\cos(0) = Dk$\n\nSince $T'(0) = 0$, we have $D = 0$.\n\nNow, we have the solution:\n\n$y(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(12\\pi t)$\n\nThis is the displacement function for $x\\in[0,1]$ and $t>0$."
