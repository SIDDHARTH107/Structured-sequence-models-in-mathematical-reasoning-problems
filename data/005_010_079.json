    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that a person has the disease (A) given that they tested positive (B). We are given the following information:\n\n- P(A) = prevalence rate of the disease = 0.5% = 0.005\n- P(B|A) = sensitivity = 90% = 0.9\n- P(A') = probability of not having the disease = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995\n- P(B|A') = probability of testing positive given that the person does not have the disease = 1 - specificity = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n\nNow we need to find P(B), the probability of testing positive. We can do this using the law of total probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')\n\nP(B) = (0.9 * 0.005) + (0.05 * 0.995) = 0.0045 + 0.04975 = 0.05425\n\nNow we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.9 * 0.005) / 0.05425 â‰ˆ 0.0826\n\nSo the probability that a person who tests positive for the disease actually has the disease is approximately 8.26%."
