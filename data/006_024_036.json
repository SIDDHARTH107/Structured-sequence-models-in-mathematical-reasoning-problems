    "message_1": "A tour company offers three types of packages for their holiday trip: Economy, Business, and First Class. Based on past records, it is observed that the probability of a customer choosing an Economy package is 0.4, the probability of a customer choosing a Business package is 0.35, and the probability of a customer choosing a First Class package is 0.25. If 500 customers book a trip with this tour company, how many customers are expected to book each type of package?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of customers for each package, we can multiply the total number of customers (500) by the probability of each package being chosen.\n\nEconomy package:\nExpected number of customers = 500 * 0.4 = 200\n\nBusiness package:\nExpected number of customers = 500 * 0.35 = 175\n\nFirst Class package:\nExpected number of customers = 500 * 0.25 = 125\n\nSo, we can expect 200 customers to book the Economy package, 175 customers to book the Business package, and 125 customers to book the First Class package."
