    "message_2": "To find the probability of experiencing both sunny weather and traffic on the same trip, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each event occurring.\n\nProbability of sunny weather = 60% = 0.60\nProbability of encountering traffic = 25% = 0.25\n\nProbability of both sunny weather and traffic = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15\n\nSo, there is a 15% chance of experiencing both sunny weather and traffic on the same trip."
