    "message_2": "To find the minimum point of the function using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any point x.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x + 5 is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 4\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum point. We start with an initial point x=3 and a learning rate of 0.1.\n\nThe gradient descent update rule is:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * f'(x_old)\n\nWe will perform a few iterations of this update rule to find the minimum point:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = 3\nf'(x_old) = 3*(3^2) - 4*3 + 4 = 27 - 12 + 4 = 19\nx_new = x_old - 0.1 * f'(x_old) = 3 - 0.1 * 19 = 1.1\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = 1.1\nf'(x_old) = 3*(1.1^2) - 4*1.1 + 4 ≈ 3.63 - 4.4 + 4 = 3.23\nx_new = x_old - 0.1 * f'(x_old) ≈ 1.1 - 0.1 * 3.23 ≈ 0.777\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = 0.777\nf'(x_old) ≈ 3*(0.777^2) - 4*0.777 + 4 ≈ 1.81 - 3.108 + 4 = 2.702\nx_new = x_old - 0.1 * f'(x_old) ≈ 0.777 - 0.1 * 2.702 ≈ 0.47\n\nWe can continue this process for more iterations to get closer to the minimum point. However, it's important to note that gradient descent may not always converge to the exact minimum point, and the number of iterations and learning rate should be chosen carefully.\n\nAfter a few iterations, we have found an approximate minimum point around x ≈ 0.47. To find the value of the function at this point, we can plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(x) ≈ f(0.47) = (0.47)^3 - 2*(0.47)^2 + 4*(0.47) + 5 ≈ 5.57\n\nSo, the approximate minimum point of the function using the gradient descent method with a learning rate of 0.1 and starting from an initial point x=3 is (0.47, 5.57)."
