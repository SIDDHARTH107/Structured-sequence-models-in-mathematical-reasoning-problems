    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the displacement function s(t) with respect to time t.\n\nThe displacement function is given by s(t) = 3t^2 - 2t + 1.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of s(t) with respect to t, which represents the velocity function v(t):\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(3t^2 - 2t + 1)/dt = 6t - 2.\n\nNow, we find the second derivative of s(t) with respect to t, which represents the acceleration function a(t):\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 2)/dt = 6.\n\nNow that we have the velocity and acceleration functions, we can find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds:\n\nv(2) = 6(2) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 m/s.\na(2) = 6 m/s².\n\nSo, the velocity of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 10 m/s, and the acceleration is 6 m/s²."
