    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the population mean (μ) as 165 cm and the population standard deviation (σ) as 10 cm. We are also given the sample size (n) as 25 adult females.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / √25\nσ_sample_mean = 10 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 2 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean heights (162 cm and 168 cm). The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor 162 cm:\nz1 = (162 - 165) / 2\nz1 = -3 / 2\nz1 = -1.5\n\nFor 168 cm:\nz2 = (168 - 165) / 2\nz2 = 3 / 2\nz2 = 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean height is between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(-1.5) ≈ 0.0668\nP(z2) = P(1.5) ≈ 0.9332\n\nTo find the probability that the sample mean height is between 162 and 168 cm, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(162 < x < 168) = P(z2) - P(z1)\nP(162 < x < 168) = 0.9332 - 0.0668\nP(162 < x < 168) ≈ 0.8664\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample mean height is between 162 and 168 cm is approximately 86.64%."
