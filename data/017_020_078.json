    "message_2": "There are five non-isomorphic groups of order 40, which can be represented as follows:\n\n1. C40 (Cyclic group of order 40)\nGenerators: {g^k | gcd(k, 40) = 1}, where g is a generator of the group.\nFor example, g = 1, and k can be any integer coprime to 40, such as 3, 7, 9, etc.\n\n2. C20 × C2 (Direct product of cyclic groups of orders 20 and 2)\nGenerators: {(g1, g2) | g1 is a generator of C20, g2 is a generator of C2}\nFor example, g1 = 1 and g2 = 1, so the generators are (1,1), (3,1), (7,1), etc.\n\n3. C10 × C4 (Direct product of cyclic groups of orders 10 and 4)\nGenerators: {(g1, g2) | g1 is a generator of C10, g2 is a generator of C4}\nFor example, g1 = 1 and g2 = 1, so the generators are (1,1), (3,1), (7,1), etc.\n\n4. C5 × C8 (Direct product of cyclic groups of orders 5 and 8)\nGenerators: {(g1, g2) | g1 is a generator of C5, g2 is a generator of C8}\nFor example, g1 = 1 and g2 = 1, so the generators are (1,1), (1,3), (1,7), etc.\n\n5. D40 (Dihedral group of order 40)\nGenerators: {r, s | r^20 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)}\nFor example, r = rotation by 18 degrees, s = reflection.\n\nGroup tables for these groups are quite large (40x40) and cannot be easily displayed here. However, you can find the group tables in various group theory books or online resources."
