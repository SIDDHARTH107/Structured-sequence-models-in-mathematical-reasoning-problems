    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical question for a math student to solve on the Chicken Game in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose two players, Alice and Bob, are engaged in a game of Chicken. They both start driving towards each other at 60 miles per hour on opposite sides of a straight road. They must choose whether to swerve left or right at the last moment. If they both swerve in the same direction, they avoid a collision and neither loses anything. However, if one player swerves and the other does not, the player who does not swerve gets a payoff of 100 points, while the player who swerves gets a payoff of -50 points (representing the damage to their car).\n\nAlice is a risk-taker and decides to never swerve. Bob is unsure and decides to flip a coin to determine whether to swerve or not. If the coin comes up heads, Bob will swerve to the left. If the coin comes up tails, Bob will not swerve and continue straight.\n\nWhat is the expected payoff for each player in this situation?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected payoff for each player, we need to consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities. Since Bob is flipping a coin, there is a 50% chance of heads (swerving left) and a 50% chance of tails (not swerving).\n\n1. If Bob swerves left (50% chance):\n   - Alice does not swerve and gets a payoff of 100 points.\n   - Bob swerves and gets a payoff of -50 points.\n\n2. If Bob does not swerve (50% chance):\n   - Alice does not swerve, and they collide. Since the problem does not specify the payoff for a collision, we cannot determine the exact payoff for this scenario. However, we can still calculate the expected payoff for the first scenario.\n\nExpected payoff for Alice = (0.5 * 100) + (0.5 * collision_payoff)\nExpected payoff for Bob = (0.5 * -50) + (0.5 * collision_payoff)\n\nWithout knowing the payoff for a collision, we can only partially calculate the expected payoffs:\n\nExpected payoff for Alice = 50 + 0.5 * collision_payoff\nExpected payoff for Bob = -25 + 0.5 * collision_payoff"
