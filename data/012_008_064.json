    "message_2": "According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nA planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. In a planar graph, each face is a region bounded by at least three edges. Therefore, we have:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n\nCombining this inequality with Euler's formula, we get:\n\nV - E + F ≥ V - E + (2E/3) = 2\n\nSolving for E, we obtain:\n\nE ≤ (3V - 6)\n\nFor a planar graph with 10 vertices (V = 10), the maximum number of edges is:\n\nE ≤ (3 * 10 - 6) = 24\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges that a planar graph with 10 vertices can have is 24."
