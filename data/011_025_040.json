    "message_2": "To determine who would win the game, we can analyze the game using a backward induction strategy. We will start by looking at the possible outcomes for the last few stones and work our way back to the beginning of the game.\n\nIf there are 1 or 2 stones left, neither player can win since they can only take 3 or 4 stones. If there are 3 or 4 stones left, the current player can take all the remaining stones and win.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when there are 5 stones left. If the current player takes 3 stones, the other player will take the remaining 2 stones and win. If the current player takes 4 stones, the other player will take the remaining 1 stone and win. So, in this case, the current player will lose.\n\nWhen there are 6 stones left, the current player can take 3 stones, leaving the other player with the losing position of 3 stones. So, the current player will win in this case.\n\nWhen there are 7 stones left, the current player can take 4 stones, leaving the other player with the losing position of 3 stones. So, the current player will win in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case. If the current player is in a position with a multiple of 5 stones (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.), they will lose since any move they make will leave the other player with a winning position (6 or 7 stones left). If the current player is in a position with a multiple of 5 plus 1 or 2 stones (i.e., 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, etc.), they can make a move that leaves the other player with a multiple of 5 stones, which is a losing position.\n\nSince 50 is a multiple of 5, Player 1 will be in a losing position at the start of the game. Therefore, if both players play optimally, Player 2 will win the game."
