    "message_2": "To simplify the rational expression (8x^2 + 16x) / (4x), we can first factor out the common factor of 8x from the numerator:\n\n8x(x + 2) / (4x)\n\nNow, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4x:\n\n(8x/4x)(x + 2) / (4x/4x)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2(x + 2) / 1\n\nSince dividing by 1 doesn't change the value of an expression, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2(x + 2)"
