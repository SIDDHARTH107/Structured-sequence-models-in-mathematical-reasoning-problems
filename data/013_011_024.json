    "message_1": "Consider two companies producing identical products and competing in a market. Each company sets its price independently of the other. The demand function for the product is Q = 100 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded at price P. The companies have the same constant marginal cost of production of $20.\n\nWhat price should each company set to maximize its profit and what will be the resulting quantity and profit for each company?",
    "message_2": "To find the price that each company should set to maximize its profit, we need to find the profit function and then maximize it. \n\nLet's denote the price set by Company 1 as P1 and the price set by Company 2 as P2. The quantity demanded for Company 1's product is Q1 = 100 - P1, and the quantity demanded for Company 2's product is Q2 = 100 - P2.\n\nThe total revenue for each company is the product of the price and the quantity demanded. So, the total revenue for Company 1 is TR1 = P1 * Q1 = P1 * (100 - P1), and the total revenue for Company 2 is TR2 = P2 * Q2 = P2 * (100 - P2).\n\nThe total cost for each company is the product of the marginal cost and the quantity produced. Since the marginal cost is constant at $20, the total cost for Company 1 is TC1 = 20 * Q1 = 20 * (100 - P1), and the total cost for Company 2 is TC2 = 20 * Q2 = 20 * (100 - P2).\n\nThe profit for each company is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit for Company 1 is π1 = TR1 - TC1 = P1 * (100 - P1) - 20 * (100 - P1), and the profit for Company 2 is π2 = TR2 - TC2 = P2 * (100 - P2) - 20 * (100 - P2).\n\nTo maximize the profit for each company, we need to find the first-order conditions by taking the first derivative of the profit functions with respect to the prices and setting them equal to zero.\n\nFor Company 1:\ndπ1/dP1 = (100 - P1) - P1 - 20 = 0\n80 - 2P1 = 0\nP1 = 40\n\nFor Company 2:\ndπ2/dP2 = (100 - P2) - P2 - 20 = 0\n80 - 2P2 = 0\nP2 = 40\n\nSo, each company should set its price at $40 to maximize its profit.\n\nNow, let's find the resulting quantity and profit for each company.\n\nFor Company 1:\nQ1 = 100 - P1 = 100 - 40 = 60\nπ1 = P1 * (100 - P1) - 20 * (100 - P1) = 40 * 60 - 20 * 60 = 2400 - 1200 = 1200\n\nFor Company 2:\nQ2 = 100 - P2 = 100 - 40 = 60\nπ2 = P2 * (100 - P2) - 20 * (100 - P2) = 40 * 60 - 20 * 60 = 2400 - 1200 = 1200\n\nEach company should set its price at $40, and the resulting quantity for each company will be 60 units. The profit for each company will be $1,200."
