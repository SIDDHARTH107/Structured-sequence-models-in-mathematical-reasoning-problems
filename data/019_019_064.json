    "message_2": "We define the language L as follows:\n\nL = {x âˆˆ {0, 1}* | x represents a multiple of 3 in base 10}\n\nNow, we need to determine if the language L is decidable or undecidable.\n\nA language is decidable if there exists a Turing machine that can decide it, meaning that the Turing machine can determine whether any given input string is a member of the language or not.\n\nIn this case, we can construct a Turing machine that decides L as follows:\n\n1. Convert the input binary string x to its decimal representation, say n.\n2. Check if n is divisible by 3. If it is, accept the input; otherwise, reject it.\n\nSince we can construct a Turing machine that decides L, the language L is decidable."
