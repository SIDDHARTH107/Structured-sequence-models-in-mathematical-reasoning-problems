    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose we want to solve the partial differential equation:\n\n ∂u / ∂t - ∇(k∇u) = f(x, y) , \n\nover the square domain Ω = (0, L) × (0, L), with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, ∇u · n = 0.\n\nWe want to use the finite element method with linear triangular elements to solve the equation.\n\nLet k(x, y) = 1 + x^2 + y^2 and f(x, y) = cos(x)sin(y). Use N = 50 triangular elements (i.e, 51 vertices in each direction) to compute the approximate solution u(x, y, t) at time t = 0.1 for L = 2.5.\n\nReport your results and plot the approximate solution using a contour plot.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first discretize the domain and set up the finite element method. Then, we will implement the time-stepping scheme to find the solution at t = 0.1. Finally, we will plot the approximate solution using a contour plot.\n\n1. Discretize the domain:\nWe have a square domain Ω = (0, L) × (0, L) with L = 2.5. We will use N = 50 triangular elements, which means we have 51 vertices in each direction. The distance between each vertex (h) is L / N = 2.5 / 50 = 0.05.\n\n2. Set up the finite element method:\nWe will use linear triangular elements and the Galerkin method to set up the weak form of the problem. The weak form involves finding the solution u(x, y, t) such that:\n\n∫Ω ( ∂u / ∂t * v + k(x, y) * ∇u · ∇v ) dΩ = ∫Ω f(x, y) * v dΩ, ∀v ∈ V\n\nwhere V is the space of test functions.\n\n3. Implement the time-stepping scheme:\nWe will use the backward Euler method for time discretization. This involves solving the following equation at each time step:\n\n∫Ω ( (u^(n+1) - u^n) / Δt * v + k(x, y) * ∇u^(n+1) · ∇v ) dΩ = ∫Ω f(x, y) * v dΩ, ∀v ∈ V\n\nwhere Δt is the time step size and u^n is the solution at the nth time step.\n\n4. Solve the problem at t = 0.1:\nWe will choose an appropriate time step size (e.g., Δt = 0.01) and iterate the time-stepping scheme until we reach t = 0.1. At each time step, we will solve the linear system of equations to find the approximate solution u^(n+1).\n\n5. Plot the approximate solution using a contour plot:\nOnce we have the solution at t = 0.1, we can plot the approximate solution u(x, y, t) using a contour plot.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the finite element method and time-stepping scheme requires a significant amount of programming and numerical computation. The above steps provide a high-level overview of the process. To obtain the actual results and plot, you would need to use a numerical software package (e.g., MATLAB, Python, or FEniCS) to implement the finite element method and solve the problem."
