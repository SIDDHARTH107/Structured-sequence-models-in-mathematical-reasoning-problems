    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 7, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 7)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = (3)(2)x^(3-1) - (2)(5)x^(2-1) + (1)(4)x^(1-1)\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 4\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative by differentiating f'(x):\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 10x + 4)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\nf''(x) = (2)(6)x^(2-1) - (1)(10)x^(1-1)\n\nf''(x) = 12x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 7 is f''(x) = 12x - 10."
