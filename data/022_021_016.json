    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of a function f(t), we use the definition:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0, ∞] f(t) * e^(-st) dt\n\nWe have f(t) = 2t^3 + 5e^(-3t). Let's find the Laplace transform of each term separately.\n\n1) For the term 2t^3:\n\nL{2t^3} = ∫[0, ∞] 2t^3 * e^(-st) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = t^3 and dv = 2e^(-st) dt. Then, du = 3t^2 dt and v = -e^(-st)/s. Applying integration by parts:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nL{2t^3} = -2t^3 * e^(-st) / s |[0, ∞] - ∫[0, ∞] (-3t^2 * e^(-st) / s) dt\n\nNow, let's apply integration by parts again. Let u = t^2 and dv = -3e^(-st) / s dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = 3e^(-st) / s^2.\n\nL{2t^3} = -2t^3 * e^(-st) / s |[0, ∞] + (3/s) ∫[0, ∞] t^2 * e^(-st) dt\n\nL{2t^3} = -2t^3 * e^(-st) / s |[0, ∞] + (3/s) * (t^2 * e^(-st) / s^2 - ∫[0, ∞] (2t * e^(-st) / s^2) dt)\n\nApplying integration by parts one last time. Let u = t and dv = -2e^(-st) / s^2 dt. Then, du = dt and v = 2e^(-st) / s^3.\n\nL{2t^3} = -2t^3 * e^(-st) / s |[0, ∞] + (3/s) * (t^2 * e^(-st) / s^2 |[0, ∞] - (2/s^2) ∫[0, ∞] t * e^(-st) dt)\n\nNow, we know that the Laplace transform of t^n is n! / s^(n+1). So, L{t} = 1 / s^2.\n\nL{2t^3} = -2t^3 * e^(-st) / s |[0, ∞] + (3/s) * (t^2 * e^(-st) / s^2 |[0, ∞] - (2/s^2) * (1 / s^2))\n\nL{2t^3} = 0 + 0 - (2/s) * (3/s^2) * (1/s^2)\n\nL{2t^3} = 6 / s^5\n\n2) For the term 5e^(-3t):\n\nL{5e^(-3t)} = ∫[0, ∞] 5e^(-3t) * e^(-st) dt\n\nL{5e^(-3t)} = 5 ∫[0, ∞] e^(-(s+3)t) dt\n\nNow, we know that the Laplace transform of e^(-at) is 1 / (s + a). So,\n\nL{5e^(-3t)} = 5 / (s + 3)\n\nFinally, we can combine the Laplace transforms of both terms:\n\nL{f(t)} = L{2t^3} + L{5e^(-3t)} = 6 / s^5 + 5 / (s + 3)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 2t^3 + 5e^(-3t) is F(s) = 6 / s^5 + 5 / (s + 3).\n\nThe domain of convergence for the Laplace transform is determined by the values of s for which the integral converges. In this case, the domain of convergence is:\n\ns > 0 for the term 6 / s^5\n\ns > -3 for the term 5 / (s + 3)\n\nThe intersection of these two domains is s > 0. Therefore, the domain of convergence for the Laplace transform of f(t) is s > 0."
