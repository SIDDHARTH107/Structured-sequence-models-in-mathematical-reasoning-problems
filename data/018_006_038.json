    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Suppose A = {1, 2, 3} is a subset of U. Find the complement of A, then find the union of A and its complement, and show that it equals the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we look for the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. The complement of A, denoted as A', is:\n\nA' = {4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we find the union of A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. In this case, the union of A and A' is:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nAs we can see, the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nThis demonstrates that the union of a set and its complement is equal to the universal set."
