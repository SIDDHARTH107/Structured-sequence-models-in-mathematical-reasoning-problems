    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected point in the Barnsley fern will be in the first quadrant, we need to analyze the behavior of the four functions f1, f2, f3, and f4 in the first quadrant.\n\n1. f1(x, y) = [0.00, 0.00; 0.00, 0.16] with a probability of 0.01:\nThis function maps any point to a point on the y-axis between 0 and 0.16y. Since the first quadrant is above the x-axis and to the right of the y-axis, the probability of a point being in the first quadrant after applying f1 is 1.\n\n2. f2(x, y) = [0.85, 0.04; -0.04, 0.85] with a probability of 0.85:\nThis function maps a point in the first quadrant to another point in the first quadrant, as both x and y coordinates remain positive. Therefore, the probability of a point being in the first quadrant after applying f2 is 1.\n\n3. f3(x, y) = [0.20, -0.26; 0.23, 0.22] with a probability of 0.07:\nThis function maps a point in the first quadrant to a point in the second quadrant, as the x coordinate becomes negative while the y coordinate remains positive. Therefore, the probability of a point being in the first quadrant after applying f3 is 0.\n\n4. f4(x, y) = [-0.15, 0.28; 0.26, 0.24] with a probability of 0.07:\nThis function maps a point in the first quadrant to a point in the second quadrant, as the x coordinate becomes negative while the y coordinate remains positive. Therefore, the probability of a point being in the first quadrant after applying f4 is 0.\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall probability of a point being in the first quadrant by considering the probabilities of each function:\n\nP(first quadrant) = P(f1) * P(first quadrant | f1) + P(f2) * P(first quadrant | f2) + P(f3) * P(first quadrant | f3) + P(f4) * P(first quadrant | f4)\n\nP(first quadrant) = 0.01 * 1 + 0.85 * 1 + 0.07 * 0 + 0.07 * 0\n\nP(first quadrant) = 0.01 + 0.85\n\nP(first quadrant) = 0.86\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected point in the Barnsley fern will be in the first quadrant is 0.86 or 86%."
