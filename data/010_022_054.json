    "message_2": "To find the tangent lines, we first need to find the derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to $t$. \n\n$x'(t) = -\\sin(t)$ and $y'(t) = \\cos(t)$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the curve intersects the unit circle. Since the parametric equations are already in the form of a unit circle, we know that the curve itself is the unit circle. Therefore, the points of intersection are all points on the curve.\n\nTo find the equation of the tangent line at a point $(x(t), y(t))$, we can use the point-slope form of a line: $y - y(t) = m(x - x(t))$, where $m$ is the slope of the tangent line. The slope of the tangent line can be found by taking the ratio of the derivatives: $m = \\frac{y'(t)}{x'(t)} = \\frac{\\cos(t)}{-\\sin(t)}$.\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line at a point $(x(t), y(t))$ is:\n\n$y - \\sin(t) = \\frac{\\cos(t)}{-\\sin(t)}(x - \\cos(t))$\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation:\n\n$y - \\sin(t) = -\\frac{\\cos(t)(x - \\cos(t))}{\\sin(t)}$\n\n$y\\sin(t) - \\sin^2(t) = -\\cos(t)(x - \\cos(t))$\n\n$y\\sin(t) = \\cos(t)(x - \\cos(t)) + \\sin^2(t)$\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent line at a point $(x(t), y(t))$ on the curve $C$. Since the curve is the unit circle, the tangent lines will be different for each value of $t$ in the range $0 \\leq t \\leq 2\\pi$."
