    "message_1": "Consider the system of linear equations: \n\n2x + 3y = 12 \n\n4x + 6y = 24 \n\nWhat is the solution for this system of equations?",
    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n\nThis is the same as the first equation. Since both equations are the same, they represent the same line, and there are infinitely many solutions for this system of equations. The system is dependent."
