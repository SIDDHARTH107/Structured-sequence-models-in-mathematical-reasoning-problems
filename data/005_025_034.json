    "message_2": "To find a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all apples of this type, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nx̄ = 150 grams (average weight of the sample)\nσ = 10 grams (standard deviation)\nn = 50 (sample size)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 150 ± (1.96 * (10 / √50))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (σ / √n):\n\nStandard Error = 10 / √50 ≈ 1.414\n\nNow, we can find the margin of error (Z * Standard Error):\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 1.414 ≈ 2.77\n\nFinally, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = 150 ± 2.77\n\nLower Limit = 150 - 2.77 = 147.23 grams\nUpper Limit = 150 + 2.77 = 152.77 grams\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all apples of this type is approximately (147.23, 152.77) grams."
