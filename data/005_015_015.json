    "message_2": "To find the average distance between the centroids of two clusters in a k-means clustering algorithm with k=3, we first need to perform the k-means clustering on the given data points. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids randomly. For simplicity, let's choose the first three data points as initial centroids:\n   C1 = (2,3), C2 = (4,5), C3 = (6,2)\n\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all the data points assigned to each centroid.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nAfter performing the k-means clustering algorithm, we get the following final centroids:\n\nC1 = (3, 3.333), C2 = (11.2, 8.2), C3 = (16, 12)\n\nNow, we calculate the distances between each pair of centroids:\n\nDistance(C1, C2) = sqrt((11.2 - 3)^2 + (8.2 - 3.333)^2) ≈ 10.16\nDistance(C1, C3) = sqrt((16 - 3)^2 + (12 - 3.333)^2) ≈ 15.97\nDistance(C2, C3) = sqrt((16 - 11.2)^2 + (12 - 8.2)^2) ≈ 7.24\n\nFinally, we calculate the average distance between the centroids:\n\nAverage distance = (10.16 + 15.97 + 7.24) / 3 ≈ 11.12"
