    "message_1": "Assume there are two players, A and B, in a signaling game. Player A can have either a high type (H) or a low type (L), with equal probability. Player B can observe whether A is high or low, but A cannot observe B's observation. If A chooses to signal H, it will cost them $2, otherwise, it will cost them $0. If A signals L, it will cost them $1. After A signals, B must choose between two actions: trust or don't trust A. If B trusts A and A is a high type, B gains $10, and if A is a low type, B loses $5. If B doesn't trust A, B gains $1. What is the probability that a high-type A signals H to B?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability that a high-type A signals H as p, and the probability that a low-type A signals H as q. We will use the concept of Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected payoffs for player B:\n\n1. If B trusts A after observing H:\n    - With probability p, A is high-type, and B gains $10.\n    - With probability (1-p), A is low-type, and B loses $5.\n\n    Expected payoff = 10p - 5(1-p) = 15p - 5\n\n2. If B trusts A after observing L:\n    - With probability q, A is high-type, and B gains $10.\n    - With probability (1-q), A is low-type, and B loses $5.\n\n    Expected payoff = 10q - 5(1-q) = 15q - 5\n\n3. If B doesn't trust A, B gains $1 regardless of A's signal.\n\nNow, let's find the conditions for B to trust or not trust A:\n\n- B will trust A after observing H if the expected payoff from trusting is greater than not trusting: 15p - 5 > 1, which implies p > 2/5.\n- B will trust A after observing L if the expected payoff from trusting is greater than not trusting: 15q - 5 > 1, which implies q > 2/5.\n\nNow, let's analyze the payoffs for player A:\n\n1. If high-type A signals H and B trusts:\n    - A's payoff = $10 - $2 (cost of signaling H) = $8\n\n2. If high-type A signals L and B doesn't trust:\n    - A's payoff = $1 - $1 (cost of signaling L) = $0\n\nSince the payoff for signaling H is higher for high-type A, they will always signal H. Therefore, the probability that a high-type A signals H to B is 1 (or 100%)."
