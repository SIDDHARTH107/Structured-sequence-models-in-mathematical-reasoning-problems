    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 8 cm. What is the surface area of the cube?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 faces).\n\nThe area of a square can be calculated using the formula: Area = side × side\n\nIn this case, the side length of the cube is 8 cm. So, the area of one face is:\n\nArea = 8 cm × 8 cm = 64 cm²\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by 6 to find the total surface area of the cube:\n\nSurface Area = 6 × 64 cm² = 384 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 384 cm²."
