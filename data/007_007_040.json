    "message_2": "First, we check if the greatest common divisor of 7 and 9 divides 15:\n\ngcd(7, 9) = 1\n\nSince 1 divides 15, there are integer solutions to this Diophantine equation.\n\nNow, we will find one particular solution. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers s and t such that:\n\n7s + 9t = gcd(7, 9)\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 1 * 7 + 0 * 9\n9 = 0 * 7 + 1 * 9\n\n9 - 1 * 7 = 2\n7 - 3 * 2 = 1\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1 = 7 - 3 * (9 - 1 * 7)\n1 = 7 * 4 + 9 * (-3)\n\nThus, s = 4 and t = -3. Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:\n\n15 = 7 * (4 * 15) + 9 * (-3 * 15)\n\nSo, one particular solution is:\n\nx = 4 * 15 = 60\ny = -3 * 15 = -45\n\nNow, we can find the general solution. Since the gcd(7, 9) = 1, the general solution is given by:\n\nx = 60 + 9k\ny = -45 - 7k\n\nwhere k is an integer."
