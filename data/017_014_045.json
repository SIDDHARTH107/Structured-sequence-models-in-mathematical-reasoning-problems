    "message_2": "To find all groups of order 20 up to isomorphism, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. Let G be a group of order 20.\n\n1. Sylow 5-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 4 (the index of the 5-subgroup) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1, so there is a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow 5-subgroup, which we denote by P_5.\n\n2. Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 (the index of the 2-subgroup) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow 2-subgroup, which we denote by P_2.\n\nNow we consider the possible structures of G based on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, both P_2 and P_5 are normal subgroups of G. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 20. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_5. Since P_2 is a group of order 4 and P_5 is a group of order 5, G is isomorphic to either C_4 × C_5 or C_2 × C_2 × C_5. Since C_4 × C_5 and C_2 × C_2 × C_5 are not isomorphic, we have two distinct groups in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIn this case, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal. Let Q be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since P_5 is normal, we can form the semidirect product Q ⋊ P_5. The non-abelian group of order 20 is a semidirect product of a group of order 4 and a group of order 5, so G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20 in this case.\n\nNow we can classify the groups we found:\n\n1. C_4 × C_5: This group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, as it has a single element of order 20.\n2. C_2 × C_2 × C_5: This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, as it has the structure of a group of order 2 acting on a group of order 10.\n3. The non-abelian group of order 20: This group is not isomorphic to either C20 or D10, as it is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three groups of order 20 up to isomorphism: C20, D10, and the non-abelian group of order 20."
