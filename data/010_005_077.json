    "message_2": "To determine whether X is connected, path-connected, or neither, we first need to understand the definitions of connected and path-connected spaces.\n\nA topological space X is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, X is connected if there do not exist open sets A and B such that X = A ∪ B, A ∩ B = ∅, and A, B ≠ ∅.\n\nA topological space X is path-connected if for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given subspace topology of X. The open sets of X are X, ∅, [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], and [3, 4].\n\nConnectedness:\nWe can see that X can be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets: X = [0, 1] ∪ ([1, 2] ∪ [2, 3] ∪ [3, 4]). Here, [0, 1] and ([1, 2] ∪ [2, 3] ∪ [3, 4]) are disjoint, non-empty open sets. Therefore, X is not connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nTo show that X is not path-connected, we need to find two points x, y ∈ X for which there is no continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Let x = 1 and y = 2. Suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X with f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 2. Since f is continuous, the preimage of any open set in X must be open in [0, 1]. Consider the open set [0, 1] in X. The preimage of [0, 1] under f must be open in [0, 1], but it must also contain 0 since f(0) = 1 ∈ [0, 1]. Similarly, the preimage of [1, 2] under f must be open in [0, 1] and contain 1 since f(1) = 2 ∈ [1, 2]. However, this would imply that [0, 1] can be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets, which is a contradiction since [0, 1] is connected. Therefore, there is no continuous function f: [0, 1] → X with f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 2, and X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the topological space X with the given subspace topology is neither connected nor path-connected."
