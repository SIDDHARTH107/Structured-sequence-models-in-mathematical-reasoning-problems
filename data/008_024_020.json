    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations by dividing each equation by their common factors:\n\n1) x + y + z = 6\n2) (2x + 2y + 2z)/2 = 12/2 => x + y + z = 6\n3) (3x + 3y + 3z)/3 = 18/3 => x + y + z = 6\n\nNow, we can see that all three equations are the same (x + y + z = 6). Since they are the same, they represent the same plane in three-dimensional space. Thus, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, as the entire plane is the solution.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can rewrite the equation in terms of one variable, say z:\n\nx + y + z = 6 => x + y = 6 - z\n\nNow, let's express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = 6 - y - z\n\nThe general solution to this system of linear equations can be written as:\n\nx = 6 - y - z, where y and z can be any real numbers."
