    "message_2": "To find the percentage of divorced residents, we first need to find the combined percentage of married and single residents: 60% (married) + 25% (single) = 85%.\n\nSince the remaining residents are divorced, we can find the percentage of divorced residents by subtracting the combined percentage of married and single residents from 100%: 100% - 85% = 15%.\n\nNow that we know 15% of the residents are divorced, we can calculate the number of divorced residents by multiplying the total number of residents (1000) by the percentage of divorced residents (15%): 1000 * 0.15 = 150.\n\nThere are 150 divorced residents in the community."
