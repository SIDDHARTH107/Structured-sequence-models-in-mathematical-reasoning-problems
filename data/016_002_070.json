    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by iterating the Koch curve process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nLet L_n be the length of the Koch curve after n iterations. Then, L_n = (4/3)^n * L_0, where L_0 is the initial length of the line segment (1 unit in this case).\n\nAfter five iterations, the length of the Koch curve will be:\n\nL_5 = (4/3)^5 * L_0\nL_5 = (4/3)^5 * 1\nL_5 ≈ 2.48832\n\nSince the Koch snowflake is formed by three Koch curves, the total length of the Koch snowflake after five iterations will be:\n\nLength of Koch snowflake = 3 * L_5\nLength of Koch snowflake ≈ 3 * 2.48832\nLength of Koch snowflake ≈ 7.46496 units"
