    "message_2": "The Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., they have no common divisors other than 1). \n\nTo find the totient function value of the number 27, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factors of 27. Since 27 = 3^3, it has only one distinct prime factor, which is 3.\n\nNow, we can plug this into the formula:\n\nφ(27) = 27 * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(27) = 27 * (2/3)\nφ(27) = 18\n\nSo, the totient function value of the number 27 is 18."
