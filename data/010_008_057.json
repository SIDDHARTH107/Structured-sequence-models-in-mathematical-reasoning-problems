    "message_2": "In a simplicial complex with 6 vertices, we can form a triangular face by choosing any 3 vertices out of the 6. To find the number of ways to do this, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of vertices (6 in this case) and k is the number of vertices in each triangular face (3 in this case).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= 720 / (6 * 6)\n= 20\n\nSo, there are 20 possible triangular faces in a simplicial complex with 6 vertices, where each triangular face contains exactly 3 vertices."
