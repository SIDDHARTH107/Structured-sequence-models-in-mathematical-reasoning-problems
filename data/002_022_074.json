    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 8 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the minor radius of the torus and major_radius is the major radius of the torus.\n\nGiven the major radius (R) is 8 cm and the minor radius (r) is 3 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2 * π * 8)\nVolume = (π * 9) * (16 * π)\nVolume = 144 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 144 * π^2 cubic centimeters."
