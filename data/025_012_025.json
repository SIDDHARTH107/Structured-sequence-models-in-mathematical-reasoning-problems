    "message_2": "To find the equation of the elliptic curve passing through the points P(1,1), Q(2,4), and R(4,8), we will use the general equation of an ellipse in the form:\n\nAx^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n\nWe will plug in the coordinates of the three points into the equation and solve the system of linear equations to find the coefficients A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nFor point P(1,1):\n\nA(1)^2 + B(1)(1) + C(1)^2 + D(1) + E(1) + F = 0\n\nFor point Q(2,4):\n\nA(2)^2 + B(2)(4) + C(4)^2 + D(2) + E(4) + F = 0\n\nFor point R(4,8):\n\nA(4)^2 + B(4)(8) + C(8)^2 + D(4) + E(8) + F = 0\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\nA + B + C + D + E + F = 0\n4A + 8B + 16C + 2D + 4E + F = 0\n16A + 32B + 64C + 4D + 8E + F = 0\n\nWe can simplify the system by subtracting the first equation from the second and third equations:\n\n3A + 7B + 15C + D + 3E = 0\n15A + 31B + 63C + 3D + 7E = 0\n\nNow, we can multiply the first simplified equation by 5 and subtract it from the second simplified equation:\n\n6A + 4B + 18C + 2E = 0\n\nWe can divide this equation by 2:\n\n3A + 2B + 9C + E = 0\n\nNow we have a system of three linear equations with three variables (A, B, and C):\n\nA + B + C + D + E + F = 0\n3A + 7B + 15C + D + 3E = 0\n3A + 2B + 9C + E = 0\n\nWe can eliminate the variable E by subtracting the third equation from the second equation:\n\n5B + 6C + D = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (B and C):\n\nA + B + C + D + E + F = 0\n5B + 6C + D = 0\n\nWe can eliminate the variable D by subtracting the second equation from the first equation multiplied by 5:\n\n-4B - 5C + 5E + 5F = 0\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (B and C):\n\n-4B - 5C + 5E + 5F = 0\n5B + 6C + D = 0\n\nUnfortunately, this system of linear equations does not have a unique solution, which means that there is not a unique elliptic curve that passes through the given points. This is because the given points do not satisfy the conditions required for an elliptic curve. An elliptic curve has a specific structure and properties that these points do not meet."
