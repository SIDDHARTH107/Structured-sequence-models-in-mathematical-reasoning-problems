Consider a stream cipher that uses a key of length 32 bits. \n\nIf the key stream generated by the cipher is 11011100 10101010 11001100 11100011 at the 101st bit position, what is the corresponding keystream at the 215th bit position?",
    "message_2": "To find the corresponding keystream at the 215th bit position, we need to determine the relationship between the 101st bit position and the 215th bit position.\n\nSince the key has a length of 32 bits, the key stream repeats every 32 bits. We can calculate the difference between the 215th and 101st bit positions:\n\n215 - 101 = 114\n\nNow, we need to find how many times the key stream repeats within this difference:\n\n114 / 32 = 3 (with a remainder of 18)\n\nThis means that the key stream repeats 3 times and then continues for another 18 bits. Therefore, the 215th bit position will be the same as the 18th bit position in the key stream.\n\nThe key stream is: 11011100 10101010 11001100 11100011\n\nThe 18th bit position is the second bit in the second group of 8 bits: 1\n\nSo, the corresponding keystream at the 215th bit position is 1."
