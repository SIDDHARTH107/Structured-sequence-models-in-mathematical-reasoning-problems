    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 54 and 72 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by factoring the numbers.\n\nFactoring method:\n54 = 2 × 3^3\n72 = 2^3 × 3^2\n\nThe common factors are 2 and 3^2. Multiplying these gives the GCD:\n2 × 3^2 = 2 × 9 = 18\n\nSo, the GCD of 54 and 72 is 18."
