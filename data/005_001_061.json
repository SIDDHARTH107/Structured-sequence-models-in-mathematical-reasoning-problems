    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the average weight of their cereal boxes is 16 ounces. A sample of 50 cereal boxes was taken and the average weight was found to be 15.5 ounces with a standard deviation of 1.2 ounces. Can you reject the manufacturer's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We are given the following information:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average weight of the cereal boxes is 16 ounces.\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average weight of the cereal boxes is not 16 ounces.\n\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 15.5 ounces\nPopulation mean (μ) = 16 ounces\nSample standard deviation (s) = 1.2 ounces\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = (15.5 - 16) / (1.2 / √50)\nt = (-0.5) / (1.2 / 7.071)\nt = -0.5 / 0.1698\nt ≈ -2.94\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% level of significance and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.0096.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.94) is less than the critical t-value (-2.0096), we reject the null hypothesis at a 5% level of significance. This means that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the average weight of the cereal boxes is not 16 ounces."
