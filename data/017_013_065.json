    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we need to analyze the possible structures of groups with order 18. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. There are three possible structures for groups of order 18:\n\n1. C_18: The cyclic group of order 18.\n2. C_2 x C_9: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 9.\n3. C_6 x C_3: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNow, we need to determine if any of these structures are isomorphic. The first two structures are not isomorphic since their orders are different. The third structure is not isomorphic to the first two structures since it has a different structure.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 18."
