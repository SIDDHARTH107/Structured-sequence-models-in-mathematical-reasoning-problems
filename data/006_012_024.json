    "message_1": "What is the probability of a burglary occurring at least once in a neighborhood of 200 households, given that the average burglary rate is 0.02 per household per month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of an event not happening, which is 1 minus the probability of the event happening.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a burglary not happening in a single household in a month. If the burglary rate is 0.02, then the probability of not having a burglary is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of no burglaries happening in the entire neighborhood of 200 households in a month. Since the households are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of no burglaries for each household: (0.98)^200 ≈ 0.0175.\n\nFinally, we can find the complementary probability of at least one burglary happening in the neighborhood: 1 - 0.0175 ≈ 0.9825.\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring at least once in a neighborhood of 200 households in a month is approximately 0.9825 or 98.25%."
