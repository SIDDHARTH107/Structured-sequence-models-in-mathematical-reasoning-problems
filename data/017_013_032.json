    "message_2": "To find the distinct groups of order 18, we first need to analyze the prime factorization of 18. The prime factorization of 18 is 2^1 * 3^2. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to find the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor a group of order 18, there are two types of Sylow subgroups: Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: These have order 2. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 9 (which is 18/2), and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: These have order 9. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2 (which is 18/9), and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possible value for n_3 is 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible groups based on these Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are both normal subgroups. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P and Q are both normal, their direct product P x Q forms a group of order 18. This group is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_9, which is an Abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is unique, it is a normal subgroup. Let Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since Q has order 9, it can be isomorphic to either Z_9 or Z_3 x Z_3. However, since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be isomorphic to Z_9. The semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup forms a non-Abelian group of order 18. This group is denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_2.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two distinct groups of order 18:\n\n1. Z_2 x Z_9 (Abelian)\n2. Z_9 ⋊ Z_2 (Non-Abelian)"
