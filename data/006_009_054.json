    "message_1": "If the probability of a certain medical condition occurring is 0.05, what is the probability that out of 1000 patients, exactly 50 will be diagnosed with this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, patients diagnosed with the medical condition) out of n trials (patients)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (0.05 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (1000 patients)\n- k is the number of successes (50 patients diagnosed)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 50) = C(1000, 50) * 0.05^50 * (1-0.05)^(1000-50)\n\nFirst, we calculate C(1000, 50):\n\nC(1000, 50) = 1000! / (50!(1000-50)!)\nC(1000, 50) ≈ 1.029e+28\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 50) ≈ 1.029e+28 * 0.05^50 * 0.95^950\nP(X = 50) ≈ 0.046\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 50 out of 1000 patients will be diagnosed with the medical condition is approximately 0.046 or 4.6%."
