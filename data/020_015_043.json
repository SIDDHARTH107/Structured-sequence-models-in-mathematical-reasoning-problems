    "message_1": "A cable company wants to install a new fiber-optic cable underground from point A to point B. The cable has a maximum length of 500 meters, and the company wants to minimize the cost of the installation. If the cable is 500 meters, it will cost $10 per meter to install. However, if the cable is shorter than 500 meters, it will still cost $10 per meter, but there is an additional $500 flat fee. Determine the shortest length of the cable that will minimize the cost of the installation, and calculate the total cost.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable in meters. The cost function C(x) can be defined as follows:\n\nC(x) = 10x + 500 if x < 500 meters\nC(x) = 10x if x = 500 meters\n\nWe want to minimize the cost, so we need to compare the cost of installing a cable shorter than 500 meters with the cost of installing a cable of exactly 500 meters.\n\nIf the cable is exactly 500 meters, the cost will be:\n\nC(500) = 10 * 500 = $5000\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the cable is shorter than 500 meters. The cost will be:\n\nC(x) = 10x + 500\n\nSince there is an additional $500 flat fee, the cost will always be greater than or equal to $500. Therefore, the shortest length of the cable that will minimize the cost of the installation is 500 meters, as it will not incur the additional $500 fee.\n\nThe total cost for installing a 500-meter cable is $5000."
