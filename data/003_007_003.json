    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 12 units in this case. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a = 7, b = 10, and c = 12, and the angles opposite these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. We want to find angle C.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:\n\n12^2 = 7^2 + 10^2 - 2 * 7 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 49 + 100 - 140 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we will solve for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (49 + 100 - 144) / (140)\n\ncos(C) = 5 / 140\n\ncos(C) = 1 / 28\n\nNow, we will find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value we found:\n\nC = arccos(1 / 28)\n\nC ≈ 88.21°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 88.21°."
