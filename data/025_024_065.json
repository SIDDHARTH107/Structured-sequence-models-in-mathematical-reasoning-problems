    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct orbits of $G$ on $X$, we will use the concept of stabilizers and the orbit-stabilizer theorem.\n\nLet $x = (x_0, x_1, ..., x_n) \\in X$. The stabilizer of $x$ under the action of $G$ is the set $G_x = \\{t \\in G : t \\cdot x = x\\}$. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the size of the orbit of $x$ is equal to the index of the stabilizer, i.e., $|G : G_x|$.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of $G$ on $X$. For $t \\in G$, we have $t \\cdot (x_0, x_1, ..., x_n) = (t^{a_0}x_0, t^{a_1}x_1, ..., t^{a_n}x_n)$. Since $F$ is a homogeneous polynomial, we have $F(t^{a_0}x_0, t^{a_1}x_1, ..., t^{a_n}x_n) = t^d F(x_0, x_1, ..., x_n)$, where $d$ is the degree of $F$. Thus, the action of $G$ preserves the variety $X$.\n\nNow, let's consider the orbits of $G$ on $X$. Two points $x, y \\in X$ are in the same orbit if and only if there exists $t \\in G$ such that $t \\cdot x = y$. This is equivalent to the existence of $t \\in G$ such that $(t^{a_0}x_0, t^{a_1}x_1, ..., t^{a_n}x_n) = (y_0, y_1, ..., y_n)$. Since $X$ is a projective variety, we can assume that $x_0, x_1, ..., x_n$ and $y_0, y_1, ..., y_n$ are coprime. Then, the existence of such $t$ is equivalent to the existence of $t$ such that $t^{a_i} = \\frac{y_i}{x_i}$ for all $i = 0, 1, ..., n$. This condition is satisfied if and only if $\\frac{a_i}{\\gcd(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n)} = \\frac{y_i}{x_i}$ for all $i = 0, 1, ..., n$.\n\nLet $g = \\gcd(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n)$. Then, the number of distinct orbits of $G$ on $X$ is equal to the number of distinct tuples $(k_0, k_1, ..., k_n)$ such that $\\frac{a_i}{g} = k_i$ for all $i = 0, 1, ..., n$. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of such tuples is equal to the number of ways to distribute $g$ balls into $n+1$ boxes, which is given by the stars and bars formula:\n\n$$\\binom{g + n}{n} = \\binom{g + n}{g}.$$\n\nThus, the number of distinct orbits of $G$ on $X$ is $\\binom{g + n}{n}$."
