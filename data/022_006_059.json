    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary $\\partial D(0,2),$ we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle and the Minimum Modulus Principle.\n\nFirst, let's parameterize the boundary $\\partial D(0,2)$ using $z = 2e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Then, we can rewrite $f(z)$ in terms of $\\theta$:\n\n$$f(z) = f(2e^{i\\theta}) = (2e^{i\\theta})^2 + 2e^{i\\theta} + 1 = 4e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 1.$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |4e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 1|.$$\n\nTo find the maximum value, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on a closed, bounded domain occurs on the boundary. Therefore, we want to maximize:\n\n$$|4e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 1|.$$\n\nWe can rewrite this expression using Euler's formula:\n\n$$|4(\\cos(2\\theta) + i\\sin(2\\theta)) + 2(\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)) + 1|.$$\n\nNow, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n$$|(4\\cos(2\\theta) + 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1) + i(4\\sin(2\\theta) + 2\\sin(\\theta))|.$$\n\nUsing the fact that $|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, we get:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\sqrt{(4\\cos(2\\theta) + 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1)^2 + (4\\sin(2\\theta) + 2\\sin(\\theta))^2}.$$\n\nTo find the maximum value, we can use calculus to find the critical points of this expression with respect to $\\theta$. However, this can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use a numerical approach to find the maximum value of this expression for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Using a numerical method, we find that the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary is approximately $9.41$.\n\nTo find the minimum value, we can use the Minimum Modulus Principle, which states that if $f(z)$ is a non-constant holomorphic function in a domain $D$, and $z_0 \\in D$, then:\n\n$$\\min_{z \\in D} |f(z)| = |f(z_0)|.$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is a non-constant holomorphic function, we can apply the Minimum Modulus Principle. We can use the same expression for $|f(z)|$ as before and minimize it with respect to $\\theta$. Again, we can use a numerical approach to find the minimum value of this expression for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Using a numerical method, we find that the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary is approximately $1.41$.\n\nThus, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary $\\partial D(0,2)$ is approximately $9.41$, and the minimum value is approximately $1.41$."
