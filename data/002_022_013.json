    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 8 meters and a minor radius of 3 meters. Find the volume of the torus in cubic meters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the radius of the circular cross-section of the torus (3 meters) and major_radius is the distance from the center of the circular cross-section to the center of the torus (8 meters).\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2 * π * 8)\nVolume = (π * 9) * (16 * π)\nVolume = 144 * π^2\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 144π^2 cubic meters, or approximately 1421.22 cubic meters."
