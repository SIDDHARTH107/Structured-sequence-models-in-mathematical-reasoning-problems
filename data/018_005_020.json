    "message_2": "First, let's define the sets A and B.\n\nSet A consists of even numbers between 1 to 10. So, A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.\n\nSet B is the complement of A, which means it consists of all the numbers between 1 to 10 that are not in A. So, B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of set A and its complement, which is denoted by A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIn this case, there are no common elements between A and B, as A consists of even numbers and B consists of odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nTo prove that the intersection of A and its complement is equal to the empty set, we can use the definition of the complement and intersection.\n\nBy definition, the complement of a set A (denoted as A') contains all the elements that are not in A. So, for any element x, if x ∈ A, then x ∉ A', and if x ∈ A', then x ∉ A.\n\nThe intersection of two sets A and B (denoted as A ∩ B) contains all the elements that are in both A and B. So, for any element x, if x ∈ A ∩ B, then x ∈ A and x ∈ B.\n\nNow, let's assume that there exists an element x such that x ∈ A ∩ B. This would mean that x ∈ A and x ∈ B. However, since B is the complement of A, if x ∈ A, then x ∉ B. This contradicts our assumption that x ∈ A ∩ B.\n\nTherefore, there cannot be any element x that belongs to both A and B, which means A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set)."
