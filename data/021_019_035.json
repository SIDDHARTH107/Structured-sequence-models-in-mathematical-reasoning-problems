    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 using the HS algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n   - Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of choosing a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n   - Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting the pitch of a chosen harmony (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of iterations (NI): The maximum number of iterations (e.g., 1000)\n   - Search space: Define the range of x values (e.g., -10 to 10)\n\n2. Initialize the harmony memory (HM) with randomly generated solutions within the search space.\n\n3. For each iteration, do the following:\n   a. Create a new harmony vector (solution) by considering each decision variable (x) in the problem.\n      - With a probability of HMCR, select a value for x from the harmony memory.\n      - With a probability of PAR, adjust the pitch of the selected x value by adding or subtracting a small random value.\n      - With a probability of 1 - HMCR, generate a new random value for x within the search space.\n   b. Evaluate the new harmony vector using the objective function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1.\n   c. If the new harmony vector is better than the worst harmony in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony vector.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 for the specified number of iterations (NI).\n\n5. After completing the iterations, the best harmony vector in the harmony memory represents the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nNote that the HS algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the results may vary between different runs. To improve the reliability of the solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and take the best result."
