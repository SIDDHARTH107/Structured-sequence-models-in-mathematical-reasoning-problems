    "message_2": "To solve the cubic equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0, we can first try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, 6) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, the only possible value for q is 1. Therefore, we only need to check the factors of 6: ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nBy testing these values, we find that x = 1 is a root of the equation:\n\n(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor. We will divide the cubic equation by (x - 1):\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6)\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation to solve:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nSo the remaining roots are x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nThe solutions to the cubic equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
