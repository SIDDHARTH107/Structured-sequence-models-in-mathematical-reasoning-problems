    "message_1": "Consider a population of bacteria whose growth can be modeled using the differential equation: \n\ndP/dt = 0.5P \n\nWhere P is the population size at time t, and 0.5 is the growth rate constant.\n\nIf the initial population is 100, what will be the population after 6 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the given differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the specific solution.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndP/dt = 0.5P\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation, and it can be solved by separating variables and integrating both sides. \n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.5 dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.5 dt\n\nThe left side is the integral of 1/P with respect to P, which is ln|P|. The right side is the integral of 0.5 with respect to t, which is 0.5t. So, we have:\n\nln|P| = 0.5t + C\n\nNow, we need to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.5t + C) = e^(0.5t) * e^C\n\nLet's call e^C = k, a constant:\n\nP(t) = ke^(0.5t)\n\nNow, we use the initial condition P(0) = 100 to find the value of k:\n\n100 = k * e^(0.5 * 0)\n100 = k * e^0\n100 = k * 1\nk = 100\n\nSo, the specific solution to the differential equation is:\n\nP(t) = 100 * e^(0.5t)\n\nNow, we can find the population after 6 hours by plugging t = 6 into the equation:\n\nP(6) = 100 * e^(0.5 * 6)\nP(6) = 100 * e^3\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of e^3:\n\ne^3 ≈ 20.0855\n\nSo, the population after 6 hours is:\n\nP(6) ≈ 100 * 20.0855\nP(6) ≈ 2008.55\n\nTherefore, the population after 6 hours will be approximately 2008.55 bacteria."
