The production of product A requires 2 hours of labour and 1 hour of machine time, while the production of product B requires 1 hour of labour and 3 hours of machine time. The factory has 90 hours of labour and 108 hours of machine time available per week. If the profit from each unit of product A sold is $5 and from each unit of product B is $7, how many units of each product should the factory produce per week in order to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced per week and y be the number of units of product B produced per week.\n\nThe constraints for labour and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabour: 2x + y ≤ 90\nMachine time: x + 3y ≤ 108\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Rearrange the labour constraint equation:\ny ≤ -2x + 90\n\n2. Rearrange the machine time constraint equation:\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 36\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. There are three vertices: (0, 0), (0, 36), and (30, 30).\n\n1. At point (0, 0), the profit is:\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n\n2. At point (0, 36), the profit is:\nP(0, 36) = 5(0) + 7(36) = $252\n\n3. At point (30, 30), the profit is:\nP(30, 30) = 5(30) + 7(30) = $360\n\nThe maximum profit of $360 is achieved when the factory produces 30 units of product A and 30 units of product B per week."
