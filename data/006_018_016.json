    "message_1": "In a company, the probability of financial fraud occurring in any given year is 0.3. If the company has a total of 20 employees, what is the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in financial fraud within a year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, employees involved in financial fraud) in n trials (in this case, the total number of employees)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an employee being involved in financial fraud, which is 0.3)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of an employee not being involved in financial fraud, which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of employees, which is 20)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of employees involved in financial fraud)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in financial fraud, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 5, 6, ..., 20.\n\nP(X >= 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + ... + P(X = 20)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and then sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 5) = Σ [(20Ck) * (0.3^k) * (0.7^(20-k))] for k = 5 to 20\n\nCalculating each term and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X >= 5) ≈ 0.9791\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in financial fraud within a year is approximately 0.9791 or 97.91%."
