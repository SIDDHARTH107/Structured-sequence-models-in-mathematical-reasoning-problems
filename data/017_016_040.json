    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will first compute the commutator subgroup [G, G] and then analyze the structure of G based on the properties of [G, G].\n\nRecall that the commutator subgroup [G, G] is generated by elements of the form g^(-1)h^(-1)gh for all g, h in G. Also, note that the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3). We can use the following facts about p-groups:\n\n1. The center of a non-trivial p-group is non-trivial (i.e., it contains more than just the identity element).\n2. A group of order p^n is abelian if and only if its commutator subgroup is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element).\n\nNow, let's compute the commutator subgroup [G, G]:\n\nSince G is a group of order 27, it has a non-trivial center Z(G). There are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G = Z(G)\nIn this case, G is an abelian group, and thus [G, G] is trivial. Since G is abelian and has order 27, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C27, C9 x C3, or C3 x C3 x C3. However, since G has a non-trivial center, it cannot be isomorphic to C3 x C3 x C3. Also, G cannot be isomorphic to C9 x C3, because the order of elements in C9 x C3 is at most 9, while G must have an element of order 27 (by Cauchy's theorem). Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: G ≠ Z(G)\nIn this case, G is not equal to its center, and thus G/Z(G) is a non-trivial group. Since the order of G is 27 and the order of Z(G) must be a divisor of 27, the possible orders for Z(G) are 3 and 9. \n\nIf |Z(G)| = 3, then |G/Z(G)| = 9. Since G/Z(G) is a group of order 9, it must be abelian (as it is a group of prime power order). Therefore, [G, G] ⊆ Z(G). However, since G ≠ Z(G), [G, G] cannot be trivial. Thus, |[G, G]| = 3, and G has a normal subgroup of order 3. \n\nIf |Z(G)| = 9, then |G/Z(G)| = 3. In this case, G/Z(G) is cyclic, which implies that G is abelian. This contradicts our assumption that G ≠ Z(G). Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 (when G = Z(G)) or a non-abelian group of order 27 with a normal subgroup of order 3 (when G ≠ Z(G)). Since there is only one non-abelian group of order 27 up to isomorphism, G must be isomorphic to either C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27."
