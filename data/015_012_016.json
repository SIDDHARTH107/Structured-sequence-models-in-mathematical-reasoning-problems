    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, which is a system of three ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sigma (y - x) \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = x (\\rho - z) - y \\\\\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \\beta z\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $x, y, z$ are the variables and $\\sigma, \\rho, \\beta$ are the parameters. In this case, we have $\\sigma = 10, \\rho = 28,$ and $\\beta = 8/3$.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It can be computed numerically using various algorithms. One common method is the Wolf algorithm, which involves calculating the average exponential rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space.\n\nHowever, computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent analytically is not possible for the Lorenz system. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to approximate the value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent.\n\nUsing numerical methods, the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Lorenz system with the given parameters is approximately $\\lambda_{max} \\approx 0.9056$."
