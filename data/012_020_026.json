    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of a graph, we need to determine all the possible ways to relabel the vertices such that the graph remains unchanged. Let's first analyze the possible structures of a simple undirected graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges.\n\nThere are two possible structures for this graph:\n\n1. A cycle of length 6 (C6): In this case, the graph is a simple cycle with 6 vertices connected in a circular manner. The automorphism group of C6 is the dihedral group D6, which has 12 elements. These elements include 6 rotations (including the identity) and 6 reflections.\n\n2. A tree with one vertex of degree 4 (star graph): In this case, the graph has a central vertex connected to 4 other vertices, and one of these vertices is connected to another leaf vertex. The automorphism group of this graph has 4! = 24 elements, corresponding to the permutations of the 4 vertices connected to the central vertex.\n\nIn conclusion, the automorphism group of a simple undirected graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges depends on the structure of the graph. If the graph is a cycle of length 6, its automorphism group is the dihedral group D6 with 12 elements. If the graph is a tree with one vertex of degree 4, its automorphism group has 24 elements."
