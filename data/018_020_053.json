    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A△B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we can find A△B:\n\nA△B = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B))\nA△B = ({1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 4}) ∪ ({2, 4, 6, 8} - {2, 4})\nA△B = {1, 3} ∪ {6, 8}\nA△B = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A△B and C:\n\nA△B = {1, 3, 6, 8}\nC = {3, 6, 9}\n(A△B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 6, 8} ∪ {3, 6, 9}\n(A△B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over union using this example.
