    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at point P using the Fourier transform method, we first need to express the magnetic field in terms of the current density J(x, y) and the Green's function G(x, y, x', y').\n\nThe current density J(x, y) for a wire carrying a uniform current I = 2A along the z-axis can be expressed as:\n\nJ(x, y) = 2A * δ(x) * δ(y - 5 cm)\n\nwhere δ(x) and δ(y - 5 cm) are Dirac delta functions.\n\nNow, we need to find the Green's function G(x, y, x', y') for the magnetic field. The Green's function for the magnetic field in free space is given by:\n\nG(x, y, x', y') = μ₀ / (4π * sqrt((x - x')² + (y - y')²))\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nThe magnetic field B(x, y) at point P can be obtained by convolving the current density J(x, y) with the Green's function G(x, y, x', y'):\n\nB(x, y) = ∬ J(x', y') * G(x, y, x', y') dx' dy'\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform method to solve this convolution integral. The Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function is:\n\nF[δ(x)] = 1\n\nF[δ(y - 5 cm)] = exp(-2πiky₀)\n\nwhere k is the wave number and y₀ = 5 cm.\n\nThe Fourier transform of the Green's function is:\n\nF[G(x, y, x', y')] = exp(-2πik|y - y'|)\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform of the magnetic field B(x, y):\n\nF[B(x, y)] = F[J(x', y')] * F[G(x, y, x', y')]\n\nF[B(x, y)] = (1) * (exp(-2πiky₀)) * (exp(-2πik|y - y'|))\n\nNow, we can compute the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the magnetic field B(x, y) at point P:\n\nB(x, y) = F^(-1)[F[B(x, y)]]\n\nB(x, y) = (1 / (2π)) * ∬ exp(2πik(x - x' + y - y')) * exp(-2πiky₀) * exp(-2πik|y - y'|) dkx dky\n\nAfter evaluating this integral, we can obtain the magnetic field B(x, y) at point P. However, this integral is quite complex and may not have a closed-form solution. Therefore, it is recommended to use numerical methods to evaluate the magnetic field at point P."
