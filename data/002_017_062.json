    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4. In this case, the side length is 6 cm.\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (6^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = (36 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = 9 * sqrt(3) square centimeters.\n\nSince there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon, the total area of the hexagon is:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (9 * sqrt(3)) = 54 * sqrt(3) square centimeters."
