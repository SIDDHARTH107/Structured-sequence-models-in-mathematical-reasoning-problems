    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In this case, we are asked to find the volume of a Menger sponge of order 2, where each stage of the construction reduces the length of each side by a factor of 3.\n\nLet's start with the initial cube, which has a side length of 1 unit. The volume of this cube is 1^3 = 1 cubic unit.\n\nIn the first stage of the construction, we remove 1/3 of the smaller cubes from the larger cube, leaving 2/3 of the smaller cubes. Since there are 3^3 = 27 smaller cubes in the larger cube, we remove 1/3 * 27 = 9 smaller cubes. This leaves 18 smaller cubes, each with a side length of 1/3 units. The total volume of these 18 smaller cubes is 18 * (1/3)^3 = 18 * 1/27 = 2/3 cubic units.\n\nIn the second stage of the construction, we remove 1/3 of the even smaller cubes from each of the 18 remaining smaller cubes. Since there are 3^3 = 27 even smaller cubes in each smaller cube, we remove 1/3 * 27 = 9 even smaller cubes from each smaller cube. This leaves 18 smaller cubes, each with 18 even smaller cubes remaining. Each even smaller cube has a side length of 1/9 units. The total volume of these 18 * 18 = 324 even smaller cubes is 324 * (1/9)^3 = 324 * 1/729 = 4/9 cubic units.\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 2 is 4/9 cubic units."
