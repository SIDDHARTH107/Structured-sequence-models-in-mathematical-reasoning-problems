    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\nA ∩ B = {6}\n\nSo, A △ B = {3, 4, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A △ B) and {6}:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ {6} = {3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's verify if the result satisfies the distributive property for the symmetric difference over union:\n\nThe distributive property states that A △ (B ∪ C) = (A △ B) ∪ (A △ C)\n\nIn our case, we have A, B, and {6} as C. Let's find A △ (B ∪ C):\n\nB ∪ C = {3, 6, 9} ∪ {6} = {3, 6, 9}\nA △ (B ∪ C) = A △ {3, 6, 9} = {4, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) ∪ (A △ C):\n\n(A △ B) = {3, 4, 8, 9, 10}\n(A △ C) = {4, 8, 10}\n(A △ B) ∪ (A △ C) = {3, 4, 8, 9, 10} ∪ {4, 8, 10} = {3, 4, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince (A △ B) ∪ {6} = {3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10} and (A △ B) ∪ (A △ C) = {3, 4, 8, 9, 10}, the distributive property for the symmetric difference over union does not hold in this case."
