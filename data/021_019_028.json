    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. A unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and yields a profit of $80, while a unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor and yields a profit of $120. The factory has 200 hours of labor and $600 for material at its disposal. How many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit? Use Harmony Search algorithm to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Harmony Search algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 80A + 120B\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 2A + 3B <= 200\n2. Material constraint: We do not have enough information about the material cost for each product, so we cannot include this constraint in the problem.\n\nParameters for Harmony Search algorithm:\n1. Harmony memory size (HMS): The number of solutions in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n2. Harmony memory considering rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n3. Pitch adjusting rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a value after selecting it from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.3)\n4. Number of improvisations (NI): The number of iterations for the algorithm (e.g., 1000)\n\nNow, we can apply the Harmony Search algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize the harmony memory with random solutions respecting the constraints.\n2. For each iteration (improvisation), create a new harmony by selecting values for A and B.\n   a. With probability HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory for A and B.\n   b. With probability PAR, adjust the selected values for A and B.\n   c. Ensure the new harmony respects the constraints.\n3. Evaluate the objective function for the new harmony.\n4. If the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the specified number of improvisations (NI).\n\nAfter the algorithm finishes, the best solution in the harmony memory will be the optimal solution for the problem. The optimal number of units of products A and B to maximize profit will be the values of A and B in the best solution."
