    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that allows us to isolate x. Since 27 is a power of 3 (3^3), we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n3^(2x+3) = 3^3\n\nNow that we have the same base on both sides of the equation, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x + 3 = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 3 - 3\n2x = 0\nx = 0/2\nx = 0"
