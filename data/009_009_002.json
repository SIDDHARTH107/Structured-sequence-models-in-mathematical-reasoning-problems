Find the energy levels and wave functions for the first three states of the particle in the box if L = 1 nm and m = 9.11×10^(-31) kg. Round your answers to three significant figures.",
    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box, we first need to consider the boundary conditions. Since the potential energy is infinite outside the box, the wave function must be zero outside the box. Also, the wave function is given to be zero at the boundaries of the box. Therefore, we have:\n\nψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0\n\nInside the box, the potential energy is zero, so the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n-ℏ²/2m d²ψ/dx² = E ψ\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\n\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0\n\nThis implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, the wave number k is given by:\n\nk = nπ/L\n\nNow, we can find the energy levels E using the relation:\n\nE = ℏ²k²/2m\n\nSubstituting the expression for k, we get:\n\nE = ℏ²(nπ/L)²/2m\n\nGiven L = 1 nm = 1 × 10^(-9) m and m = 9.11 × 10^(-31) kg, we can calculate the energy levels for the first three states (n = 1, 2, 3). The reduced Planck constant, ℏ, is approximately 1.054 × 10^(-34) Js.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\nE₁ = (1.054 × 10^(-34))^2 * (π/1 × 10^(-9))^2 / (2 * 9.11 × 10^(-31))\nE₁ ≈ 6.024 × 10^(-20) J\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nE₂ = (1.054 × 10^(-34))^2 * (2π/1 × 10^(-9))^2 / (2 * 9.11 × 10^(-31))\nE₂ ≈ 2.410 × 10^(-19) J\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nE₃ = (1.054 × 10^(-34))^2 * (3π/1 × 10^(-9))^2 / (2 * 9.11 × 10^(-31))\nE₃ ≈ 5.418 × 10^(-19) J\n\nNow, we can find the wave functions for the first three states using the expression:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx)\n\nFor n = 1:\n\nψ₁(x) = A₁ sin(πx/L)\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nψ₂(x) = A₂ sin(2πx/L)\n\nFor n = 3:\n\nψ₃(x) = A₃ sin(3πx/L)\n\nTo find the normalization constants A₁, A₂, and A₃, we need to ensure that the integral of the probability density |ψ(x)|² over the box is equal to 1:\n\n∫₀ᴸ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nFor each state, this gives:\n\nA₁² ∫₀ᴸ sin²(πx/L) dx = 1\nA₂² ∫₀ᴸ sin²(2πx/L) dx = 1\nA₃² ∫₀ᴸ sin²(3πx/L) dx = 1\n\nSolving these integrals, we find:\n\nA₁ = √(2/L) ≈ √2 nm^(-1/2)\nA₂ = √(2/L) ≈ √2 nm^(-1/2)\nA₃ = √(2/L) ≈ √2 nm^(-1/2)\n\nSo the wave functions for the first three states are:\n\nψ₁(x) = √2 sin(πx) nm^(-1/2)\nψ₂(x) = √2 sin(2πx) nm^(-1/2)\nψ₃(x) = √2 sin(3πx) nm^(-1/2)\n\nIn summary, the energy levels for the first three states are:\n\nE₁ ≈ 6.024 × 10^(-20) J\nE₂ ≈ 2.410 × 10^(-19) J\nE₃ ≈ 5.418 × 10^(-19) J\n\nAnd the wave functions are:\n\nψ₁(x) = √2 sin(πx) nm^(-1/2)\nψ₂(x) = √2 sin(2πx) nm^(-1/2)\nψ₃(x) = √2 sin(3πx) nm^(-1/2)"
