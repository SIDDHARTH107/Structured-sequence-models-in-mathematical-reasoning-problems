    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 6 centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (6 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 36 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 144π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14, we get:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 144 * 3.14 cm^2\n\nSurface Area ≈ 452.16 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 452.16 square centimeters."
