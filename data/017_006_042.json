    "message_2": "To determine the structure of a group of order 35, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, we know that G has a 5-Sylow subgroup and a 7-Sylow subgroup.\n\nLet n_5 and n_7 be the number of 5-Sylow and 7-Sylow subgroups of G, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom the first condition, n_5 can only be 1 or 7. However, since n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5), we have n_5 = 1. Similarly, from the second condition, n_7 can only be 1 or 5, and since n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we have n_7 = 1.\n\nNow, let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G (by the Sylow theorems). Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 7 are prime numbers), we have:\n\n|P ∩ Q| = 1\n\nNow, consider the product of the elements of P and Q:\n\nR = {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}\n\nSince P and Q are normal in G, the set R is closed under the group operation. Moreover, the identity element of G is in R, and the inverse of any element in R is also in R. Therefore, R is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the order of the product of two subgroups:\n\n|R| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|\n\nSince |P| = 5, |Q| = 7, and |P ∩ Q| = 1, we have:\n\n|R| = 5 * 7 / 1 = 35\n\nSince |R| = |G|, we have R = G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q:\n\nG ≅ P × Q\n\nSince P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7 (by the Sylow theorems), we have:\n\nG ≅ C_5 × C_7\n\nThus, the group of order 35 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
