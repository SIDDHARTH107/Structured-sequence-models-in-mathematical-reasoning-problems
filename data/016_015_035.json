    "message_2": "The Hilbert Curve is a space-filling curve, and its total length increases with each order. The length of the curve at each order can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Number of segments) * (Length of each segment)\n\nFor the Hilbert Curve, the number of segments at each order is 4^n, where n is the order. The length of each segment at each order is (1/2)^n, where n is the order.\n\nFor the 4th order Hilbert Curve, we have:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^4 = 256\nLength of each segment = (1/2)^4 = 1/16\n\nTotal length = 256 * (1/16) = 16 units"
