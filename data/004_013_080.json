    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of material used to construct the tank, we need to minimize its surface area. The volume V and surface area A of a right circular cylinder can be expressed as follows:\n\nV = πr²h\nA = 2πrh + 2πr²\n\nWe are given that the volume of the tank is 400 cubic feet. Therefore, we can write:\n\n400 = πr²h\n\nWe need to express h in terms of r, so we can write:\n\nh = 400 / (πr²)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA(r) = 2πr(400 / (πr²)) + 2πr²\nA(r) = (800 / r) + 2πr²\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we need to find the critical points of A(r) by taking its derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -800/r² + 4πr\n\nNow, we set dA/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -800/r² + 4πr\n800/r² = 4πr\n800 = 4πr³\nr³ = 800 / (4π)\nr³ = 200 / π\nr = (200 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nh = 400 / (πr²)\nh = 400 / (π(200 / π)^(2/3))\nh = 400 / (200^(2/3))\nh = 2(200^(1/3))\n\nSo, the dimensions of the tank that will minimize the amount of material used to construct it are:\n\nr ≈ (200 / π)^(1/3) feet\nh ≈ 2(200^(1/3)) feet"
