    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 over the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 2x\n\nx^2 = x\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nSo, the points of intersection are (0, 0) and (1, 1). Now, we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 1]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative:\n\nF(x) = x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\nArea = F(1) - F(0) = (1^2 - (2/3)(1)^3) - (0^2 - (2/3)(0)^3) = 1 - (2/3) = 1/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 over the interval [0, 2] is 1/3 square units."
