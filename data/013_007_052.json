    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 10 farmers own a communal grazing area that can support a maximum of 100 cows. Each farmer decides how many cows to graze on the land to maximize their own profit. However, the commons can become overgrazed and damaged if more than 100 cows are on the land. Each cow generates a profit of $50 for its owner, but each additional cow above the capacity reduces the profit per cow by $10 for all farmers. If each farmer only considers their own profit, how many cows will be grazed on the commons? What is the maximum total profit the group can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of cows each farmer grazes as x. Since there are 10 farmers, the total number of cows grazed on the commons will be 10x. The profit per cow is $50, but it decreases by $10 for each cow above the capacity of 100. So, the profit per cow can be represented as P(x) = 50 - 10 * (10x - 100).\n\nEach farmer wants to maximize their own profit, which is the product of the number of cows they have and the profit per cow: x * P(x). To find the maximum profit, we can take the derivative of this function with respect to x and set it equal to 0.\n\nd(x * P(x))/dx = d(x * (50 - 10 * (10x - 100)))/dx = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nd(50x - 1000x^2 + 10000x)/dx = 0\n\nTaking the derivative, we have:\n\n50 - 2000x + 10000 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n2000x = 9950\nx = 4.975\n\nSince the number of cows must be an integer, each farmer will graze either 4 or 5 cows. In this case, they will choose to graze 5 cows each, as it will maximize their individual profit. So, there will be a total of 10 * 5 = 50 cows grazed on the commons.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum total profit the group can earn. Since the commons can support a maximum of 100 cows, the maximum profit per cow is $50. Therefore, the maximum total profit the group can earn is:\n\n100 cows * $50/cow = $5000."
