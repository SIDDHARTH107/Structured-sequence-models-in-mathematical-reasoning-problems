    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the height (a) is 9 cm and the base (b) is 12 cm.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (9 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nc² = 81 cm² + 144 cm²\nc² = 225 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse (c):\n\nc = √(225 cm²)\nc = 15 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 15 cm."
