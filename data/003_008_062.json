    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine function. First, we need to find one of the angles of the triangle. Let's call the base angle A, the opposite angle B, and the right angle C. We have a right-angled triangle with the base (adjacent side) of 8 cm and the height (opposite side) of 12 cm.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find angle A:\n\ntan(A) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(A) = 12 cm / 8 cm\ntan(A) = 1.5\n\nNow, we can find angle A:\n\nA = arctan(1.5)\nA ≈ 56.31°\n\nNow that we have angle A, we can find the area of the triangle using the sine function. The formula for the area of a triangle using trigonometry is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nIn our case:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 12 cm * sin(56.31°)\nArea ≈ 0.5 * 8 cm * 12 cm * 0.833\nArea ≈ 40 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 40 cm²."
