    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of producing a defective product is 0.05. If 500 products are produced, what is the probability that less than 20 products will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 500)\n- k is the number of defective products (we want to find the probability of having less than 20 defective products)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k defective products from n total products, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of producing a defective product (0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of producing a non-defective product (0.95)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having less than 20 defective products, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 19:\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability for each k and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nCalculating this sum:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.9648\n\nSo, the probability of having less than 20 defective products out of 500 is approximately 0.9648 or 96.48%."
