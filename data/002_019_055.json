    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (which is a circle) and the lateral surface area (which is the area of the curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, and l is the slant height of the cone. We are given the radius (r = 5 cm) and the height (h = 10 cm), but we need to find the slant height (l). We can do this using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nl^2 = (5 cm)^2 + (10 cm)^2\nl^2 = 25 cm^2 + 100 cm^2\nl^2 = 125 cm^2\nl = √125 cm\nl ≈ 11.18 cm\n\nNow we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(5 cm)(5 cm + 11.18 cm)\nSurface Area ≈ 3.14 * 5 cm * 16.18 cm\nSurface Area ≈ 254.34 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 254.34 square centimeters."
