    "message_2": "To find the expected number of pedestrians hit by a car, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number = Probability of an event * Number of trials\n\nIn this case, the probability of a pedestrian being hit by a car is 0.05, and the number of trials (pedestrians crossing the road) is 100.\n\nExpected number = 0.05 * 100 = 5\n\nSo, the expected number of pedestrians that will be hit by a car during rush hour is 5."
