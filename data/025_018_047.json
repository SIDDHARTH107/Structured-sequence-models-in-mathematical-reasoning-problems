Suppose that ρ(X) = 1, which means that X has only one rational curve. If H is an effective divisor on X with [H] ∙ [H] = 0 and such that L ∙ H = 1, then show that H is numerically equivalent to a multiple of the unique rational curve on X.",
    "message_2": "Let C be the unique rational curve on X. Since ρ(X) = 1, the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted by NS(X), is generated by the class of C, say [C]. Thus, any divisor class on X can be written as a multiple of [C]. \n\nNow, let's consider the intersection product of H and C. Since H is effective and [H] ∙ [H] = 0, by the Hodge Index Theorem, we have [H] ∙ [C] > 0. Let's denote this intersection product by n, i.e., [H] ∙ [C] = n.\n\nSince NS(X) is generated by [C], there exists an integer m such that [H] = m[C]. Now, we compute the intersection product L ∙ H using this expression:\n\nL ∙ H = L ∙ (m[C]) = m(L ∙ [C]).\n\nWe are given that L ∙ H = 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n1 = m(L ∙ [C]).\n\nSince L is very ample, L ∙ [C] > 0. Thus, m must be equal to 1, and we have [H] = [C]. This shows that H is numerically equivalent to the unique rational curve on X, as desired."
