    "message_2": "Let's use the handshaking lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, since every vertex is adjacent to exactly 3 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 6 * 3 = 18. Since there are 10 edges, the handshaking lemma tells us that 18 = 2 * 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of triangles in $K$. Let $t$ be the number of triangles. Each triangle has 3 edges, and each edge is part of exactly 2 triangles. Therefore, the total number of \"edge-triangle incidences\" is $3t$. Since each edge is part of exactly 2 triangles, we have:\n\n3t = 2 * 10\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\nt = 20 / 3\n\nHowever, the number of triangles must be an integer. This means that there is no simplicial complex $K$ with 6 vertices and 10 edges such that every vertex is adjacent to exactly 3 edges."
