We can use backtracking to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nLet's start with vertex 1 and try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8\n\nNow we need to check if there is an edge between vertex 8 and vertex 1 to complete the cycle. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we can see that there is no edge between vertex 8 and vertex 1.\n\nHowever, we can try a different path:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7\n\nNow we need to check if there is an edge between vertex 7 and vertex 1 to complete the cycle. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we can see that there is an edge between vertex 7 and vertex 1.\n\nSo, the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and the sequence of vertices that form the cycle is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1"
