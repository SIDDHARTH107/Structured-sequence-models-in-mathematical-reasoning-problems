    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian variety J(C) of the curve C, we first need to compute the differentials on the curve. The curve C is given by the equation F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x - 1 = 0. The differentials are given by:\n\ndx = ∂F/∂x dx + ∂F/∂y dy = 0\ndy = ∂F/∂y dx + ∂F/∂x dy = 0\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nSubstitute these into the differential equations:\n\n(-3x^2 + 4) dx + 2y dy = 0\n2y dx - (3x^2 - 4) dy = 0\n\nNow, we can find the basis of holomorphic differentials on C. Since C is a curve of genus 2, there will be two linearly independent holomorphic differentials. We can find these by solving the following equation:\n\nω = f(x, y) dx + g(x, y) dy\n\nwhere f(x, y) and g(x, y) are rational functions on C. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\nω = f(x, y) (-3x^2 + 4) dx + g(x, y) (2y) dy\n\nNow, we can find the basis of holomorphic differentials by finding two linearly independent solutions to this equation. One possible basis is:\n\nω₁ = dx / (2y)\nω₂ = x dx / (2y)\n\nNow that we have the basis of holomorphic differentials, we can compute the period matrix of C. The period matrix is a 2x2 matrix, where the (i, j)-th entry is given by the integral of the product of the i-th and j-th basis elements over the curve C:\n\nΩ = ( ∫ ω₁ ω₁  ∫ ω₁ ω₂ )\n        ( ∫ ω₂ ω₁  ∫ ω₂ ω₂ )\n\nThe Jacobian variety J(C) is then given by the complex torus C^2 / ΩZ^4, where Z is the set of integers."
