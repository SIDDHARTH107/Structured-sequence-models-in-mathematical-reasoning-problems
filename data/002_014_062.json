    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, width of 5 cm, and height of 3 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one of the length-width faces is 10 cm * 5 cm = 50 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 50 cm² = 100 cm².\n2. The area of one of the length-height faces is 10 cm * 3 cm = 30 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 30 cm² = 60 cm².\n3. The area of one of the width-height faces is 5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 15 cm² = 30 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 100 cm² + 60 cm² + 30 cm² = 190 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 190 cm²."
