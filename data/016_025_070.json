    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that can be constructed by starting with a square and recursively removing squares from the previous stage. The number of black squares at each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of black squares at stage n = 3^(n-1)\n\nTo find the total number of black squares up to the seventh stage, we need to sum the number of black squares at each stage from 1 to 7:\n\nTotal black squares = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 + 3^6\nTotal black squares = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729\nTotal black squares = 1093\n\nSo, there are 1093 black squares in the Sierpinski sieve when it is constructed up to the seventh stage."
