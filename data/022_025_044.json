    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a free particle in two dimensions, we assume separation of variables, meaning that the wave function $\\Psi(x,y)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $y$. So, let's write:\n\n$$\\Psi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Schrödinger equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2})(X(x)Y(y)) = E X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nApplying the Laplacian operator to the product of functions, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y)) = E X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}) = E$$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on $x$ and $y$, we can separate the equation into two independent equations:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}) = k_x^2$$\n$$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}) = k_y^2$$\n\nwhere $k_x^2$ and $k_y^2$ are constants. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) = k_x^2 X(x)$$\n$$Y''(y) = k_y^2 Y(y)$$\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\n$$X(x) = A e^{ik_x x} + B e^{-ik_x x}$$\n$$Y(y) = C e^{ik_y y} + D e^{-ik_y y}$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation as:\n\n$$\\Psi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y) = (A e^{ik_x x} + B e^{-ik_x x})(C e^{ik_y y} + D e^{-ik_y y})$$\n\nHowever, since we are looking for plane wave solutions, we can simplify this expression by considering only the forward-propagating waves, which means setting $B = D = 0$:\n\n$$\\Psi(x,y) = A C e^{i(k_x x + k_y y)}$$\n\nThis is the general solution of the Schrödinger equation for a free particle in two dimensions in terms of plane waves, where $A$ and $C$ are constants, and $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the wave numbers in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively."
