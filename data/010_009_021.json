    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of regions formed by adding n non-intersecting lines, we can use the formula:\n\nRegions = (n^2 + n + 2) / 2\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (since we are adding 7 non-intersecting lines). Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nRegions = (7^2 + 7 + 2) / 2\nRegions = (49 + 7 + 2) / 2\nRegions = 58 / 2\nRegions = 29\n\nSo, the maximum number of regions that can be formed in a plane by adding 7 non-intersecting lines is 29."
