    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 12 and E = 20. We need to find F to use the formula.\n\n12 - 20 + F = 2\nF = 10\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the genus of a graph:\n\ng = (E - V - F + 2) / 2\n\ng = (20 - 12 - 10 + 2) / 2\ng = (0) / 2\ng = 0\n\nThe genus of the graph is 0, which means it is a planar graph."
