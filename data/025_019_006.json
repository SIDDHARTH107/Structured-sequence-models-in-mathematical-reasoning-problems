If the cohomology class of H is given by [H]=2H_1+3H_2+4H_3 in H^2(X, Z), where H_1, H_2, H_3 are the generators of the Picard group of X, find the degree of H^3, i.e., the coefficient of H^3 in [H]^3.",
    "message_2": "Since X is a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard number ρ(X) = 1, the Picard group of X is generated by a single ample divisor class. Let's denote this generator by G. Then, we can write H_i = a_iG for some integers a_i, where i = 1, 2, 3.\n\nNow, we are given that [H] = 2H_1 + 3H_2 + 4H_3. Substituting H_i = a_iG, we get:\n\n[H] = 2(a_1G) + 3(a_2G) + 4(a_3G) = (2a_1 + 3a_2 + 4a_3)G.\n\nWe want to compute the degree of H^3, which is the coefficient of H^3 in [H]^3. To do this, we first compute [H]^3:\n\n[H]^3 = ((2a_1 + 3a_2 + 4a_3)G)^3 = (2a_1 + 3a_2 + 4a_3)^3G^3.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of H^3 in [H]^3, which is the coefficient of G^3 in (2a_1 + 3a_2 + 4a_3)^3G^3. This is simply the cube of the sum of the coefficients:\n\nDegree of H^3 = (2a_1 + 3a_2 + 4a_3)^3.\n\nSo, the degree of H^3 is the cube of the sum of the coefficients of the generators of the Picard group in the expression for [H]."
