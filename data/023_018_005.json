    "message_2": "To find the steady-state error of the control system when a unit step input is applied, we first need to find the system's position error constant (Kp). The position error constant is a measure of how well the system can track a step input.\n\nFor a transfer function H(s), the position error constant Kp is given by:\n\nKp = lim (s -> 0) s * H(s)\n\nIn our case, H(s) = (s^2 + 4s + 13) / (s^3 + 5s^2 + 6s). So, we need to find the limit as s approaches 0 of s * H(s):\n\nKp = lim (s -> 0) s * (s^2 + 4s + 13) / (s^3 + 5s^2 + 6s)\n\nTo find this limit, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by s:\n\nKp = lim (s -> 0) (s^3 + 4s^2 + 13s) / (s^4 + 5s^3 + 6s^2)\n\nNow, we can apply the limit:\n\nKp = (0^3 + 4*0^2 + 13*0) / (0^4 + 5*0^3 + 6*0^2) = 0 / 0\n\nThis is an indeterminate form, so we can use L'Hôpital's rule to find the limit. We differentiate the numerator and the denominator with respect to s:\n\nd/ds (s^3 + 4s^2 + 13s) = 3s^2 + 8s + 13\nd/ds (s^4 + 5s^3 + 6s^2) = 4s^3 + 15s^2 + 12s\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule:\n\nKp = lim (s -> 0) (3s^2 + 8s + 13) / (4s^3 + 15s^2 + 12s)\n\nApplying the limit:\n\nKp = (3*0^2 + 8*0 + 13) / (4*0^3 + 15*0^2 + 12*0) = 13 / 0\n\nSince the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero, the limit does not exist. This means that the position error constant Kp is infinite.\n\nNow, we can find the steady-state error (Ess) for a unit step input. The steady-state error for a unit step input is given by:\n\nEss = 1 / Kp\n\nSince Kp is infinite, the steady-state error is:\n\nEss = 1 / ∞ = 0\n\nSo, the steady-state error of the control system when a unit step input is applied to it is 0."
