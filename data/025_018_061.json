Suppose that there exists a higher rank vector bundle E on X such that $c_1(E) = L_1 + L_2$ and $c_2(E) = 10$. Find the rank of the vector bundle E.",
    "message_2": "To find the rank of the vector bundle E, we can use the Chern character formula, which relates the Chern classes of a vector bundle to its rank, as well as the Todd class of the surface X. The Chern character is given by:\n\n$ch(E) = rank(E) + c_1(E) + \\frac{1}{2}(c_1^2(E) - 2c_2(E))$.\n\nWe are given that $c_1(E) = L_1 + L_2$ and $c_2(E) = 10$. We can compute $c_1^2(E)$ as follows:\n\n$c_1^2(E) = (L_1 + L_2)^2 = L_1^2 + 2L_1 \\cdot L_2 + L_2^2 = 3 + 2L_1 \\cdot L_2 + 4$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the Chern character formula:\n\n$ch(E) = rank(E) + (L_1 + L_2) + \\frac{1}{2}((3 + 2L_1 \\cdot L_2 + 4) - 20)$.\n\nSince X is a non-singular projective surface, its Todd class is given by:\n\n$Td(X) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}c_1(X) + \\frac{1}{12}(c_1^2(X) + c_2(X))$.\n\nThe index theorem states that the Euler characteristic of a vector bundle E on a surface X is given by the product of the Chern character and the Todd class:\n\n$\\chi(E) = ch(E) \\cdot Td(X)$.\n\nWe can compute the Euler characteristic of E using the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces:\n\n$\\chi(E) = rank(E)(1 - g) + \\frac{1}{2}rank(E)c_1(X) + \\frac{1}{2}(c_1^2(E) - 2c_2(E))$.\n\nSince $c_1(E) = L_1 + L_2$, we have $c_1(X) = c_1(E) - c_1(E) = 0$. Thus, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to:\n\n$\\chi(E) = rank(E)(1 - g) + \\frac{1}{2}(c_1^2(E) - 2c_2(E))$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$\\chi(E) = rank(E)(1 - g) + \\frac{1}{2}((3 + 2L_1 \\cdot L_2 + 4) - 20)$.\n\nSince $\\chi(E)$ is an integer, we can deduce that $rank(E)(1 - g)$ must be an integer as well. This implies that the rank of the vector bundle E is either 1 or a multiple of $(1 - g)$. Since we are given that E is a higher rank vector bundle, we can conclude that the rank of E is a multiple of $(1 - g)$. In particular, we can deduce that the rank of E is at least 2.\n\nTo find the exact rank of E, we can consider the possible values of $L_1 \\cdot L_2$. If $L_1 \\cdot L_2 = 0$, then the Chern character formula becomes:\n\n$ch(E) = rank(E) + (L_1 + L_2) - 6$.\n\nIn this case, the rank of E must be at least 3, since $ch(E)$ must be positive. However, this contradicts the fact that the rank of E is a multiple of $(1 - g)$. Therefore, we can conclude that $L_1 \\cdot L_2 \\neq 0$.\n\nIf $L_1 \\cdot L_2 = 1$, then the Chern character formula becomes:\n\n$ch(E) = rank(E) + (L_1 + L_2) - 5$.\n\nIn this case, the rank of E must be at least 2, since $ch(E)$ must be positive. Since the rank of E is a multiple of $(1 - g)$, we can conclude that the rank of E is exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the vector bundle E is 2."
