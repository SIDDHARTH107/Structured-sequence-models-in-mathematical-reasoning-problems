    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, you can multiply the number of sides by the length of each side. In this case, the polygon has 10 sides, and each side measures 5 cm.\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Length of each side)\nPerimeter = 10 × 5 cm\nPerimeter = 50 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the polygon is 50 cm."
