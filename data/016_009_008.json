    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial segment length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the perimeter after the 10th iteration. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^5)\nPerimeter = 1 * 32\nPerimeter = 32\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 32."
