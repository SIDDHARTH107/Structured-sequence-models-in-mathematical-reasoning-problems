    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 5x - 3, we first need to find the x-intercepts (roots) of the equation. To do this, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² + 5x - 3\n\nTo find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(-3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\nx₁ = (-5 + 7) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\nx₂ = (-5 - 7) / 4 = -12 / 4 = -3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts (roots) of the equation are x = 1/2 and x = -3.\n\nNow, to find the vertex of the parabola, we can use the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nx_vertex = -5 / (2 * 2) = -5 / 4\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x_vertex value back into the original equation:\n\ny_vertex = 2(-5/4)² + 5(-5/4) - 3\n\ny_vertex = 2(25/16) - 25/4 - 3\n\ny_vertex = 50/16 - 25/4 - 3\n\ny_vertex = 25/8\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-5/4, 25/8).\n\nThe parabola opens upwards since the coefficient of the x² term (a) is positive.\n\nTo graph the parabola, plot the vertex (-5/4, 25/8) and the x-intercepts (1/2, 0) and (-3, 0). Then, draw a smooth curve through these points, making sure the parabola opens upwards."
