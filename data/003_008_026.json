    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides with lengths 4 and 7 and the included angle measures 60 degrees. What is the area of the triangle using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)ab * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and C is the included angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = 7, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)(4)(7) * sin(π/3)\n\nSince sin(π/3) = √3/2, we have:\n\nArea = (1/2)(4)(7) * (√3/2)\n\nArea = 14 * (√3/2)\n\nArea = 7√3\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 7√3 square units."
