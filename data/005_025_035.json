    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the average weight of a cereal box is 14 oz. A sample of 50 cereal boxes was taken and the mean weight was found to be 13.5 oz with a standard deviation of 0.8 oz. Can we reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 5%?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We are given the following information:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 14 oz (the average weight of a cereal box is 14 oz)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 14 oz (the average weight of a cereal box is not 14 oz)\n\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 13.5 oz\nSample standard deviation (s) = 0.8 oz\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = (13.5 - 14) / (0.8 / √50)\nt = (-0.5) / (0.8 / 7.071)\nt = -0.5 / 0.113\nt ≈ -4.42\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level with 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.009.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-4.42) is less than the critical t-value (-2.009), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the average weight of a cereal box is not 14 oz at a 5% significance level."
