    "message_1": "Sorry, it is not possible to write a precise numerical problem for the subtopic Paraconsistent logic as it is a non-classical logic that allows for contradictions to exist without resulting in everything being true. It deals with reasoning in situations where incomplete or inconsistent information is present. It is more theoretical and does not involve numerical calculations.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a mathematical problem to solve. Please provide a different topic or a specific numerical problem, and I will be happy to help you with it."
