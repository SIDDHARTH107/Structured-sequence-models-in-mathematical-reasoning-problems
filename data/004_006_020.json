    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 36x + 1, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 - 36x + 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 36\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n6x^2 - 36 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx^2 - 6 = 0\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\nx^2 = 6\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nx = ±√6\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 36x + 1 are x = √6 and x = -√6."
