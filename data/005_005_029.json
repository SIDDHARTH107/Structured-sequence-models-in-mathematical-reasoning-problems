    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs and the probability of a bulb being defective is 0.05. If a customer buys 10 bulbs, what is the probability that at least one bulb is defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one bulb is defective, we can first find the probability that none of the bulbs are defective and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a bulb not being defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the customer buys 10 bulbs, the probability that all 10 bulbs are not defective is (0.95)^10.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one bulb is defective by subtracting the probability that none are defective from 1:\n\nProbability(at least one defective) = 1 - Probability(none defective) = 1 - (0.95)^10 â‰ˆ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that at least one bulb is defective is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
