    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the linear system |D|, we first need to compute the degree of the divisor D and then use the Riemann-Roch theorem.\n\nDegree of D:\ndeg(D) = deg(P1) + 2*deg(P2) + deg(P3) + deg(P4) - 2*deg(P5) - deg(P6)\n\nSince all the points P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 are points on the curve, their degrees are all 1. So,\n\ndeg(D) = 1 + 2*1 + 1 + 1 - 2*1 - 1 = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the curve X of genus g=3:\n\nl(D) - l(K-D) = deg(D) - g + 1\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the linear system |D|, K is the canonical divisor, and l(K-D) is the dimension of the linear system |K-D|. We are given that X is non-singular, so K has degree 2g-2 = 4.\n\nWe want to find l(D), so we need to find l(K-D). Since deg(D) = 1, deg(K-D) = 4 - 1 = 3. Since deg(K-D) < 2g-2, by Riemann-Roch theorem, we have l(K-D) = 0.\n\nNow we can find l(D):\n\nl(D) - 0 = 1 - 3 + 1\nl(D) = 1 - 2\nl(D) = -1\n\nHowever, the dimension of the linear system cannot be negative. This means that the given divisor D is not effective, and the linear system |D| is empty.\n\nNow, let's find the number of points of intersection of D with a non-singular complete intersection of two plane curves of degrees (3, 4).\n\nBy BÃ©zout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two plane curves of degrees m and n is given by the product m*n, counting multiplicities. In our case, m=3 and n=4, so the number of intersection points is:\n\nIntersection points = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nHowever, since the linear system |D| is empty, there are no effective divisors in the form of D that intersect the complete intersection of the two plane curves. Therefore, the number of points of intersection of D with a non-singular complete intersection of two plane curves of degrees (3, 4) is 0."
