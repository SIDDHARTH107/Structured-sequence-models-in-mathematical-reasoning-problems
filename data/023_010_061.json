    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the 2D image defined by the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 over the region -1 <= x <= 1 and -1 <= y <= 1, we will use the 2D Fourier transform formula:\n\nF(u, v) = ∬[f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx dy]\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier transform of the function f(x, y), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn our case, f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2. So, we have:\n\nF(u, v) = ∬[(x^2 + y^2) * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx dy]\n\nNow, we need to compute the double integral over the region -1 <= x <= 1 and -1 <= y <= 1:\n\nF(u, v) = ∫(∫(x^2 + y^2) * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx) dy, where the inner integral is with respect to x from -1 to 1, and the outer integral is with respect to y from -1 to 1.\n\nLet's first compute the inner integral with respect to x:\n\n∫(x^2 + y^2) * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx = ∫(x^2 * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx + ∫(y^2 * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx\n\nNow, we can compute these integrals separately:\n\n∫(x^2 * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx = (-j/(4π^2u^3)) * (e^(-j2πux) * (2πux - j + j * cos(2πux) + sin(2πux)))\n\n∫(y^2 * e^(-j2π(ux + vy)) dx = (y^2 / (2πu)) * (e^(-j2πux) - e^(j2πux))\n\nNow, let's compute the outer integral with respect to y:\n\nF(u, v) = ∫((-j/(4π^2u^3)) * (e^(-j2πux) * (2πux - j + j * cos(2πux) + sin(2πux))) + (y^2 / (2πu)) * (e^(-j2πux) - e^(j2πux)) dy\n\nThis integral is quite complex, and it's best to use a symbolic computation software like Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha to compute it. However, the result will be a complex function F(u, v) that represents the Fourier transform of the given 2D image."
