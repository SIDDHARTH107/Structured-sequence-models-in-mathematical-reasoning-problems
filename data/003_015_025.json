    "message_2": "The given trigonometric function is y = 4sin(3x).\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 4. So, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. The period of the basic sine function, y = sin(x), is 2π. To find the period of y = 4sin(3x), we need to consider the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function, which is 3 in this case. The period of a sine function with a coefficient of x is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |coefficient of x|\n\nIn this case, the coefficient of x is 3. So, the period of y = 4sin(3x) is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function y = 4sin(3x) is 4, and its period is (2π) / 3 radians."
