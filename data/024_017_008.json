    "message_1": "A student is given a curve in 3D space defined by the equation x(t) = (t, t^2, 2t + 1), where t is a parameter. They are asked to determine the parallel transport of a vector v = (1, 2, -1) as it moves along the curve from the point (0, 0, 1) to the point (2, 4, 5). What is the resulting transported vector at the end of the curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at each point. We can do this by taking the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter t:\n\ndx/dt = (1, 2t, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the change in the tangent vector as we move along the curve. This can be done by taking the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to t:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 = (0, 2, 0)\n\nNext, we need to find the parallel transport equation, which is given by:\n\ndv/dt + (v • d^2x/dt^2) * dx/dt = 0\n\nWe can plug in the given vector v and the derivatives we found:\n\nd(1, 2, -1)/dt + ((1, 2, -1) • (0, 2, 0)) * (1, 2t, 2) = 0\n\nThe dot product of v and d^2x/dt^2 is:\n\n(1, 2, -1) • (0, 2, 0) = 0*1 + 2*2 + (-1)*0 = 4\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the parallel transport equation:\n\nd(1, 2, -1)/dt + 4 * (1, 2t, 2) = 0\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t, we get:\n\nv(t) = (1, 2, -1) - 4 * ∫(1, 2t, 2) dt\n\nv(t) = (1, 2, -1) - 4 * (t, t^2, 2t)\n\nNow, we can find the transported vector at the end of the curve, which is when t = 2:\n\nv(2) = (1, 2, -1) - 4 * (2, 2^2, 2*2)\n\nv(2) = (1, 2, -1) - 4 * (2, 4, 4)\n\nv(2) = (1, 2, -1) - (8, 16, 16)\n\nv(2) = (-7, -14, -17)\n\nSo, the resulting transported vector at the end of the curve is (-7, -14, -17)."
