Start by considering an initial population of 25 fireflies with random positions between -5 and 5. Assume that the maximum number of iterations is 100, and that the parameter alpha (a control parameter that determines the attractiveness between fireflies) is equal to 0.5. What is the best solution found by the algorithm?",
