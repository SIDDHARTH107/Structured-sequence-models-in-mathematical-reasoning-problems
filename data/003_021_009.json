    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere u and v are the given vectors, θ is the angle between them, and |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nu · v = (-2)(4) + (5)(-3) = -8 - 15 = -23\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|u| = √((-2)^2 + (5)^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n|v| = √((4)^2 + (-3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n-23 = (√29)(5) cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by (√29)(5):\n\ncos(θ) = -23 / (5√29)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result to get the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(-23 / (5√29))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 129.72°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 130°."
