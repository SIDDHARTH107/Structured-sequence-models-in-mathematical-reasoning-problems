    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the building (150 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance between the observer and the building (120 meters).\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation. Then, we have:\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = 150 / 120\ntan(θ) = 1.25\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ whose tangent is 1.25. We can use the arctangent (inverse tangent) function for this:\n\nθ = arctan(1.25)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 51.3 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of elevation from the observer's eye to the top of the building is approximately 51.3 degrees, rounded to the nearest tenth."
