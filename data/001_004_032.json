    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x^2 + 7x + 12, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give the original polynomial. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. Those numbers are 3 and 4.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 4)"
