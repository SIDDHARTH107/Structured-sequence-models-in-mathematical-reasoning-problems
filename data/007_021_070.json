    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of 123456789 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function, f(x), such as f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the number we want to factor.\n2. Choose two initial values, x and y, both set to 2.\n3. Iterate the function for both x and y, updating their values as follows:\n   x = f(x)\n   y = f(f(y))\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and N.\n5. If the GCD is 1, go back to step 3.\n6. If the GCD is N, the algorithm failed, and we need to choose a different function or initial values.\n7. If the GCD is a factor of N, we found a non-trivial factor. We can then apply the algorithm recursively to the factors until we have the prime factorization.\n\nNow, let's apply Pollard's rho algorithm to find the prime factorization of 123456789:\n\nN = 123456789\nf(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N\nx = y = 2\n\nIterate until we find a non-trivial factor:\n\n1. x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 123456789 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 123456789 = 26\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 123456789) = GCD(21, 123456789) = 1\n\n2. x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 123456789 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 123456789 = 58321\n   GCD(|26 - 58321|, 123456789) = GCD(58295, 123456789) = 3\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor: 3. Now we can apply the algorithm recursively to the remaining factor, 123456789 / 3 = 41152263:\n\nN = 41152263\nf(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N\nx = y = 2\n\nIterate until we find a non-trivial factor:\n\n1. x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 41152263 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 41152263 = 26\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 41152263) = GCD(21, 41152263) = 1\n\n2. x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 41152263 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) mod 41152263 = 360057\n   GCD(|26 - 360057|, 41152263) = GCD(360031, 41152263) = 3607\n\nWe found another non-trivial factor: 3607. Now we can apply the algorithm recursively to the remaining factor, 41152263 / 3607 = 11407:\n\nSince 11407 is a prime number, we don't need to apply the algorithm further.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 123456789 is 3 × 3607 × 11407."
