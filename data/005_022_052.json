    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the scores in ascending order:\n67, 68, 69, 72, 76, 78, 82, 85, 90, 95\n\nNow, let's find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3) using Tukey's hinges method.\n\nMedian (Q2) is the middle value of the dataset. Since there are 10 scores (an even number), we will take the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th scores):\nQ2 = (76 + 78) / 2 = 77\n\nLower Quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the dataset (excluding the median if the dataset has an odd number of values). In this case, we have 5 values in the lower half:\nQ1 = Median of {67, 68, 69, 72, 76} = 69\n\nUpper Quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the dataset (excluding the median if the dataset has an odd number of values). In this case, we have 5 values in the upper half:\nQ3 = Median of {78, 82, 85, 90, 95} = 85\n\nNow, let's find the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 85 - 69 = 16\n\nSo, the median is 77, the lower quartile is 69, the upper quartile is 85, and the interquartile range is 16."
