    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function y = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative (y'):\n\ny' = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\ny' = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative (y''):\n\ny'' = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\ny'' = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where y'' changes its sign. This occurs when y'' = 0:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug x = 2 back into the original function:\n\ny = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 2\ny = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2\ny = 4\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function y = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 is (2, 4)."
