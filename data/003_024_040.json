    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A 路 B / ||B||^2) * B\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B (A 路 B):\n\nA 路 B = (3 * 5) + (4 * 6) = 15 + 24 = 39\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude squared of vector B (||B||^2):\n\n||B||^2 = (5^2) + (6^2) = 25 + 36 = 61\n\nNow, we can find the scalar projection:\n\nScalar projection = (A 路 B / ||B||^2) = 39 / 61\n\nFinally, let's find the vector projection by multiplying the scalar projection by vector B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (39/61) * (5, 6) = (195/61, 234/61)\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is (195/61, 234/61)."
