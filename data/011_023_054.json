    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph G, we can use the concept of chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nSince G has 7 vertices and 9 edges, we can first check if it's a complete graph (where every vertex is connected to every other vertex). A complete graph with n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges. In this case, with 7 vertices, a complete graph would have 7(7-1)/2 = 21 edges. Since G has only 9 edges, it's not a complete graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph G (the maximum number of edges connected to a single vertex). The maximum degree, denoted as Δ(G), is an important factor in determining the chromatic number. According to the theorem, the chromatic number χ(G) is bounded by the inequality:\n\nΔ(G) < χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nSince G is not a complete graph, we know that χ(G) is not equal to the number of vertices (7). We also know that the minimum number of colors needed is at least Δ(G) + 1.\n\nTo find the minimum number of colors needed, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph G.\n2. Check if G is a bipartite graph (a graph that can be divided into two sets of vertices, where each edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex from the other set). If G is bipartite, then the chromatic number is 2.\n3. If G is not bipartite, then the chromatic number is at least Δ(G) + 1.\n\nSince we don't have the exact structure of the graph G, we can't determine the exact value of Δ(G) or check if it's bipartite. However, we can provide a range for the chromatic number based on the given information.\n\nThe maximum degree Δ(G) in this graph is at most 6 (since there are 7 vertices, and each vertex can be connected to at most 6 other vertices). Therefore, the chromatic number χ(G) is at least 3 and at most 7 (Δ(G) + 1).\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph G, we can only conclude that the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph G is between 3 and 7, inclusive."
