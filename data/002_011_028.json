    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 8 cm and a hypotenuse of 10 cm. What is the length of the perpendicular side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, a is the length of the base, and b is the length of the perpendicular side. We are given the values of c and a, so we can plug them into the equation:\n\n10² = 8² + b²\n100 = 64 + b²\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\n100 - 64 = b²\n36 = b²\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √36\nb = 6\n\nSo, the length of the perpendicular side is 6 cm."
