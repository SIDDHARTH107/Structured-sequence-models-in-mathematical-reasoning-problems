    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the velocity field using Fourier analysis, we need to express the given function in terms of its Fourier series. The Fourier series of a function is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} [a_n \\cos(2\\pi nx) + b_n \\sin(2\\pi nx)]$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$a_0 = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} f(x) dx$$\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} f(x) \\cos(2\\pi nx) dx$$\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} f(x) \\sin(2\\pi nx) dx$$\n\nand $L$ is the period of the function.\n\nIn our case, the velocity field is given by:\n\n$$u(x,t) = 5\\cos(2\\pi x - 5\\pi t)$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = 5\\cos(2\\pi x)\\cos(5\\pi t) + 5\\sin(2\\pi x)\\sin(5\\pi t)$$\n\nNow, we can see that the function is already in the form of a Fourier series with $a_1 = 5$ and $b_1 = 5$. All other coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ for $n > 1$ are zero.\n\nSo, the frequency components of the velocity field are:\n\n$$a_1 = 5$$\n\n$$b_1 = 5$$\n\nAll other coefficients are zero. The frequency components are thus:\n\n$$u(x,t) = 5\\cos(2\\pi x)\\cos(5\\pi t) + 5\\sin(2\\pi x)\\sin(5\\pi t)$$"
