    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The number of ways to triangulate an n-sided polygon (where n is the number of vertices) is given by the (n-2)th Catalan number, which is defined as:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (2n!)/((n+1)!n!)\n\nFor an 8-sided polygon (an octagon), we want to find the 6th Catalan number (since n-2 = 8-2 = 6):\n\nC_6 = (1/(6+1)) * (2*6 choose 6) = (1/7) * (12!)/((6!)(6!))\n\nC_6 = (1/7) * (479001600)/((720)(720))\n\nC_6 = 132\n\nSo, there are 132 different ways to triangulate a regular 8-sided polygon by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the vertices."
