    "message_2": "To form a committee of 4 students from a group of 7 students, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (7 in this case) and k is the number of students to be selected for the committee (4 in this case).\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!)\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!3!)\n\nC(7, 4) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 4) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to form a committee of 4 students from a group of 7 students."
