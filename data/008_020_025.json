    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for this system is:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 1 -4  2 | -3 |\n| 3  0  2 |  7 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1 -4  2 | -3 |\n| 2  3 -1 |  5 |\n| 3  0  2 |  7 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 below the 1 in the top-left corner by subtracting multiples of Row 1 from Row 2 and Row 3:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n| 1 -4  2 | -3 |\n| 0 11 -5 | 11 |\n| 3  0  2 |  7 |\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n| 1 -4  2 | -3 |\n| 0 11 -5 | 11 |\n| 0 12 -4 | 16 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 11 to get a 1 in the second row, second column:\n\n| 1 -4  2 | -3 |\n| 0  1 -5/11 | 1 |\n| 0 12 -4 | 16 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 12 below the 1 in the second row, second column by subtracting 12 times Row 2 from Row 3:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 12 * Row 2:\n| 1 -4  2  | -3 |\n| 0  1 -5/11 | 1 |\n| 0  0  2/11 |  4 |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 2/11 to get a 1 in the third row, third column:\n\n| 1 -4  2  | -3 |\n| 0  1 -5/11 | 1 |\n| 0  0  1  | 22 |\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 22.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - (5/11)z = 1, so y = 1 + (5/11)z = 1 + (5/11)(22) = 1 + 10 = 11.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x - 4y + 2z = -3, so x = -3 + 4y - 2z = -3 + 4(11) - 2(22) = -3 + 44 - 44 = -3.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -3, y = 11, and z = 22."
