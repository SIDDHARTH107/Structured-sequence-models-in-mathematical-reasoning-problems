    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the Handshaking Theorem, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words:\n\nΣ(deg(v_i)) = 2 * |E|\n\nwhere deg(v_i) is the degree of vertex i, and |E| is the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 vertices and 15 edges, so:\n\nΣ(deg(v_i)) = 2 * 15 = 30\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum degree required for a graph to be connected. In a connected graph, each vertex must have a degree of at least 1, as it must be connected to at least one other vertex. Therefore, the minimum sum of degrees for a connected graph with 10 vertices is 10.\n\nSince the sum of degrees in our graph is 30, which is greater than the minimum sum of degrees required for a connected graph (10), it is possible that the graph is connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the degrees could be distributed in a way that still results in a disconnected graph.\n\nTo further investigate, let's consider the maximum number of vertices that could be disconnected in the graph. If a vertex is disconnected, its degree is 0. If we have k disconnected vertices, the sum of degrees for the remaining connected vertices must be at least 2 * (10 - k), as each connected vertex must have a degree of at least 2 to form a connected component with the other connected vertices.\n\nFor k = 1 (one disconnected vertex), the sum of degrees for the remaining connected vertices must be at least 2 * (10 - 1) = 18. Since the sum of degrees in our graph is 30, this is possible.\n\nFor k = 2 (two disconnected vertices), the sum of degrees for the remaining connected vertices must be at least 2 * (10 - 2) = 16. Since the sum of degrees in our graph is 30, this is not possible, as the sum of degrees for the connected vertices would be greater than the total sum of degrees in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the graph can have at most 1 disconnected vertex. However, this does not necessarily mean that the graph is disconnected, as it could still be connected with the given sum of degrees. Without more information about the distribution of the degrees among the vertices, we cannot definitively determine if the graph is connected or disconnected."
