    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to bring it to its row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n```\n[5 1 3]\n[2 6 4]\n[8 0 7]\n```\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 5 to get a leading 1:\n```\n[1  1/5  3/5]\n[2  6    4  ]\n[8  0    7  ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 8 times the first row from the third row:\n```\n[1  1/5  3/5]\n[0  11/5 8/5]\n[0 -8/5  16/5]\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by 5/11 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n```\n[1  1/5  3/5 ]\n[0  1   8/11 ]\n[0 -8/5 16/5 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Add 8/5 times the second row to the third row:\n```\n[1  1/5  3/5 ]\n[0  1   8/11 ]\n[0  0   72/11]\n```\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form, and we can see that all rows are non-zero. Therefore, the rank of the matrix A is 3."
