    "message_2": "To find an integer x such that a^x ≡ b (mod 23), we need to use the discrete logarithm. Since a is a primitive root of the prime number p = 23, we know that a^x will generate all the non-zero residues modulo 23. \n\nWe can use trial and error to find the primitive root a. Let's try a = 2:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 23)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 23)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 23)\n2^4 ≡ 16 (mod 23)\n2^5 ≡ 9 (mod 23)\n2^6 ≡ 18 (mod 23)\n2^7 ≡ 13 (mod 23)\n2^8 ≡ 3 (mod 23)\n2^9 ≡ 6 (mod 23)\n2^10 ≡ 12 (mod 23)\n...\n\nWe see that 2^10 ≡ 12 (mod 23), which means that a = 2 and x = 10 satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the integer x we are looking for is x = 10."
