    "message_2": "To prove that A is closed, we need to show that its complement, X \\ A, is open in the topological space X.\n\nLet x be an arbitrary point in X \\ A. We want to show that there exists an open neighborhood U of x such that U is contained in X \\ A.\n\nSince A is compact, for every open cover of A, there exists a finite subcover. Consider the open cover of A consisting of the open sets A ∩ V, where V is an open set containing x. Since X \\ A is the union of all open sets V that contain x and do not intersect A, we can rewrite the open cover as:\n\nA ⊆ (X \\ A) ∪ (A ∩ V1) ∪ (A ∩ V2) ∪ ... ∪ (A ∩ Vn),\n\nwhere V1, V2, ..., Vn are open sets containing x and n is finite.\n\nNow, let U = V1 ∩ V2 ∩ ... ∩ Vn. U is an open set containing x, as the intersection of finitely many open sets is open. We claim that U is contained in X \\ A.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a point y in U such that y is also in A. Then y is in A ∩ Vi for all i = 1, 2, ..., n. But this means that y is in the open cover of A, which contradicts the fact that X \\ A and A are disjoint. Therefore, no such point y exists, and U is contained in X \\ A.\n\nSince x was an arbitrary point in X \\ A, we have shown that for every point in X \\ A, there exists an open neighborhood contained in X \\ A. Thus, X \\ A is open, and A is closed."
