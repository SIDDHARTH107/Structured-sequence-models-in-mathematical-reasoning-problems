    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation for heat diffusion in a 2-dimensional object given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = 4 * (∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is the temperature at point (x,y) and time t.\n\nIf a circular object of radius 5 cm is initially at a uniform temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, and the boundary of the circle is kept at a constant temperature of 50 degrees Celsius, what is the temperature distribution throughout the circle after 5 minutes? Also, what is the maximum temperature achieved in the circle during this time? Use the initial condition u(x,y,0) = 100 and boundary condition u(r,θ,t) = 50, where r is the radius and θ is the angle with respect to the positive x-axis. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the material to be 0.01 cm^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We first transform the PDE into polar coordinates:\n\n∂u/∂t = 4 * (1/r * ∂/∂r (r * ∂u/∂r) + 1/r² * ∂²u/∂θ²)\n\nNow, we assume that the solution u(r,θ,t) can be written as a product of three functions, R(r), Θ(θ), and T(t):\n\nu(r,θ,t) = R(r) * Θ(θ) * T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the PDE and dividing by 4 * R * Θ * T, we get:\n\n(1/T) * ∂T/∂t = (1/r * R) * ∂/∂r (r * ∂R/∂r) + (1/r² * Θ) * ∂²Θ/∂θ²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on r and θ, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/T) * ∂T/∂t = -λ²\n(1/r * R) * ∂/∂r (r * ∂R/∂r) + (1/r² * Θ) * ∂²Θ/∂θ² = -λ²\n\nNow, we have three ODEs to solve:\n\n1. (1/T) * ∂T/∂t = -λ²\n2. (1/r * R) * ∂/∂r (r * ∂R/∂r) = -λ²\n3. (1/Θ) * ∂²Θ/∂θ² = λ²\n\nSolving these ODEs, we get:\n\n1. T(t) = e^(-λ² * 4 * t)\n2. R(r) = A * J_0(λ * r) + B * Y_0(λ * r), where J_0 and Y_0 are Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively.\n3. Θ(θ) = C * cos(λ * θ) + D * sin(λ * θ)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. u(r,θ,0) = R(r) * Θ(θ) = 100\n2. u(5,θ,t) = 50\n\nFrom the second boundary condition, we have:\n\n50 = R(5) * Θ(θ) * e^(-λ² * 4 * t)\n\nSince this must hold for all θ and t, we must have R(5) = 50 and Θ(θ) = 1. This implies that λ = 0, and thus R(r) = 50 for all r. Therefore, the temperature distribution throughout the circle after 5 minutes is:\n\nu(r,θ,t) = 50 * e^(-λ² * 4 * t) = 50\n\nThe maximum temperature achieved in the circle during this time is also 50 degrees Celsius."
