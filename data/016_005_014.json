    "message_2": "The Cantor set is created by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. After each iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of 2/3 of the previous length.\n\nLet's calculate the total length after each iteration:\n\n1. Original length: 27 cm\n2. First iteration: 27 * (2/3) = 18 cm\n3. Second iteration: 18 * (2/3) = 12 cm\n4. Third iteration: 12 * (2/3) = 8 cm\n5. Fourth iteration: 8 * (2/3) = 16/3 cm ≈ 5.333 cm\n6. Fifth iteration: (16/3) * (2/3) = 32/9 cm ≈ 3.556 cm\n\nAfter the 5th iteration, the total length of the Cantor set is approximately 3.556 cm."
