    "message_2": "To prove that a group of prime order p = 7 is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of order p is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order p.\n\nLet G be a group of order 7. Since 7 is a prime number, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 7.\n\nWe know that the identity element e of G has order 1. Now, let's consider any other element a ∈ G, where a ≠ e. Since the only possible orders for elements in G are 1 and 7, and a ≠ e, the order of a must be 7.\n\nSince we have found an element a of order 7 in G, we can generate a cyclic subgroup of G by taking powers of a: {a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^6}. This subgroup has 7 elements, which is the same as the order of G. Therefore, this subgroup must be equal to G, and G is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of prime order p = 7 must be cyclic."
