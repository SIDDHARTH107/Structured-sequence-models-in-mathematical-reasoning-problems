    "message_2": "First, we show that $E$ is an Abelian variety over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. An Abelian variety is a projective algebraic variety that is also a group, with the group operation being defined algebraically. In this case, the elliptic curve $E$ is a projective algebraic curve, and the addition law defined above is algebraic. Moreover, the addition law satisfies the group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: For any two points $P, Q \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, their sum $P+Q$ is also in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$.\n2. Associativity: For any three points $P, Q, R \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, we have $(P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R)$.\n3. Identity: There exists an identity element, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$, such that for any point $P \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, we have $P+\\mathcal{O}=P$.\n4. Inverse: For any point $P=(x_1,y_1) \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, there exists an inverse point $-P=(x_1,-y_1)$ such that $P+(-P)=\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nSince $E$ satisfies these group axioms, it is an Abelian variety over $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nNow, we show that if $n=p+1-t$, where $t$ is an integer, then $E$ has $t$ rational points of order $n$. Since the order of $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is $n$, and the order of the point $P$ is also $n$, we have that $nP=\\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element. \n\nLet $Q$ be another point in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ such that the order of $Q$ is $n$. Then, we have $nQ=\\mathcal{O}$. Now, consider the point $R=P+Q$. We have:\n\n$$nR = n(P+Q) = nP + nQ = \\mathcal{O} + \\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}$$\n\nThus, the order of $R$ is also $n$. Since there are $t$ points in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ that are not in the cyclic subgroup generated by $P$, we can find $t$ distinct points of order $n$ by adding $P$ to each of these points. Therefore, $E$ has $t$ rational points of order $n$."
