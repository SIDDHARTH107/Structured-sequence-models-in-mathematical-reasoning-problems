    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n```\n| 3 -2  1 | 5\n| 4  1  1 | 3\n| 5 -3  2 | 2\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nWe can do this by replacing the second row with (-4/3) times the first row plus the second row, and replacing the third row with (-5/3) times the first row plus the third row.\n\n```\n|  3  -2   1 |  5\n|  0   5  -1 | -5\n|  0   1  -1 | -3\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nWe can do this by replacing the third row with (-1/5) times the second row plus the third row.\n\n```\n|  3  -2   1 |  5\n|  0   5  -1 | -5\n|  0   0  -4 |  4\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nThe third row represents the equation -4z = 4. Dividing both sides by -4, we get z = -1.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nThe second row represents the equation 5y - z = -5. Substituting the value of z, we get 5y - (-1) = -5, which simplifies to 5y + 1 = -5. Subtracting 1 from both sides and then dividing by 5, we get y = -1.2.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nThe first row represents the equation 3x - 2y + z = 5. Substituting the values of y and z, we get 3x - 2(-1.2) - 1 = 5, which simplifies to 3x + 2.4 - 1 = 5. Subtracting 1.4 from both sides and then dividing by 3, we get x = 1.2.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.2, y = -1.2, and z = -1."
