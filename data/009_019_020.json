    "message_2": "To solve the stochastic differential equation (SDE) given by\n\ndX_t = (2X_t + 1)dt + 3dW_t\n\nwe can use the integrating factor method. First, we rewrite the SDE as\n\ndX_t - 2X_t dt = 3dW_t - dt\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by the integrating factor e^(-2t):\n\ne^(-2t)dX_t - 2e^(-2t)X_t dt = 3e^(-2t)dW_t - e^(-2t)dt\n\nThe left-hand side is the differential of the product e^(-2t)X_t:\n\nd(e^(-2t)X_t) = 3e^(-2t)dW_t - e^(-2t)dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to t from 0 to t:\n\n∫(0 to t) d(e^(-2s)X_s) = ∫(0 to t) [3e^(-2s)dW_s - e^(-2s)ds]\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have:\n\ne^(-2t)X_t - e^(-2*0)X_0 = ∫(0 to t) 3e^(-2s)dW_s - ∫(0 to t) e^(-2s)ds\n\nSince X_0 = 0, the equation becomes:\n\ne^(-2t)X_t = ∫(0 to t) 3e^(-2s)dW_s - ∫(0 to t) e^(-2s)ds\n\nNow, we solve the integrals on the right-hand side:\n\n∫(0 to t) e^(-2s)ds = [-1/2 * e^(-2s)](0 to t) = -1/2 * (e^(-2t) - 1)\n\nFor the stochastic integral, we have:\n\n∫(0 to t) 3e^(-2s)dW_s\n\nThis integral represents an Ito integral, which we cannot compute explicitly. However, we can denote it as Y_t:\n\nY_t = ∫(0 to t) 3e^(-2s)dW_s\n\nNow, we can write the solution for X_t:\n\ne^(-2t)X_t = Y_t - 1/2 * (e^(-2t) - 1)\n\nX_t = e^(2t) * (Y_t - 1/2 * (e^(-2t) - 1))\n\nThis is the general solution for the SDE. To find the value of X_t at t = 1, we need to compute the value of Y_t at t = 1. However, since Y_t is an Ito integral, we cannot compute its value explicitly. Instead, we can simulate the process and estimate the value of X_t at t = 1 using Monte Carlo methods or other numerical techniques."
