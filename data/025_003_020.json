    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the projective variety X at the point [1 : 1 : 1], we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe given equation is F(x, y, z) = x^2y - z^3 = 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2xy\n∂F/∂y = x^2\n∂F/∂z = -3z^2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point [1 : 1 : 1]:\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 1, 1) = 2(1)(1) = 2\n∂F/∂y(1, 1, 1) = (1)^2 = 1\n∂F/∂z(1, 1, 1) = -3(1)^2 = -3\n\nThe gradient of F at the point [1 : 1 : 1] is given by the vector (2, 1, -3).\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the tangent line. In projective space, the tangent line at a point [x0 : y0 : z0] is given by the equation:\n\nL(x, y, z) = ∂F/∂x(x0, y0, z0) * (x - x0) + ∂F/∂y(x0, y0, z0) * (y - y0) + ∂F/∂z(x0, y0, z0) * (z - z0) = 0\n\nSubstituting the point [1 : 1 : 1] and the gradient (2, 1, -3) into the equation, we get:\n\nL(x, y, z) = 2(x - 1) + 1(y - 1) - 3(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nL(x, y, z) = 2x + y - 3z = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the projective variety X at the point [1 : 1 : 1] is 2x + y - 3z = 0."
