    "message_2": "The Laplace transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) f(t) dt\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 5sin(2t). So, we need to find the Laplace transform of 5sin(2t):\n\nL{5sin(2t)} = F(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) (5sin(2t)) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = e^(-st) and dv = 5sin(2t) dt. Then, du = -se^(-st) dt and v = -5/2 cos(2t).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nF(s) = [-5/2 e^(-st) cos(2t)] [0, ∞] - ∫[0, ∞] (-5/2 cos(2t) (-se^(-st))) dt\n\nEvaluate the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [-5/2 e^(-st) cos(2t)] - [-5/2 e^(0) cos(0)] = 0 - (-5/2) = 5/2\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n-5/2 ∫[0, ∞] se^(-st) cos(2t) dt\n\nAgain, use integration by parts. Let u = e^(-st) and dv = s cos(2t) dt.

We already know the Laplace transform of sin(2t) is 2/(s^2 + 4). So, we can write:\n\n5/4 * s^2 * (2/(s^2 + 4))\n\nNow, simplify:\n\nF(s) = (5s^2) / (s^2 + 4)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of 5sin(2t) is:\n\nL{5sin(2t)} = (5s^2) / (s^2 + 4)"
