    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, Product A and Product B. The profit margins for Product A and B are $5 and $8 respectively. The factory can produce up to 500 units of Product A per day, and up to 300 units of Product B per day. The production of each product requires a certain amount of labor and raw materials, as shown in the table below:\n\n|   Product   | Labor (hours/unit) | Raw Materials (kg/unit) |\n|-------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Product A   |           2            |                   5           |\n| Product B   |           4            |                   6           |\n\nThe factory has 18 hours of labor and 60 kg of raw materials available per day. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product that the factory should produce in order to maximize the daily profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 18\n2. Raw materials constraint: 5x + 6y ≤ 60\n3. Production capacity constraints: 0 ≤ x ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 300\n\nFirst, we will solve the labor constraint for y:\ny ≤ (18 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 4.5 - 0.5x\n\nNext, we will solve the raw materials constraint for y:\ny ≤ (60 - 5x) / 6\ny ≤ 10 - (5/6)x\n\nNow we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y = 4.5 - 0.5x (y-intercept at (0, 4.5) and x-intercept at (9, 0))\n2. Raw materials constraint: y = 10 - (5/6)x (y-intercept at (0, 10) and x-intercept at (12, 0))\n3. Production capacity constraints: x = 0, x = 500, y = 0, y = 300\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4.5), (9, 0), and (6, 4). We will now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 4.5) = 5(0) + 8(4.5) = $36\n3. P(9, 0) = 5(9) + 8(0) = $45\n4. P(6, 4) = 5(6) + 8(4) = $62\n\nThe maximum profit is $62, which occurs when the factory produces 6 units of Product A and 4 units of Product B."
