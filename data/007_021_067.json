    "message_2": "To find a nontrivial factor of 8881200 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a starting point x_1 and a function f(x) that will generate a pseudo-random sequence. A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + c (mod n), where n is the number we want to factor, and c is a constant different from 0 and -2. We'll choose x_1 = 2 and c = 1, so f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod 8881200).\n\n2. Generate the sequence x_2, x_3, ... using the function f(x). We'll also compute the absolute difference between each pair of terms, |x_i - x_j|, and find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of this difference and the number n. If the GCD is not 1 or n, we've found a nontrivial factor.\n\nLet's start generating the sequence and computing the GCD:\n\ni = 2: x_2 = f(x_1) = f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 (mod 8881200)\nGCD(|x_2 - x_1|, 8881200) = GCD(|5 - 2|, 8881200) = GCD(3, 8881200) = 1\n\ni = 3: x_3 = f(x_2) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26 (mod 8881200)\nGCD(|x_3 - x_2|, 8881200) = GCD(|26 - 5|, 8881200) = GCD(21, 8881200) = 3\n\nWe found a nontrivial factor: 3. Indeed, 8881200 = 3 * 2960400."
