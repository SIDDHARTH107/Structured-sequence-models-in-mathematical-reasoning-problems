    "message_1": "Solve the following system of linear equations with ill-conditioned matrices:\n```\n3x + 4y + 7z = 10\n6x + 8y + 14z = 20\n9x + 12y + 21z = 30\n```\nRound your answers to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "This system of linear equations is ill-conditioned because the equations are linearly dependent, meaning they are multiples of each other. To show this, we can divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n```\n3x + 4y + 7z = 10\n3x + 4y + 7z = 10\n3x + 4y + 7z = 10\n```\n\nAs we can see, all three equations are the same, which means there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy the system. We cannot provide a unique solution for x, y, and z in this case."
