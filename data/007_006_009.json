    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 52 and 78 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (78) by the smaller number (52) and find the remainder.\n   78 รท 52 = 1 with a remainder of 26.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (78) with the smaller number (52) and the smaller number with the remainder (26).\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   52 รท 26 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 26. Therefore, the GCD of 52 and 78 is 26."
