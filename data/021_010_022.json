    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nStep 1: Find the derivative of the function f(x).\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nStep 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor the equation:\n\n3(x^2 - 6x + 8) = 0\n3(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 4 and x = 2 are the critical points.\n\nStep 3: Determine which critical point is a minimum.\nTo do this, we can use the second derivative test. Find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 18\n\nNow, evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 18 = -6 (which is negative, so x = 2 is a maximum)\nf''(4) = 6(4) - 18 = 6 (which is positive, so x = 4 is a minimum)\n\nStep 4: Use Newton's method to find the minimum value.\nNewton's method formula: x_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nWe know that x = 4 is the minimum, so we can use it as the initial guess (x_0) for Newton's method:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 4 - (3(4)^2 - 18(4) + 24) / (6(4) - 18)\nx_1 = 4 - (48 - 72 + 24) / (24 - 18)\nx_1 = 4 - (-24) / 6\nx_1 = 4 + 4\nx_1 = 8\n\nSince x_1 is significantly different from our initial guess x_0, we should iterate the process again:\n\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1)\nx_2 = 8 - (3(8)^2 - 18(8) + 24) / (6(8) - 18)\nx_2 = 8 - (192 - 144 + 24) / (48 - 18)\nx_2 = 8 - (72) / 30\nx_2 = 8 - 2.4\nx_2 = 5.6\n\nWe can continue iterating the process until the difference between consecutive x values is very small or negligible. In this case, we can stop here as the difference between x_1 and x_2 is small enough.\n\nStep 5: Find the minimum value of the function f(x) at the approximate critical point x = 5.6.\nf(5.6) = (5.6)^3 - 9(5.6)^2 + 24(5.6) + 7 ≈ -25.344\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 7 is approximately -25.344 when x ≈ 5.6."
