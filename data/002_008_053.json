    "message_1": "A cone has a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * π * r^2 * h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven the diameter of the cone is 8 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 4 cm. The height (h) is given as 12 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * π * (4^2) * 12\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 16 * 12\n\nVolume ≈ 201.06176 cm³\n\nThe volume of the cone is approximately 201.06 cm³."
