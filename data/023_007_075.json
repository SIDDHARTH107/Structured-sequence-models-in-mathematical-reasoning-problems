    "message_1": "A signal f(t) is given by f(t) = 2sin(100πt) + 5cos(300πt). Use Fourier transform to find the frequency content of the signal in Hz.",
    "message_2": "The given signal f(t) is already in the time domain and consists of two sinusoidal components with different frequencies. To find the frequency content of the signal, we can simply identify the frequencies of the individual components.\n\nThe first component is 2sin(100πt). The angular frequency (ω) is given by 100π rad/s. To convert this to frequency (f) in Hz, we use the formula:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nFor the first component:\n\nf1 = (100π) / (2π) = 50 Hz\n\nThe second component is 5cos(300πt). The angular frequency (ω) is given by 300π rad/s. To convert this to frequency (f) in Hz, we use the same formula:\n\nFor the second component:\n\nf2 = (300π) / (2π) = 150 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal f(t) consists of two frequencies: 50 Hz and 150 Hz."
