    "message_1": "A company wants to produce rectangular cardboard boxes with a total surface area of 900 square inches. The length of the box is twice its height. Determine the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of cardboard used.",
    "message_2": "Let the height of the box be h, the length be L, and the width be w. We are given that the length L is twice the height, so L = 2h. The surface area of the box is given by the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2(hw + Lw + Lh)\n\nWe are given that the total surface area is 900 square inches. So,\n\n900 = 2(hw + Lw + Lh)\n\nSince L = 2h, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n900 = 2(hw + (2h)w + (2h)h)\n\nNow, we can solve for w in terms of h:\n\n450 = hw + 2hw + 2h^2\n450 = 3hw + 2h^2\n\nw = (450 - 2h^2) / 3h\n\nNow, we need to minimize the surface area with respect to the height h. To do this, we will find the derivative of w with respect to h and set it to zero:\n\ndw/dh = d(450 - 2h^2) / 3h / dh\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we get:\n\ndw/dh = (3h(-4h) - (450 - 2h^2)(3)) / (3h)^2\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ndw/dh = (-12h^2 - 1350 + 6h^2) / 9h^2\n\nCombining like terms:\n\ndw/dh = (-6h^2 - 1350) / 9h^2\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n0 = (-6h^2 - 1350) / 9h^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9h^2:\n\n0 = -6h^2 - 1350\n\nAdding 6h^2 and 1350 to both sides:\n\n6h^2 = 1350\n\nDividing by 6:\n\nh^2 = 225\n\nTaking the square root:\n\nh = 15\n\nNow, we can find the width w using the equation we derived earlier:\n\nw = (450 - 2(15)^2) / 3(15)\nw = (450 - 450) / 45\nw = 0 / 45\nw = 0\n\nHowever, a width of 0 is not possible for a box. This means that the dimensions that minimize the amount of cardboard used are not possible. The problem may have a mistake or may be unsolvable with the given constraints."
