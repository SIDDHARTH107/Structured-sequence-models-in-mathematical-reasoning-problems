    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n```\n| 2  4  -6 |  8  |\n| 3 -3   2 | -1  |\n| 1 -1   1 |  4  |\n```\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  2  -3 |  4  |\n| 3 -3   2 | -1  |\n| 1 -1   1 |  4  |\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with (-3 * row1) + row2 and the third row with (-1 * row1) + row3:\n\n```\n|  1  2  -3 |  4  |\n|  0 -9  11 | -13 |\n|  0 -3   4 |  0  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -9 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n```\n|  1  2  -3 |  4  |\n|  0  1 -11/9| 13/9|\n|  0 -3   4 |  0  |\n```\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with (-2 * row2) + row1 and the third row with (3 * row2) + row3:\n\n```\n|  1  0  5/3 | -2/3 |\n|  0  1 -11/9| 13/9 |\n|  0  0  1/3 | 13/3 |\n```\n\nStep 5: Multiply the third row by 3 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n```\n|  1  0  5/3 | -2/3 |\n|  0  1 -11/9| 13/9 |\n|  0  0   1  |  13  |\n```\n\nStep 6: Replace the first row with (-5/3 * row3) + row1 and the second row with (11/9 * row3) + row2:\n\n```\n|  1  0   0  |  2  |\n|  0  1   0  |  1  |\n|  0  0   1  |  13 |\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the row-echelon form:\n\nx = 2\ny = 1\nz = 13"
