    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x² + 3x - 10 = 0 by factoring, we need to find two binomials that multiply to give the equation.\n\n(x + a)(x + b) = x² + 3x - 10\n\nWe need to find the values of a and b such that:\n\n1. a * b = -10\n2. a + b = 3\n\nThe two numbers that satisfy these conditions are 5 and -2.\n\na = 5\nb = -2\n\nSo, the factored equation is:\n\n(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx + 5 = 0\nx = -5\n\nx - 2 = 0\nx = 2\n\nThe values of x that satisfy the equation are x = -5 and x = 2."
