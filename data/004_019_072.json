    "message_1": "A car is driving along a straight road at a constant speed of 60 mph. After 5 seconds, the driver hits the gas and starts to accelerate at a rate of 4 mph/s. What is the car's velocity and acceleration after 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how much the car has accelerated during the 5 seconds after the driver hits the gas.\n\nAcceleration = 4 mph/s\nTime = 5 seconds\n\nIncrease in velocity = Acceleration × Time\nIncrease in velocity = 4 mph/s × 5 s = 20 mph\n\nNow, let's add this increase in velocity to the initial velocity of the car.\n\nInitial velocity = 60 mph\nIncreased velocity = 20 mph\n\nFinal velocity = Initial velocity + Increased velocity\nFinal velocity = 60 mph + 20 mph = 80 mph\n\nThe car's velocity after 10 seconds is 80 mph.\n\nThe car's acceleration remains constant at 4 mph/s during the entire 10 seconds."
