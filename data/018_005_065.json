    "message_1": "Let A be a set containing 10 elements. Find the number of elements in the intersection of A and its complement.",
    "message_2": "The complement of a set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are not in A. Since A has 10 elements, the intersection of A and its complement A' would be the set of elements that are both in A and not in A. This is a contradiction, as an element cannot be both in a set and not in the same set at the same time. Therefore, the intersection of A and its complement A' is an empty set, which has 0 elements."
