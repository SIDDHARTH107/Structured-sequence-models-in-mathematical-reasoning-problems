The union of sets A and B is denoted as A ∪ B.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6}\nB = {1, 3, 5}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of A are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n1 ∈ B and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of B are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is a superset of both A and B."
