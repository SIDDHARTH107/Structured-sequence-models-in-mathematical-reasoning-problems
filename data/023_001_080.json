    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2/2] | (-π, π) = (1/π) * [(π^2/2) - (-π^2/2)] = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n * x) dx\n\nThis integral is an odd function, so its value is 0:\n\na_n = 0\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\n∫ x * sin(n * x) dx = -x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n) * ∫ cos(n * x) dx\n= -x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-x * (1/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] | (-π, π)\nb_n = (1/π) * [2 * π * (1/n)]\n\nb_n = 2/n\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ (2/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of the series at x = π/2:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ (2/n) * sin(n * π/2)\n\nThe series converges by the Dirichlet's test, since the coefficients (2/n) decrease monotonically to zero, and the partial sums of sin(n * π/2) are bounded.\n\nHowever, the value of the series at x = π/2 does not equal f(π/2) due to the discontinuity of the function f(x) = x at the endpoints of the interval [-π, π]. The Fourier series converges to the average value of the function at the discontinuity, which is:\n\nf(π/2) = (f(π/2+) + f(π/2-))/2 = (π/2 + (-π/2))/2 = 0"
