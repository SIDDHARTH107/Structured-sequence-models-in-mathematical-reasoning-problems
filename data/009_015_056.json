    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nA sample of carbon-14 has an initial weight of 800 grams. If the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,700 years, how much of the original sample will remain after 17,100 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 800 grams, the time elapsed is 17,100 years, and the half-life is 5,700 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 800 * (1/2)^(17,100 / 5,700)\n\nFinal amount = 800 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 800 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 100 grams\n\nSo, after 17,100 years, 100 grams of the original 800-gram sample of carbon-14 will remain."
