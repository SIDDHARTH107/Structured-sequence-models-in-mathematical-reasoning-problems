    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of electronic products, A and B. The production of product A generates a profit of $8/unit while the production of product B generates a profit of $10/unit. The company has 200 hours of work per week and can produce a maximum of 150 units of product A and 100 units of product B per week. Using the Grey Wolf optimizer algorithm, what is the maximum profit that the company can generate per week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming instead of the Grey Wolf optimizer algorithm, as it is a simpler and more appropriate method for this type of problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 8x + 10y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production time constraint: The company has 200 hours of work per week. Let's assume it takes a hours to produce one unit of product A and b hours to produce one unit of product B. Then, the constraint can be written as:\nax + by ≤ 200\n\n2. Maximum production constraint: The company can produce a maximum of 150 units of product A and 100 units of product B per week.\nx ≤ 150\ny ≤ 100\n\n3. Non-negativity constraint:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies all constraints and then find the maximum value of the objective function within that region. However, we need the values of a and b (hours required to produce each product) to proceed with the solution. Please provide the values of a and b to continue."
