    "message_2": "With a key size of 128 bits, there are 2^128 possible encryption keys that can be generated. This is because each bit can have two possible values (0 or 1), and there are 128 bits in the key. So, the total number of possible keys is:\n\n2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456"
