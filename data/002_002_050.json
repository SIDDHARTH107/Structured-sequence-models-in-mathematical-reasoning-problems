    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the sphere is 12 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 6 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) × 3.14159 × (6^3)\nV = (4/3) × 3.14159 × 216\nV = 1.33333 × 3.14159 × 216\nV ≈ 904.7787\n\nCorrect to one decimal place, the volume of the sphere is approximately 904.8 cubic centimeters."
