    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are both equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n\n$f_x(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 - 3xy^2) = 3x^2 - 3y^2$\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivative with respect to $y$:\n\n$f_y(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 - 3xy^2) = -6xy$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$\n$-6xy = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) $x = 0$\n\nIf $x = 0$, then the first equation becomes:\n\n$3(0)^2 - 3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow -3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo, one critical point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n2) $y = 0$\n\nIf $y = 0$, then the first equation becomes:\n\n$3x^2 - 3(0)^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\nBut we already found this critical point, so there are no new critical points in this case.\n\nThus, the only critical point of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$ is $(0, 0)$."
