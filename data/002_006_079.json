    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, you can use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven a diameter of 12 inches, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = πd\nC = 3.14159 × 12\nC ≈ 37.699\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 37.699 inches."
