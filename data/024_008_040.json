    "message_2": "To determine the Ricci curvature of a 2-dimensional sphere, we first need to understand that the Ricci curvature is a scalar value that describes the curvature of a manifold. In the case of a 2-dimensional sphere, the manifold is the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe Ricci curvature for a 2-dimensional sphere is given by the formula:\n\nRicci curvature = 2 * (Gaussian curvature)\n\nThe Gaussian curvature for a 2-dimensional sphere of radius R is given by the formula:\n\nGaussian curvature = 1 / R^2\n\nIn this case, the radius of the sphere is 4 units. Therefore, the Gaussian curvature is:\n\nGaussian curvature = 1 / (4^2) = 1 / 16\n\nNow, we can calculate the Ricci curvature:\n\nRicci curvature = 2 * (1 / 16) = 1 / 8\n\nSo, the Ricci curvature of the 2-dimensional sphere with radius 4 units at any point on its surface, including the point (2, 2), is 1/8."
