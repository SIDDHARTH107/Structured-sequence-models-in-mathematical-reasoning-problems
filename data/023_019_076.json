    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of h(t), we can use the following formula:\n\nH(jw) = ∫[h(t) * e^(-jwt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nHowever, since h(t) = e^(-t)u(t), the impulse response is zero for t < 0. Therefore, we can modify the integral limits:\n\nH(jw) = ∫[e^(-t) * e^(-jwt)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to +∞.\n\nNow, let's combine the exponentials:\n\nH(jw) = ∫[e^(-t(1 + jw))] dt, from 0 to +∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution. Let x = (1 + jw)t, then dx = (1 + jw)dt. Also, when t = 0, x = 0, and when t = +∞, x = +∞. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\nH(jw) = ∫[e^(-x) * (1/(1 + jw))] dx, from 0 to +∞.\n\nNow, we can take the constant term (1/(1 + jw)) out of the integral:\n\nH(jw) = (1/(1 + jw)) * ∫[e^(-x)] dx, from 0 to +∞.\n\nThe integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x), so we have:\n\nH(jw) = (1/(1 + jw)) * [-e^(-x)] from 0 to +∞.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limits:\n\nH(jw) = (1/(1 + jw)) * [-e^(-∞) + e^(0)].\n\nSince e^(-∞) = 0 and e^(0) = 1, we have:\n\nH(jw) = (1/(1 + jw)) * [1].\n\nFinally, the Fourier transform of h(t) is:\n\nH(jw) = 1/(1 + jw).\n\nNow, to determine the stability of the system, we need to check if the impulse response h(t) is absolutely integrable:\n\n∫|h(t)| dt, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nSince h(t) = e^(-t)u(t), we have:\n\n∫|e^(-t)u(t)| dt, from -∞ to +∞.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the impulse response is zero for t < 0, so we can modify the integral limits:\n\n∫|e^(-t)| dt, from 0 to +∞.\n\nThe integral of |e^(-t)| is -e^(-t), so we have:\n\n-e^(-t) from 0 to +∞.\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\n-[-1 + 0] = 1.\n\nSince the integral converges to a finite value, the system is stable."
