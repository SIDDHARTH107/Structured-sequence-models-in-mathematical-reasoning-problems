    "message_2": "To find the tangent plane to the projective variety V at the point P = [1:0:0], we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equations with respect to x, y, and z. \n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 and G(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^3 - z^3.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\n∂G/∂x = 3x^2\n∂G/∂y = -3y^2\n∂G/∂z = -3z^2\n\nNow, evaluate these partial derivatives at the point P = [1:0:0]:\n\n∂F/∂x(P) = 2\n∂F/∂y(P) = 0\n∂F/∂z(P) = 0\n\n∂G/∂x(P) = 3\n∂G/∂y(P) = 0\n∂G/∂z(P) = 0\n\nThe tangent plane to V at P can be described by the linear equation:\n\na * ∂F/∂x(P) + b * ∂G/∂x(P) = 0\na * ∂F/∂y(P) + b * ∂G/∂y(P) = 0\na * ∂F/∂z(P) + b * ∂G/∂z(P) = 0\n\nSubstitute the values of the partial derivatives at P:\n\n2a + 3b = 0\n0a + 0b = 0\n0a + 0b = 0\n\nThe second and third equations are trivially satisfied. The first equation gives us the relationship between a and b:\n\n2a + 3b = 0 => a = -3/2 * b\n\nNow, we can write the tangent plane equation in terms of a and b:\n\na(x - 1) + b(x^2 - y^2 - z^2) = 0\n\nSubstitute a = -3/2 * b:\n\n-3/2 * b(x - 1) + b(x^2 - y^2 - z^2) = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\nb(-3/2 * (x - 1) + (x^2 - y^2 - z^2)) = 0\n\nSince b cannot be zero (otherwise, the tangent plane would be degenerate), we can divide both sides by b:\n\n-3/2 * (x - 1) + (x^2 - y^2 - z^2) = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent plane to the projective variety V at the point P = [1:0:0]."
