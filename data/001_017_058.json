    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x - 3) - log(x + 1) = 2, we can first use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nlog(x - 3) - log(x + 1) = log((x - 3)/(x + 1))\n\nNow we have:\n\nlog((x - 3)/(x + 1)) = 2\n\nTo remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. In this case, our base is 10 (since it's not specified):\n\n10^2 = (x - 3)/(x + 1)\n\n100 = (x - 3)/(x + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by (x + 1):\n\n100(x + 1) = x - 3\n\n100x + 100 = x - 3\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides:\n\n99x + 100 = -3\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\n99x = -103\n\nFinally, divide by 99:\n\nx = -103/99"
