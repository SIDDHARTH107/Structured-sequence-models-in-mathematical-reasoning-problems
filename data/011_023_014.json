    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph with 5 nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph (every node is connected to every other node). In this case, the minimum number of colors needed is equal to the maximum degree of the nodes plus 1, which is 5 for a complete graph with 5 nodes. However, if the graph is not complete, the number of colors needed may be less than 5.\n\nFor example, if the graph is a cycle with 5 nodes (a pentagon), then the minimum number of colors needed is 3. If the graph is a tree or has even fewer edges, the minimum number of colors needed can be 2.\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph with 5 nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color can be 2, 3, or 5, depending on the structure of the graph."
