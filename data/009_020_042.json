    "message_1": "A chemical reactor operating at steady-state is described by a first-order ordinary differential equation. The input to the reactor is the concentration of the reactant, and the output is the concentration of the product. The gain of the system is known to be 0.8. The controller is designed such that the error between the desired and actual output is a minimum when the integral of the squared error is minimized. If the steady-state error is 0.02 units, what is the optimal controller gain to achieve a steady-state error of 0.005 units?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the steady-state error as E_ss, the system gain as G, and the controller gain as K_c. The steady-state error can be expressed as:\n\nE_ss = 1 / (1 + G * K_c)\n\nWe are given that the steady-state error is 0.02 units when the system gain is 0.8. We can use this information to find the current controller gain:\n\n0.02 = 1 / (1 + 0.8 * K_c)\n\nSolving for K_c, we get:\n\nK_c = (1 - 0.02) / (0.8 * 0.02) = 0.98 / 0.016 = 61.25\n\nNow, we want to find the optimal controller gain to achieve a steady-state error of 0.005 units. We can use the same formula for the steady-state error:\n\n0.005 = 1 / (1 + 0.8 * K_c_optimal)\n\nSolving for K_c_optimal, we get:\n\nK_c_optimal = (1 - 0.005) / (0.8 * 0.005) = 0.995 / 0.004 = 248.75\n\nSo, the optimal controller gain to achieve a steady-state error of 0.005 units is 248.75."
