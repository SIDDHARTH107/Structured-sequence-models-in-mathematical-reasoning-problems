    "message_2": "To find the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we first need to find the slope (m) and then the y-intercept (b).\n\n1. Find the slope (m):\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (4, -1) and (-2, 3):\nm = (3 - (-1)) / (-2 - 4)\nm = (3 + 1) / (-6)\nm = 4 / (-6)\nm = -2/3\n\n2. Find the y-intercept (b):\nWe can use the slope-intercept form equation y = mx + b and one of the given points to find the y-intercept (b). Let's use the point (4, -1).\n\n-1 = (-2/3)(4) + b\n-1 = (-8/3) + b\n\nTo solve for b, we need to add 8/3 to both sides of the equation:\nb = -1 + 8/3\nb = -3/3 + 8/3\nb = 5/3\n\n3. Write the equation in slope-intercept form:\ny = mx + b\ny = (-2/3)x + 5/3\n\nSo, the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line passing through the points (4, -1) and (-2, 3) is y = (-2/3)x + 5/3."
