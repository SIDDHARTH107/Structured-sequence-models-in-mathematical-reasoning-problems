    "message_2": "To find the Poincaré duals of the homology classes represented by C1 and C2, we first need to understand the homology and cohomology of the closed surface X of genus 3.\n\nThe homology groups of a closed surface of genus g are given by:\n\nH_0(X) = Z, H_1(X) = Z^(2g), H_2(X) = Z, and H_i(X) = 0 for i > 2.\n\nFor a genus 3 surface, we have:\n\nH_0(X) = Z, H_1(X) = Z^6, H_2(X) = Z, and H_i(X) = 0 for i > 2.\n\nThe cohomology groups of X are isomorphic to the homology groups:\n\nH^0(X) = Z, H^1(X) = Z^6, H^2(X) = Z, and H^i(X) = 0 for i > 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection number [C1] · [C2] = 4. This means that the homology classes represented by C1 and C2 are nontrivial elements of H_1(X). Let's denote these classes by [C1] = a and [C2] = b, where a, b ∈ H_1(X).\n\nThe Poincaré dual of a homology class α ∈ H_i(X) is a cohomology class PD(α) ∈ H^(2-i)(X) such that for any homology class β ∈ H_i(X), the intersection number α · β is equal to the evaluation of the cup product PD(α) ∪ PD(β) on the fundamental class [X] ∈ H_2(X).\n\nIn our case, we want to find the Poincaré duals of a and b in H^1(X). Let's denote these duals by PD(a) = α and PD(b) = β, where α, β ∈ H^1(X).\n\nSince the intersection number [C1] · [C2] = a · b = 4, we have:\n\nα ∪ β ([X]) = 4.\n\nNow, we need to find α and β in H^1(X) = Z^6. Since X is a closed surface of genus 3, we can choose a basis for H^1(X) consisting of 2g = 6 elements, say {e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6}, where e_i are the standard generators corresponding to the loops around the handles of X.\n\nWe can express α and β as linear combinations of these basis elements:\n\nα = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + a_3 e_3 + a_4 e_4 + a_5 e_5 + a_6 e_6,\nβ = b_1 e_1 + b_2 e_2 + b_3 e_3 + b_4 e_4 + b_5 e_5 + b_6 e_6,\n\nwhere a_i, b_i ∈ Z.\n\nTo find the coefficients a_i and b_i, we can use the fact that the cup product is bilinear and the intersection pairing is nondegenerate. This means that there exists a unique pair of elements α and β in H^1(X) such that their cup product evaluates to 4 on the fundamental class [X].\n\nWithout more information about the specific loops C1 and C2 on the surface X, we cannot determine the exact coefficients a_i and b_i. However, we can conclude that the Poincaré duals of the homology classes represented by C1 and C2 are nontrivial elements α and β in H^1(X) such that their cup product evaluates to 4 on the fundamental class [X]:\n\nα ∪ β ([X]) = 4."
