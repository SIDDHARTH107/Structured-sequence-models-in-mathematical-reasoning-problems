    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we will use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors.\n\n1. Remove edge {1,2} to get graph G1. The edges of G1 are: {1,5}, {2,3}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}.\n2. Contract edge {1,2} to get graph G2. The edges of G2 are: {1,3}, {1,5}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}.\n\nNow we need to find the chromatic polynomial of G1 and G2.\n\nFor G1:\n1. Remove edge {1,5} to get graph G1.1. The edges of G1.1 are: {2,3}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}.\n2. Contract edge {1,5} to get graph G1.2. The edges of G1.2 are: {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}.\n\nFor G2:\n1. Remove edge {1,3} to get graph G2.1. The edges of G2.1 are: {1,5}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}.\n2. Contract edge {1,3} to get graph G2.2. The edges of G2.2 are: {1,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}.\n\nNow we can find the chromatic polynomial for each of these graphs:\n\nP(G1.1, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4) (since G1.1 is a tree with 6 vertices)\nP(G1.2, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4) (since G1.2 is a tree with 6 vertices)\nP(G2.1, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)(k-3) (since G2.1 is a tree with 5 vertices)\nP(G2.2, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^3 (since G2.2 is a tree with 4 vertices)\n\nNow we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm to find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k)\nP(G, k) = (P(G1.1, k) - P(G1.2, k)) - (P(G2.1, k) - P(G2.2, k))\nP(G, k) = (k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4) - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4)) - (k(k-1)^2(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)(k-2)^3)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^3\n\nSo the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^3."
