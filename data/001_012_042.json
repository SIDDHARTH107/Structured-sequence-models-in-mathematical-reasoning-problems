    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factor in the numerator:\n\n(12x^2 - 6x) / (6x) = 6x(2x - 1) / (6x)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor of 6x in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n6x(2x - 1) / (6x) = (2x - 1)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2x - 1"
