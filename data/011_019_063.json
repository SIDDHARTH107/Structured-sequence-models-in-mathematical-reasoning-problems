    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a systematic way of designing experiments to test multiple factors at different levels. In this case, the company wants to test 5 factors, each with 3 levels. To determine the appropriate orthogonal array, we need to find the smallest array that can accommodate these requirements.\n\nThe notation for an orthogonal array is L_n(m^k), where:\n- L_n represents the number of experiments (rows) in the array\n- m is the number of levels for each factor\n- k is the number of factors\n\nIn this case, we are looking for an orthogonal array with m = 3 (3 levels) and k = 5 (5 factors).\n\nThe smallest orthogonal array that meets these requirements is L_27(3^5). This means that the company needs to run 27 experiments to test all possible combinations of factor levels using an orthogonal array."
