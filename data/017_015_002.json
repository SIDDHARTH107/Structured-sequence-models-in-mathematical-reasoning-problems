    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1. This means there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8.\n\nNext, let's find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or n_3 = 4. \n\nNow, we consider the cases:\n\n1. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal, the group is a direct product of these subgroups. In this case, the group is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_3, which is isomorphic to Z_24.\n\n2. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. We can have two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup:\n\na) The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_8. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_3. There are two non-isomorphic semidirect products in this case: Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 and D_12 (dihedral group of order 12) as a subgroup of index 2.\n\nb) The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_2. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of Z_4 × Z_2 and Z_3. There is only one non-isomorphic semidirect product in this case: Z_6 × Z_4.\n\nIn summary, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 24:\n\n1. Z_24\n2. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3\n3. D_12 as a subgroup of index 2\n4. Z_6 × Z_4"
