    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nA toy manufacturer produces two types of cars: compact and luxury. Each compact car brings in a profit of $5,000 while each luxury car brings in a profit of $8,000. The manufacturer has the capacity to produce 200 cars per month, but can only produce a maximum of 100 luxury cars due to production constraints. How many cars of each type should the manufacturer produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of compact cars and y be the number of luxury cars produced.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The total number of cars produced cannot exceed 200: x + y ≤ 200\n2. The number of luxury cars produced cannot exceed 100: y ≤ 100\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x,y) = 5000x + 8000y.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ 200 - x\n2. y ≤ 100\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of x + y = 200 and y = 100:\n   x + 100 = 200\n   x = 100\n   So, the intersection point is (100, 100).\n\n2. Intersection of x + y = 200 and x-axis (y = 0):\n   x + 0 = 200\n   x = 200\n   So, the intersection point is (200, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of y = 100 and y-axis (x = 0):\n   y = 100\n   So, the intersection point is (0, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x,y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(100, 100) = 5000(100) + 8000(100) = 500,000 + 800,000 = 1,300,000\n2. P(200, 0) = 5000(200) + 8000(0) = 1,000,000 + 0 = 1,000,000\n3. P(0, 100) = 5000(0) + 8000(100) = 0 + 800,000 = 800,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the manufacturer produces 100 compact cars and 100 luxury cars, with a total profit of $1,300,000."
