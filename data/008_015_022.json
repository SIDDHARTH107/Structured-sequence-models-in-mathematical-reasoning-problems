    "message_2": "To use the Cholesky decomposition method, we first need to write the given system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |\n    | 1  3  2 |\n    | 1  2  4 |\n\nb = | 7  |\n    | 14 |\n    | 22 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T.\n\nL = | l11  0    0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nL^T = | l11 l21 l31 |\n      | 0   l22 l32 |\n      | 0   0   l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition method, we can find the elements of matrix L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(2)\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 1 / sqrt(2)\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 1 / sqrt(2)\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(3 - 1/2) = sqrt(5/2)\nl32 = (a32 - l31*l21) / l22 = (2 - 1/2) / sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(3/2)\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(4 - 1/2 - 3/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | sqrt(2)    0        0    |\n    | 1/sqrt(2) sqrt(5/2)  0    |\n    | 1/sqrt(2) sqrt(3/2) sqrt(2) |\n\nNow, we need to solve the following two systems of linear equations:\n\n1) Ly = b\n2) L^Tx = y\n\nFirst, we solve for y in the Ly = b system:\n\n| sqrt(2)    0        0    | | y1 |   |  7  |\n| 1/sqrt(2) sqrt(5/2)  0    | | y2 | = | 14  |\n| 1/sqrt(2) sqrt(3/2) sqrt(2) | | y3 |   | 22  |\n\ny1 = 7 / sqrt(2)\ny2 = (14 - 1/sqrt(2) * y1) / sqrt(5/2)\ny3 = (22 - 1/sqrt(2) * y1 - sqrt(3/2) * y2) / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we solve for x in the L^Tx = y system:\n\n| sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) 1/sqrt(2) | | x1 |   | y1 |\n| 0      sqrt(5/2) sqrt(3/2)  | | x2 | = | y2 |\n| 0      0         sqrt(2)    | | x3 |   | y3 |\n\nx1 = y1 / sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2) * y2 - 1/sqrt(2) * y3\nx2 = (y2 - sqrt(3/2) * y3) / sqrt(5/2)\nx3 = y3 / sqrt(2)\n\nAfter solving for x1, x2, and x3, we get the solution of the system of linear equations:\n\nx1 = 1\nx2 = 2\nx3 = 3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
