    "message_2": "We can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to solve this problem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nwhere h^0(X, L) and h^1(X, L) are the dimensions of the spaces H⁰(X, L) and H¹(X, L), respectively, and deg(L) is the degree of the line bundle L.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that h^0(X, L) = 3 and h^1(X, L) = 0. Plugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n3 - 0 = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nNow, we need to find the value of deg(L). Since h^0(X, L) = 3, we know that L has at least 3 global sections. By the definition of the degree of a line bundle, deg(L) must be at least 2 (because a line bundle with degree less than 2 cannot have 3 global sections).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n3 = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nSince deg(L) ≥ 2, we can write:\n\n3 = 2 + 1 - g\n\nSolving for g, we get:\n\ng = 0\n\nTherefore, the genus g of the smooth projective curve X is 0."
