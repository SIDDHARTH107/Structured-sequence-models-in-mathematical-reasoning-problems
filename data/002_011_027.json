    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that measures 5 cm and the hypotenuse measures 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that one leg (a) is 5 cm and the hypotenuse (c) is 13 cm. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n5² + b² = 13²\n\n25 + b² = 169\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb² = 169 - 25\nb² = 144\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of 144:\n\nb = √144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
