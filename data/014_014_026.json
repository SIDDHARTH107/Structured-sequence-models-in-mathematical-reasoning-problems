    "message_1": "In the Playfair cipher encryption, \"HELLO WORLD\" is encrypted using the keyword \"MATHS\" and the following steps:\n\n1. Remove all non-alphabetic characters and convert all text to uppercase: \"HELLOWORLD\" becomes \"HELLOWORLD\"\n2. Insert a dummy character \"X\" if two identical letters are adjacent: \"HELLOWORLD\" becomes \"HELXLOWORLD\"\n3. Divide the resulting string into pairs of two letters (digraphs): \"HELXLOWORLD\" becomes \"HE LX LO WO RL D\"\n4. For each digraph, locate the letters in the Playfair grid and transform them according to the following rules:\n\n- If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).\n- If both letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n- If the letters are not in the same row or column, form a rectangle with the two letters and replace each with the letter in the same row but opposite column of the rectangle.\n\nWhat is the encrypted form of \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Playfair cipher and the keyword \"MATHS\"?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to create the Playfair grid using the keyword \"MATHS\". The grid will be a 5x5 matrix containing the letters of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" since it's combined with \"I\") and the keyword. The keyword letters come first, followed by the remaining letters in alphabetical order.\n\nThe grid looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, let's encrypt the digraphs \"HE LX LO WO RL D\" using the rules:\n\n1. HE: H and E form a rectangle. H's opposite corner is F, and E's opposite corner is U. So, HE -> FU.\n2. LX: L and X are in the same column. L goes down to O, and X goes down to M. So, LX -> OM.\n3. LO: L and O are in the same row. L goes right to N, and O goes right wrapping around to P. So, LO -> NP.\n4. WO: W and O form a rectangle. W's opposite corner is R, and O's opposite corner is K. So, WO -> RK.\n5. RL: R and L form a rectangle. R's opposite corner is W, and L's opposite corner is I. So, RL -> WI.\n6. D: Since there's only one letter left, we add a dummy character \"X\" to make a digraph. DX: D and X form a rectangle. D's opposite corner is Y, and X's opposite corner is C. So, DX -> YC.\n\nThe encrypted form of \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Playfair cipher and the keyword \"MATHS\" is \"FUOMNPRKWIYC\"."
