    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of a cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 faces).\n\nThe area of one face (a square) can be found using the formula: area = side length × side length\n\nIn this case, the side length is 4 cm. So, the area of one face is:\n\nArea = 4 cm × 4 cm = 16 square cm\n\nNow, to find the total surface area of the cube, we multiply the area of one face by 6:\n\nTotal surface area = 6 × 16 square cm = 96 square cm"
