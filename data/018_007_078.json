    "message_2": "The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. To find the power set of A, we list all possible subsets:\n\nP(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}\n\nNow, let's find the cardinality of A and P(A). The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.\n\n|A| = 3 (since A has three elements: 1, 2, and 3)\n\n|P(A)| = 8 (since P(A) has eight elements: ∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3})\n\nSince |P(A)| = 8 and |A| = 3, it is clear that the cardinality of the power set of A is larger than the cardinality of A itself (8 > 3)."
