    "message_1": "Suppose you are using the Vigenere cipher with a key of length 5 to encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\". If the first letter in the key is \"C\" and the first letter in the message is \"M\", what will be the fifth letter of the encrypted message? (Hint: use the Vigenere table to find the corresponding letter)",
    "message_2": "To find the fifth letter of the encrypted message, we need to know the fifth letter of the key. Since the key has a length of 5, it will repeat itself for the entire message. Therefore, the fifth letter of the key will also be \"C\".\n\nNow, we can use the Vigenere table to find the corresponding encrypted letter. The fifth letter in the message is \"M\", and the fifth letter in the key is \"C\". In the Vigenere table, find the row corresponding to \"M\" and the column corresponding to \"C\". The intersection of this row and column is the encrypted letter.\n\nThe encrypted letter at the intersection of row \"M\" and column \"C\" is \"O\".\n\nSo, the fifth letter of the encrypted message is \"O\"."
