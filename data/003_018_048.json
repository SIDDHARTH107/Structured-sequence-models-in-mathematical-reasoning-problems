    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's break down the function into its components:\n\nOuter function: g(x) = 2x\nInner function: h(x) = sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these functions:\n\ng'(x) = 2 (derivative of 2x)\nh'(x) = cos(3x) * 3 (derivative of sin(3x), using the chain rule)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\nf'(x) = 2 * cos(3x) * 3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 6cos(3x)"
