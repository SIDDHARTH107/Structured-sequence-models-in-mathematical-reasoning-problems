    "message_1": "A train leaves station A and travels towards station B at a constant speed of 60 km/h. At the same time, another train leaves station B and travels towards station A at a constant speed of 80 km/h. The distance between the stations is 450 km. How long will it take for the two trains to meet? Use temporal logic to show your answer.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the time it takes for the two trains to meet as t (in hours). We can use the formula distance = speed × time to represent the distance each train travels before they meet.\n\nFor the train leaving station A, the distance it travels is 60t.\nFor the train leaving station B, the distance it travels is 80t.\n\nSince the two trains are traveling towards each other, the sum of the distances they travel before they meet is equal to the distance between the stations (450 km). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n60t + 80t = 450\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n140t = 450\n\nNow, we can solve for t by dividing both sides by 140:\n\nt = 450 / 140\nt ≈ 3.21 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 3.21 hours for the two trains to meet."
