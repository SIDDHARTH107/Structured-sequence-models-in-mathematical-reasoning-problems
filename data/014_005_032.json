    "message_1": "Consider a digital signature system that uses RSA algorithm with a public key exponent of e=17 and a modulus N=3233. If the private key exponent d=2753, what is the digital signature of the message M=1234?",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature (S) of the message M=1234 using the RSA algorithm, we need to raise the message to the power of the private key exponent (d) and then take the modulus with respect to N. In this case, d=2753 and N=3233.\n\nS = M^d mod N\nS = 1234^2753 mod 3233\n\nTo calculate this, you can use the modular exponentiation method or use a calculator that supports large numbers. Using a calculator, we get:\n\nS = 855\n\nSo, the digital signature of the message M=1234 is 855."
