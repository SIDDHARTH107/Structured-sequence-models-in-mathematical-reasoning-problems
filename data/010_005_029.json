    "message_2": "Yes, the set $E$ is a connected set. \n\nTo justify this, we need to show that there is no separation of $E$ into two non-empty, disjoint, open subsets. In other words, we need to show that for any two points in $E$, there exists a continuous path connecting them that lies entirely within $E$.\n\nLet $p=(x_1, y_1)$ and $q=(x_2, y_2)$ be any two points in $E$. Since $x_1^2 + y_1^2 < 1$ and $x_2^2 + y_2^2 < 1$, both points lie strictly inside the unit circle centered at the origin.\n\nNow, consider the straight line segment connecting $p$ and $q$. We can parameterize this line segment by the function:\n\n$$f(t) = (1-t)p + tq = ((1-t)x_1 + tx_2, (1-t)y_1 + ty_2)$$\n\nfor $t \\in [0, 1]$. This function is continuous, as it is a linear combination of continuous functions.\n\nWe need to show that $f(t)$ lies entirely within $E$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. To do this, we can compute the squared distance from the origin to $f(t)$:\n\n$$\\|f(t)\\|^2 = ((1-t)x_1 + tx_2)^2 + ((1-t)y_1 + ty_2)^2$$\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\n$$\\|f(t)\\|^2 = (1-t)^2(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + 2t(1-t)(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2) + t^2(x_2^2 + y_2^2)$$\n\nSince $x_1^2 + y_1^2 < 1$ and $x_2^2 + y_2^2 < 1$, we have:\n\n$$\\|f(t)\\|^2 < (1-t)^2 + 2t(1-t)(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2) + t^2$$\n\nNow, observe that the function $g(t) = (1-t)^2 + 2t(1-t)(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2) + t^2$ is a convex combination of $1$ and $(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2)$, which lies between $-1$ and $1$. Therefore, $g(t) \\leq 1$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nHence, we have $\\|f(t)\\|^2 < g(t) \\leq 1$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$, which implies that $f(t) \\in E$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. This shows that there exists a continuous path connecting any two points in $E$ that lies entirely within $E$, and thus $E$ is a connected set."
