    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function, we first need to find the first derivative and then differentiate it once more.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by differentiating f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 5x^3 + 2x^2 - x)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 15x^2 + 4x - 1\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 15x^2 + 4x - 1)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 30x + 4\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 2x^2 - x is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 30x + 4."
