    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it passes through every point in the unit square. However, it is important to note that the Peano curve is a fractal, and as such, it does not have a well-defined length in the traditional sense. \n\nAs the number of iterations in the construction of the Peano curve increases, the length of the curve approaches infinity. This is because the curve becomes more and more intricate, with each iteration adding more twists and turns to cover the entire area of the unit square. \n\nIn summary, the length of the Peano curve that passes through every point in the unit square is infinite."
