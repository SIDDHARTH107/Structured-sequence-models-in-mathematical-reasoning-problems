    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is formed by iterating the Koch curve process. In each iteration, every straight line segment is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. \n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, the total length is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 4 segments is replaced by 4 segments, making a total of 4 * 4 = 16 segments, each 1/3 the length of the segments from the previous iteration. So, the total length is 16 * (1/3)^2 = 16/9.\n\nIn the third iteration, there are 4^3 = 64 segments, each 1/3 the length of the segments from the previous iteration. So, the total length is 64 * (1/3)^3 = 64/27.\n\nIn the fourth iteration, there are 4^4 = 256 segments, each 1/3 the length of the segments from the previous iteration. So, the total length is 256 * (1/3)^4 = 256/81.\n\nTherefore, the length of the Koch snowflake curve after 4 iterations with an original line segment length of 1 is 256/81."
