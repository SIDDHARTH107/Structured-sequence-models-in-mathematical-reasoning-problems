    "message_2": "To find the values of z such that f(z) = 1, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 2 = 1\n\nFirst, let's move the 1 to the left side of the equation:\n\nz^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 3 = 0\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the cubic equation. We can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the divisors of the constant term (3) divided by the divisors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±3.\n\nLet's test these possible roots:\n\nf(1) = 1^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 3 = 1 - 4 + 5 - 3 = -1 ≠ 1\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 3 = -1 - 4 - 5 - 3 ≠ 1\nf(3) = 3^3 - 4(3)^2 + 5(3) - 3 = 27 - 36 + 15 - 3 = 3 ≠ 1\nf(-3) = (-3)^3 - 4(-3)^2 + 5(-3) - 3 = -27 - 36 - 15 - 3 ≠ 1\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are solutions to the equation. Since the equation is a cubic, it must have at least one real root. We can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to approximate the real root.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method requires the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 8z + 5\n\nWe start with an initial guess for the root, say z_0 = 1. Then we iterate the following formula:\n\nz_n+1 = z_n - f(z_n) / f'(z_n)\n\nLet's perform a few iterations:\n\nz_1 = 1 - (1^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 3) / (3(1)^2 - 8(1) + 5) = 1 - (-1) / 0 = 1 (no change)\n\nSince the iteration didn't change the value of z, we have found the real root: z ≈ 1.\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(z^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 3) / (z - 1) = z^2 - 3z + 3\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\nz^2 - 3z + 3 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 3:\n\nz = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nz = (3 ± √(9 - 12)) / 2\nz = (3 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nThe roots of the quadratic equation are complex:\n\nz = (3 ± i√3) / 2\n\nSo the values of z such that f(z) = 1 are:\n\nz ≈ 1, z = (3 + i√3) / 2, and z = (3 - i√3) / 2."
