    "message_2": "First, let's find the image of the circle |z-1| = 2 under the mapping w = f(z). To do this, we can parameterize the circle using polar coordinates. Let z = 1 + 2e^(it), where t is a real parameter and i is the imaginary unit. Then, we can substitute this expression for z into the function f(z):\n\nf(z) = (1 + 2e^(it))^3 - 3(1 + 2e^(it))^2 + 3(1 + 2e^(it)) - 1\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\nf(z) = (1 + 6e^(it) + 8e^(2it) + 8e^(3it)) - 3(1 + 4e^(it) + 4e^(2it)) + 3(1 + 2e^(it)) - 1\n\nf(z) = 8e^(3it) + 8e^(2it) + 6e^(it)\n\nNow, we can see that the image of the circle under the mapping w = f(z) is a curve in the complex plane parameterized by the function w(t) = 8e^(3it) + 8e^(2it) + 6e^(it). This curve is not a simple geometric shape like a circle or an ellipse, but it is a continuous curve in the complex plane.\n\nNext, let's find the pre-image of this curve under the mapping w = f(z). To do this, we need to find all points z in the complex plane such that f(z) = w for some point w on the curve. In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^3 - 3z^2 + 3z - 1 = 8e^(3it) + 8e^(2it) + 6e^(it)\n\nThis is a cubic equation in z, and finding its solutions is not straightforward. However, we can use numerical methods or software tools to find the solutions for different values of t. The pre-image of the curve will be the set of all such solutions in the complex plane.\n\nIn summary, the image of the circle |z-1| = 2 under the mapping w = f(z) is a continuous curve in the complex plane parameterized by the function w(t) = 8e^(3it) + 8e^(2it) + 6e^(it). The pre-image of this curve is the set of all points z in the complex plane that satisfy the equation z^3 - 3z^2 + 3z - 1 = 8e^(3it) + 8e^(2it) + 6e^(it) for some value of t."
