    "message_2": "1. Cut vertices and bridges in G:\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can analyze the graph:\n\n- Removing vertex A and its incident edges {AB, AC, AD} results in two connected components: {B, E} and {C, D, F}. So, A is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex B and its incident edges {AB, BE} results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {E}. So, B is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex C and its incident edges {AC, CF} results in two connected components: {A, B, D, E} and {F}. So, C is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex D and its incident edges {AD} does not increase the number of connected components. So, D is not a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex E and its incident edges {BE} results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {B, E}. So, E is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex F and its incident edges {CF} does not increase the number of connected components. So, F is not a cut vertex.\n\nCut vertices are A, B, C, and E.\n\nNow let's find the bridges:\n\n- Removing edge {AB} results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {B, E}. So, {AB} is a bridge.\n- Removing edge {AC} results in two connected components: {A, B, D, E} and {C, F}. So, {AC} is a bridge.\n- Removing edge {AD} does not increase the number of connected components. So, {AD} is not a bridge.\n- Removing edge {BE} results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {B, E}. So, {BE} is a bridge.\n- Removing edge {CF} does not increase the number of connected components. So, {CF} is not a bridge.\n\nBridges are {AB}, {AC}, and {BE}.\n\n2. If a new edge {CD} is added to G, how does this change the cut vertices and bridges in the graph?\n\nAdding edge {CD} creates a cycle between vertices A, C, and D. Let's reanalyze the graph for cut vertices and bridges:\n\n- Removing vertex A and its incident edges {AB, AC, AD} still results in two connected components: {B, E} and {C, D, F}. So, A remains a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex B and its incident edges {AB, BE} still results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {E}. So, B remains a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex C and its incident edges {AC, CF, CD} does not increase the number of connected components due to the cycle created by the new edge {CD}. So, C is no longer a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex D and its incident edges {AD, CD} does not increase the number of connected components. So, D remains not a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex E and its incident edges {BE} still results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {B, E}. So, E remains a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex F and its incident edges {CF} does not increase the number of connected components. So, F remains not a cut vertex.\n\nCut vertices after adding {CD} are A, B, and E.\n\nNow let's find the bridges after adding {CD}:\n\n- Removing edge {AB} still results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {B, E}. So, {AB} remains a bridge.\n- Removing edge {AC} does not increase the number of connected components due to the cycle created by the new edge {CD}. So, {AC} is no longer a bridge.\n- Removing edge {AD} does not increase the number of connected components. So, {AD} remains not a bridge.\n- Removing edge {BE} still results in two connected components: {A, C, D, F} and {B, E}. So, {BE} remains a bridge.\n- Removing edge {CF} does not increase the number of connected components. So, {CF} remains not a bridge.\n- Removing edge {CD} does not increase the number of connected components. So, {CD} is not a bridge.\n\nBridges after adding {CD} are {AB} and {BE}.\n\nIn summary, adding edge {CD} to the graph G changes the cut vertices from {A, B, C, E} to {A, B, E} and the bridges from {AB, AC, BE} to {AB, BE}."
