    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 28x^3 + 75x^2 - 66x, we first need to find its derivative f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 28x^3 + 75x^2 - 66x)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 84x^2 + 150x - 66\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n12x^3 - 84x^2 + 150x - 66 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of 66 divided by the factors of 12, which are:\n\n±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\n12(1)^3 - 84(1)^2 + 150(1) - 66 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(12x^3 - 84x^2 + 150x - 66) / (x - 1)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n12x^2 - 72x + 66\n\nNow, we can find the remaining critical points by setting the quadratic factor equal to zero:\n\n12x^2 - 72x + 66 = 0\n\nDivide by 6:\n\n2x^2 - 12x + 11 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining critical points:\n\nx = [-(-12) ± √((-12)^2 - 4(2)(11))] / (2 * 2)\n\nx = [12 ± √(144 - 88)] / 4\n\nx = [12 ± √56] / 4\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 28x^3 + 75x^2 - 66x are:\n\nx = 1, x = (12 + √56) / 4, and x = (12 - √56) / 4"
