    "message_2": "Floer homology is a homology theory for Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic manifolds. However, in this case, we are given a smooth map f: X -> Y, where X is a torus and Y is a sphere, which are not Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic manifold. Therefore, Floer homology is not applicable to this problem.\n\nInstead, we can consider the homotopy groups or homology groups of the torus and sphere, which are topological invariants that can be computed for these spaces.\n\nFor the torus X, its homotopy groups are:\nπ_1(X) = Z × Z (the fundamental group)\nπ_n(X) = 0 for n > 1\n\nAnd its homology groups are:\nH_0(X) = Z (the zeroth homology group)\nH_1(X) = Z × Z (the first homology group)\nH_n(X) = 0 for n > 1\n\nFor the sphere Y, its homotopy groups are:\nπ_0(Y) = 0\nπ_1(Y) = 0\nπ_n(Y) = Z for n > 1\n\nAnd its homology groups are:\nH_0(Y) = Z (the zeroth homology group)\nH_n(Y) = Z for n > 0 and n is even\nH_n(Y) = 0 for n > 0 and n is odd\n\nHowever, without more information about the smooth map f: X -> Y, we cannot compute any further invariants related to this map."
