    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by Î´ (delta), is approximately equal to 4.66920160910299067185320382. It characterizes the period-doubling route to chaos in 1-dimensional maps and is a universal constant in the sense that it is the same for various functions and systems that exhibit period-doubling behavior."
