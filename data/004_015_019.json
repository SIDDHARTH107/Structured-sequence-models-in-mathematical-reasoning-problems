    "message_1": "A quadratic function f(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3 has an inflection point. Determine the x-coordinate of the inflection point using calculus.",
    "message_2": "Quadratic functions do not have inflection points. An inflection point is a point on the graph of a function where the concavity changes. Quadratic functions have a single, constant concavity, either upward or downward, depending on the sign of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn the case of the given function f(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3, the leading coefficient is positive (2), so the graph is a parabola opening upward, and it does not have an inflection point."
