    "message_1": "Using the RSA public key encryption scheme, suppose the public key is $e = 65537$ and the modulus is $n = 1048576$. If a message is encrypted by converting it to a number using ASCII codes (where each letter corresponds to a 3-digit number), and then applying RSA encryption, what is the encrypted message for the word \"MATH\"?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the word \"MATH\" to its ASCII representation. The ASCII codes for the letters are:\n\nM: 077\nA: 065\nT: 084\nH: 072\n\nNow, we concatenate these codes to form the message number: 077065084072.\n\nNext, we apply RSA encryption using the public key (e, n) = (65537, 1048576). The encryption formula is:\n\nciphertext = (message^e) % n\n\nSo, we compute:\n\nciphertext = (77065084072^65537) % 1048576\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language that supports large numbers, we find:\n\nciphertext = 1019904\n\nThus, the encrypted message for the word \"MATH\" is 1019904."
