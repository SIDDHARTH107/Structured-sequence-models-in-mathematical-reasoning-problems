    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given 10 dollars and must decide how much to offer Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they split the money as agreed. If Player 2 rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What is the optimal offer that Player 1 should make to maximize their chances of Player 2 accepting the offer, and what is Player 2's best response?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the optimal offer that Player 1 should make to maximize their chances of Player 2 accepting the offer depends on Player 2's preferences and expectations. However, a common strategy is for Player 1 to offer an amount that is perceived as fair by Player 2. \n\nA common benchmark for fairness is a 50-50 split, so Player 1 could offer $5 to Player 2. This is likely to be accepted by Player 2, as they would receive half of the total amount. However, Player 1 could also offer a slightly lower amount (e.g., $4) to maximize their own share, assuming that Player 2 would still accept the offer as it is better than receiving nothing.\n\nPlayer 2's best response is to accept any offer that is greater than $0, as receiving any amount of money is better than receiving nothing. However, if Player 2 values fairness or wants to punish Player 1 for making an unfair offer, they might reject offers below a certain threshold (e.g., less than $3). This would result in both players receiving nothing, but it could send a signal to Player 1 about the importance of fairness."
