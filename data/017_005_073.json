    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the Sylow theorems state the following:\n\n1. For any prime power p^k dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of order p^k in G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the first Sylow theorem, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of order 5^3 in G. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups n_5 divides the index [G : P] = 125/125 = 1, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is that n_5 = 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P in G. Since P is unique, it is normal in G (as all Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate to each other, and the only conjugate of P is P itself).\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of P. Since P has order 5^3, it is a p-group, and by the second Sylow theorem, it has a nontrivial center Z(P). The order of Z(P) must be a power of 5, so either |Z(P)| = 5, 25, or 125. If |Z(P)| = 125, then P is abelian and G is cyclic, as desired. So, let's consider the case where |Z(P)| = 5 or 25.\n\nIf |Z(P)| = 5, then P/Z(P) has order 25. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P/Z(P) is isomorphic to either C_25 or C_5 × C_5. If P/Z(P) is isomorphic to C_25, then P is isomorphic to Z(P) × C_25, which is a cyclic group of order 125, and G is cyclic. If P/Z(P) is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5, then P is isomorphic to Z(P) × (C_5 × C_5), which is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIf |Z(P)| = 25, then P is isomorphic to Z(P) × C_5, which is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn either case, we have shown that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
