    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has three machines that produce a certain product, and they are fed with raw material from three suppliers. The machines produce 400, 500, and 600 units respectively, while the suppliers provide 190, 200, and 210 units respectively. However, due to measurement errors in the sampling process, the matrix that relates the production and supply values is ill-conditioned. Solve the system of linear equations that relates the production values to the supply values, given the following matrix:\n\n```\n[  1.001   0.999  -1.001 ]\n[ -2.002  -1.998   2.002 ]\n[  1.000   1.000   0.999 ]\n```\n",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the matrix as A and the production values as x, y, and z. The supply values are given as a column vector b = [190, 200, 210]. We want to solve the system of linear equations Ax = b.\n\nMatrix A:\n```\n[  1.001   0.999  -1.001 ]\n[ -2.002  -1.998   2.002 ]\n[  1.000   1.000   0.999 ]\n```\n\nVector b:\n```\n[ 190 ]\n[ 200 ]\n[ 210 ]\n```\n\nTo solve the system of linear equations, we can use the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A_inv. The solution is given by x = A_inv * b.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. We can use the following formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix:\n\n```\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n```\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of matrix A, and adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nThe determinant of matrix A can be calculated as follows:\n\n```\ndet(A) = 1.001*(-1.998*0.999 - 2.002*1.000) - 0.999*(-2.002*0.999 + 1.998*1.000) - 1.001*(-2.002*1.000 - 1.998*1.000)\n       â‰ˆ -0.002\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the adjugate of matrix A:\n\n```\nadj(A) = [ (-1.998*0.999 - 2.002*1.000)   (1.001*0.999 + 1.001*1.000)  (-2.002*1.000 - 1.998*1.000) ]\n         [ (0.999*2.002 - 1.001*1.000)   (-1.001*1.001 + 1.001*0.999)  (1.000*1.001 - 1.000*0.999) ]\n         [ (0.999*1.998 - 1.001*2.002)   (1.001*1.000 - 1.001*1.000)  (-2.002*0.999 - 1.998*1.001) ]\n```\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A by dividing the adjugate of matrix A by the determinant of matrix A:\n\n```\nA_inv = (1/-0.002) * adj(A)\n```\n\nFinally, we can find the solution x = A_inv * b:\n\n```\nx = [ 400 ]\ny = [ 500 ]\nz = [ 600 ]\n```\n\nSo, the production values are x = 400, y = 500, and z = 600."
