    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: type A and type B. The profit obtained from each unit of type A is $30 and from each unit of type B is $50. The factory has 500 units of raw material, which is enough to produce 300 units of type A or 200 units of type B. The demand for type A is at least 200 units, and the demand for type B is at least 100 units. The production process is subject to stochastic variability, and the probability of producing a type A unit is 0.8 and that of producing a type B unit is 0.6. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the profit of the factory?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A produced and y be the number of units of type B produced. We need to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 30x + 50y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: x + 2y ≤ 500 (since 1 unit of type A requires 1 unit of raw material and 1 unit of type B requires 2 units of raw material)\n2. Demand constraint for type A: x ≥ 200\n3. Demand constraint for type B: y ≥ 100\n4. Probability constraint for type A: x ≤ 300 (since the probability of producing a type A unit is 0.8, and there are 500 units of raw material)\n5. Probability constraint for type B: y ≤ 200 (since the probability of producing a type B unit is 0.6, and there are 500 units of raw material)\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by plotting these constraints on a graph. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied.\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraints intersect. These vertices are potential candidates for the optimal production plan.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\n1. (200, 100)\n2. (200, 150)\n3. (300, 100)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at these vertices:\n\n1. P(200, 100) = 30(200) + 50(100) = 6000 + 5000 = 11000\n2. P(200, 150) = 30(200) + 50(150) = 6000 + 7500 = 13500\n3. P(300, 100) = 30(300) + 50(100) = 9000 + 5000 = 14000\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the vertex (300, 100), with a profit of $14,000. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 300 units of type A and 100 units of type B."
