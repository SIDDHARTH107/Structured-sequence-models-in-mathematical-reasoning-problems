    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(t) = 2cos(t) + 3, we need to find the maximum value of the cosine function and then apply the transformation.\n\nThe maximum value of the cosine function occurs at t = 0, where cos(t) = 1. Now, we can apply the transformation to find the maximum value of f(t):\n\nf(t) = 2cos(t) + 3\nf(0) = 2cos(0) + 3\nf(0) = 2(1) + 3\nf(0) = 2 + 3\nf(0) = 5\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function f(t) = 2cos(t) + 3 is 5, and it occurs at t = 0."
