    "message_1": "There are 80 students in a school, of which 45 are boys and 35 are girls. If 20 students can play volleyball, 25 students can play basketball, and 15 students can play both games, then how many students can play at least one game?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students who can play at least one game, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nNumber of students who can play at least one game = Number of students who can play volleyball + Number of students who can play basketball - Number of students who can play both games.\n\nNumber of students who can play at least one game = 20 (volleyball) + 25 (basketball) - 15 (both)\n\nNumber of students who can play at least one game = 20 + 25 - 15 = 30\n\nSo, 30 students can play at least one game."
