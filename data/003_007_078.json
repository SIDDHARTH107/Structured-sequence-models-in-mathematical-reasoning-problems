    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side of the triangle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 5, b = 7, and the angle C = 120 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (120 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 3\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 74 - 70 * (-1/2)\nc² = 74 + 35\nc² = 109\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc = √109 ≈ 10.44\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is approximately 10.44 units."
