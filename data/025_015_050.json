    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane curve that is the intersection of the two surfaces, we can solve the system of equations by eliminating one variable. Let's eliminate x^2 by adding the two equations:\n\n$(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2 - y^2 - z^2) = 81 + 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$2x^2 = 81$\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{81}{2}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $x^2$ back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$\\frac{81}{2} + y^2 + z^2 = 81$\n\nNow, subtract $\\frac{81}{2}$ from both sides:\n\n$y^2 + z^2 = 81 - \\frac{81}{2}$\n\n$y^2 + z^2 = \\frac{81}{2}$\n\nThis is the equation of the plane curve that is the intersection of the two surfaces. It represents a circle in the yz-plane with a radius of $\\sqrt{\\frac{81}{2}}$."
