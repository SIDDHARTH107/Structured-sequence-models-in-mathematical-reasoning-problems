    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak formulation of the problem. Let's use a rectangular grid with 10 divisions in each direction, so Δx = Δy = 0.1.\n\n1. Discretize the domain:\nCreate a grid with 11 nodes in each direction (0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1) for both x and y coordinates. There will be a total of 121 nodes.\n\n2. Define the basis functions:\nUse bilinear rectangular elements as basis functions. Each element will have 4 nodes, and the basis functions will be defined as:\nϕ_i(x, y) = (1 - |x - x_i|/Δx)(1 - |y - y_i|/Δy) for i = 1, 2, ..., 121\n\n3. Set up the weak formulation:\nMultiply the PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain:\n∫∫(u_tt * v - u_xx * v_x - u_yy * v_y) dxdy = 0\n\n4. Apply the Galerkin method:\nApproximate the solution u(x, y, t) and its derivatives as a linear combination of the basis functions:\nu(x, y, t) ≈ Σ u_i(t) * ϕ_i(x, y)\nu_t(x, y, t) ≈ Σ u'_i(t) * ϕ_i(x, y)\nu_tt(x, y, t) ≈ Σ u''_i(t) * ϕ_i(x, y)\nu_x(x, y, t) ≈ Σ u_i(t) * ϕ_i_x(x, y)\nu_y(x, y, t) ≈ Σ u_i(t) * ϕ_i_y(x, y)\n\n5. Assemble the system of equations:\nSubstitute the approximations into the weak formulation and apply the boundary conditions. This will result in a system of linear equations in the form:\nM * u''(t) + K * u(t) = 0\nwhere M and K are the mass and stiffness matrices, respectively.\n\n6. Solve the system of equations:\nUse a time-stepping method, such as the Newmark-beta method or the central difference method, to solve the system of equations for the unknown coefficients u_i(t) at each time step.\n\n7. Compute the numerical solution:\nOnce the coefficients u_i(t) are obtained, the numerical solution of the PDE at any point (x, y) and time t can be computed as:\nu(x, y, t) ≈ Σ u_i(t) * ϕ_i(x, y)\n\nNote that this is a general outline of the finite element method for solving the given PDE. The actual implementation and computation of the numerical solution would require programming and numerical computation software, such as MATLAB or Python."
