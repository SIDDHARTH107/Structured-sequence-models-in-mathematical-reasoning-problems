    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (a sector of a circle), and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base:\nBase area (A_base) = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = π * 25 cm^2\nA_base ≈ 78.54 cm^2\n\nNext, let's find the lateral area:\nLateral area (A_lateral) = 1/2 * Circumference of base * Slant height\nCircumference of base = 2 * π * r\nCircumference of base = 2 * π * 5 cm\nCircumference of base = 10π cm\n\nNow, we can find the lateral area:\nA_lateral = 1/2 * (10π cm) * (10 cm)\nA_lateral = 50π cm^2\nA_lateral ≈ 157.08 cm^2\n\nFinally, let's add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area:\nSurface area (A_total) = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total ≈ 78.54 cm^2 + 157.08 cm^2\nA_total ≈ 235.62 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 235.62 cm^2."
