    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points, which means that the metric remains unchanged under the transformation. For the given metric, we are looking for transformations that preserve the Euclidean distance in the plane.\n\nThere are four types of isometries in the Euclidean plane:\n\n1. Translations: A translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed distance in a fixed direction. Let's denote the translation by a vector $\\mathbf{v} = (a, b)$. The transformation is given by:\n\n$$\n(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)\n$$\n\nUnder this transformation, the metric remains unchanged:\n\n$$\nds'^2 = d(x')^2 + d(y')^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = ds^2\n$$\n\n2. Rotations: A rotation is a transformation that rotates every point in the plane around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a fixed angle $\\theta$. The transformation is given by:\n\n$$\nx' = x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta \\\\\ny' = x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta\n$$\n\nUnder this transformation, the metric remains unchanged:\n\n$$\nds'^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 = (dx \\cos \\theta - dy \\sin \\theta)^2 + (dx \\sin \\theta + dy \\cos \\theta)^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = ds^2\n$$\n\n3. Reflections: A reflection is a transformation that reflects every point in the plane across a fixed line (the line of reflection). Let's denote the line of reflection by the equation $ax + by + c = 0$. The transformation is given by:\n\n$$\nx' = x - 2 \\frac{ax + by + c}{a^2 + b^2} a \\\\\ny' = y - 2 \\frac{ax + by + c}{a^2 + b^2} b\n$$\n\nUnder this transformation, the metric remains unchanged:\n\n$$\nds'^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 = (dx - 2 \\frac{adx + bdy}{a^2 + b^2} a)^2 + (dy - 2 \\frac{adx + bdy}{a^2 + b^2} b)^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = ds^2\n$$\n\n4. Glide reflections: A glide reflection is a transformation that combines a reflection across a fixed line and a translation parallel to the line. The transformation can be obtained by first applying a reflection and then a translation:\n\n$$\nx'' = x' + a \\\\\ny'' = y' + b\n$$\n\nUnder this transformation, the metric remains unchanged:\n\n$$\nds''^2 = d(x'')^2 + d(y'')^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 = ds'^2 = ds^2\n$$\n\nIn summary, the isometries of the given metric are translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections."
