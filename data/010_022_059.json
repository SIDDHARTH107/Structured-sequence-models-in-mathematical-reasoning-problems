    "message_2": "The equation of a sphere centered at the origin with radius 2 is given by:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the tangent plane to this sphere at the point (1, -1, sqrt(3)). The gradient of the sphere at this point will give us the normal vector to the tangent plane.\n\nThe gradient of the sphere is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\nâˆ‡(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, sqrt(3)), the gradient is:\n\n(2(1), 2(-1), 2(sqrt(3))) = (2, -2, 2sqrt(3))\n\nThis is the normal vector to the tangent plane. Now, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane:\n\nA(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0\n\nWhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector, and (x0, y0, z0) is the point on the plane. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) - 2(y + 1) + 2sqrt(3)(z - sqrt(3)) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x - 2y + 2sqrt(3)z = 4 + 6\n\n2x - 2y + 2sqrt(3)z = 10\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent plane to the sphere at the point (1, -1, sqrt(3))."
