The factory has 3 sources of materials available with the following daily supply capacities:\n\n- Source 1: 100 units\n- Source 2: 200 units\n- Source 3: 150 units\n\nThe factory has 4 production lines which require different amounts of materials as follows:\n\n- Line 1: requires 2 units of material from source 1, 4 units from source 2 and 3 units from source 3 to produce 1 unit of product\n- Line 2: requires 3 units of material from source 1, 2 units from source 2 and 1 unit from source 3 to produce 1 unit of product\n- Line 3: requires 1 unit of material from source 1, 1 unit from source 2 and 2 units from source 3 to produce 1 unit of product\n- Line 4: requires 2 units of material from source 1, 3 units from source 2 and 1 unit from source 3 to produce 1 unit of product\n\nWhat is the maximum number of units of each product that the factory can produce per day?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of units of each product that the factory can produce per day, we need to determine the maximum number of units that can be produced by each production line based on the available materials from each source.\n\nLine 1:\n- Source 1: 100 units / 2 units = 50 units\n- Source 2: 200 units / 4 units = 50 units\n- Source 3: 150 units / 3 units = 50 units\nThe maximum number of units that Line 1 can produce is 50 units.\n\nLine 2:\n- Source 1: 100 units / 3 units = 33.33 units (round down to 33 units)\n- Source 2: 200 units / 2 units = 100 units\n- Source 3: 150 units / 1 unit = 150 units\nThe maximum number of units that Line 2 can produce is 33 units.\n\nLine 3:\n- Source 1: 100 units / 1 unit = 100 units\n- Source 2: 200 units / 1 unit = 200 units\n- Source 3: 150 units / 2 units = 75 units\nThe maximum number of units that Line 3 can produce is 75 units.\n\nLine 4:\n- Source 1: 100 units / 2 units = 50 units\n- Source 2: 200 units / 3 units = 66.67 units (round down to 66 units)\n- Source 3: 150 units / 1 unit = 150 units\nThe maximum number of units that Line 4 can produce is 50 units.\n\nSo, the maximum number of units of each product that the factory can produce per day is as follows:\n- Line 1: 50 units\n- Line 2: 33 units\n- Line 3: 75 units\n- Line 4: 50 units"
