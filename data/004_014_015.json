    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the given region around the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of cross-sectional disks along the axis of rotation. In this case, the cross-sectional disks have a radius equal to the function y = 2x^2 and thickness dx.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by the formula A(x) = π * (radius)^2 = π * (2x^2)^2 = 4πx^4.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the area function A(x) along the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 2:\n\nVolume = ∫[A(x) dx] from 0 to 2 = ∫[4πx^4 dx] from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate 4πx^4 with respect to x, we use the power rule:\n\n∫[4πx^4 dx] = (4π/5)x^5 + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds x = 0 and x = 2:\n\n(4π/5)(2^5) - (4π/5)(0^5) = (4π/5)(32) = 128π/5\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the curve y = 2x^2, the line y = 0, and the lines x = 0 and x = 2 around the x-axis is 128π/5 cubic units."
