The demand curve is given by Q = 600 - 2P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price.\n\na) Find the market equilibrium quantity and price.\nb) Calculate the profit earned by each company in the market equilibrium.\nc) Calculate the market share of each company in the market equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "a) To find the market equilibrium quantity and price, we first need to find the total quantity produced by both companies. Since Company A produces 100 units and Company B produces 80 units, the total quantity produced (Q) is:\n\nQ = 100 + 80 = 180 units\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the demand curve equation to find the equilibrium price (P):\n\n180 = 600 - 2P\n\n2P = 600 - 180\n2P = 420\nP = 210\n\nSo, the market equilibrium quantity is 180 units, and the equilibrium price is $210.\n\nb) To calculate the profit earned by each company, we need to find their respective total revenue and total cost. We are not given any information about the cost structure of the companies, so we will assume that the cost per unit is the same for both companies and denote it as C.\n\nTotal revenue for Company A: TR_A = P * Q_A = 210 * 100 = 21,000\nTotal revenue for Company B: TR_B = P * Q_B = 210 * 80 = 16,800\n\nTotal cost for Company A: TC_A = C * 100\nTotal cost for Company B: TC_B = C * 80\n\nProfit for Company A: π_A = TR_A - TC_A = 21,000 - C * 100\nProfit for Company B: π_B = TR_B - TC_B = 16,800 - C * 80\n\nWithout information about the cost per unit (C), we cannot find the exact profit values for each company. However, we can express their profits in terms of C as shown above.\n\nc) To calculate the market share of each company, we need to find the proportion of the total market quantity produced by each company.\n\nMarket share of Company A: (Q_A / Q_total) * 100 = (100 / 180) * 100 = 55.56%\nMarket share of Company B: (Q_B / Q_total) * 100 = (80 / 180) * 100 = 44.44%\n\nIn the market equilibrium, Company A has a market share of 55.56%, and Company B has a market share of 44.44%."
