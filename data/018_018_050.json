    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is defined as the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFirst, let's find A Δ B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find B Δ A:\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nB ∩ A = {} (since B and A have no common elements)\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can see that A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. This shows that the symmetric difference is commutative, as A Δ B = B Δ A."
