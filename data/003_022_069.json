    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors u and v using trigonometric principles, we can use the formula:\n\nu . v = |u| * |v| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, respectively, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √(1² + 2²) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u . v) / (|u| * |v|)\n\nwhere u . v is the dot product of the vectors u and v. We can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nu . v = u₁v₁ + u₂v₂\n\nFor our vectors u = [3, 4] and v = [1, 2], this gives us:\n\nu . v = (3 * 1) + (4 * 2) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nNow we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (11) / (5 * √5)\n\nNow we can plug this into our formula for the dot product using trigonometric principles:\n\nu . v = |u| * |v| * cos(θ) = 5 * √5 * (11 / (5 * √5))\n\nThe √5 and 5 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nu . v = 11\n\nSo the dot product of the two vectors u = [3, 4] and v = [1, 2] is 11."
