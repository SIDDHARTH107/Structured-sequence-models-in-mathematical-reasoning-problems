    "message_1": "John is participating in an auction for a painting. The bidding starts at $100 and the increment is $10. John values the painting at $200. What should be John's bidding strategy to maximize his expected utility?",
    "message_2": "To maximize his expected utility, John should follow these steps in his bidding strategy:\n\n1. Start by bidding the minimum amount, which is $100 in this case.\n2. Continue bidding in increments of $10 as long as the current bid is below his valuation of $200.\n3. Stop bidding once the current bid reaches or exceeds his valuation of $200.\n\nBy following this strategy, John ensures that he does not overpay for the painting while still having a chance to win the auction if the final bid is below his valuation. Additionally, this strategy allows John to potentially win the painting at a lower price than his valuation, increasing his overall utility."
