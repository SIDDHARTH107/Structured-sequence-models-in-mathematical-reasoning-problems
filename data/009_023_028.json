    "message_2": "Given the peak amplitude of the soliton wave is $2$, we have $A = 2$.\n\nThe width of the soliton wave is given as $6$. The width is related to the parameter $k$ through the relation $width = \\frac{2}{k}$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$6 = \\frac{2}{k} \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe soliton wave moves to the right with a speed of $1$, so $v = 1$.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $w$. To do this, we can substitute the given soliton wave solution into the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation and solve for $w$. However, since the equation is quite complex, we can use the known relationship between the parameters of a soliton wave solution for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$w = \\frac{v^2}{4} - \\frac{A^2}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $A$ and $v$, we get:\n\n$$w = \\frac{1^2}{4} - \\frac{2^2}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} - 2 = -\\frac{7}{4}$$\n\nSo, the values of the constants are $A = 2$, $k = \\frac{1}{3}$, $v = 1$, and $w = -\\frac{7}{4}$."
