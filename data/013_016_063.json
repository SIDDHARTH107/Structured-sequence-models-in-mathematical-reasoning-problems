    "message_1": "Suppose that a company is offering its employees a bonus for achieving a goal on a project. The bonus will be split equally among all team members. The company knows that each team member will only put in maximum effort if the bonus is at least $10,000 in total. However, the company cannot be sure if each member is putting in maximum effort or shirking. If a team member shirks, they get the same bonus regardless of their effort.\n\nAssuming each team member has a 50/50 chance of shirking or putting in maximum effort, what is the minimum bonus amount required to incentivize each member to put in maximum effort?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the expected value of the bonus for each team member if they put in maximum effort and if they shirk. We want to find the minimum bonus amount that makes the expected value of putting in maximum effort greater than the expected value of shirking.\n\nLet B be the total bonus amount, and N be the number of team members. If a team member puts in maximum effort, they will receive B/N. If they shirk, they will still receive B/N, since the bonus is split equally among all team members.\n\nThe expected value of putting in maximum effort is 0.5 * (B/N) + 0.5 * (B/N) = B/N. The expected value of shirking is also B/N. To incentivize maximum effort, we need the expected value of putting in maximum effort to be greater than the expected value of shirking.\n\nSince we know that each team member will only put in maximum effort if the bonus is at least $10,000 in total, we can set B = $10,000. Now we need to find the minimum number of team members (N) for which the expected value of putting in maximum effort is greater than the expected value of shirking.\n\nB/N > B/N\n$10,000/N > $10,000/N\n\nSince the inequality is not true for any value of N, it means that the minimum bonus amount required to incentivize each member to put in maximum effort is the same as the amount the company initially set, which is $10,000."
