    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 10 centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(10)\n\nC ≈ 3.14 * 10\n\nC ≈ 31.4 centimeters\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 31.4 centimeters."
