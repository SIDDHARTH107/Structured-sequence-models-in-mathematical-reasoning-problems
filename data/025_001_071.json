Find the number of points of intersection of these curves and prove your answer using Bezout's theorem.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the number of points of intersection of the two curves, we first need to solve the system of equations formed by the given equations of the curves. \n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 = 9\nC2: x + y = 2\n\nFrom C2, we can express y in terms of x: y = 2 - x. Now, substitute this expression for y into C1:\n\nx^2 + (2 - x)^2 = 9\nx^2 + (4 - 4x + x^2) = 9\n2x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for x. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -4, and c = -5:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(-5))) / (2(2))\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 40)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √56) / 4\n\nSo, we have two possible values for x: x = (4 + √56) / 4 and x = (4 - √56) / 4. For each value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using the expression y = 2 - x:\n\nFor x = (4 + √56) / 4:\ny = 2 - (4 + √56) / 4\n\nFor x = (4 - √56) / 4:\ny = 2 - (4 - √56) / 4\n\nThus, we have two points of intersection for the two curves.\n\nNow, let's prove this result using Bezout's theorem. Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nThe degree of C1 (x^2 + y^2 = 9) is 2, as the highest power of x or y in the equation is 2. The degree of C2 (x + y = 2) is 1, as the highest power of x or y in the equation is 1. The product of their degrees is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nSince the two curves have no common components (they are not multiples of each other), Bezout's theorem tells us that the number of intersection points is indeed 2, which confirms our earlier result."
