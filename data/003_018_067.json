The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's break down the function into its components:\nOuter function: g(u) = 4cos(u)\nInner function: h(x) = 3x\n\nNow, we'll find the derivatives of these functions:\ng'(u) = -4sin(u)\nh'(x) = 3\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\n\nSubstitute the inner function and its derivative:\nf'(x) = -4sin(3x) * 3\n\nSimplify the expression:\nf'(x) = -12sin(3x)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 4cos(3x) with respect to x is f'(x) = -12sin(3x)."
