    "message_2": "The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a region that is symmetric with respect to the real axis, and if the function is continuous up to the real axis and takes real values on the real axis, then the function can be analytically continued to the symmetric region in the lower half-plane.\n\nIn this case, f(z) is analytic in the upper half-plane Im(z) > 0 and f(z) = z for all real numbers x. We want to find f(z) in the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0.\n\nLet g(z) be the reflection of f(z) with respect to the real axis, i.e., g(z) = f(conj(z)), where conj(z) denotes the complex conjugate of z. Since f(z) is analytic in the upper half-plane and takes real values on the real axis, g(z) is analytic in the lower half-plane and takes real values on the real axis.\n\nNow, consider the function h(z) = f(z) - g(z). This function is analytic in both the upper and lower half-planes, and h(z) = 0 on the real axis (since f(z) = z and g(z) = conj(z) for real z). By the uniqueness theorem for analytic functions, h(z) must be identically zero in the whole complex plane. Therefore, f(z) = g(z) in the lower half-plane.\n\nSo, for Im(z) < 0, we have:\n\nf(z) = f(conj(z))\n\nThis is the analytic continuation of f(z) in the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0."
