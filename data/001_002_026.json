    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3x + 4y = 12 for y, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation:\n4y = 12 - 3x\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\ny = (12 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow that we have the equation in terms of y, we can graph it on the coordinate plane. The equation is in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\ny = (-3/4)x + 3\n\nThe slope (m) is -3/4, and the y-intercept (b) is 3.\n\nTo graph the equation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Plot the y-intercept (0, 3) on the coordinate plane.\n2. From the y-intercept point, use the slope to find the next point. Since the slope is -3/4, go down 3 units and to the right 4 units. This will give you the point (4, 0).\n3. Draw a straight line through the two points (0, 3) and (4, 0).\n\nThe graph of the equation 3x + 4y = 12 is a straight line that passes through the points (0, 3) and (4, 0)."
