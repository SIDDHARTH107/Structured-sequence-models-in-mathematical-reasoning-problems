    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the breeding behavior of cuckoo birds. To apply the cuckoo search algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 in the interval [0, 5], we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Set the initial population of \"nests\" (potential solutions) and their positions (x values) randomly within the interval [0, 5]. Let's say we have 10 nests.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest: Calculate the function value f(x) for each nest's position (x value) and determine their fitness. Lower function values correspond to higher fitness.\n\n3. Generate a new solution (cuckoo egg) for a randomly chosen nest using a random walk (Levy flight) within the interval [0, 5].\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution (cuckoo egg). If its fitness is better (lower function value) than the nest it was generated for, replace the nest with the new solution.\n\n5. Perform \"discovery\" of a fraction of the worst nests (e.g., 20%) and replace them with new randomly generated solutions within the interval [0, 5].\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a minimum function value threshold or no significant improvement in the best solution).\n\n7. The best solution (nest) found during the iterations represents the minimum value of the function.\n\nApplying the cuckoo search algorithm to the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6, we will find that the minimum value occurs at x â‰ˆ 2.5, with a function value of f(2.5) = -0.25."
