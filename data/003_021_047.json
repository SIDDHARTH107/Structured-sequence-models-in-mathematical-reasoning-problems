    "message_2": "Let's denote the starting point as A, the point after 10 km eastward as B, and the current position after 8 km northward as C. We want to find the angle ∠BAC.\n\nWe can use the cosine rule to find the angle. The cosine rule states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle ∠C opposite side c:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 10 km (AB), b = 8 km (BC), and we need to find c (AC) first to apply the cosine rule.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for a right-angled triangle ABC, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 10^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = 100 + 64\nc^2 = 164\nc = √164 ≈ 12.81 km\n\nNow we have the length of AC, and we can apply the cosine rule to find the angle ∠BAC:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n164 = 100 + 64 - 2 * 10 * 8 * cos(C)\n0 = -160 * cos(C)\ncos(C) = 0\n\nSince cos(C) = 0, the angle ∠BAC = arccos(0) = 90°."
