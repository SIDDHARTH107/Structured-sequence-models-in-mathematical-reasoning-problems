    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the sound recording, we first need to have the time-domain signal of the recording, which is not provided in the problem statement. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation, allowing us to analyze the frequency content of the signal.\n\nAssuming we have the time-domain signal x(t), the Fourier Transform X(f) can be calculated as:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire time duration of the signal.\n\nHowever, without the actual time-domain signal x(t), we cannot compute the Fourier Transform and determine the frequency content at 5000 Hz.\n\nIf you can provide the time-domain signal or a specific function representing the sound recording, we can proceed with the Fourier Transform calculation and determine the frequency content at 5000 Hz."
