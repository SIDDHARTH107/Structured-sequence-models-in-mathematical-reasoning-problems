The data is presented in the table below.\n\n| Student | Hours Studied | Test Score |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 1       | 2            | 60         |\n| 2       | 5            | 75         |\n| 3       | 1            | 50         |\n| 4       | 3            | 65         |\n| 5       | 4            | 70         |\n| 6       | 6            | 80         |\n| 7       | 7            | 85         |\n| 8       | 4            | 70         |\n| 9       | 2            | 55         |\n| 10      | 5            | 75         |\n\nCalculate the correlation coefficient between the number of hours students study per week and their scores on the test.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours students study per week and their scores on the test, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of the x values (hours studied), and ȳ is the mean of the y values (test scores).\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the hours studied (x̄) and the mean of the test scores (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (2 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 5) / 10 = 39 / 10 = 3.9\nȳ = (60 + 75 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 80 + 85 + 70 + 55 + 75) / 10 = 685 / 10 = 68.5\n\nNext, we will calculate the individual terms for the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\n| Student | xi - x̄ | yi - ȳ | (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) | (xi - x̄)² | (yi - ȳ)² |\n|---------|--------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|\n| 1       | -1.9   | -8.5   | 16.15          | 3.61      | 72.25    |\n| 2       | 1.1    | 6.5    | 7.15           | 1.21      | 42.25    |\n| 3       | -2.9   | -18.5  | 53.65          | 8.41      | 342.25   |\n| 4       | -0.9   | -3.5   | 3.15           | 0.81      | 12.25    |\n| 5       | 0.1    | 1.5    | 0.15           | 0.01      | 2.25     |\n| 6       | 2.1    | 11.5   | 24.15          | 4.41      | 132.25   |\n| 7       | 3.1    | 16.5   | 51.15          | 9.61      | 272.25   |\n| 8       | 0.1    | 1.5    | 0.15           | 0.01      | 2.25     |\n| 9       | -1.9   | -13.5  | 25.65          | 3.61      | 182.25   |\n| 10      | 1.1    | 6.5    | 7.15           | 1.21      | 42.25    |\n\nNow, we will sum up the columns:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) = 16.15 + 7.15 + 53.65 + 3.15 + 0.15 + 24.15 + 51.15 + 0.15 + 25.65 + 7.15 = 188.5\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = 3.61 + 1.21 + 8.41 + 0.81 + 0.01 + 4.41 + 9.61 + 0.01 + 3.61 + 1.21 = 32.9\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = 72.25 + 42.25 + 342.25 + 12.25 + 2.25 + 132.25 + 272.25 + 2.25 + 182.25 + 42.25 = 1101.5\n\nFinally, we will plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = 188.5 / √(32.9 * 1101.5) ≈ 188.5 / √(36234.35) ≈ 188.5 / 190.35 ≈ 0.990\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours students study per week and their scores on the test is approximately 0.990, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two variables."
