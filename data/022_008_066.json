    "message_2": "To prove that f is a polynomial of degree at most 3, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function is constant. We will show that the derivatives of f of order greater than 3 are all constant and equal to 0.\n\nLet's consider the function g(z) = f(z) / (z^3 + 1). Since f(z) is entire, g(z) is also entire except at the points where z^3 + 1 = 0. However, these are isolated singularities, and g(z) is bounded near these singularities because |f(z)| is bounded by 3|z|^3 + 2. Therefore, g(z) can be analytically continued to an entire function.\n\nNow, let's examine the behavior of g(z) as |z| → ∞. We have:\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z) / (z^3 + 1)| ≤ (3|z|^3 + 2) / (|z|^3 - 1)\n\nAs |z| → ∞, the term 3|z|^3 dominates both the numerator and the denominator, so:\n\n|g(z)| ≤ 3|z|^3 / |z|^3 = 3\n\nThis shows that g(z) is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, g(z) must be constant. Let's denote this constant by c, so g(z) = c for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nNow, we have f(z) = c(z^3 + 1). Since g(z) is entire, f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3. Therefore, f is a polynomial of degree at most 3."
