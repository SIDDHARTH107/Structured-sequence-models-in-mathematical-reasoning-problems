    "message_1": "Consider the heat equation on the complex plane, given by the equation:\n\nu_t = u_xx + u_yy\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is a complex-valued function of two spatial variables (x,y) and time t. Suppose that the initial condition is given by:\n\nu(x,y,0) = x + iy\n\nand that the boundary conditions are periodic:\n\nu(x+L,y,t) = u(x,y+L,t) = u(x,y,t)\n\nwhere L is a positive constant. What is the solution u(x,y,t) to the heat equation with these initial and boundary conditions, for all t>0?",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t), where X(x), Y(y), and T(t) are functions of x, y, and t, respectively. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = (X''(x) / X(x)) + (Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\n\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -λX(x)\n\nY''(y) = (λ - μ)Y(y)\n\nwith μ being another constant. The boundary conditions for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x + L) = X(x)\n\nY(y + L) = Y(y)\n\nThese boundary conditions imply that the solutions for X(x) and Y(y) are periodic functions, which can be represented as Fourier series:\n\nX(x) = Σ [A_n cos(2πnx/L) + B_n sin(2πnx/L)]\n\nY(y) = Σ [C_n cos(2πny/L) + D_n sin(2πny/L)]\n\nNow, substitute the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = x + iy into the separated solution:\n\nx + iy = Σ Σ [A_n cos(2πnx/L) + B_n sin(2πnx/L)] [C_n cos(2πny/L) + D_n sin(2πny/L)]\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\nx = Σ Σ [A_n cos(2πnx/L) + B_n sin(2πnx/L)] [C_n cos(2πny/L)]\n\ny = Σ Σ [A_n cos(2πnx/L) + B_n sin(2πnx/L)] [D_n sin(2πny/L)]\n\nSolving for the coefficients A_n, B_n, C_n, and D_n, we find:\n\nA_n = 0\n\nB_n = (-1)^n / (πn)\n\nC_n = 1\n\nD_n = 0\n\nThus, the solution for u(x, y, t) is given by:\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ [(-1)^n / (πn) sin(2πnx/L)] cos(2πny/L) e^(-λ_nt)\n\nwhere λ_n = (2πn/L)^2."
