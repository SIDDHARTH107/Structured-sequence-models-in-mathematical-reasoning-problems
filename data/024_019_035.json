    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the Euler characteristic (χ) of a surface to its total Gaussian curvature. The theorem states:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the infinitesimal surface area, and the integral is taken over the entire surface S.\n\nIn this case, we are given that S is a unit sphere, which means its radius is 1. The Gaussian curvature K of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nK = 1/r^2\n\nSince the radius of the unit sphere is 1, we have:\n\nK = 1/1^2 = 1\n\nNow we need to find the surface area A of the unit sphere. The surface area of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nA = 4πr^2\n\nFor the unit sphere, we have:\n\nA = 4π(1)^2 = 4π\n\nNow we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nSince K is constant and equal to 1, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫∫_S dA = 2πχ\n\nThe integral of dA over the entire surface S is just the surface area A, so we have:\n\nA = 2πχ\n\nSubstituting the value of A we found earlier:\n\n4π = 2πχ\n\nDivide both sides by 2π:\n\n2 = χ\n\nSo the Euler characteristic of the unit sphere S is 2."
