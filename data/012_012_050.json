    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the given graph, let's first construct the graph based on the given degree sequence.\n\nWe have 6 vertices with degree 3 and 6 vertices with degree 2. Let's label the vertices with degree 3 as A, B, C, D, E, and F, and the vertices with degree 2 as G, H, I, J, K, and L.\n\nNow, let's connect the vertices in such a way that the degree sequence is satisfied:\n\n1. Connect A to G, H, and I.\n2. Connect B to H, I, and J.\n3. Connect C to I, J, and K.\n4. Connect D to J, K, and L.\n5. Connect E to K, L, and G.\n6. Connect F to L, G, and H.\n\nNow, all vertices have the required degree. The graph looks like this:\n\n```\n  A -- G -- E -- K -- C\n  |\\     _/    _/|    _/\n  | H - F - L - J - D\n  |/     _/    _/|    _/\n  B -- I -- C -- J -- B\n```\n\nThe shortest cycle in this graph is A-G-E-A, B-H-F-B, C-I-F-C, and D-J-E-D, which have a length of 3. Therefore, the girth of the graph is 3."
