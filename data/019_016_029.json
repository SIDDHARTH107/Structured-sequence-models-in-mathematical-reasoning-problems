    "message_2": "The cardinality of a set is the number of distinct elements in the set. In the set A = {1, 2, {3, 4}, {1, 2}}, there are three distinct elements: 1, 2, and {3, 4}. The set {1, 2} is not counted as a distinct element because it contains the same elements as the set itself, so it is not considered a separate element.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set A is 3."
