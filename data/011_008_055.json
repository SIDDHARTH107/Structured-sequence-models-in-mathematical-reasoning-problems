    "message_1": "A seller offers 12 different types of cookies, and a customer wants to buy 8 cookies from the collection. In how many ways can the customer select the cookies such that they order at least one of each type? Use Stirling numbers of the second kind to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Stirling numbers of the second kind, we need to find the number of ways to partition a set of 8 cookies into 12 non-empty subsets, where each subset represents a type of cookie.\n\nStirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 8 and k = 12. However, since there are more types of cookies than the number of cookies the customer wants to buy, it is impossible for the customer to buy at least one of each type. Therefore, the answer to this problem is 0."
