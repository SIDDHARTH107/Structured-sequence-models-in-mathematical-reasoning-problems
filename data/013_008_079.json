    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 5 participants who each contribute to a common pool. The pool will be evenly distributed among the participants at the end of the game. Each participant has an initial endowment of $100. The game has 10 rounds and each participant chooses how much to contribute in each round. The total contributions in each round are multiplied by 2 and divided equally among the participants. If a participant does not contribute anything, their share will still be included in the pool and divided equally. Determine the contribution(s) that maximizes the total payoff for each participant at the end of the game.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation and find the optimal strategy for each participant to maximize their total payoff at the end of the game.\n\nIn each round, the total contribution is multiplied by 2 and then divided equally among the 5 participants. This means that for each dollar contributed to the pool, the contributor gets back 2/5 of a dollar, and the other participants get 2/5 of a dollar each as well.\n\nTo maximize the total payoff for each participant, they should aim to maximize the return on their investment in each round. Since the return on investment is 2/5 for each dollar contributed, the optimal strategy would be to contribute as much as possible in each round, i.e., the entire endowment of $100.\n\nLet's calculate the total payoff for each participant if they follow this strategy:\n\n1. In the first round, each participant contributes $100, making the total contribution $500. This amount is multiplied by 2, resulting in $1000, which is then divided equally among the 5 participants, giving each participant $200.\n2. In the second round, each participant contributes their entire endowment again ($200), making the total contribution $1000. This amount is multiplied by 2, resulting in $2000, which is then divided equally among the 5 participants, giving each participant $400.\n3. This process continues for 10 rounds.\n\nAfter 10 rounds, the total payoff for each participant can be calculated as follows:\n\nInitial endowment: $100\nRound 1: $200\nRound 2: $400\nRound 3: $800\nRound 4: $1600\nRound 5: $3200\nRound 6: $6400\nRound 7: $12800\nRound 8: $25600\nRound 9: $51200\nRound 10: $102400\n\nTotal payoff for each participant after 10 rounds: $102400\n\nSo, the optimal strategy for each participant to maximize their total payoff at the end of the game is to contribute their entire endowment in each round."
