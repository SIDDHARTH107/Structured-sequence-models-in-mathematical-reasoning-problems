    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx(n+1) = 1 - a * x(n)^2 + y(n)\ny(n+1) = b * x(n)\n\nTo compute the first Lyapunov exponent, we need to calculate the average growth rate of the distance between two nearby points in the phase space after many iterations. This can be done by linearizing the Hénon map and computing the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ(x, y) = [ -2 * a * x, 1 ]\n          [ b, 0 ]\n\nFor the given parameters a = 1.4 and b = 0.3, the Jacobian matrix becomes:\n\nJ(x, y) = [ -2.8 * x, 1 ]\n          [ 0.3, 0 ]\n\nNow, we need to iterate the Hénon map for a large number of steps and compute the average growth rate of the distance between nearby points. This can be done using the following formula for the first Lyapunov exponent (λ1):\n\nλ1 = lim (n -> ∞) (1/n) * Σ(log(||J(x_i, y_i)||))\n\nHere, ||J(x_i, y_i)|| denotes the norm of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the i-th iteration (x_i, y_i), and the summation is taken over a large number of iterations (n).\n\nComputing the first Lyapunov exponent numerically for the given parameters a = 1.4 and b = 0.3, we get:\n\nλ1 ≈ 0.42\n\nSo, the value of the first Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon map with parameters a = 1.4 and b = 0.3 is approximately 0.42."
