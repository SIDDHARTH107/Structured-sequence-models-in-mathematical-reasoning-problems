    "message_2": "G is a group of order 25, which means that the number of elements in G is 25. Since 25 is a prime number squared (25 = 5^2), we can apply the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: Let p be a prime number, and let G be a group of order p^2. Then G is either a cyclic group or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nIn our case, p = 5, and the order of G is 25 = 5^2. Therefore, by the theorem, G must be either a cyclic group or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nTo determine which of these cases holds, we can consider the number of elements of order 5 in G. By Cauchy's theorem, G must have an element of order 5, say g. If G is cyclic, then G is generated by g, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_25.\n\nIf G is not cyclic, then there must be another element h in G, not a power of g, with order 5. In this case, the subgroup generated by h, <h>, is also a cyclic group of order 5. Since the intersection of <g> and <h> is just the identity element, and the product of their orders is equal to the order of G (5 * 5 = 25), G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, which can be written as G ≅ Z_5 × Z_5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, as stated by the theorem."
