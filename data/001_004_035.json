    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 6x^3 - 30x^2 + 24x, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. The GCF of 6, -30, and 24 is 6, and the GCF of x^3, x^2, and x is x. So, we can factor out 6x from the polynomial:\n\n6x(x^2 - 5x + 4)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We look for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add to -5. These numbers are -4 and -1. So, we can factor the quadratic expression as:\n\n6x(x - 4)(x - 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 6x^3 - 30x^2 + 24x is 6x(x - 4)(x - 1)."
