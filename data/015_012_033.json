    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, which is a system of three ordinary differential equations. The number of attractors in the Lorenz system depends on the values of its parameters: sigma, beta, and rho. \n\nFor the given parameter values (sigma = 10, beta = 8/3, and rho = 170), the Lorenz system exhibits a chaotic behavior with two attractors. These attractors correspond to the two wings of the butterfly-shaped Lorenz attractor. The system will switch between these two attractors, but it is unpredictable when the switch will occur due to the chaotic nature of the system."
