    "message_1": "Sorry, but it's not possible to create a precise numerical problem for the Paraconsistent Logic topic as it is a type of logic that deals with contradictions and allows for certain contradictions to coexist without leading to logically inconsistent results. It deals with more abstract concepts rather than numerical problems that can be solved with a specific answer. Do you want me to suggest a different math topic and subtopic for a numerical problem?",
    "message_2": "Yes, please suggest a different math topic and subtopic for a numerical problem."
