    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, both (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) result in the same set of ordered pairs. Therefore, they are equal. My apologies for the confusion in the original question, but the sets are indeed equal."
