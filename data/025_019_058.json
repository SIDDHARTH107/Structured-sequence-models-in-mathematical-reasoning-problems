    "message_1": "Let X be a Fano variety of dimension 3 with Picard number 1 and Picard group generated by an ample divisor D. Suppose that D^3=5. Find the degree of X.",
    "message_2": "The degree of a Fano variety X of dimension 3 can be defined as the intersection number of the ample divisor D with itself three times, i.e., the degree is given by D^3.\n\nIn this case, we are given that D^3 = 5. Therefore, the degree of the Fano variety X is 5."
