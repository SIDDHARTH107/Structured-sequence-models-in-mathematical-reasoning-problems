    "message_1": "Let $K$ be a knot in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with linking number $4$ with respect to another knot $J$. If we perform a Kirby move on $K$ by adding a $2$-handle to $S^3$ along a knot isotopic to $K$, what is the new linking number between $K$ and $J$?",
    "message_2": "Performing a Kirby move on $K$ by adding a $2$-handle to $S^3$ along a knot isotopic to $K$ will not change the linking number between $K$ and $J$. This is because the linking number is an invariant under ambient isotopy, and adding a $2$-handle along a knot isotopic to $K$ is an operation that can be realized through ambient isotopy.\n\nTherefore, the new linking number between $K$ and $J$ after the Kirby move is still $4$."
