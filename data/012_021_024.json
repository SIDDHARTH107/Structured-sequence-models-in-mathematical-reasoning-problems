    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of G, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A graph with n vertices and m edges has treewidth at most min(n-1, 2m/n).\n\n2. A graph with treewidth k has at most (k+1)n - (k(k+1)/2) edges.\n\nUsing fact 1, we can find an upper bound for the treewidth of G:\n\nmin(8-1, 2*10/8) = min(7, 2.5) = 2.5\n\nSince treewidth is an integer, we can round 2.5 down to 2. So, the treewidth of G is at most 2.\n\nNow, we need to check if there exists a graph with 8 vertices, 10 edges, and treewidth 2. Using fact 2, we can find the maximum number of edges for a graph with 8 vertices and treewidth 2:\n\n(3*8) - (2*3)/2 = 24 - 3 = 21\n\nSince 10 is less than 21, it is possible for a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges to have treewidth 2. One such example is a tree with 7 edges and 3 additional edges connecting non-adjacent vertices.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of G is 2."
