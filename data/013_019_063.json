    "message_1": "Two players are playing a game of Cheap Talk. The first player has to choose to send either a true message or a false message to the second player, who has to make a decision based on this message. For the first player, sending a true message costs $10, while sending a false message costs $5. The second player has to make a decision that will earn them either $20 or $0, depending on whether the first player's message was true or false. If the second player chooses to rely on the first player's message and makes the correct decision, they will earn $20, but if they rely on the message and make the wrong decision, they will earn $0. What should the first player do to maximize their expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their expected payoff, the first player should consider the potential outcomes of sending a true message or a false message.\n\nLet's denote the probability of the second player believing the message as p. If the first player sends a true message, their payoff will be:\n\nPayoff(True) = p * ($20 - $10) + (1 - p) * (-$10) = 10p - 10\n\nIf the first player sends a false message, their payoff will be:\n\nPayoff(False) = p * (-$5) + (1 - p) * ($20 - $5) = 15 - 20p\n\nTo maximize their expected payoff, the first player should choose the option with the highest payoff. Therefore, they should send a true message if:\n\n10p - 10 > 15 - 20p\n\n30p > 25\n\np > 5/6 â‰ˆ 0.83\n\nSo, if the probability of the second player believing the message is greater than 0.83, the first player should send a true message to maximize their expected payoff. Otherwise, they should send a false message."
