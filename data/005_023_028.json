    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the dataset in ascending order: {65, 75, 79, 82, 85, 85, 88, 90, 92, 96, 97, 98}\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2) of the dataset. Since there are 12 data points, the median is the average of the 6th and 7th values: (85 + 85) / 2 = 85.\n\nNow we need to find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3). \n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the dataset: {65, 75, 79, 82, 85, 85}. Since there are 6 data points, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values: (79 + 82) / 2 = 80.5.\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the dataset: {88, 90, 92, 96, 97, 98}. The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values: (92 + 96) / 2 = 94.\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 94 - 80.5 = 13.5.\n\nTo determine if there are any outliers, we calculate the lower and upper bounds:\n\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 80.5 - 1.5 * 13.5 = 60.75\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 94 + 1.5 * 13.5 = 114.25\n\nNow we check if there are any data points outside of these bounds. In this case, there are no data points below 60.75 or above 114.25, so there are no outliers in the dataset."
