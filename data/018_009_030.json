    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian products using the associative property, we first need to understand that the associative property states that for any sets A, B, and C, (A × B) × C = A × (B × C). \n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A × B) × {6}\n\nFirst, find A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, find (A × B) × {6}:\n(A × B) × {6} = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\n2.
