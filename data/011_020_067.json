    "message_1": "A company needs to assemble a team of 6 employees for a project. The company has 10 employees to choose from, but only 4 of them are qualified for the project. In how many ways can the company select a team if at least 2 qualified employees must be included?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We have 4 qualified employees and 6 non-qualified employees. We need to select a team of 6 employees with at least 2 qualified employees. We can break this down into 3 cases:\n\n1. Selecting exactly 2 qualified employees and 4 non-qualified employees.\n2. Selecting exactly 3 qualified employees and 3 non-qualified employees.\n3. Selecting all 4 qualified employees and 2 non-qualified employees.\n\nCase 1: Selecting 2 qualified employees and 4 non-qualified employees\nThere are C(4,2) ways to select 2 qualified employees from the 4 available, and C(6,4) ways to select 4 non-qualified employees from the 6 available. So, there are C(4,2) * C(6,4) ways to select the team in this case.\n\nCase 2: Selecting 3 qualified employees and 3 non-qualified employees\nThere are C(4,3) ways to select 3 qualified employees from the 4 available, and C(6,3) ways to select 3 non-qualified employees from the 6 available. So, there are C(4,3) * C(6,3) ways to select the team in this case.\n\nCase 3: Selecting all 4 qualified employees and 2 non-qualified employees\nThere is only C(4,4) = 1 way to select all 4 qualified employees, and C(6,2) ways to select 2 non-qualified employees from the 6 available. So, there are C(4,4) * C(6,2) ways to select the team in this case.\n\nNow, we add up the number of ways for each case to get the total number of ways to select the team:\n\nTotal ways = (C(4,2) * C(6,4)) + (C(4,3) * C(6,3)) + (C(4,4) * C(6,2))\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, C(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), we can compute the values:\n\nTotal ways = (C(4,2) * C(6,4)) + (C(4,3) * C(6,3)) + (C(4,4) * C(6,2))\nTotal ways = (6 * 15) + (4 * 20) + (1 * 15)\nTotal ways = 90 + 80 + 15\nTotal ways = 185\n\nSo, there are 185 ways for the company to select a team with at least 2 qualified employees."
