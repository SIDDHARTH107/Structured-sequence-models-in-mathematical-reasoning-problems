    "message_1": "Given set A = {1, 2} and set B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that the two products are not equal, therefore proving that the Cartesian product is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nGiven set A = {1, 2} and set B = {3, 4}, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are not the same. For example, (1, 3) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (3, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, A × B ≠ B × A, which proves that the Cartesian product is not commutative."
