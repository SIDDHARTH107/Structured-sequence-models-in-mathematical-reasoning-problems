    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. Geodesics on a sphere are segments of great circles.\n\nGiven a sphere with radius 3, centered at the origin (0,0,0), we have the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\nThe starting point is (2,1,0) and the ending point is (-1,4,2). First, we need to project these points onto the surface of the sphere. To do this, we can find the unit vectors from the origin to each point, and then multiply by the radius of the sphere.\n\nStarting point unit vector:\nMagnitude: sqrt(2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(5)\nUnit vector: (2/sqrt(5), 1/sqrt(5), 0)\n\nProjected starting point on the sphere:\n(2*3/sqrt(5), 1*3/sqrt(5), 0) ≈ (2.683, 1.341, 0)\n\nEnding point unit vector:\nMagnitude: sqrt((-1)^2 + 4^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(21)\nUnit vector: (-1/sqrt(21), 4/sqrt(21), 2/sqrt(21))\n\nProjected ending point on the sphere:\n(-1*3/sqrt(21), 4*3/sqrt(21), 2*3/sqrt(21)) ≈ (-0.654, 2.618, 1.309)\n\nNow we have the projected starting and ending points on the sphere: (2.683, 1.341, 0) and (-0.654, 2.618, 1.309).\n\nTo find the great circle containing these points, we can take the cross product of the position vectors of the two points, which will give us the normal vector of the plane containing the great circle.\n\nNormal vector = (2.683, 1.341, 0) x (-0.654, 2.618, 1.309) = (1.741, -3.482, 8.964)\n\nThe equation of the plane containing the great circle is:\n\n1.741x - 3.482y + 8.964z = 0\n\nNow we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9. To do this, we can substitute z from the plane equation into the sphere equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (1/8.964(1.741x - 3.482y))^2 = 9\n\nThis equation represents the geodesic on the surface of the sphere. To find the specific segment between the projected starting and ending points, we can parameterize the curve and find the limits of the parameter that correspond to the points.\n\nHowever, finding an explicit parameterization of this curve is quite complicated. In practice, one would typically use numerical methods to find the geodesic between the two points on the sphere."
