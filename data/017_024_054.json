    "message_1": "What is the total number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 96 and what are the essential differences between these groups and the cyclic group C96 and alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, if any?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find all possible group structures of order 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3. We will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of groups of each prime power order.\n\nFor the 2^5 part, we have the following possibilities for group structures:\n\n1. C_32 × C_2\n2. C_16 × C_4\n3. C_16 × C_2 × C_2\n4. C_8 × C_8\n5. C_8 × C_4 × C_2\n6. C_8 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n7. C_4 × C_4 × C_4\n8. C_4 × C_4 × C_2 × C_2\n9. C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n10. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\nFor the 3 part, we have only one possibility: C_3.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 96 by combining these structures. We can eliminate the abelian groups from the list above. Abelian groups are those where all the factors are cyclic groups of prime order. So, we can eliminate options 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10.\n\nThis leaves us with the following non-abelian group structures:\n\n1. C_8 × C_8\n2. C_8 × C_4 × C_2\n3. C_8 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n4. C_4 × C_4 × C_4\n5. C_4 × C_4 × C_2 × C_2\n6. C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n7. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\nNow, we need to combine these structures with the C_3 part. Since C_3 is of prime order, it will not affect the non-abelian property of the groups. So, we have 7 distinct non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nNow, let's compare these groups with the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nC96 is an abelian group, and all the groups we found above are non-abelian. So, the essential difference between these groups and C96 is that they are non-abelian, while C96 is abelian.\n\nA4 × C4 × C2 is also a non-abelian group of order 96. However, it has a different structure than the groups we found above. The essential difference between these groups and A4 × C4 × C2 is in their internal structure and properties, such as the number and order of their subgroups, the way their elements interact, and their isomorphism classes."
