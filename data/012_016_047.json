    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we will use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G) = T(G\\e) + T(G/e)\n\nwhere G\\e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nLet's start by choosing an edge to work with. We'll choose edge CD.\n\n1. Deleting edge CD (G\\e):\n\n```\n     A\n    / \\\n   B<---C\n   |    |\n   D    E\n    \\ /\n     F\n```\n\n2.

The Tutte polynomial for a disconnected graph is the product of the Tutte polynomials of its components. The first component is a triangle, and the second component is a cycle of length 3. The Tutte polynomial for a triangle is (x-1)(y-1) and for a cycle of length 3 is (x-1) + (y-1). Therefore, the Tutte polynomial for G\\e is:\n\nT(G\\e) = (x-1)(y-1) * [(x-1) + (y-1)]\n\nFor the graph G/e (with edge CD contracted), we have a graph with vertices A, B, C, D*, E, and F. The graph is still connected, so we need to choose another edge to apply the recursive formula. We'll choose edge BC.\n\n1. Deleting edge BC (G/e\\e):\n\n```\n     A\n    / \\\n   B    C\n   |    |\n   D*---E\n    \\ /\n     F\n```\n\n2. Contracting edge BC (G/e/e):\n\n```\n     A\n      \\\n       C\n       |\n      D*\n       |\n       F\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the Tutte polynomial for both of these new graphs.\n\nFor the graph G/e\\e (with edge BC deleted), we have a disconnected graph with two components: one with vertices A and B, and another with vertices C, D*, E, and F. The Tutte polynomial for a disconnected graph is the product of the Tutte polynomials of its components. The first component is a single edge, and the second component is a cycle of length 4. The Tutte polynomial for a single edge is x+y-xy and for a cycle of length 4 is (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2. Therefore, the Tutte polynomial for G/e\\e is:\n\nT(G/e\\e) = (x+y-xy) * [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2]\n\nFor the graph G/e/e (with edge BC contracted), we have a tree with vertices A, C, D*, and F. The Tutte polynomial for a tree is x^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 4, so the Tutte polynomial for G/e/e is:\n\nT(G/e/e) = x^3\n\nNow, we can use the recursive formula to find the Tutte polynomial for G/e:\n\nT(G/e) = T(G/e\\e) + T(G/e/e) = (x+y-xy) * [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2] + x^3\n\nFinally, we can find the Tutte polynomial for the original graph G:\n\nT(G) = T(G\\e) + T(G/e) = (x-1)(y-1) * [(x-1) + (y-1)] + (x+y-xy) * [(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2] + x^3"
