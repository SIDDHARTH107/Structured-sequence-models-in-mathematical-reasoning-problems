    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve process to a regular triangle. After each iteration, the perimeter of the Koch island increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nTo find the perimeter after four iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Original Perimeter × (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the original perimeter is 12 cm, and we want to find the perimeter after 4 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = 12 × (4/3)^4\nPerimeter = 12 × (256/81)\nPerimeter = 3072/81\nPerimeter ≈ 37.93 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after four iterations is approximately 37.93 cm."
