    "message_1": "Let G be a group of order 10. How many elements of order 5 does G have?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the number of elements of order 5 in the group G. Since G has order 10, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 5, and 10. \n\nWe know that there is exactly one element of order 1, which is the identity element. \n\nNow, let's consider the elements of order 5. If x is an element of order 5, then x^5 = e (the identity element), and x^k ≠ e for any k < 5. Furthermore, the elements x, x^2, x^3, and x^4 must all be distinct, since if x^i = x^j for some i ≠ j, then x^(i-j) = e, which contradicts the fact that x has order 5.\n\nTherefore, if x is an element of order 5, then the set {x, x^2, x^3, x^4} contains four distinct elements of order 5. Moreover, if y is another element of order 5 and y is not in this set, then the set {y, y^2, y^3, y^4} contains another four distinct elements of order 5. However, this is not possible, since G has only 10 elements in total, and we have already accounted for the identity element.\n\nThus, there can be only one set of the form {x, x^2, x^3, x^4} in G, and so there are exactly 4 elements of order 5 in G."
