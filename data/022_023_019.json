Assume that the initial displacement is given by a Gaussian function u(x,0) = exp(-x^2) and that the initial velocity is uniformly zero u_t(x,0) = 0. \n\nFind the solution u(x,t) to the wave equation that satisfies those initial conditions.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of d'Alembert's formula. The general solution to the wave equation can be written as:\n\nu(x,t) = f(x + ct) + g(x - ct)\n\nwhere f and g are arbitrary functions. We are given the initial conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = exp(-x^2)\nu_t(x,0) = 0\n\nLet's apply these initial conditions to the general solution:\n\nu(x,0) = f(x) + g(x) = exp(-x^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the time derivative of u(x,t):\n\nu_t(x,t) = cf'(x + ct) - cg'(x - ct)\n\nApplying the second initial condition:\n\n0 = cf'(x) - cg'(x)\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\nf(x) + g(x) = exp(-x^2)\ncf'(x) - cg'(x) = 0\n\nTo solve this system, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) + g'(x) = -2x * exp(-x^2)\n\nNow, we can multiply the second equation by c and add it to the first equation:\n\n2cf'(x) = -2x * exp(-x^2)\n\nf'(x) = (-x/c) * exp(-x^2)\n\nNow, we can integrate f'(x) with respect to x to find f(x):\n\nf(x) = ∫(-x/c) * exp(-x^2) dx\n\nLet's use the substitution method:\n\nLet y = -x^2\ndy = -2x dx\n\nf(x) = (-1/2c) ∫ exp(y) dy = (-1/2c) * exp(y) + C1 = (-1/2c) * exp(-x^2) + C1\n\nNow, we can find g(x) using the first equation:\n\ng(x) = exp(-x^2) - f(x) = exp(-x^2) - (-1/2c) * exp(-x^2) + C1 = (1 + 1/2c) * exp(-x^2) - C1\n\nNow, we can plug f(x) and g(x) back into the general solution:\n\nu(x,t) = f(x + ct) + g(x - ct) = (-1/2c) * exp(-(x + ct)^2) + C1 + (1 + 1/2c) * exp(-(x - ct)^2) - C1\n\nu(x,t) = (-1/2c) * exp(-(x + ct)^2) + (1 + 1/2c) * exp(-(x - ct)^2)\n\nThis is the solution to the wave equation with the given initial conditions."
