    "message_2": "To determine if the set X is compact, we need to check if it is both closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, let's check if X is bounded. Since X = {1/n | n is a positive integer}, we can see that the smallest element in X is 1 (when n = 1), and the largest element in X is 1/2 (when n = 2). All other elements in X are between 1/2 and 1. Therefore, X is bounded.\n\nNow, let's check if X is closed. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. The limit points of X are the points that can be approached arbitrarily closely by elements of X. In this case, the only limit point of X is 0, as for any Îµ > 0, there exists an integer n such that 1/n < Îµ. However, 0 is not an element of X, since X only contains elements of the form 1/n where n is a positive integer. Therefore, X is not closed.\n\nSince X is bounded but not closed, we can conclude that X is not compact."
