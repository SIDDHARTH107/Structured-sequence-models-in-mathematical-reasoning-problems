    "message_2": "To find the length of the adjacent side, we can use the cosine function in trigonometry. The cosine function relates the angle, the adjacent side, and the hypotenuse in a right triangle:\n\ncos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\nWe are given the angle (35 degrees) and the hypotenuse (10 cm). We can plug these values into the equation and solve for the adjacent side:\n\ncos(35) = adjacent side / 10\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 35 degrees. Make sure your calculator is in degree mode:\n\ncos(35) ≈ 0.8192\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\n0.8192 = adjacent side / 10\n\nTo solve for the adjacent side, multiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n\nadjacent side = 0.8192 * 10\n\nadjacent side ≈ 8.192 cm\n\nSo, the length of the adjacent side to the 35-degree angle is approximately 8.192 cm."
