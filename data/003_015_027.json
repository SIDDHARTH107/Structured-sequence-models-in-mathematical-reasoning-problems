    "message_1": "A student is given the trigonometric function f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4). Find the period and amplitude of this function.",
    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4).\n\nThe amplitude of a trigonometric function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine or cosine term. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nThe period of a trigonometric function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. For a sine or cosine function, the period is found by dividing the standard period (2π for sine and cosine) by the absolute value of the coefficient of the x term inside the sine or cosine. In this case, the coefficient of the x term is 2. So, the period is (2π)/|2| = 2π/2 = π.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function is 3 and the period is π."
