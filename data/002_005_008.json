    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of this rectangular prism? (Round off your answer to the nearest hundredth).",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nDiagonal = √(10² + 8² + 6²)\nDiagonal = √(100 + 64 + 36)\nDiagonal = √200\n\nRounding off to the nearest hundredth, the length of the diagonal is approximately 14.14 cm."
