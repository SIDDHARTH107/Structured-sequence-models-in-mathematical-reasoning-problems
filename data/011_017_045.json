    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid filled with the integers from 1 to 4 such that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. To count the number of different Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in any order, so there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to fill the first row. However, since we are only interested in the arrangement of the remaining rows, we can fix the first row as (1, 2, 3, 4) without loss of generality. This is because any Latin square can be transformed into another Latin square by permuting the symbols (i.e., replacing all 1s with 2s, all 2s with 3s, etc., in some order).\n\n2. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to fill the second row, as there are 3 remaining numbers for the first position, 2 remaining numbers for the second position, and 1 remaining number for the third position. The last position is determined by the Latin square property.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible ways to fill the first two positions, and the last two positions are determined by the Latin square property.\n\n4. The fourth row is completely determined by the Latin square property, as there is only one possible arrangement that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the total number of different Latin squares of order 4 is:\n\n1 (fixed first row) × 3! (second row) × 2 (third row) × 1 (fourth row) = 1 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 different Latin squares of order 4."
