    "message_2": "In set theory, a set B is considered a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A.\n\nThe empty set Ø is a set with no elements. By definition, there are no elements in Ø that are not in A, since there are no elements in Ø at all. Therefore, the empty set Ø is a subset of any set, including set A.\n\nSo, Ø ⊆ A, and the empty set is a subset of set A."
