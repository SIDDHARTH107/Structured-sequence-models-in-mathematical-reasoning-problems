    "message_2": "First, let's find (A ∩ B)'. Since A = {2, 4} and B = {1, 3}, there are no common elements between A and B. Therefore, A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set). The complement of the empty set, (A ∩ B)', is the universal set (denoted by U), which contains all elements under consideration.\n\nNow, let's find (A x B)' and A' x B'. The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A x B = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)}. The complement of A x B, (A x B)', contains all ordered pairs that are not in A x B.\n\nTo find A' x B', we first need to find the complements of A and B. Let's assume the universal set U contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4} for simplicity. Then, A' = {1, 3} and B' = {2, 4}. Now, we can find the Cartesian product A' x B' = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}.\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that (A x B)' and A' x B' are not equal. The complement of A x B, (A x B)', contains all ordered pairs that are not in A x B, while A' x B' contains the ordered pairs formed by the complements of A and B. These two sets are different, so (A x B)' is not equal to A' x B'."
