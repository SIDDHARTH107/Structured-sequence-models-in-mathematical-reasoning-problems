    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) + 4cos(5x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, our outer functions are 3sin(u) and 4cos(v), and our inner functions are u = 2x and v = 5x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the first term, 3sin(2x):\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(2x))/dx = 3 * d(sin(2x))/dx\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nd(sin(2x))/dx = cos(2x) * d(2x)/dx = cos(2x) * 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the first term is:\n\n3 * cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the second term, 4cos(5x):\n\ndy/dx = d(4cos(5x))/dx = 4 * d(cos(5x))/dx\n\nAgain, we apply the chain rule:\n\nd(cos(5x))/dx = -sin(5x) * d(5x)/dx = -sin(5x) * 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the second term is:\n\n4 * -sin(5x) * 5 = -20sin(5x)\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of both terms to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(2x) - 20sin(5x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6cos(2(π/4)) - 20sin(5(π/4))\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6cos(π/2) - 20sin(5π/4)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(5π/4) = -√2/2\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6(0) - 20(-√2/2)\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 10√2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) + 4cos(5x) at x = π/4 is 10√2."
