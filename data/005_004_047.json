He selects 5 apples from each brand and finds their weights in grams as follows:\nBrand A: 120, 121, 119, 122, 118\nBrand B: 130, 129, 130, 127, 131\nBrand C: 125, 124, 127, 126, 128\n\nUsing one-way ANOVA, determine if there is any significant difference between the mean weights of these brands of apples at a 5% significance level.",
    "message_2": "To perform a one-way ANOVA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean weight for each brand.\n2. Calculate the overall mean weight.\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB), Sum of Squares Within (SSW), and Total Sum of Squares (SST).\n4. Calculate the Mean Square Between (MSB) and Mean Square Within (MSW).\n5. Calculate the F-statistic.\n6. Determine the critical F-value from the F-distribution table.\n7. Compare the F-statistic with the critical F-value to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean weights.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean weight for each brand.\nBrand A: (120 + 121 + 119 + 122 + 118) / 5 = 600 / 5 = 120\nBrand B: (130 + 129 + 130 + 127 + 131) / 5 = 647 / 5 = 129.4\nBrand C: (125 + 124 + 127 + 126 + 128) / 5 = 630 / 5 = 126\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean weight.\nOverall mean = (600 + 647 + 630) / 15 = 1877 / 15 ≈ 125.13\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB), Sum of Squares Within (SSW), and Total Sum of Squares (SST).\nSSB = Σn_i (mean_i - overall_mean)^2\nSSB = 5(120 - 125.13)^2 + 5(129.4 - 125.13)^2 + 5(126 - 125.13)^2 ≈ 222.53\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_i)^2\nFor Brand A: Σ(x_ij - 120)^2 = (0)^2 + (1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (-2)^2 = 10\nFor Brand B: Σ(x_ij - 129.4)^2 = (0.6)^2 + (-0.4)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (-2.4)^2 + (1.6)^2 ≈ 9.8\nFor Brand C: Σ(x_ij - 126)^2 = (-1)^2 + (-2)^2 + (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (2)^2 = 10\nSSW = 10 + 9.8 + 10 = 29.8\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 222.53 + 29.8 = 252.33\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Mean Square Between (MSB) and Mean Square Within (MSW).\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1) = 222.53 / (3 - 1) = 111.27\nMSW = SSW / (N - k) = 29.8 / (15 - 3) = 29.8 / 12 ≈ 2.48\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic.\nF = MSB / MSW = 111.27 / 2.48 ≈ 44.87\n\nStep 6: Determine the critical F-value from the F-distribution table.\nAt a 5% significance level, with degrees of freedom between (k - 1) = 2 and degrees of freedom within (N - k) = 12, the critical F-value is approximately 3.89.\n\nStep 7: Compare the F-statistic with the critical F-value.\nSince the F-statistic (44.87) is greater than the critical F-value (3.89), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between the mean weights of these brands of apples at a 5% significance level."
