    "message_2": "To solve this non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we will use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  7 ]\n[ 3  2  2 | 15 ]\n[ 2 -1  1 |  1 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 2, 3 times Row 1 from Row 3, and 2 times Row 1 from Row 4:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -5 ]\n[ 0 -1 -1 | -3 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -11 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide Row 2 by -3:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 5/3 ]\n[ 0 -1 -1 | -3 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -11 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Add Row 2 to Row 3 and 3 times Row 2 to Row 4:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   1  |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 5/3 ]\n[ 0  0 -4/3 | -4/3 ]\n[ 0  0   0  |  0 ]\n```\n\nSince we have a row of zeros in the last row, we can ignore it and focus on the first three rows. Now, we will perform back-substitution to find the solutions for x, y, and z.\n\nStep 4: Multiply Row 3 by -3/4:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   1  |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 5/3 ]\n[ 0  0   1  |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Add 1/3 times Row 3 to Row 2 and subtract Row 3 from Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  0 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Subtract Row 2 from Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 |  3 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  1 ]\n```\n\nThe matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form, and we can read the solutions directly:\n\nx = 3\ny = 2\nz = 1"
