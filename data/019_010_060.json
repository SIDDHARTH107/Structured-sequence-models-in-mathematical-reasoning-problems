    "message_2": "In linear logic, the \"of course\" connective !A represents an unlimited supply of resources of type A. The linear implication A → B means that if we have a resource of type A, we can transform it into a resource of type B.\n\nTo find a formula B such that !A → B is true in linear logic, we can consider the following:\n\nSince !A represents an unlimited supply of resources of type A, we can always use one of these resources to create a resource of type A. In other words, if we have !A, we can always obtain A. Therefore, we can choose B = A, and the formula !A → A will be true in linear logic.\n\nIn summary, the formula B = A satisfies the condition !A → B in linear logic."
