    "message_1": "A company hires a new salesperson with a base salary of $50,000 per year, and also offers her a commission on sales made during the year. The commission is calculated as follows:\n\n- On sales up to $100,000, the salesperson gets a commission rate of 5%\n- On sales above $100,000, the salesperson gets a commission rate of 10%\n\nHowever, there is a moral hazard problem: the salesperson is not monitored very closely and there is a risk that she will shirk her duties and not work very hard to make sales.\n\nSuppose that the salesperson's effort level is a binary choice: either she works hard (H) or she shirks (S). If she works hard, she has a 60% chance of making sales of $150,000 and a 40% chance of making sales of $70,000. If she shirks, she has a 50% chance of making sales of $50,000 and a 50% chance of making no sales at all.\n\nAssuming that the salesperson is risk-neutral, what level of commission will induce the salesperson to work hard? What commission level will induce the salesperson to shirk?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected sales and commission for each effort level.\n\nIf the salesperson works hard (H):\n- 60% chance of making sales of $150,000\n- 40% chance of making sales of $70,000\n\nExpected sales when working hard (H) = 0.6 * $150,000 + 0.4 * $70,000 = $90,000 + $28,000 = $118,000\n\nIf the salesperson shirks (S):\n- 50% chance of making sales of $50,000\n- 50% chance of making no sales at all\n\nExpected sales when shirking (S) = 0.5 * $50,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $25,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected commission for each effort level. Let x be the commission rate up to $100,000 and y be the commission rate above $100,000.\n\nExpected commission when working hard (H):\n- On the first $100,000: x * $100,000\n- On the remaining $18,000: y * $18,000\n\nExpected commission when shirking (S): x * $25,000\n\nTo induce the salesperson to work hard, her expected income when working hard must be greater than her expected income when shirking. That is:\n\nBase salary + Expected commission when working hard (H) > Base salary + Expected commission when shirking (S)\n\n$50,000 + (x * $100,000) + (y * $18,000) > $50,000 + (x * $25,000)\n\nNow, we can simplify the inequality:\n\n(x * $100,000) + (y * $18,000) > (x * $25,000)\n\nTo induce the salesperson to shirk, her expected income when shirking must be greater than her expected income when working hard:\n\n$50,000 + (x * $25,000) > $50,000 + (x * $100,000) + (y * $18,000)\n\nNow, we can simplify the inequality:\n\n(x * $25,000) > (x * $100,000) + (y * $18,000)\n\nGiven the commission structure (5% on sales up to $100,000 and 10% on sales above $100,000), we have x = 0.05 and y = 0.1. Plugging these values into the inequalities:\n\n(0.05 * $100,000) + (0.1 * $18,000) > (0.05 * $25,000)\n$5,000 + $1,800 > $1,250\n$6,800 > $1,250\n\n(0.05 * $25,000) > (0.05 * $100,000) + (0.1 * $18,000)\n$1,250 > $5,000 + $1,800\n$1,250 > $6,800\n\nThe first inequality is true, meaning that the current commission structure (5% on sales up to $100,000 and 10% on sales above $100,000) will induce the salesperson to work hard. The second inequality is false, meaning that the current commission structure will not induce the salesperson to shirk."
