    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve E over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible x values in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ (i.e., 0 to 6).\n2. For each x value, compute the right-hand side of the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$.\n3. Check if the result is a quadratic residue in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. If it is, there are two corresponding y values, and if it is not, there are no corresponding y values.\n4. Count the total number of points found in step 3.\n5. Add 1 to the total count to account for the point at infinity.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. The possible x values in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n2. Compute the right-hand side of the equation for each x value:\n\n   - For x = 0: $y^2 = 0^3 + 2(0) + 1 = 1$\n   - For x = 1: $y^2 = 1^3 + 2(1) + 1 = 4$\n   - For x = 2: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2(2) + 1 = 13 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$\n   - For x = 3: $y^2 = 3^3 + 2(3) + 1 = 34 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$\n   - For x = 4: $y^2 = 4^3 + 2(4) + 1 = 73 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n   - For x = 5: $y^2 = 5^3 + 2(5) + 1 = 132 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n   - For x = 6: $y^2 = 6^3 + 2(6) + 1 = 223 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\n3. Check if the results are quadratic residues in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$:\n\n   - 1 is a quadratic residue (1 and 6 are its square roots).\n   - 4 is a quadratic residue (2 and 5 are its square roots).\n   - 6 is not a quadratic residue.\n   - 3 is not a quadratic residue.\n\n4. Count the total number of points found:\n\n   - For x = 0, there are 2 points (0, 1) and (0, 6).\n   - For x = 1, there are 2 points (1, 2) and (1, 5).\n   - For x = 2, there are 0 points.\n   - For x = 3, there are 0 points.\n   - For x = 4, there are 0 points.\n   - For x = 5, there are 2 points (5, 2) and (5, 5).\n   - For x = 6, there are 2 points (6, 1) and (6, 6).\n\n   So, there are a total of 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 8 points on E.\n\n5. Add 1 to the total count to account for the point at infinity:\n\n   The final count is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 points on the elliptic curve E over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$."
