    "message_2": "Case 1: There exists an element of order 6 in G.\n\nLet g be an element of order 6 in G. Then, the subgroup generated by g, denoted by <g>, has order 6. Since the order of <g> is equal to the order of G, it follows that <g> = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group generated by g, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: There is no element of order 6 in G.\n\nSince G has order 6, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 in G. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3 in G. Then, we have:\n\na^2 = e\nb^3 = e\n\nwhere e is the identity element in G.\n\nNow, consider the element ab. Since a and b have different orders, they cannot commute, i.e., ab ≠ ba. We will show that (ab)^2 = e. Observe that:\n\n(ab)^2 = abab\n\nWe want to show that abab = e. Since a^2 = e, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nabab = aea\nabab = a(ba)a\n\nNow, we know that ab ≠ ba, so let's denote the product ba as c. Then, we have:\n\nabab = aca\n\nSince a has order 2, we can multiply both sides by a on the right:\n\nababa = acaa\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nabab = ac\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by b on the right:\n\nababb = acb\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nabab = acb\n\nSince b has order 3, we can multiply both sides by b on the left:\n\nbabab = bcb\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nabab = bcb\n\nNow, we have shown that (ab)^2 = e, and we have the following relations:\n\na^2 = e\nb^3 = e\n(ab)^2 = e\n\nThese relations are exactly the same as the relations in the dihedral group D3. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3."
