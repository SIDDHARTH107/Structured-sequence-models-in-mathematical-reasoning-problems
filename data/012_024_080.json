    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the formula for the genus of a graph.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nThe formula for the genus g of a graph is:\n\nE <= 3V + 6g - 6\n\nIn our case, we have V = 7 and E = 10. Let's first check if the graph is planar.\n\nIf the graph is planar, then we can find F using Euler's formula:\n\nF = 2 - V + E = 2 - 7 + 10 = 5\n\nNow, let's check if the graph satisfies the inequality for the genus:\n\n10 <= 3 * 7 + 6g - 6\n\n10 <= 21 + 6g - 6\n\n-5 <= 6g\n\ng >= 5/6\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, the smallest possible genus for this graph is g = 1. Therefore, the genus of the graph is 1."
