    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, we simply multiply the side length by the number of sides. In this case, the polygon has 8 sides and a side length of 6 cm.\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Side length)\nPerimeter = 8 × 6 cm\nPerimeter = 48 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular polygon is 48 cm."
