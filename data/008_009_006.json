    "message_2": "To find the determinant of matrix A using the cofactor expansion method, we will expand along the first row. The determinant of A can be calculated as follows:\n\ndet(A) = a11 * C11 - a12 * C12 + a13 * C13\n\nwhere a11, a12, and a13 are the elements of the first row, and C11, C12, and C13 are their respective cofactors.\n\nFirst, let's find the cofactors:\n\nC11 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing the first row and first column:\nC11 = det(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}) = (0*2) - (6*1) = -6\n\nC12 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing the first row and second column:\nC12 = det(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 6 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}) = (1*2) - (6*3) = 2 - 18 = -16\n\nC13 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing the first row and third column:\nC13 = det(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}) = (1*1) - (0*3) = 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2 * (-6) - 4 * (-16) + 5 * (1) = -12 + 64 + 5 = 52 + 5 = 57\n\nSo, the determinant of matrix A is 57."
