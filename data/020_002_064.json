    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Nonlinear programming:\n\nA manufacturing company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The production of each product requires machine hours: 3 for Product A and 4 for Product B. The company has a total of 240 machine hours available for production. The profit for each unit of Product A and Product B is $8 and $10, respectively. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?\n\nCan you please solve the problem and provide the optimal solution for the student?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized): P = 8x + 10y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Machine hours: 3x + 4y ≤ 240\n2. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 240\nDivide by 3: x + (4/3)y ≤ 80\ny = (240 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x-axis (y=0) and the constraint line:\ny = 0, x = 80\n\n2. Intersection of y-axis (x=0) and the constraint line:\nx = 0, y = 60\n\n3. Intersection of x-axis and y-axis:\nx = 0, y = 0\n\nNow we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(80, 0) = 8(80) + 10(0) = 640\n2. P(0, 60) = 8(0) + 10(60) = 600\n3. P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = 0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (80, 0), with a profit of $640. Therefore, the company should produce 80 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize its profit."
