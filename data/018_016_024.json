    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) ∪ (B x A) and (B x A) ∪ (A x B) are equal. However, this does not mean that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. The Cartesian product itself is not commutative, as A x B ≠ B x A. The union operation is commutative, which is why the result of the union of the two Cartesian products is the same regardless of the order.\n\nTo further clarify, let's consider the definition of commutativity:\n\nAn operation * is commutative if for all elements a and b, a * b = b * a.\n\nIn this case, the operation * is the Cartesian product, and the elements are sets A and B. Since A x B ≠ B x A, the Cartesian product is not commutative.\n\nThe union operation is commutative, which is why (A x B) ∪ (B x A) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B). However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product itself is commutative with respect to union."
