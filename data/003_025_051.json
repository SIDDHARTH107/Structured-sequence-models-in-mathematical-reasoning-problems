    "message_1": "A student is standing at point A with coordinates (3, 4) on a coordinate plane. He wants to walk to point B with coordinates (-5, -12). Calculate the magnitude and direction of the vector AB using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the vector AB, we need to subtract the coordinates of point A from the coordinates of point B:\n\nAB = (Bx - Ax, By - Ay) = (-5 - 3, -12 - 4) = (-8, -16)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the vector AB using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|AB| = √((-8)^2 + (-16)^2) = √(64 + 256) = √320 ≈ 17.89\n\nNext, we need to find the direction of the vector AB. We can use the arctangent function (tan^(-1)) to find the angle θ between the vector and the positive x-axis:\n\nθ = tan^(-1)(y/x) = tan^(-1)(-16/-8) = tan^(-1)(2)\n\nθ ≈ 63.43°\n\nSince the vector is in the third quadrant, we need to add 180° to the angle:\n\nθ = 63.43° + 180° = 243.43°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the vector AB is approximately 17.89 units, and its direction is approximately 243.43° counterclockwise from the positive x-axis."
