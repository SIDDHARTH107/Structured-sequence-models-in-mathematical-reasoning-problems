    "message_2": "First, let's represent the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 3 -6 | -15]\n[ 2 -4 |  9 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[ 3 -6 | -15]\n[ 1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 2 -4 |  9 ]\n```\n\n2. Divide Row 1 by 3 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2 | -5 ]\n[ 1  2 |  5 ]\n[ 2 -4 |  9 ]\n```\n\n3. Subtract Row 1 from Row 2 and Row 3 to eliminate the leading coefficients in the second and third rows:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2 | -5 ]\n[ 0  4 | 10 ]\n[ 0  0 | 19 ]\n```\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by 4 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2 | -5 ]\n[ 0  1 |  2.5]\n[ 0  0 | 19 ]\n```\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of the matrix. We can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y = 19, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the system of linear equations has no solution."
