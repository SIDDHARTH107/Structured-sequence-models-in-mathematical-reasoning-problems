    "message_1": "Suppose the first stage of the Sierpinski sieve has an equilateral triangle with side length 1. How long are the sides of the equilateral triangles in the second and third stages?",
    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski sieve, each equilateral triangle is divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, with the middle one being removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller triangles.\n\nFor the second stage, the side length of the equilateral triangles will be half of the original side length, since each side is divided into two equal parts. So, the side length of the triangles in the second stage will be 1/2.\n\nFor the third stage, the side length of the equilateral triangles will be half of the side length in the second stage. So, the side length of the triangles in the third stage will be (1/2) / 2 = 1/4."
