    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle between the two forces as θ. We can use the cosine rule to find the angle θ. The cosine rule states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle θ opposite side c:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(θ)\n\nIn this problem, the two forces 4 N and 6 N can be considered as the sides a and b, and the resultant force 8 N can be considered as side c. Plugging these values into the cosine rule, we get:\n\n8^2 = 4^2 + 6^2 - 2 * 4 * 6 * cos(θ)\n\n64 = 16 + 36 - 48 * cos(θ)\n\n64 = 52 - 48 * cos(θ)\n\n12 = 48 * cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 12 / 48\n\ncos(θ) = 1/4\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 1/4:\n\nθ = arccos(1/4)\n\nθ ≈ 75.52°\n\nSo, the angle between the two forces is approximately 75.52°."
