    "message_2": "To find the approximate value of the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 1 at x=2 using the forward difference method with a step size of 0.1, we will use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h is the step size (0.1 in this case) and x is the point at which we want to find the derivative (x=2).\n\nFirst, let's find f(2) and f(2 + 0.1):\n\nf(2) = (2^3) - 2(2^2) + 1 = 8 - 8 + 1 = 1\nf(2 + 0.1) = ((2 + 0.1)^3) - 2((2 + 0.1)^2) + 1 ≈ 7.261\n\nNow, we can find the approximate value of the derivative:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1 ≈ (7.261 - 1) / 0.1 ≈ 6.261 / 0.1 = 62.61\n\nNow, let's estimate the error using the formula for the truncation error. The truncation error is given by:\n\nError ≈ (M * h) / 2\n\nwhere M is the maximum value of the second derivative of f(x) in the interval [x, x+h]. First, let's find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x\nf''(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of f''(x) in the interval [2, 2 + 0.1]. Since f''(x) is a linear function, the maximum value will occur at the endpoint x = 2 + 0.1:\n\nM = f''(2 + 0.1) = 6(2 + 0.1) - 4 ≈ 8.6\n\nNow, we can estimate the error:\n\nError ≈ (8.6 * 0.1) / 2 ≈ 0.43\n\nSo, the approximate value of the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 1 at x=2 using the forward difference method with a step size of 0.1 is 62.61, and the estimated error is 0.43."
