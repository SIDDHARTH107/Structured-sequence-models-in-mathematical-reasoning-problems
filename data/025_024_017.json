Here's an example problem:\n\nConsider the projective plane curve defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. Let $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ act on this curve by permuting the coordinates $x$, $y$, $z$. Find the number of fixed points of this action on the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the fixed points of the action of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ on the projective plane curve defined by $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$, we need to find the points on the curve that are invariant under the action of $G$. The action of $G$ on the curve is given by permuting the coordinates $x$, $y$, $z$. Since $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, the only non-trivial element of $G$ is $1$, which acts by swapping $x$ and $y$.\n\nLet $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ be a fixed point of the action. Then, applying the action of $1 \\in G$ to this point, we have:\n\n$(x_0, y_0, z_0) \\mapsto (y_0, x_0, z_0)$\n\nSince $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a fixed point, we must have $(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (y_0, x_0, z_0)$. This implies that $x_0 = y_0$ and $y_0 = x_0$. Therefore, we have $x_0 = y_0$.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the equation of the curve:\n\n$x_0^4 + y_0^4 + z_0^4 = 0$\n\nSince $x_0 = y_0$, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$2x_0^4 + z_0^4 = 0$\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\n1. $x_0 \\neq 0$: In this case, we can divide both sides of the equation by $2x_0^4$ to get:\n\n$1 + \\left(\\frac{z_0}{x_0}\\right)^4 = 0$\n\nThis has no solutions, as the sum of two non-negative numbers cannot be equal to zero.\n\n2. $x_0 = 0$: In this case, the equation of the curve becomes:\n\n$z_0^4 = 0$\n\nThis implies that $z_0 = 0$. However, in projective space, we cannot have all coordinates equal to zero, so this case is not valid.\n\nTherefore, there are no fixed points of the action of $G$ on the projective plane curve defined by $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$."
