Determine the temperature distribution along the rod after 20 seconds if the heat transfer coefficient between the rod and the oil is 50 W/m²K. Use Fourier transform method to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Fourier transform method, we need to first set up the heat equation and boundary conditions for the given problem. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution along the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, and x and t are the position along the rod and time, respectively.\n\nThe boundary conditions for this problem are:\n\n1. At x = 0 and x = L (L = 0.1 m), the heat transfer between the rod and the oil is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n\n- k ∂T(x,t)/∂x = h [T(x,t) - T_oil]\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of the material, h is the heat transfer coefficient (50 W/m²K), and T_oil is the temperature of the oil (20°C).\n\n2. At t = 0, the initial temperature of the rod is given by:\n\nT(x,0) = T_initial = 100°C\n\nNow, we can solve the heat equation using the Fourier transform method. First, we apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation:\n\n∂T(k,t)/∂t = -αk²T(k,t)\n\nwhere T(k,t) is the Fourier transform of T(x,t) and k is the wave number.\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation in time, which can be solved by separation of variables:\n\ndT(k,t)/dt = -αk²T(k,t)\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to time, we get:\n\nT(k,t) = T(k,0) * exp(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution, T(k,0). Since the initial temperature is constant (100°C), the Fourier transform is given by:\n\nT(k,0) = 100 * δ(k)\n\nwhere δ(k) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for T(k,t), we get:\n\nT(k,t) = 100 * δ(k) * exp(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫[100 * δ(k) * exp(-αk²t) * exp(ikx)] dk\n\nSince the integral of the Dirac delta function is 1 when the argument is 0 and 0 otherwise, the integral simplifies to:\n\nT(x,t) = 100 * exp(-αk²t)\n\nHowever, this is an infinite rod solution, and we need to account for the boundary conditions. To do this, we can use the method of images:\n\nT(x,t) = 100 * Σ[(-1)^n * exp(-α(2nL + (-1)^n x)²t)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integer values of n.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for L (0.1 m), α (which can be found from the material properties of steel), and t (20 seconds) to find the temperature distribution T(x,t) along the rod. Note that the exact value of α depends on the specific type of steel, but a typical value is around 1.2 x 10^-5 m²/s.\n\nKeep in mind that this solution assumes an infinite series, so you may need to truncate the series at a certain number of terms to get a practical numerical solution."
