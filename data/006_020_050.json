    "message_1": "In a certain community, there are 1000 adults. Among them, 300 are smokers and 700 are non-smokers. If a person is randomly selected from the community, what is the probability that the person is a smoker?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a person is a smoker, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of smokers (300) and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of adults (1000).\n\nProbability = 300 / 1000\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 3 / 10\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person from the community is a smoker is 3/10 or 0.3 or 30%."
