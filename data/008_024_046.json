    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. So, we can eliminate one of the variables by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(2x + 4y) - (x + 2y) = 10 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + 2y = 5\n\nNow we can see that the two equations are actually the same, which means they represent the same line. In this case, there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line satisfies both equations. To express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (5 - x) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions are all the points (x, y) where y = (5 - x) / 2."
