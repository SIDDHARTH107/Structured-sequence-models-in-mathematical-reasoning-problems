    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the response of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we can use the formula for the amplitude of a forced oscillator:\n\nA = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\n\nwhere:\nA is the amplitude of the oscillator\nF0 is the forcing amplitude (2)\nk is the spring constant (mω_n^2, where m is the mass and ω_n is the natural frequency)\nm is the mass of the oscillator (we can assume m = 1 for simplicity)\nω_n is the natural frequency (3 rad/sec)\nc is the damping coefficient (0.1)\nω is the forcing frequency (2.5 rad/sec)\n\nFirst, we need to find the spring constant k:\n\nk = mω_n^2 = 1 * (3)^2 = 9\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the amplitude formula:\n\nA = 2 / sqrt((9 - 1 * (2.5)^2)^2 + (0.1 * 2.5)^2)\nA = 2 / sqrt((9 - 6.25)^2 + (0.25)^2)\nA = 2 / sqrt((2.75)^2 + (0.25)^2)\nA = 2 / sqrt(7.5625 + 0.0625)\nA = 2 / sqrt(7.625)\nA = 2 / 2.76\n\nA ≈ 0.725\n\nThe maximum amplitude of the response of the forced van der Pol oscillator is approximately 0.725."
