    "message_2": "1. To show the existence of the variety $Y$, we will use the deformation theory. Let $E$ be a vector bundle in $M_C(2)$. Consider the tangent space $T_E M_C(2)$ of the moduli space at the point $E$. By deformation theory, we have an isomorphism $T_E M_C(2) \\cong Ext^1(E, E)$. Since $E$ is a rank 2 vector bundle, we have $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} Ext^1(E, E) = 4g - 4 = 8$. \n\nNow, let $Y$ be the total space of the projectivized tangent bundle $\\mathbb{P}(T M_C(2))$. Then, $Y$ is a smooth projective variety, and its dimension is $\\dim Y = \\dim M_C(2) + 1 = 9$. The points of $Y$ correspond to pairs $(E, s)$, where $E$ is a vector bundle in $M_C(2)$ and $s \\in \\mathbb{P}(Ext^1(E, E))$ is a non-zero extension of $E$ with itself. Since $M_C(2)$ is irreducible, it follows that $Y$ is also irreducible.\n\n2. To compute the Picard group of $Y$, we will use the Leray spectral sequence for the projection map $\\pi: Y \\to M_C(2)$. We have $R^i \\pi_* \\mathcal{O}_Y = 0$ for $i > 0$, since $Y$ is the projectivization of a vector bundle over $M_C(2)$. Therefore, the Leray spectral sequence degenerates, and we get an isomorphism $H^2(Y, \\mathcal{O}_Y) \\cong H^2(M_C(2), \\pi_* \\mathcal{O}_Y)$. \n\nNow, we have an exact sequence of sheaves on $M_C(2)$:\n$$0 \\to \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)} \\to \\pi_* \\mathcal{O}_Y \\to \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1) \\to 0,$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1)$ is the ample generator of the Picard group of $M_C(2)$. Taking cohomology, we get a long exact sequence:\n$$0 \\to H^0(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}) \\to H^0(M_C(2), \\pi_* \\mathcal{O}_Y) \\to H^0(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1)) \\to H^1(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nSince $M_C(2)$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension 4, we have $H^1(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}) = 0$. Therefore, we get an isomorphism $H^2(Y, \\mathcal{O}_Y) \\cong H^0(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1))$. By the exponential sequence, we have $H^2(Y, \\mathcal{O}_Y) \\cong Pic(Y)$. Thus, we obtain an isomorphism $Pic(Y) \\cong H^0(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1))$. \n\nSince $\\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1)$ is an ample line bundle on $M_C(2)$, we have $H^0(M_C(2), \\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1)) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, we get $Pic(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the pullback of $\\mathcal{O}_{M_C(2)}(1)$ to $Y$."
