    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^2, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), can be found using the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^4)/dx - d(5x^2)/dx\nf'(x) = 4 * 3x^3 - 2 * 5x\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 10x\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d(12x^3)/dx - d(10x)/dx\nf''(x) = 3 * 12x^2 - 10\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 10\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 10\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 10\nf''(2) = 144 - 10\nf''(2) = 134\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^2 at x = 2 is 134."
