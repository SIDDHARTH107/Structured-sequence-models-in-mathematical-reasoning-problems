Consider the following fuzzy set, \"Cheap\", defined as having a membership function of:\n\nμ(x) = 1/2 − 1/2t, 0 ≤ x ≤ t\n\nwhere t is the absolute price of the item. If the original price of the item is $50, what is the degree of membership for the item in the fuzzy set \"Cheap\" after the sale?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the price of the item after the 20% discount. The original price is $50, so the discount is:\n\n20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10\n\nNow, subtract the discount from the original price to find the new price:\n\n$50 - $10 = $40\n\nNow that we have the new price, we can find the degree of membership for the item in the fuzzy set \"Cheap\" using the given membership function:\n\nμ(x) = 1/2 - 1/2t\n\nIn this case, x is the new price ($40) and t is the original price ($50). Plug these values into the membership function:\n\nμ(40) = 1/2 - 1/2(50)\n\nμ(40) = 1/2 - 1/100\n\nμ(40) = 50/100 - 1/100\n\nμ(40) = 49/100\n\nSo, the degree of membership for the item in the fuzzy set \"Cheap\" after the sale is 49/100 or 0.49."
