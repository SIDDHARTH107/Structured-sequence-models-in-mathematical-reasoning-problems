    "message_1": "Suppose you have a Feistel cipher structure where the block size is 64 bits, the key size is 128 bits, the number of rounds is 16, and the round function uses a substitution box (S-box) of size 8 bits. If you are given a plaintext block of 64 bits and a key of 128 bits, what would be the size of the resulting ciphertext block after the Feistel cipher encryption algorithm is applied?",
    "message_2": "The size of the resulting ciphertext block after the Feistel cipher encryption algorithm is applied would still be 64 bits. In a Feistel cipher, the block size remains the same throughout the encryption process, regardless of the key size, number of rounds, or the size of the S-box used in the round function."
