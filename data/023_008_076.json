    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for a non-periodic function, we first need to make it periodic by extending it to a piecewise function over the interval [-1, 1]. Let's define the function g(x) as follows:\n\ng(x) = f(x) for -1 <= x < 1\ng(x + 2) = g(x) for all x\n\nNow, g(x) is a periodic function with period 2. We can find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n for g(x) using the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[g(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[g(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\n\nwhere L is half the period of g(x), which is 1 in this case.\n\nFor a_n:\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 4) * cos(n * π * x) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nFor b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 4) * sin(n * π * x) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we need to solve these integrals to find the coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nFor a_n:\n\na_0 = ∫(x^2 - 3x + 4) dx from -1 to 1\na_0 = [(1/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + 4x] from -1 to 1\na_0 = (1/3 - 3/2 + 4) - (-1/3 - 3/2 - 4)\na_0 = 2\n\nFor n > 0:\n\na_n = ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 4) * cos(n * π * x) dx] from -1 to 1\na_n = (1/(n^2 * π^2)) * [2x * cos(n * π * x) + (3 - n^2 * π^2) * sin(n * π * x)] from -1 to 1\na_n = (1/(n^2 * π^2)) * [2 - 2 * cos(n * π) + (3 - n^2 * π^2) * (sin(n * π) - sin(-n * π))]\na_n = (1/(n^2 * π^2)) * [2 - 2 * cos(n * π)] (since sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer n)\n\nFor b_n:\n\nb_n = ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 4) * sin(n * π * x) dx] from -1 to 1\nb_n = (1/(n * π)) * [(2 - n^2 * π^2 * x) * cos(n * π * x) + 3n * π * sin(n * π * x)] from -1 to 1\nb_n = (1/(n * π)) * [(2 - n^2 * π^2) * (cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π)) + 3n * π * (sin(n * π) - sin(-n * π))]\nb_n = 0 (since cos(n * π) = cos(-n * π) and sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer n)\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for the function g(x) are:\n\na_n = (1/(n^2 * π^2)) * [2 - 2 * cos(n * π)] for n > 0\na_0 = 2\nb_n = 0 for all n\n\nNote that these coefficients are for the periodic extension g(x) of the original function f(x)."
