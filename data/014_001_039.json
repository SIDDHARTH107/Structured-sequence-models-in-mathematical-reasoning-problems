    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext c and decrypt the message using the private key d, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Compute the private key d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n4. Encrypt the message m using the public key (n, e) to get the ciphertext c: c ≡ m^e (mod n)\n5. Decrypt the ciphertext c using the private key d to get the original message m: m ≡ c^d (mod n)\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. n = p * q = 11 * 17 = 187\n2. φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (11-1) * (17-1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n3. To find d, we need to solve the equation d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)). In our case, e = 7 and φ(n) = 160. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of e:\n\n   d * 7 ≡ 1 (mod 160)\n   d = 23 (mod 160)\n\n4. Encrypt the message m using the public key (n, e): c ≡ m^e (mod n)\n   c ≡ 3^7 (mod 187)\n   c ≡ 2187 (mod 187)\n   c = 106\n\n5. Decrypt the ciphertext c using the private key d: m ≡ c^d (mod n)\n   m ≡ 106^23 (mod 187)\n   m ≡ 3 (mod 187)\n\nThe ciphertext c is 106, and the decrypted message m is 3, which is the original message."
