    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, 5 people affected by the disease)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 1000 individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 5 people affected)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence rate of 2% or 0.02)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 5) = (1000 choose 5) * 0.02^5 * (1-0.02)^(1000-5)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (1000 choose 5):\n\n(1000 choose 5) = 1000! / (5!(1000-5)!)\n= 1000! / (5! * 995!)\n= (1000 * 999 * 998 * 997 * 996) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 8,250,291,250\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = 8,250,291,250 * 0.02^5 * 0.98^995\n= 8,250,291,250 * 3.2e-7 * 0.98^995\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X = 5) â‰ˆ 0.0013\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 5 people are affected by the disease in this demographic group of 1000 individuals is approximately 0.0013 or 0.13%."
