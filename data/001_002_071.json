    "message_2": "To find the slope (m) of the line passing through the points (4, 2) and (-2, 8), we can use the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (4, 2) and (x2, y2) = (-2, 8).\n\nm = (8 - 2) / (-2 - 4)\nm = (6) / (-6)\nm = -1\n\nSo, the slope of the line is -1.\n\nNow, to find the y-intercept (b), we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope (m = -1) and one of the points (x1, y1) = (4, 2):\n\ny - 2 = -1(x - 4)\n\nNow, we can solve for y when x = 0 to find the y-intercept:\n\ny - 2 = -1(0 - 4)\ny - 2 = 4\ny = 6\n\nSo, the y-intercept is 6.\n\nThus, the slope of the line is -1 and the y-intercept is 6."
