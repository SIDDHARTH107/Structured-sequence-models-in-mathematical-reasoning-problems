    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nThis is the same as the first equation. Since both equations are the same, they represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of equations, as every point on the line satisfies both equations.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x (or vice versa) from one of the equations. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\n3y = 8 - 2x\n\ny = (8 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we have y in terms of x, and any value of x will give us a corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations."
