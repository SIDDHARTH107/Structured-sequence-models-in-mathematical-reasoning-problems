    "message_2": "To prove that $f$ is smooth, we need to show that all its derivatives exist and are continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. We will consider three cases: $x < 0$, $x = 0$, and $x > 0$.\n\nCase 1: $x < 0$\n\nFor $x < 0$, $f(x) = x^2$. All the derivatives of $x^2$ exist and are continuous on $(-\\infty, 0)$. Therefore, $f$ is smooth on $(-\\infty, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: $x > 0$\n\nFor $x > 0$, $f(x) = \\cos(\\pi/x)$. We can find the derivatives of $f(x)$ using the chain rule:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\cos(\\pi/x) = \\sin(\\pi/x) \\cdot \\frac{-\\pi}{x^2}\n$$\n\n$$\nf''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\sin(\\pi/x) \\cdot \\frac{-\\pi}{x^2}\\right) = \\left(\\cos(\\pi/x) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{x^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{-\\pi}{x^2} - \\sin(\\pi/x) \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{x^3}\n$$\n\nIn general, the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ will be a combination of sine and cosine functions with rational functions as coefficients. Since sine and cosine functions are smooth and the product of smooth functions is smooth, $f$ is smooth on $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nCase 3: $x = 0$\n\nWe need to show that all the derivatives of $f(x)$ exist and are continuous at $x = 0$. We already know that the derivatives of $f(x)$ exist for $x < 0$ and $x > 0$. We will now show that the derivatives of $f(x)$ at $x = 0$ exist and are continuous.\n\nFor $n \\geq 1$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f^{(n)}(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} x^2 = 0\n$$\n\nFor $n \\geq 2$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f^{(n)}(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} \\cos(\\pi/x)\n$$\n\nSince the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ for $x > 0$ is a combination of sine and cosine functions with rational functions as coefficients, and the limits of sine and cosine functions as $x$ approaches $0$ are finite, the limit of the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right exists and is finite.\n\nTherefore, all the derivatives of $f(x)$ at $x = 0$ exist and are continuous. This completes the proof that $f$ is smooth on $\\mathbb{R}$."
