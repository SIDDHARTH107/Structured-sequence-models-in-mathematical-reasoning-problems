    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, car sales) in a fixed interval of time (2 days).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (car sales) in the given time interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average number of events (car sales) in the given time interval\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 15 car sales)\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of car sales in 2 days. Since the dealership sells an average of 10 cars per day, the average number of car sales in 2 days is:\n\nλ = 10 cars/day * 2 days = 20 cars\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = (e^(-20) * 20^15) / 15!\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.034718\n\nSo the probability that the dealership will sell exactly 15 cars in the next 2 days is approximately 3.47%."
