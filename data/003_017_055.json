    "message_1": "A student is observed playing a game on his phone 4 times per minute for 3 minutes. At the beginning of the observation, the height of the sun is 15 degrees. Find the average value of the sine of the height of the sun during this observation. Use radians to answer up to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the average value of the sine of the height of the sun during this observation, we first need to convert the height of the sun from degrees to radians. \n\nTo convert degrees to radians, we use the formula:\n\nradians = (degrees × π) / 180\n\nSo, the height of the sun in radians is:\n\n(15 × π) / 180 ≈ 0.262 radians\n\nSince the observation lasts for 3 minutes and the height of the sun doesn't change during this short period of time, the average value of the sine of the height of the sun is simply the sine of its height in radians:\n\nsin(0.262) ≈ 0.258\n\nTherefore, the average value of the sine of the height of the sun during this observation is approximately 0.258."
