    "message_2": "1. Write a differential equation representing the population growth.\n\nLet P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t, and k be the proportionality constant. The rate of growth of the population is proportional to the current population size and the remaining capacity of the island. So, the differential equation can be written as:\n\ndP/dt = k * P * (1 - P/1000)\n\n2. Find a general solution for the population growth model.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Rearrange the equation to separate P terms and t terms:\n\n(dP/P * (1 - P/1000)) = k * dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P * (1 - P/1000)) dP = ∫k dt\n\nTo integrate the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let A and B be constants such that:\n\n1/(P * (1 - P/1000)) = A/P + B/(1 - P/1000)\n\nMultiplying both sides by P * (1 - P/1000) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 = A * (1 - P/1000) + B * P\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by setting P = 0 and P = 1000:\n\nFor P = 0: 1 = A * (1 - 0) => A = 1\nFor P = 1000: 1 = B * 1000 => B = 1/1000\n\nNow, substitute A and B back into the integral:\n\n∫(1/P + 1/1000(1 - P/1000)) dP = ∫k dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n(ln|P| - ln|(1 - P/1000)|) = kt + C1\n\nCombine the logarithms:\n\nln|(P/(1 - P/1000))| = kt + C1\n\nExponentiate both sides to remove the natural logarithm:\n\nP/(1 - P/1000) = e^(kt + C1) = e^(kt) * e^C1\n\nLet C2 = e^C1, then:\n\nP/(1 - P/1000) = C2 * e^(kt)\n\n3. Find the particular solution for the population growth model using the initial condition.\n\nAt t = 0, P(0) = 20. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n20/(1 - 20/1000) = C2 * e^(k * 0)\n\nSolve for C2:\n\n20/980 = C2 => C2 = 1/49\n\nNow, substitute C2 back into the equation:\n\nP/(1 - P/1000) = (1/49) * e^(kt)\n\nThis is the particular solution for the population growth model.\n\n4. How long will it take for the rabbit population to reach 90% of the carrying capacity of the island?\n\n90% of the carrying capacity is 0.9 * 1000 = 900 rabbits. Set P(t) = 900 and solve for t:\n\n900/(1 - 900/1000) = (1/49) * e^(kt)\n\nSolve for t:\n\n49/100 = e^(kt)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(49/100) = kt\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = (1/k) * ln(49/100)\n\nSince we don't have the value of k, we cannot find the exact time it will take for the rabbit population to reach 90% of the carrying capacity. However, this equation gives us the relationship between time and the proportionality constant k."
