Let C^k(X) be the space of k-chains on X (i.e., the free abelian group generated by the k-simplices of X). Calculate the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X) with coefficients in Z_2.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X) with coefficients in Z_2, we can use the fact that the torus X has the same homotopy type as the wedge sum of two circles, S^1 ∨ S^1. This is because the torus can be obtained by attaching a 2-cell to the wedge sum of two circles along their common basepoint.\n\nNow, consider the cellular chain complex for the wedge sum of two circles:\n\nC_2 = 0 → C_1 = Z ⊕ Z → C_0 = Z → 0\n\nHere, C_0, C_1, and C_2 are the 0-, 1-, and 2-dimensional cellular chain groups, respectively. The boundary maps are given by:\n\n∂_2 = 0 (since there are no 2-cells)\n∂_1: Z ⊕ Z → Z, given by (m, n) ↦ m + n\n∂_0 = 0 (since there are no 0-cells other than the basepoint)\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology groups with coefficients in Z_2 by applying the functor Hom(-, Z_2) to the cellular chain complex:\n\nHom(C_2, Z_2) = 0 → Hom(C_1, Z_2) = Z_2 ⊕ Z_2 → Hom(C_0, Z_2) = Z_2 → 0\n\nThe cohomology groups are given by the kernel of the coboundary maps modulo the image of the previous coboundary map:\n\nH^0(X; Z_2) = ker(∂^0) / im(∂^1) = Z_2 / 0 = Z_2\nH^1(X; Z_2) = ker(∂^1) / im(∂^2) = (Z_2 ⊕ Z_2) / 0 = Z_2 ⊕ Z_2\nH^2(X; Z_2) = ker(∂^2) / im(∂^3) = 0 / 0 = 0\n\nThus, the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X) with coefficients in Z_2 is 2."
