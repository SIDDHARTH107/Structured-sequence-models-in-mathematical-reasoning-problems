    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a level 3 Menger sponge, this process is repeated three times. To find the volume, we can calculate the total number of smaller cubes remaining and multiply it by the volume of each small cube.\n\nIn each iteration, 20 of the 27 smaller cubes remain. So, for a level 3 Menger sponge:\n\nNumber of remaining cubes = 20^3 = 8000\n\nThe starting cube has a side length of 3 cm, so each small cube in the level 3 Menger sponge has a side length of:\n\nSide length of small cube = 3 cm / (3^3) = 3 cm / 27 = 1/9 cm\n\nThe volume of each small cube is:\n\nVolume of small cube = (1/9 cm)^3 = 1/729 cm^3\n\nFinally, the volume of the level 3 Menger sponge is:\n\nVolume of Menger sponge = 8000 * (1/729 cm^3) = 8000/729 cm^3 â‰ˆ 10.97 cm^3"
