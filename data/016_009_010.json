    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles. So, after 10 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nInitial length * 2^number of iterations\n1 * 2^10 = 1 * 1024 = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
