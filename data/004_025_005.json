    "message_1": "A car is driving along a straight road and its position (in meters) at time t (in seconds) is given by the equation: s(t) = 3t^2 + 12t + 5. Find the car's velocity at time t=3 seconds, using calculus.",
    "message_2": "To find the car's velocity at time t=3 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. This derivative will give us the velocity function v(t).\n\ns(t) = 3t^2 + 12t + 5\n\nNow, we will find the derivative of s(t) with respect to t:\n\nds/dt = d(3t^2 + 12t + 5)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = 6t + 12\n\nNow, we will find the velocity at time t=3 seconds by plugging t=3 into the velocity function:\n\nv(3) = 6(3) + 12\nv(3) = 18 + 12\nv(3) = 30\n\nSo, the car's velocity at time t=3 seconds is 30 meters per second."
