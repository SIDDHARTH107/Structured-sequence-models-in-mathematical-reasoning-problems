    "message_1": "A rectangular garden is 5 meters wide and 8 meters long. What is the total distance around the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the total distance around the garden, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 meters and the width is 5 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (8 + 5) = 2 * 13 = 26 meters\n\nSo, the total distance around the garden is 26 meters."
