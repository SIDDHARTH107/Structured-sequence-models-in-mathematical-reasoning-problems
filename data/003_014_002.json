    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a diameter of 60 meters and rotates once every 2 minutes. Suppose you are at the bottom of the Ferris wheel and your seat is located 3 meters above the ground. Determine the equation of the trigonometric function that models your height above the ground as a function of time, and find your height after 45 seconds.",
    "message_2": "Let h(t) represent the height above the ground as a function of time t (in minutes). Since the Ferris wheel rotates once every 2 minutes, the period of the trigonometric function is 2 minutes. We can use a cosine function to model the height, as the height starts at its minimum value when t = 0.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is 30 meters. The vertical shift is the distance from the ground to the bottom of the Ferris wheel, which is 3 meters. Therefore, the equation of the trigonometric function is:\n\nh(t) = 30cos(πt) + 33\n\nNow, we need to find the height after 45 seconds. First, convert 45 seconds to minutes:\n\n45 seconds = 45/60 = 0.75 minutes\n\nNow, plug this value into the equation:\n\nh(0.75) = 30cos(π(0.75)) + 33\n\nh(0.75) ≈ 30cos(2.356) + 33\nh(0.75) ≈ 30(-0.707) + 33\nh(0.75) ≈ -21.21 + 33\nh(0.75) ≈ 11.79\n\nAfter 45 seconds, your height above the ground is approximately 11.79 meters."
