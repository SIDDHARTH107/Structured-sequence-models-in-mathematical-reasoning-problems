    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed.\n\nIn the first level (iteration 1), we remove 1 cube from the center and 6 cubes from the faces, which is a total of 1 + 6 = 7 cubes removed. This leaves 20 cubes remaining.\n\nIn the second level (iteration 2), we apply the same process to each of the 20 remaining cubes. So, we remove 7 cubes from each of the 20 cubes, which is 20 * 7 = 140 cubes removed. Since each of the 20 cubes is divided into 27 smaller cubes, we have 20 * 27 = 540 smaller cubes. After removing the 140 cubes, we are left with 540 - 140 = 400 cubes.\n\nIn the third level (iteration 3), we apply the same process to each of the 400 remaining cubes. So, we remove 7 cubes from each of the 400 cubes, which is 400 * 7 = 2800 cubes removed. Since each of the 400 cubes is divided into 27 smaller cubes, we have 400 * 27 = 10,800 smaller cubes. After removing the 2800 cubes, we are left with 10,800 - 2800 = 8,000 cubes.\n\nSo, the total number of cubes in the third level of the Menger sponge construction is 8,000."
