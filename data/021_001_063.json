    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 7\n4x - 2y + 5z = -12\n-2x + y - 3z = 10\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7  |\n|  4  -2   5 | -12 |\n| -2   1  -3 | 10  |\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1   1.5  -0.5 |  3.5  |\n|  4  -2    5   | -12   |\n| -2   1   -3   |  10   |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows by subtracting multiples of the first row:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 4 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 + 2 * Row1\n\n|  1   1.5  -0.5 |  3.5  |\n|  0  -8    7   | -26   |\n|  0   4   -2   |  17   |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -8 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n|  1   1.5  -0.5 |  3.5  |\n|  0   1   -7/8  | 13/4  |\n|  0   4   -2   |  17   |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in the third row by subtracting a multiple of the second row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - 4 * Row2\n\n|  1   1.5  -0.5 |  3.5  |\n|  0   1   -7/8  | 13/4  |\n|  0   0    1   |  -1   |\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. Let's perform back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = -1\n\ny + (-7/8)z = 13/4\ny = 13/4 + (7/8)(-1)\ny = 13/4 - 7/8\ny = (13-7)/4\ny = 6/4\ny = 3/2\n\nx + 1.5y - 0.5z = 3.5\nx = 3.5 - 1.5(3/2) + 0.5(-1)\nx = 3.5 - 9/4 + 1/2\nx = (7 - 9 + 2)/4\nx = 0\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 3/2, and z = -1."
