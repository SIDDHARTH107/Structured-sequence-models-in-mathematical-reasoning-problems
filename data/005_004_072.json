They randomly assigned 18 participants to watch the TV ad, listen to the radio ad, or see the product on social media. After exposure to the ad, the participants were asked to rate their intention to purchase the product on a scale of 1-10 (10 being most likely). The company wants to know if there is a significant difference in the mean intention to purchase ratings based on the type of advertising method used.\n\nHere are the mean and standard deviation intention to purchase ratings for each of the three advertising methods:\n\nTV: Mean = 8.2, SD = 1.5\nRadio: Mean = 6.8, SD = 1.2\nSocial Media: Mean = 7.5, SD = 1.3\n\nWhat statistical test should the company use to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean intention to purchase ratings based on advertising method? Conduct the appropriate test and provide a conclusion with justification.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference between the mean intention to purchase ratings based on the advertising method, the company should use a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. This test is appropriate because there are three independent groups (TV, radio, and social media) and the goal is to compare the means of these groups.\n\nFirst, let's state the null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nH0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 (There is no significant difference between the mean intention to purchase ratings for the three advertising methods)\nH1: At least one mean is significantly different from the others\n\nNow, let's perform the one-way ANOVA test:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the overall mean (Grand Mean) of all the groups combined:\n(8.2 + 6.8 + 7.5) / 3 = 7.5\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW):\n\nSSB = Σn_i(μ_i - Grand Mean)^2\nSSB = 6(8.2 - 7.5)^2 + 6(6.8 - 7.5)^2 + 6(7.5 - 7.5)^2 = 6(0.7)^2 + 6(-0.7)^2 + 0 = 5.88\n\nSSW = Σ(n_i - 1) * SD_i^2\nSSW = (6 - 1) * 1.5^2 + (6 - 1) * 1.2^2 + (6 - 1) * 1.3^2 = 5 * (2.25 + 1.44 + 1.69) = 5 * 5.38 = 26.9\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Mean Squares Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Squares Within Groups (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1), where k is the number of groups\nMSB = 5.88 / (3 - 1) = 5.88 / 2 = 2.94\n\nMSW = SSW / (N - k), where N is the total number of participants\nMSW = 26.9 / (18 - 3) = 26.9 / 15 = 1.793\n\nStep 4: Calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 2.94 / 1.793 = 1.639\n\nStep 5: Determine the critical F-value for a given significance level (α) and degrees of freedom:\n\nFor this problem, let's use a significance level of α = 0.05. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (df1) is k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2, and for the denominator (df2) is N - k = 18 - 3 = 15. Using an F-distribution table or calculator, the critical F-value for α = 0.05, df1 = 2, and df2 = 15 is approximately 3.68.\n\nStep 6: Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value:\n\nSince the calculated F-statistic (1.639) is less than the critical F-value (3.68), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is no significant difference between the mean intention to purchase ratings for the three advertising methods (TV, radio, and social media) at the 0.05 significance level."
