    "message_2": "To choose 3 students out of a class of 25, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (25 in this case) and k is the number of students to be chosen (3 in this case).\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25-3)!)\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * 22!)\n\nC(25, 3) = (25 * 24 * 23 * 22!)/(3! * 22!)\n\nC(25, 3) = (25 * 24 * 23)/(3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(25, 3) = (25 * 24 * 23)/(6)\n\nC(25, 3) = 2300\n\nSo, there are 2300 ways to choose 3 students out of a class of 25 to represent the class in a debate competition."
