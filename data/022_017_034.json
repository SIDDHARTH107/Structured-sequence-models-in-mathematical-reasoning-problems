    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\n$$r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$$(r + 1)(r + 2) = 0$$\n\nThe roots of this equation are $r_1 = -1$ and $r_2 = -2$. Since we have two distinct real roots, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^{-2x}$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary complex constants."
