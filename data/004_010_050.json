    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative F(x) of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nIntegration involves finding the antiderivative of each term in the function and adding a constant C, since the derivative of a constant is zero.\n\nThe antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), so we apply this rule to each term:\n\n∫(2x^3) dx = (2/4)x^4 = (1/2)x^4\n∫(-5x^2) dx = (-5/3)x^3\n∫(3x) dx = (3/2)x^2\n∫(-1) dx = -x\n\nNow, we add all the antiderivatives together and include the constant C:\n\nF(x) = (1/2)x^4 - (5/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x + C"
