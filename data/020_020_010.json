    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of fencing needed for the garden, we need to minimize the perimeter of the rectangle while keeping the area constant at 100 square meters. Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The area of the rectangle is given by:\n\nA = L * W = 100\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is given by:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nTo minimize the perimeter, we can use calculus. First, we need to express one variable in terms of the other using the area equation:\n\nW = 100 / L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the perimeter equation:\n\nP = 2L + 2(100 / L)\n\nTo find the minimum perimeter, we can take the derivative of P with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\ndP/dL = 2 - (200 / L^2) = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n200 / L^2 = 2\nL^2 = 100\nL = 10\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 100 / 10\nW = 10\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that will minimize the length of fencing needed are 10 meters by 10 meters."
