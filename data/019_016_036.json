    "message_2": "To find the intersection of sets A and B, we need to find the set of all elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nSet A contains all elements x such that -2 < x < 4.\nSet B contains all elements x such that 0 < x < 6.\n\nThe intersection of A and B will contain all elements x that satisfy both conditions. In other words, we need to find the range of x values that are greater than -2 and less than 4, as well as greater than 0 and less than 6.\n\nSince 0 is greater than -2, we can ignore the -2 < x condition, as it is already satisfied by the 0 < x condition. Now we just need to find the range of x values that are both less than 4 and less than 6.\n\nSince 4 is less than 6, the intersection of A and B will contain all elements x such that 0 < x < 4.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and B is the set {x | 0 < x < 4}."
