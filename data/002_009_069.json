    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 5 inches and a radius of 2 inches. What is the total surface area of the cylinder?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nFor the two circular bases:\nA_base = π(2²) = 4π\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 4π = 8π.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A_lateral = 2πrh, where h is the height.\n\nFor the lateral surface area:\nA_lateral = 2π(2)(5) = 20π\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cylinder:\n\nTotal Surface Area = A_bases + A_lateral = 8π + 20π = 28π square inches."
