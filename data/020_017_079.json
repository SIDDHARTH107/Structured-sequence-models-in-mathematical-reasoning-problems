    "message_1": "A thin rectangular sheet of metal measuring 30cm by 50cm is to be made into a box with an open top by cutting equal squares from each corner and folding up the sides. What is the maximum possible volume of the box?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner.\n\nAfter cutting the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n- length: 50 - 2x\n- width: 30 - 2x\n- height: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as the product of its dimensions:\nV(x) = x(50 - 2x)(30 - 2x)\n\nTo find the maximum possible volume, we need to find the maximum value of V(x). We can do this by finding the critical points of the function, which occur when the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of V(x) with respect to x:\nV'(x) = d/dx [x(50 - 2x)(30 - 2x)]\n\nUsing the product rule and simplifying, we get:\nV'(x) = -12x^2 + 160x - 1500\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting V'(x) equal to 0:\n-12x^2 + 160x - 1500 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -12, b = 160, and c = -1500:\nx = (-160 ± √(160^2 - 4(-12)(-1500))) / 2(-12)\n\nSolving for x, we get two possible values: x ≈ 5.42 and x ≈ 23.08. However, since the width of the sheet is 30 cm, we cannot cut squares with a side length of 23.08 cm. Therefore, we will use x ≈ 5.42 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the box:\n- length: 50 - 2(5.42) ≈ 39.16 cm\n- width: 30 - 2(5.42) ≈ 19.16 cm\n- height: 5.42 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum possible volume of the box:\nV_max ≈ 39.16 * 19.16 * 5.42 ≈ 4050.87 cm³"
