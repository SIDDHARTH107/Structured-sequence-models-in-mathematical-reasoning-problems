    "message_1": "A city has a 25% chance of experiencing a major earthquake, a 35% chance of a severe thunderstorm, and a 40% chance of a flood within a year. What is the probability that the city will experience at least one of these natural disasters within a year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary probability. We will first find the probability that none of these natural disasters occur within a year, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one of these natural disasters occurs.\n\nThe probability that no major earthquake occurs is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\nThe probability that no severe thunderstorm occurs is 1 - 0.35 = 0.65.\nThe probability that no flood occurs is 1 - 0.40 = 0.60.\n\nNow, we find the probability that none of these natural disasters occur within a year by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event not happening:\n\n0.75 * 0.65 * 0.60 = 0.2925\n\nFinally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one of these natural disasters occurs:\n\n1 - 0.2925 = 0.7075\n\nSo, the probability that the city will experience at least one of these natural disasters within a year is approximately 70.75%."
