    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve formed by iterating the Koch curve construction process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nLet's denote the initial side length of the equilateral triangle as L0 = 6 cm. Since the Koch snowflake is formed from an equilateral triangle, the initial total length of the curve is 3 times the side length, which is L0 * 3.\n\nAfter the 5th stage of iteration, the length of the curve will be:\n\nL5 = L0 * 3 * (4/3)^5\n\nL5 = 6 * 3 * (4/3)^5\n\nL5 = 18 * (1024/243)\n\nL5 ≈ 18 * 4.213\n\nL5 ≈ 75.834 cm\n\nSo, the length of the Koch snowflake fractal curve after the 5th stage of iteration is approximately 75.834 cm."
