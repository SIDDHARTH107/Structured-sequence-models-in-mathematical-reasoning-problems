    "message_2": "The closure of a set A in a topological space is the smallest closed set containing A. In the context of the real line with the usual topology, the closure of a set is the union of the set and its limit points.\n\nFirst, let's find the limit points of the set A = {1/2, 2/3, 3/4}. A limit point of a set is a point such that every open neighborhood around it contains at least one point from the set different from the point itself.\n\n1. 1/2 has no limit points in the set A, as any open neighborhood around 1/2 in the interval (0,1] will not contain any other points from A.\n2. 2/3 has no limit points in the set A, as any open neighborhood around 2/3 in the interval (0,1] will not contain any other points from A.\n3. 3/4 has no limit points in the set A, as any open neighborhood around 3/4 in the interval (0,1] will not contain any other points from A.\n\nSince there are no limit points of the set A in the interval (0,1], the closure of A in the topological space (0,1] with the usual topology is just the set A itself:\n\nClosure(A) = A = {1/2, 2/3, 3/4}."
