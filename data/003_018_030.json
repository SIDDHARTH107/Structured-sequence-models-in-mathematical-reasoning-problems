    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(3x), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if you have a composite function, the derivative is the product of the derivative of the outer function and the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = sin(3x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [sin(3x)] = cos(3x) * d/dx [3x] = cos(3x) * 3\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\nf'(π/6) = 3 * cos(3(π/6)) = 3 * cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the derivative at x = π/6 is:\n\nf'(π/6) = 3 * 0 = 0"
