    "message_2": "The given function is $\\frac{1}{(z-2)^3(z+3)}$. To find the poles, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator becomes zero.\n\nThe denominator is $(z-2)^3(z+3)$. Setting this equal to zero, we get two distinct values of z:\n\n1. $(z-2)^3 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 2$\n2. $(z+3) = 0 \\Rightarrow z = -3$\n\nNow, let's find the order and type of each pole:\n\n1. For the pole at z = 2, the order is determined by the exponent of the corresponding factor in the denominator. In this case, the exponent is 3, so the order of the pole at z = 2 is 3. Since the order is greater than 1, this pole is a higher-order pole.\n\n2. For the pole at z = -3, the order is determined by the exponent of the corresponding factor in the denominator. In this case, the exponent is 1, so the order of the pole at z = -3 is 1. Since the order is 1, this pole is a simple pole.\n\nIn summary, the function $\\frac{1}{(z-2)^3(z+3)}$ has two poles in the complex plane:\n\n1. A higher-order pole of order 3 at z = 2.\n2. A simple pole of order 1 at z = -3."
