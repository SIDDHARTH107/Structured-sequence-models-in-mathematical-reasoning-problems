    "message_2": "To find all the points $(x, y)$ on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 3$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we will iterate through all possible values of $x$ and $y$ in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and check if they satisfy the equation.\n\nRecall that $\\mathbb{F}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. We will test each combination of $x$ and $y$ in this set.\n\nWe can create a table to help us organize our results:\n\n| x | y | x^3 | 5x | x^3 + 5x + 3 | y^2 |\n|---|---|-----|----|--------------|-----|\n| 0 | 0 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 0   |\n| 0 | 1 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 1   |\n| 0 | 2 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 4   |\n| 0 | 3 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 2   |\n| 0 | 4 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 2   |\n| 0 | 5 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 4   |\n| 0 | 6 | 0   | 0  | 3            | 1   |\n\nWe can see that for $x = 0$, there are no solutions since there are no values of $y$ such that $y^2 = 3$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$. We can continue this process for all values of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$:\n\n| x | y | x^3 | 5x | x^3 + 5x + 3 | y^2 |\n|---|---|-----|----|--------------|-----|\n| 1 | 0 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 0   |\n| 1 | 1 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 1   |\n| 1 | 2 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 4   |\n| 1 | 3 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 2   |\n| 1 | 4 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 2   |\n| 1 | 5 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 4   |\n| 1 | 6 | 1   | 5  | 2            | 1   |\n\nFor $x = 1$, there are no solutions either. Continuing this process for all values of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we find the following solutions:\n\n- For $x = 2$, we have the points $(2, 1)$ and $(2, 6)$.\n- For $x = 3$, we have the points $(3, 2)$ and $(3, 5)$.\n- For $x = 4$, we have the points $(4, 2)$ and $(4, 5)$.\n- For $x = 5$, we have the points $(5, 1)$ and $(5, 6)$.\n- For $x = 6$, we have the points $(6, 3)$ and $(6, 4)$.\n\nSo, the points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 3$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ are:\n\n$(2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 3),$ and $(6, 4)$."
