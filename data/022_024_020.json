Let u(x,y,0) = sin(x+iy). Determine the solution u(x,y,t) using complex analysis methods when a = 1/2 and t = 1/π.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using complex analysis methods, we will use the method of separation of variables and the complex Fourier transform. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t), where X(x), Y(y), and T(t) are functions of x, y, and t, respectively.\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n∂(XYT)/∂t = (1/2)(∂²(XYT)/∂x² + ∂²(XYT)/∂y²)\n\nDividing both sides by XYT, we obtain:\n\n(1/T)(∂T/∂t) = (1/2)((1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ.\n\n(1/T)(∂T/∂t) = -λ\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) = -2λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1) (1/T)(∂T/∂t) + λT = 0\n(2) (1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) + 2λ = 0\n\nSolving equation (1) for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n\nNow, we can rewrite equation (2) as:\n\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) = -2λ\n\nLet's solve this equation using the complex Fourier transform. Let X(x) = e^(ikx) and Y(y) = e^(ily), where k and l are complex numbers. Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\n-k²e^(ikx) + -l²e^(ily) = -2λ\n\nDividing both sides by e^(ikx)e^(ily), we obtain:\n\n-k² - l² = 2λ\n\nNow, let's consider the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(x + iy). We can rewrite this as:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = Im(e^(ix) * e^(-y))\n\nComparing this with our separated solution u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t), we can see that:\n\nX(x) = e^(ix)\nY(y) = e^(-y)\nT(0) = 1\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(x, y, t) as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = e^(ix)e^(-y)Ce^(-λt)\n\nTo find the constant C and λ, we can use the initial condition:\n\nsin(x + iy) = Im(e^(ix)e^(-y)Ce^(-λt))\n\nSince t = 1/π, we have:\n\nsin(x + iy) = Im(e^(ix)e^(-y)Ce^(-λ/π))\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we can see that:\n\nC = 1\nλ = (k² + l²)/2\n\nThus, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = e^(ix)e^(-y)e^(-((k² + l²)t)/2π)"
