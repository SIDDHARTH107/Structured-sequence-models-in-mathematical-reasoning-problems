    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$, we will use the following formula:\n\n$N = 1 + q - \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}} (1 - \\sqrt[q]{1 - (x^3 + 2x + 1)})$\n\nwhere $q = 7$ in our case. We will compute the sum by iterating over all possible values of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$ and checking whether the cubic polynomial has a square root in $\\mathbb{F}_{7}$.\n\nFor each $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, we compute $x^3 + 2x + 1$:\n\n- For $x = 0$, we have $0^3 + 2\\cdot0 + 1 = 1$.\n- For $x = 1$, we have $1^3 + 2\\cdot1 + 1 = 4$.\n- For $x = 2$, we have $2^3 + 2\\cdot2 + 1 = 2$.\n- For $x = 3$, we have $3^3 + 2\\cdot3 + 1 = 6$.\n- For $x = 4$, we have $4^3 + 2\\cdot4 + 1 = 5$.\n- For $x = 5$, we have $5^3 + 2\\cdot5 + 1 = 3$.\n- For $x = 6$, we have $6^3 + 2\\cdot6 + 1 = 0$.\n\nNow, we count the number of square roots for each value:\n\n- For $1$, there are $2$ square roots: $1$ and $6$.\n- For $4$, there are $2$ square roots: $2$ and $5$.\n- For $2$, there are $2$ square roots: $3$ and $4$.\n- For $6$, there are $2$ square roots: $5$ and $2$.\n- For $5$, there are $2$ square roots: $3$ and $4$.\n- For $3$, there are $2$ square roots: $1$ and $6$.\n- For $0$, there is $1$ square root: $0$.\n\nSo, the sum is $2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 13$. Therefore, the number of points on the elliptic curve is:\n\n$N = 1 + 7 - 13 = 8 - 5 = 3$.\n\nNow, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem to determine the dimension of the space of regular differentials on this curve. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of regular differentials associated with the divisor $D$, $K$ is the canonical divisor, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$. In our case, we want to find the dimension of the space of regular differentials, which corresponds to $l(K)$, where $K$ is the canonical divisor.\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(K) - l(0) = \\deg(K) + 1 - g$\n\nSince $l(0) = 1$, we get:\n\n$l(K) = \\deg(K) + 2 - g$\n\nNow, we know that the degree of the canonical divisor is $2g - 2$, so we have:\n\n$l(K) = 2g - 2 + 2 - g$\n\n$l(K) = g$\n\nWe also know that the number of points on the elliptic curve is $3$, which means that the dimension of the space of regular differentials is $3$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$g = 3$\n\nSo, the genus of the elliptic curve is $3$."
