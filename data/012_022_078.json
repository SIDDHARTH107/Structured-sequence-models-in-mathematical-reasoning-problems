    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a complete graph of m vertices or a complete graph of n vertices. In this case, we are looking for the Ramsey number R(4, 5).\n\nThe exact value of R(4, 5) is not known. However, we do know that R(4, 5) is between 17 and 25, inclusive. This is because R(4, 4) = 18 and R(5, 5) = 43, and the Ramsey number R(m, n) is always less than or equal to R(m, m) + R(n, n) - 1. So, R(4, 5) ≤ R(4, 4) + R(5, 5) - 1 = 18 + 43 - 1 = 60. However, it is also known that R(4, 5) > 16, so we have 17 ≤ R(4, 5) ≤ 25."
