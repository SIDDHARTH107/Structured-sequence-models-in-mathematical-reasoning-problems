    "message_1": "A group of four friends want to play a game. In this game, each person chooses a number between 1 and 10, without telling the others. The person who chooses the lowest number wins a prize of $20. However, if two or more people choose the same lowest number, then they split the prize equally. \n\nWhat mathematical strategy do the friends need to use to have the highest chance of winning the prize alone?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the chance of winning the prize alone, each friend should choose a distinct number from the set of lowest numbers. Since there are four friends, they should choose numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. This way, they ensure that one of them will have the lowest number, and they won't have to split the prize.\n\nHowever, since they cannot communicate their choices, they cannot guarantee that they will all choose distinct numbers. In this case, they can use a probabilistic strategy. Each friend can choose a number from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} with equal probability (25% chance of choosing each number). This strategy maximizes the chance of having a single winner, as it minimizes the probability of two or more friends choosing the same lowest number.\n\nTo further illustrate this, let's calculate the probability of having a single winner using this strategy:\n\n1. Probability of all friends choosing distinct numbers: (1/4) * (3/4) * (2/4) * (1/4) = 1/32\n2. Probability of three friends choosing the same number and one choosing a different number: 4 * (1/4)^3 * (3/4) = 3/16\n3. Probability of two pairs of friends choosing the same numbers: 6 * (1/4)^2 * (1/4)^2 = 3/32\n\nAdding these probabilities, we get the total probability of having a single winner:\n\n1/32 + 3/16 + 3/32 = 16/32 = 1/2\n\nSo, using this strategy, there is a 50% chance of having a single winner in the game."
