    "message_1": "Sorry, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem for epistemic logic since it deals with knowledge and beliefs rather than numerical calculations. Epistemic logic is a branch of logic that studies reasoning about knowledge and beliefs. It is concerned with questions such as \"what do I know?\" and \"what do I believe?\" rather than numerical calculations or equations.",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I understand that epistemic logic is not about numerical problems. However, if you have any other mathematical problems or questions related to other branches of mathematics, feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with those."
