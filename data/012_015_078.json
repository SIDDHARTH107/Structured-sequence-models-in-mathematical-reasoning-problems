    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices, so the graph must have at least 6 edges to be connected. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is possible for the graph to be connected.\n\nNow, let's calculate the diameter of the graph. The diameter is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. To find the diameter, we can use the fact that the maximum diameter of a connected graph with n vertices and e edges is given by the formula:\n\nDiameter ≤ n - 1 - floor((2 * (e - (n - 1))) / (n - 2))\n\nIn our case, n = 7 and e = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiameter ≤ 7 - 1 - floor((2 * (10 - (7 - 1))) / (7 - 2))\nDiameter ≤ 6 - floor((2 * (3)) / 5)\nDiameter ≤ 6 - floor(6 / 5)\nDiameter ≤ 6 - 1\nDiameter ≤ 5\n\nSo, the diameter of the graph is at most 5. However, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact diameter. It could be less than or equal to 5."
