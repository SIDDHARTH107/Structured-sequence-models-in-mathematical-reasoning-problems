    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x² ln(x + 5), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that if we have a function g(x) = u(x)v(x), then the derivative g'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x).\n\nIn this case, we have u(x) = x² and v(x) = ln(x + 5). Now, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x).\n\nu'(x) = d(x²)/dx = 2x\nv'(x) = d(ln(x + 5))/dx = 1/(x + 5)\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (2x)(ln(x + 5)) + (x²)(1/(x + 5))\nf'(x) = 2x ln(x + 5) + x²/(x + 5)"
