    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for y:\n\n2x + y = 7\n\ny = 7 - 2x\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n3x - 2(7 - 2x) = 4\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\n3x - 14 + 4x = 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7x - 14 = 4\n\nAdd 14 to both sides:\n\n7x = 18\n\nDivide by 7:\n\nx = 18/7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we'll substitute it back into the expression we found for y:\n\ny = 7 - 2(18/7)\n\nMultiply:\n\ny = 7 - 36/7\n\nFind a common denominator:\n\ny = 49/7 - 36/7\n\nSubtract:\n\ny = 13/7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 18/7 and y = 13/7."
