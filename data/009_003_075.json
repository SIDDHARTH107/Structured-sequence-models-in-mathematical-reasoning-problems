At time t=0, one end of the rod is placed in a furnace at 500 degrees Celsius while the other end is kept in an ice bath at 0 degrees Celsius. The rod conducts heat so that its temperature at any point satisfies the diffusion equation:\n\ndT/dt = k(d^2T/dx^2)\n\nwhere k=0.01 cm^2/s is the diffusion coefficient. Assume that the rod is well insulated so there is no heat loss. \n\nWhat is the temperature at the center of the rod (x = 2 cm) after 5 minutes have passed?\n",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the heat equation with the given boundary conditions and initial condition. The solution to the heat equation can be found using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by kXT, we get:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of time only and the right side is a function of position only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -kλ^2T(t) and X''(x) = -λ^2X(x)\n\nThe general solution to the second equation is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(4) = 0, we get:\n\nA = 0 and B*sin(λ*4) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(λ*4) = 0. This implies that λ*4 = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, λ = nπ/4.\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-kλ^2t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the temperature distribution as:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ(C_n*sin(nπx/4)*exp(-k(nπ/4)^2t))\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ(C_n*sin(nπx/4))\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and we can find the coefficients using the orthogonality of sine functions:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫(0 to L) (100*sin(nπx/4) dx)\n\nHere, L = 4 cm. Computing the integral, we get:\n\nC_n = (1/2) * (8/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we have the full solution:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ((1/2) * (8/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(nπx/4) * exp(-k(nπ/4)^2t))\n\nWe want to find the temperature at the center of the rod (x = 2 cm) after 5 minutes (t = 300 s). Plugging in x = 2 and t = 300, we get:\n\nT(2, 300) = Σ((1/2) * (8/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(nπ/2) * exp(-k(nπ/4)^2*300))\n\nThis is an infinite series, but we can approximate the temperature by taking the first few terms. Taking the first 10 terms, we get:\n\nT(2, 300) ≈ 168.6 degrees Celsius\n\nSo, the temperature at the center of the rod after 5 minutes is approximately 168.6 degrees Celsius."
