    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (3,4,0), we first need to find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) at that point. For a sphere of radius R, the principal curvatures are equal and given by the reciprocal of the radius, i.e., k1 = k2 = 1/R.\n\nIn this case, the sphere has a radius of 5, so the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1/5\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean curvature (H) using the formula:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nSubstituting the values of k1 and k2, we get:\n\nH = (1/5 + 1/5) / 2\nH = (2/5) / 2\nH = 1/5\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (3,4,0) is 1/5."
