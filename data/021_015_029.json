    "message_2": "To solve the given optimization problem using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Create a population of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle: Calculate the objective function value f(x, y) for each particle and check if it satisfies the constraints.\n\n3. Update personal best and global best: For each particle, compare its current fitness with its personal best fitness. If the current fitness is better, update the personal best position. Also, compare the current fitness with the global best fitness. If the current fitness is better, update the global best position.\n\n4. Update the velocity and position of each particle: Update the velocity and position of each particle using the PSO update equations, considering the personal best and global best positions.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the global best fitness).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, we obtain the minimum value of the objective function f(x, y) and the corresponding (x, y) values that satisfy the constraints. Note that the specific results may vary depending on the random initialization and parameter settings of the PSO algorithm."
