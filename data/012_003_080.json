    "message_2": "To find the size of the maximum independent set in this graph, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, since there are 8 vertices each with degree 3, the sum of the degrees is 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, there are 24/2 = 12 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum independent set. An independent set is a set of vertices in which no two vertices are adjacent. In other words, no vertex in the set shares an edge with another vertex in the set.\n\nSince each vertex has degree 3, we know that each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices. If we were to include a vertex in the independent set, we would have to exclude its 3 neighbors. Therefore, for each vertex we include in the independent set, we are effectively \"covering\" 4 vertices (the included vertex and its 3 neighbors).\n\nSince there are 8 vertices in the graph, the maximum independent set can cover at most 8/4 = 2 vertices. This means that the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 2."
