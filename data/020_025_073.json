    "message_1": "A delivery truck needs to visit 5 different locations, starting from location A and ending at location E. Each location has a demand for delivery and the truck can carry a maximum capacity of 22 deliveries. The table below shows the demand at each location:\n\n|Location|Demand|\n|--------|------|\n|A|5|\n|B|8|\n|C|10|\n|D|6|\n|E|3|\n\nThe distance between each location is also given in the table below:\n\n|  |A|B|C|D|E|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|A|0|6|10|15|30|\n|B|6|0|9|13|25|\n|C|10|9|0|8|20|\n|D|15|13|8|0|18|\n|E|30|25|20|18|0|\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery truck to minimize the total distance travelled while satisfying the demand at each location?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm. Starting from location A, we will visit the nearest location that has not been visited yet and has demand, until we reach location E.\n\n1. Start at location A (demand = 5, capacity left = 22 - 5 = 17)\n2. Nearest location from A is B (distance = 6, demand = 8, capacity left = 17 - 8 = 9)\n3. Nearest location from B is C (distance = 9, demand = 10, capacity left = 9 - 9 = 0, since we can't satisfy the entire demand, we will deliver the remaining capacity and come back to C later)\n4. Go back to A to refill (distance = 10)\n5. Nearest location from A with remaining demand is C (distance = 10, demand = 1, capacity left = 22 - 1 = 21)\n6. Nearest location from C is D (distance = 8, demand = 6, capacity left = 21 - 6 = 15)\n7. Nearest location from D is E (distance = 18, demand = 3, capacity left = 15 - 3 = 12)\n\nThe optimal route is A -> B -> C -> A -> C -> D -> E, with a total distance of 6 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 8 + 18 = 61."
