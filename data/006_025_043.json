    "message_1": "What is the probability of getting at least 2 face cards in a five-card hand drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards during a magic performance?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary probability. We will first find the probability of not getting at least 2 face cards (i.e., getting 0 or 1 face card) and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of getting at least 2 face cards.\n\nThere are 12 face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) and 40 non-face cards in a standard deck of 52 cards.\n\nCase 1: Getting 0 face cards\nThe probability of getting 0 face cards in a five-card hand is the number of ways to choose 5 non-face cards divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from the deck.\nC(40, 5) / C(52, 5) = 658008 / 2598960 ≈ 0.2531\n\nCase 2: Getting 1 face card\nThe probability of getting 1 face card and 4 non-face cards in a five-card hand is the number of ways to choose 1 face card and 4 non-face cards divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from the deck.\n(C(12, 1) * C(40, 4)) / C(52, 5) = (12 * 91,390) / 2,598,960 ≈ 0.5148\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability:\nP(at least 2 face cards) = 1 - P(0 face cards) - P(1 face card) = 1 - 0.2531 - 0.5148 ≈ 0.2321\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 2 face cards in a five-card hand drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards during a magic performance is approximately 0.2321 or 23.21%."
