    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg of length 5 cm and the other leg of length 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the length of the hypotenuse as c, and the lengths of the other two sides as a and b. In this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc^2 = (5 cm)^2 + (12 cm)^2\nc^2 = 25 cm^2 + 144 cm^2\nc^2 = 169 cm^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = âˆš(169 cm^2)\nc = 13 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 13 cm."
