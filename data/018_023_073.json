    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between sets A and B, and sets B and C.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\nB Δ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A Δ B) and C, and between A and (B Δ C).\n\n(A Δ B) Δ C = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {1, 3, 4, 5} - {4} = {1, 3, 5}\nA Δ (B Δ C) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 5}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 5} - {2} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of these sets.\n\n(A Δ B) Δ C = {1, 3, 5}\nA Δ (B Δ C) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nCartesian product of (A Δ B) Δ C and A Δ (B Δ C):\n\n{(A Δ B) Δ C} x {A Δ (B Δ C)} = {1, 3, 5} x {1, 3, 5} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)}\n\nSince both sets (A Δ B) Δ C and A Δ (B Δ C) are equal, their Cartesian product is also equal. However, the original problem asked to show that the two sets are not equal. It seems there was a mistake in the problem statement, as the sets are indeed equal in this case."
