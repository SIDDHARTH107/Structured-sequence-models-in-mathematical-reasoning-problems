    "message_1": "In a 4x4 Latin square, each row and column should contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once. How many different Latin squares are possible?",
    "message_2": "To count the number of different 4x4 Latin squares, we can use the following method:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ways, as there are no restrictions on the placement of the numbers.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to fill it, which is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways. This is because the second row cannot have any numbers in the same column as the first row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible ways to fill it. This is because the third row cannot have any numbers in the same column as the first two rows. There are only two possible arrangements that satisfy this condition.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the previous three rows, as it cannot have any numbers in the same column as the first three rows. There is only 1 way to fill the fourth row.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each row: 24 (first row) x 6 (second row) x 2 (third row) x 1 (fourth row) = 288.\n\nSo, there are 288 different 4x4 Latin squares possible."
