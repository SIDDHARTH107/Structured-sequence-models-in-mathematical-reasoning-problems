    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies both congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given congruences are:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 4)\n\nLet's solve this system of congruences step by step:\n\n1. Find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 4 = 20\n\n2. Compute the partial products: N1 = N/5 = 20/5 = 4 and N2 = N/4 = 20/4 = 5\n\n3. Find the modular inverses: We need to find integers x1 and x2 such that:\n\n   x1 * N1 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and x2 * N2 ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n\n   By trying out different values, we find that x1 = 1 and x2 = 1 satisfy these congruences.\n\n4. Compute the solution: x = (2 * N1 * x1) + (3 * N2 * x2) (mod 20)\n\n   x = (2 * 4 * 1) + (3 * 5 * 1) (mod 20)\n   x = 8 + 15 (mod 20)\n   x = 23 (mod 20)\n\nThe smallest positive integer x that satisfies both congruences is x = 23 % 20 = 3."
