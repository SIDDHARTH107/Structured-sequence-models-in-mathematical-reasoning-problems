    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5 on the interval [0, 4], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5) = 6x^2 - 6x - 12\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n6x^2 - 6x - 12 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 6:\n\nx^2 - x - 2 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0\n\nThe critical points are x = 2 and x = -1. However, since x = -1 is not in the interval [0, 4], we only need to consider x = 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical point x = 2 and the endpoints of the interval, x = 0 and x = 4:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^3 - 3(0)^2 - 12(0) + 5 = 5\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 5 = -11\nf(4) = 2(4)^3 - 3(4)^2 - 12(4) + 5 = 69\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [0, 4] is 69 at x = 4, and the minimum value is -11 at x = 2."
