    "message_2": "To prove the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers, we first need to know the formula itself. The formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers is:\n\nSum = n^2\n\nNow, we need to prove that this formula is true for n=4. We can do this by plugging in n=4 into the formula and then calculating the sum of the first 4 odd numbers manually to see if they match.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nSum = n^2\nSum = 4^2\nSum = 16\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the first 4 odd numbers manually:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\n\nSince the formula's result (16) matches the manual calculation (16), we can conclude that the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers is true for n=4."
