    "message_2": "To find the area of the right triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nSince we are given the base and height of the triangle, we can directly plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 6 cm\n\nArea = (1/2) * 48 cm²\n\nArea = 24 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the right triangle is 24 square centimeters."
