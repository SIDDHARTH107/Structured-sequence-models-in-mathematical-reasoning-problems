    "message_2": "Let's first find out how many widgets each worker produces in a day.\n\n5000 widgets / 10 workers = 500 widgets per worker per day\n\nNow, we want to find out how many workers are needed to produce 7000 widgets in a day.\n\nLet x be the number of workers needed.\n\nx workers * 500 widgets per worker per day = 7000 widgets\n\nx * 500 = 7000\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx = 7000 / 500\nx = 14\n\nSo, 14 workers should be present if the factory wants to produce 7000 widgets in a day."
