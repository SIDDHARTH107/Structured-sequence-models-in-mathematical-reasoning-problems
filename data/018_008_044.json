    "message_2": "To find A x B (the Cartesian product of A and B), we form ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. Similarly, for B x A, we form ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. Therefore, A x B is not equal to B x A."
