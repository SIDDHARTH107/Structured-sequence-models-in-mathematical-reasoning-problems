The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4} (1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and {1}, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A ∆ B and b is in {1}.\n\n(A ∆ B) x {1} = {(1, 1), (4, 1)}"
