    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and h be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * h\n\nSince the volume is 27 cubic meters, we have:\n\n27 = x^2 * h\n\nWe want to minimize the surface area of the box, which is given by:\n\nA = x^2 + 4xh\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of x from the volume equation:\n\nh = 27 / x^2\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA(x) = x^2 + 4x(27 / x^2)\n\nA(x) = x^2 + 108 / x\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and setting it to 0:\n\nA'(x) = 2x - 108 / x^2\n\n0 = 2x - 108 / x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 108\n\n2x^3 = 108\n\nx^3 = 54\n\nx = (54)^(1/3)\n\nx ≈ 3.78 meters\n\nNow we can find the height h:\n\nh = 27 / x^2\n\nh ≈ 27 / (3.78)^2\n\nh ≈ 1.89 meters\n\nSo the dimensions of the box that require the least material to be used in its construction are approximately 3.78 meters by 3.78 meters for the square base and 1.89 meters for the height."
