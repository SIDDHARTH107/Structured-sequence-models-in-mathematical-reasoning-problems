    "message_2": "To calculate the moving average for a period of 3 months, we will take the sum of the sales for each consecutive 3-month period and divide it by 3. We will do this for each possible 3-month period in the given data.\n\n1. Moving average for months 1-3:\n(100 units + 150 units + 200 units) / 3 = 450 units / 3 = 150 units\n\n2. Moving average for months 2-4:\n(150 units + 200 units + 175 units) / 3 = 525 units / 3 = 175 units\n\n3. Moving average for months 3-5:\n(200 units + 175 units + 120 units) / 3 = 495 units / 3 = 165 units\n\n4. Moving average for months 4-6:\n(175 units + 120 units + 250 units) / 3 = 545 units / 3 = 181.67 units (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the moving averages for the given monthly sales data for a period of 3 months are:\n\n150 units, 175 units, 165 units, and 181.67 units."
