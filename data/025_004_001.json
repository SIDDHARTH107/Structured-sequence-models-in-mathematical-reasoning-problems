    "message_2": "By Bézout's theorem, two curves in P^2 of degrees m and n intersect in exactly mn points, counted with multiplicity. In our case, we are looking for the intersection points of a curve C of degree d with lines, which are curves of degree 1.\n\nSo, when a line intersects C at d distinct points, it means that the intersection points have multiplicity 1. Since the total number of intersection points is d (by Bézout's theorem), we can conclude that the line intersects C transversally.\n\nNow, consider the dual curve C* in the dual projective plane (P^2)*. The points of C* correspond to the lines in P^2 that are tangent to C. By duality, the degree of C* is also d. \n\nA line in (P^2)* corresponds to a point in P^2. So, we are looking for the number of lines in (P^2)* that intersect C* at d distinct points. By Bézout's theorem again, this number is equal to the product of the degrees of the two curves, which is d * 1 = d.\n\nTherefore, there are d lines that intersect C at d distinct points."
