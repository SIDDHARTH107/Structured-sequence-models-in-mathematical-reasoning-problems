    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 24 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 24. Then, the prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 8 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, both of which are normal in G. Since P and Q have coprime orders, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C24.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, G acts on the set of left cosets of P by left multiplication, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all conjugates of P, which is a normal subgroup of G contained in P. Since P has order 8, its only nontrivial normal subgroup has order 4. Thus, the kernel has order 4, and the image of the homomorphism has order 6. This means that G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Q and the image, which is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D12 or the dicyclic group Q12.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. Let Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, G acts on the set of left cosets of Q by left multiplication, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S4. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all conjugates of Q, which is a normal subgroup of G contained in Q. Since Q has order 3, it is simple, and the kernel must be trivial. Thus, the image of the homomorphism has order 24, which means that G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S4. The only such subgroup is the alternating group A4.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, G acts on the set of left cosets of P by left multiplication, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all conjugates of P, which is a normal subgroup of G contained in P. Since P has order 8, its only nontrivial normal subgroup has order 4. Thus, the kernel has order 4, and the image of the homomorphism has order 6. This means that G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of a group of order 3 and the image, which is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D12 or the dicyclic group Q12.\n\nIn summary, a group of order 24 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A4, the dihedral group D12, the dicyclic group Q12, or one of the three other non-abelian groups of order 24 that can be obtained as semidirect products in Case 4. Note that A5 is not a possibility since it has order 60, not 24. To determine the specific group to which G is isomorphic, one would need additional information about the structure or properties of G."
