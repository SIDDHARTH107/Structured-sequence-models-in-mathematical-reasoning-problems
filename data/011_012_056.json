    "message_2": "To find the number of students who study at least one of the subjects, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nThe number of students who study math or science is the sum of the number of students who study each subject minus the number of students who study both subjects (to avoid double counting).\n\nSo, the number of students who study at least one of the subjects is:\n\n20 (students who study math) + 25 (students who study science) - 15 (students who study both) = 30 students."
