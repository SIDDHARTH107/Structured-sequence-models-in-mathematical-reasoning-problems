    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of \"at least 2 burglaries\" is \"0 or 1 burglaries\". So, we will find the probability of 0 or 1 burglaries occurring in the next 10 days and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least 2 burglaries.\n\nLet's first find the probability of 0 burglaries:\nThe probability of no burglary on a given day is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\nFor 0 burglaries in 10 days, the probability is (0.85)^10.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of exactly 1 burglary:\nWe can use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nwhere n is the number of trials (days), k is the number of successes (burglaries), p is the probability of success (0.15), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFor 1 burglary in 10 days:\nP(X=1) = C(10, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (0.85)^9\nC(10, 1) = 10 (10 ways to choose 1 day out of 10)\nP(X=1) = 10 * 0.15 * (0.85)^9\n\nNow, let's find the complement probability:\nP(at least 2 burglaries) = 1 - P(0 or 1 burglary)\nP(at least 2 burglaries) = 1 - [P(0 burglaries) + P(1 burglary)]\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\nP(0 burglaries) = (0.85)^10 ≈ 0.196\nP(1 burglary) = 10 * 0.15 * (0.85)^9 ≈ 0.391\n\nP(at least 2 burglaries) = 1 - (0.196 + 0.391) = 1 - 0.587 = 0.413\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 burglaries will occur in the neighborhood in the next 10 days is approximately 0.413 or 41.3%."
