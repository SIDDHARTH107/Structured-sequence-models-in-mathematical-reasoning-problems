Let $HF(M)$ and $HF(M_i)$ denote the Heegaard Floer homology of $M$ and $M_i$, respectively. \n\nIf $M$ is an integral homology sphere and $HF(M_i)$ has no torsion for $i=1,2$, prove that $HF(M)$ has no torsion.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $HF(M)$ has no torsion, we will use the connected sum formula for Heegaard Floer homology. The connected sum formula states that the Heegaard Floer homology of a connected sum of two 3-manifolds is given by the tensor product of their individual Heegaard Floer homologies:\n\n$$HF(M_1 \\# M_2) \\cong HF(M_1) \\otimes HF(M_2).$$\n\nSince $M = M_1 \\# M_2$, we have\n\n$$HF(M) \\cong HF(M_1) \\otimes HF(M_2).$$\n\nNow, we are given that $HF(M_i)$ has no torsion for $i = 1, 2$. This means that the homology groups $HF(M_1)$ and $HF(M_2)$ are free abelian groups. The tensor product of two free abelian groups is also a free abelian group, which implies that $HF(M)$ is a free abelian group.\n\nA free abelian group has no torsion elements, so we conclude that $HF(M)$ has no torsion."
