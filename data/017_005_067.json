    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 125 = 5^3. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. \n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, then it is normal in G. Let P be this Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the order of P is 5^2 = 25, P is a group of order 25. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in P, denoted by n_5(P), must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5(P) ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5(P) divides 25\n\nThe only possibility for n_5(P) is 1. Thus, P has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which implies that P is a cyclic group of order 25. Since G has a normal subgroup of order 25, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups to conclude that G is either a cyclic group of order 125 or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. \n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nIf there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, then each of them has order 5. Let P_1, P_2, ..., P_25 be these Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups is trivial, the total number of elements of order 5 in G is 25 * (5 - 1) = 100. Thus, there are 125 - 100 = 25 elements left in G, which must form a normal subgroup of order 25. Let H be this normal subgroup. Since H has order 25, it must be a cyclic group of order 25. \n\nNow, consider the direct product of H with any of the Sylow 5-subgroups, say P_1. The order of H × P_1 is 25 * 5 = 125, which is the same as the order of G. Moreover, the intersection of H and P_1 is trivial, as they are both Sylow 5-subgroups. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (P_1) and a group of order 25 (H).\n\nIn conclusion, G is either a cyclic group of order 125 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
