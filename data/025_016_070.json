    "message_1": "Let X be an algebraic variety, given by the equation X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 1 in projective 3-space over the field of complex numbers. Let Y be the subvariety, given by the equation X + Y + Z = 0. Calculate the degree of the birational map from X to its image in projective 2-space, which contracts Y to a point.",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the birational map, we first need to find a suitable map that contracts Y to a point. We can use the linear projection from the point P = (1, -1, 0) in projective 3-space to projective 2-space. This point P lies on the subvariety Y, as 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0.\n\nThe linear projection π: X → X' is given by π([X:Y:Z]) = [X:Y:Z] ↦ [X:Y:Z+1], where X' is the image of X in projective 2-space. Note that the point P is sent to the point at infinity [0:0:1] in projective 2-space.\n\nNow, we need to find the degree of this birational map. The degree of a birational map is the number of points in the preimage of a general point in the target space. In other words, we need to find the number of points in X that map to a general point in X' under the projection π.\n\nLet [x:y:z] be a general point in X'. Then, the preimage of this point under π is given by [x:y:z-1]. We need to find the number of solutions (x, y, z) that satisfy both the equation of X and the equation of Y:\n\n1. X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = 1\n2. X + Y + Z = 0\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n(X^2 + Y^2 + (-(X+Y))^2) = 1\n(X^2 + Y^2 + (X^2 + 2XY + Y^2)) = 1\n(2X^2 + 2Y^2 + 2XY) = 1\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nX^2 + Y^2 + XY = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the number of solutions (x, y, z) that satisfy this equation. Since we are working over the field of complex numbers, the equation has two distinct solutions for a general point in X'. Therefore, the degree of the birational map is 2."
