    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\frac{x+4}{x-3} = \\frac{2}{x+2}$, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n$(x+4)(x+2) = 2(x-3)$\n\nNow, we can expand both sides of the equation:\n\n$x^2 + 2x + 4x + 8 = 2x - 6$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$x^2 + 6x + 8 = 2x - 6$\n\nMove all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n$x^2 + 4x + 14 = 0$\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 14$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(14)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 56}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-40}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant (the value inside the square root) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation $\\frac{x+4}{x-3} = \\frac{2}{x+2}$ has no real solutions."
