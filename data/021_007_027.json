    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 9. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nUsing the initial guess x0 = 1.5:\n\nf(x0) = (1.5)^3 - 4(1.5) + 9 = 3.375 - 6 + 9 = 6.375\nf'(x0) = 3(1.5)^2 - 4 = 6.75 - 4 = 2.75\n\nx1 = 1.5 - (6.375 / 2.75) ≈ 1.5 - 2.318 = -0.818\n\nNow, we'll repeat the process using x1:\n\nf(x1) = (-0.818)^3 - 4(-0.818) + 9 ≈ -0.547\nf'(x1) = 3(-0.818)^2 - 4 ≈ 0.603\n\nx2 = -0.818 - (-0.547 / 0.603) ≈ -0.818 + 0.907 = 0.089\n\nWe can continue this process, but since the question asks for the answer rounded to two decimal places, we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 9 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 1.5 is approximately x ≈ 0.09."
