    "message_1": "A math teacher wants to display pictures on the classroom wall using different frames. There are three types of frames available with dimensions 2 cm x 3 cm, 4 cm x 6 cm, and 5 cm x 10 cm. What is the smallest length of wall on which the teacher can display an equal number of each type of framed picture without wasting any frame?",
    "message_2": "To find the smallest length of the wall on which the teacher can display an equal number of each type of framed picture without wasting any frame, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the widths of the frames.\n\nThe widths of the frames are 2 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each width:\n2 = 2\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n\nNow, find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor and multiplying them together:\nLCM = 2^2 * 5 = 4 * 5 = 20 cm\n\nSo, the smallest length of the wall on which the teacher can display an equal number of each type of framed picture without wasting any frame is 20 cm."
