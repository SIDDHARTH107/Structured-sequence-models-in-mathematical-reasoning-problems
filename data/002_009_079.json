    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is its total surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the height (h) is 10 cm and the radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2π(4)² + 2π(4)(10)\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2π(16) + 2π(40)\n\nTotal Surface Area = 32π + 80π\n\nTotal Surface Area = 112π\n\nNow, we can multiply by the value of π (approximately 3.1416):\n\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 112 * 3.1416\n\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 351.8592 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is approximately 351.86 cm²."
