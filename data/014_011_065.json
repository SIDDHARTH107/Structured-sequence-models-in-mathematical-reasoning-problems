    "message_1": "A company wants to encrypt a secret message using a transposition cipher. The message has 21 letters (including spaces) and they want to arrange it in a 3 x 7 grid before encrypting it. The company also decides to use every other column to encrypt the message. What is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information. Specifically, we need the original secret message that the company wants to encrypt. Once we have that, we can arrange the message in a 3 x 7 grid and apply the transposition cipher as described."
