    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company makes a profit of $6 for each unit of Product A sold and $8 for each unit of Product B sold. The production of each unit of Product A requires 4 labor hours and 2 machine hours, while the production of each unit of Product B requires 2 labor hours and 4 machine hours. The company has 1000 labor hours available per week, and 800 machine hours available per week. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce per week to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 6x + 8y\n\nThe constraints for labor hours and machine hours are:\n4x + 2y ≤ 1000 (labor hours)\n2x + 4y ≤ 800 (machine hours)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints for x and y.\n\nFor labor hours constraint:\n4x + 2y ≤ 1000\n2x + y ≤ 500\ny ≤ -2x + 500\n\nFor machine hours constraint:\n2x + 4y ≤ 800\nx + 2y ≤ 400\ny ≤ -0.5x + 200\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these constraints. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 200), (200, 150), and (250, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P = 6x + 8y at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 6(0) + 8(0) = $0\nP(0, 200) = 6(0) + 8(200) = $1600\nP(200, 150) = 6(200) + 8(150) = $2400\nP(250, 0) = 6(250) + 8(0) = $1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (200, 150), where the company produces 200 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B per week, resulting in a profit of $2400."
