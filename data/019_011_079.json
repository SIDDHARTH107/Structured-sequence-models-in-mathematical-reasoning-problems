    "message_2": "To determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, we can use the method of proof by contradiction or the method of elimination.\n\nProof by contradiction:\nAssume the opposite of the conclusion, i.e., it is raining. \nFrom P1, if it is raining, the street is wet.\nFrom P3, since it is raining, the sprinkler must not be on (because it is either raining or the sprinkler is on, not both).\nFrom P2, if the sprinkler is not on, the garden is not wet.\nFrom P4, the garden is not wet.\n\nThere is no contradiction in the premises, so the assumption that it is raining is false. Therefore, the conclusion C: It is not raining follows logically from the premises.\n\nMethod of elimination:\nFrom P3, we know that either it is raining or the sprinkler is on.\nFrom P4, we know that the garden is not wet.\n\nIf the sprinkler is on, then the garden is wet (P2). But we know the garden is not wet (P4), so the sprinkler cannot be on. Therefore, it must be raining.\n\nHowever, if it is raining, then the street is wet (P1). We don't have any information about the street, so we cannot eliminate this option.\n\nSince we cannot eliminate the possibility that it is raining, we cannot conclude that it is not raining (C) based on the given premises."
