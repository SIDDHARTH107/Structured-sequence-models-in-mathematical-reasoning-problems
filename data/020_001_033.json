    "message_1": "A farmer has 100 acres of farmland and wants to maximize his profits by growing crops of corn and wheat. The cost of planting an acre of corn is $200, and the cost of planting an acre of wheat is $150. The farmer has a budget of $25,000 for planting this season. An acre of corn will yield a profit of $1,000, and an acre of wheat will yield a profit of $800. Determine the optimal number of acres of each crop the farmer should plant to maximize his profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of wheat. We are given the following constraints:\n\n1. The total number of acres is 100: x + y = 100\n2. The total cost of planting cannot exceed $25,000: 200x + 150y ≤ 25,000\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 1000x + 800y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the first constraint for y:\n\ny = 100 - x\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for y into the second constraint:\n\n200x + 150(100 - x) ≤ 25,000\n200x + 15,000 - 150x ≤ 25,000\n50x ≤ 10,000\nx ≤ 200\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative, we have the following bounds for x and y:\n\n0 ≤ x ≤ 200\n0 ≤ y ≤ 100\n\nNow, we will substitute the expression for y back into the profit function:\n\nP(x) = 1000x + 800(100 - x)\nP(x) = 1000x + 80,000 - 800x\nP(x) = 200x + 80,000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we will check the critical points and the endpoints of the feasible region:\n\n1. Differentiate P(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndP(x)/dx = 200 = 0\n\nSince the derivative is a constant, there are no critical points.\n\n2. Check the endpoints:\n\nP(0) = 200(0) + 80,000 = 80,000\nP(200) = 200(200) + 80,000 = 120,000\n\nHowever, x = 200 is not a feasible solution because it would require planting 200 acres of corn, which exceeds the 100-acre limit. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the constraints.\n\nFrom the constraint 200x + 150y ≤ 25,000, we can find the maximum value of x:\n\n200x + 150(100 - x) = 25,000\n50x = 10,000\nx = 200\n\nHowever, this solution is not feasible because it would require planting 200 acres of corn, which exceeds the 100-acre limit. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the constraints.\n\nFrom the constraint x + y = 100, we can find the maximum value of x:\n\nx = 100 - y\n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the constraint 200x + 150y ≤ 25,000:\n\n200(100 - y) + 150y ≤ 25,000\n20,000 - 200y + 150y ≤ 25,000\n-50y ≤ 5,000\ny ≥ 100\n\nSince y must be non-negative and less than or equal to 100, the maximum value of y is 100. Therefore, the maximum value of x is:\n\nx = 100 - y\nx = 100 - 100\nx = 0\n\nSo the optimal solution is to plant 0 acres of corn and 100 acres of wheat. The maximum profit is:\n\nP(0, 100) = 1000(0) + 800(100) = 80,000"
