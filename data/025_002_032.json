Let $W = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{C}^3: x = 0\\}$ be a plane. Compute the intersection number $I(V_1 \\cap W, V_2)$ where $V_1 \\cap W$ denotes the intersection of $V_1$ with $W$ in $\\mathbb{C}^3$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection points of $V_1 \\cap W$. Since $W$ is defined by $x = 0$, we can substitute this into the equation for $V_1$:\n\n$0^2 + y^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 1$\n\nThis gives us two points in the intersection of $V_1$ and $W$: $(0, 1, z)$ and $(0, -1, z)$, where $z$ can be any complex number.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection points of $V_2 \\cap W$. Similarly, we substitute $x = 0$ into the equation for $V_2$:\n\n$0^2 + z^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow z^2 = 1$\n\nThis gives us two points in the intersection of $V_2$ and $W$: $(0, y, 1)$ and $(0, y, -1)$, where $y$ can be any complex number.\n\nNow we want to find the intersection number $I(V_1 \\cap W, V_2)$. This is the number of intersection points of $V_1 \\cap W$ and $V_2$ counted with multiplicity. We can see that the intersection points are $(0, 1, 1)$, $(0, 1, -1)$, $(0, -1, 1)$, and $(0, -1, -1)$. Since there are no multiplicities in this case, the intersection number is simply the number of intersection points, which is 4."
