Iterate through the array from the second element to the nth element.\n3. If the current element is greater than the current value of max, update max.\n4. Return max.\n\nAssume that each comparison and assignment operation takes one unit of time.",
    "message_2": "The time complexity of the given algorithm for finding the maximum element in an array of n elements is O(n). This is because the algorithm iterates through the array once, comparing each element to the current max value. Since there are n elements in the array, the algorithm performs n-1 comparisons (as it starts from the second element), resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n)."
