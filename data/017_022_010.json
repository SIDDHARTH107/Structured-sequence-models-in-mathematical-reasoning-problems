    "message_2": "To prove that there are exactly 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we will first analyze the possible structures of groups of order 60 and then count the non-abelian ones.\n\nA group of order 60 has the prime factorization 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 2^2 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 2^2 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1, 4, or 12.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since all Sylow subgroups are normal, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups: G = P_2 × P_3 × P_5. This group is abelian, so it is not a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_2 × P_3) ⋊ P_5. There are 6 possible isomorphisms from P_5 to Aut(P_2 × P_3), but only 2 of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 2 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_2 × P_5) ⋊ P_3. There are 4 possible isomorphisms from P_3 to Aut(P_2 × P_5), but only 2 of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 2 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, which is normal. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_2 × P_3) ⋊ P_5. There are 6 possible isomorphisms from P_5 to Aut(P_2 × P_3), and all of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 6 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 5: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, both of which are normal. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_2 × P_3) ⋊ P_5. There are 4 possible isomorphisms from P_5 to Aut(P_2 × P_3), and all of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 4 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 6: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, which is normal. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_2 × P_5) ⋊ P_3. There are 6 possible isomorphisms from P_3 to Aut(P_2 × P_5), and all of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 6 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 7: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, which is normal. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_3 × P_5) ⋊ P_2. There are 2 possible isomorphisms from P_2 to Aut(P_3 × P_5), and both of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 2 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 8: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 4\nIn this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups. The group G can be written as a semi-direct product G = (P_2 × P_3 × P_5) ⋊ K, where K is a subgroup of order 2. There are 12 possible isomorphisms from K to Aut(P_2 × P_3 × P_5), and all of them yield non-abelian groups. Thus, there are 12 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nAdding up the non-abelian groups from all cases, we have 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 12 = 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
