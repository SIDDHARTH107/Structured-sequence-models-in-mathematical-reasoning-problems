    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. We know that 18 = 2 * 3^2, so by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of G with order 9 and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q of G with order 2. \n\nFirst, we will determine the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, n_3 must divide 18 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. However, only 1 and 9 satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_3 = 9, then there are 9 Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n\nNow, we will determine the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, n_2 must divide 18 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 9, and 18. However, only 1 and 9 satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_2 = 9, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n\nCase 1: G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup P.\nIn this case, P is normal in G, and |P| = 9. Since |G| = 18, we have |G/P| = 2. Therefore, G/P is a cyclic group of order 2. By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a subgroup Q of G such that Q/P is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G/P. Since |Q/P| = 2, we have |Q| = 2 * |P| = 18. Thus, Q = G, and G is a semidirect product of P and Q. Since P is a cyclic group of order 9 and Q is a cyclic group of order 2, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (c).\n\nCase 2: G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup Q.\nIn this case, Q is normal in G, and |Q| = 2. Since |G| = 18, we have |G/Q| = 9. Therefore, G/Q is a cyclic group of order 9. By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a subgroup P of G such that P/Q is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G/Q. Since |P/Q| = 9, we have |P| = 9 * |Q| = 18. Thus, P = G, and G is a semidirect product of Q and P. Since Q is a cyclic group of order 2 and P is a cyclic group of order 9, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18 (a).\n\nCase 3: G has 9 Sylow 3-subgroups and 9 Sylow 2-subgroups.\nIn this case, none of the Sylow 3-subgroups or Sylow 2-subgroups are normal in G. Therefore, G cannot be a semidirect product of a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup. Thus, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18 (b).\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group G, we cannot determine which of the three options G is isomorphic to. It could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C18 (a), the non-abelian group of order 18 (b), or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 (c)."
