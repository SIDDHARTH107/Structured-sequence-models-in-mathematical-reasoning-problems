    "message_1": "In a Bertrand Competition game, two firms are selling identical products with a fixed cost of $100. Firm A chooses a price of $200 and Firm B chooses a price of $180. What is the profit for each firm?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand Competition, consumers will buy from the firm with the lowest price, assuming the products are identical. In this case, Firm B has the lower price at $180, so all consumers will buy from Firm B.\n\nTo calculate the profit for each firm, we need to subtract the fixed cost from the price they chose.\n\nFor Firm A:\nPrice chosen: $200\nFixed cost: $100\nSince Firm A doesn't sell any products, their profit is $0.\n\nFor Firm B:\nPrice chosen: $180\nFixed cost: $100\nProfit: $180 - $100 = $80\n\nSo, the profit for Firm A is $0 and the profit for Firm B is $80."
