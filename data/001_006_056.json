    "message_2": "To find the vertex and axis of symmetry of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 4x + 5, we first need to rewrite the equation in vertex form, which is given by:\n\ny = a(x - h)² + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola, and a is the leading coefficient (in this case, a = 2).\n\nTo rewrite the given equation in vertex form, we can complete the square:\n\ny = 2x² + 4x + 5\n\ny = 2(x² + 2x) + 5\n\nNow, we need to find a value that, when added and subtracted inside the parentheses, will complete the square. This value is given by (B/2)², where B is the coefficient of the linear term (in this case, B = 2):\n\n(B/2)² = (2/2)² = 1² = 1\n\nNow we add and subtract this value inside the parentheses:\n\ny = 2(x² + 2x + 1 - 1) + 5\n\ny = 2((x² + 2x + 1) - 1) + 5\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a perfect square:\n\ny = 2((x + 1)² - 1) + 5\n\nNow, distribute the 2:\n\ny = 2(x + 1)² - 2 + 5\n\nCombine the constants:\n\ny = 2(x + 1)² + 3\n\nNow, the equation is in vertex form, and we can identify the vertex (h, k) as (-1, 3). The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = h\n\nx = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 4x + 5 is (-1, 3), and the axis of symmetry is x = -1."
