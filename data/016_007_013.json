    "message_1": "What is the total number of cubes that make up an n-th iteration of the Menger sponge construction, where n is a positive integer?\n\nFor example, for the first iteration (n=1), the Menger sponge consists of 20 cubes. For the second iteration (n=2), it consists of 400 cubes.",
    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes in the first iteration.\n\nFor the n-th iteration, the number of cubes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal number of cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nSo, for the n-th iteration of the Menger sponge construction, the total number of cubes is 20^n."
