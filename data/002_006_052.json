    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 14 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 14 cm\n\nUsing the value of π (approximately 3.14159):\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 14 cm\nC ≈ 43.98226 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle with a diameter of 14 cm is approximately 43.98 cm."
