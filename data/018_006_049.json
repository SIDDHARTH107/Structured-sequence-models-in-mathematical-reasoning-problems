    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set, and let A be a subset of U. If U has 100 elements and A has 70 elements, how many elements are in A complement? Use set theory to prove that the union of A and its complement is U.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the complement of A, denoted as A', we can use the formula:\n\n|A'| = |U| - |A|\n\nWhere |A'| represents the number of elements in A', |U| represents the number of elements in U, and |A| represents the number of elements in A.\n\nGiven that |U| = 100 and |A| = 70, we can find the number of elements in A' as follows:\n\n|A'| = 100 - 70\n|A'| = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 elements in the complement of A (A').\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of A and its complement is U using set theory. According to the definition of a complement, every element in the universal set U is either in A or in A', but not in both. In other words, A and A' are disjoint sets, meaning they have no elements in common.\n\nThe union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. Since A and A' are disjoint, the union of A and A' will contain all elements that are in A or in A' (which includes all elements in U).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that A ∪ A' = U."
