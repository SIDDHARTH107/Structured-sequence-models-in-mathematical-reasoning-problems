    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The production process of each product requires the use of two different resources: Resource 1 and Resource 2. The company has a total of 800 units of Resource 1 and 1000 units of Resource 2 available for production per day. Each unit of Product A requires 4 units of Resource 1 and 5 units of Resource 2, while each unit of Product B requires 6 units of Resource 1 and 3 units of Resource 2. The profit per unit of Product A is $15 and the profit per unit of Product B is $20. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce per day to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 800 (Resource 1 constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 1000 (Resource 2 constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nP = 15x + 20y\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we can evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the constraints as follows:\n\ny ≤ (800 - 4x) / 6\ny ≤ (1000 - 5x) / 3\n\nNow, let's plot these constraints along with the non-negativity constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ (800 - 4x) / 6\n2. y ≤ (1000 - 5x) / 3\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 166.67), (200, 0), and (120, 80).\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function P = 15x + 20y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 15(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 166.67) = 15(0) + 20(166.67) = $3,333.40\n3. P(200, 0) = 15(200) + 20(0) = $3,000\n4. P(120, 80) = 15(120) + 20(80) = $4,800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (120, 80), with a total profit of $4,800. Therefore, the company should produce 120 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B per day to maximize profit."
