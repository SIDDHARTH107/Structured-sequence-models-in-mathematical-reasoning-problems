    "message_1": "A company conducted a survey of 500 employees asking about their job satisfaction, salary, and work-life balance. The results were recorded in a data matrix of size 500 x 3. Using principal component analysis, determine the number of principal components that account for at least 80% of the total variability in the data.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of principal components that account for at least 80% of the total variability in the data, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data: Since the variables (job satisfaction, salary, and work-life balance) are likely measured on different scales, we need to standardize the data matrix to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each variable.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data to measure the linear relationship between the variables.\n\n3. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Find the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component, and the eigenvectors represent the direction of the principal components in the original feature space.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order: Arrange the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in descending order. This will give us the principal components in order of their importance (i.e., the amount of variance they explain).\n\n5. Calculate the cumulative explained variance: Compute the cumulative sum of the explained variance by each principal component, and divide it by the total variance (sum of all eigenvalues). This will give us the proportion of the total variability explained by each principal component.\n\n6. Determine the number of principal components: Find the smallest number of principal components that account for at least 80% of the total variability in the data.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data matrix, we cannot perform these calculations directly. However, this is the general procedure to follow when using principal component analysis to determine the number of principal components that account for a certain percentage of the total variability in the data."
