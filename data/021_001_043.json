    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  4 |\n| 2 -1  1 | -1 |\n| 3  4 -2 |  8 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  4 |\n| 0 -5  7 | -9 |\n| 0 -2  7 | -4 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 + 2/5 * R2\n\n| 1  2 -3 |  4  |\n| 0 -5  7 | -9  |\n| 0  0  1 | -1/5|\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = -1/5.\n\nNow substitute the value of z in the second row to find y:\n\n-5y + 7(-1/5) = -9\n-5y - 7/5 = -9\ny = (9 - (-7/5))/5 = 52/5\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z in the first row to find x:\n\nx + 2(52/5) - 3(-1/5) = 4\nx = 4 - 104/5 + 3/5 = 1/5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1/5, y = 52/5, and z = -1/5."
