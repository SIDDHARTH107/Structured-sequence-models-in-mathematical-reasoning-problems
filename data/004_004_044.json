    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x^2 - 3x + 5 between the limits x = 1 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the indefinite integral of the function:\n\nâˆ«(2x^2 - 3x + 5)dx = (2/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + 5x + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the definite integral between the limits x = 1 and x = 3:\n\n[(2/3)(3^3) - (3/2)(3^2) + 5(3)] - [(2/3)(1^3) - (3/2)(1^2) + 5(1)]\n\n= [(2/3)(27) - (3/2)(9) + 15] - [(2/3)(1) - (3/2)(1) + 5]\n\n= [18 - 13.5 + 15] - [2/3 - 3/2 + 5]\n\n= [19.5] - [11/6]\n\n= 19.5 - 1.8333\n\n= 17.6667\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x^2 - 3x + 5 between the limits x = 1 and x = 3 is approximately 17.67 square units."
