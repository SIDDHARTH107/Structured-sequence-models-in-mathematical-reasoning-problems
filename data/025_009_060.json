    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space of smooth genus 3 (degree 4) algebraic curves passing through 8 general points in the projective plane, we can use the following formula:\n\nDimension = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2 - 3g + 3 - n\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve, g is the genus, and n is the number of general points.\n\nIn this case, d = 4, g = 3, and n = 8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDimension = (4 - 1)(4 - 2)/2 - 3(3) + 3 - 8\nDimension = (3)(2)/2 - 9 + 3 - 8\nDimension = 3 - 9 + 3 - 8\nDimension = -11\n\nHowever, the dimension of the moduli space cannot be negative. This means that there is no moduli space of smooth genus 3 (degree 4) algebraic curves passing through 8 general points in the projective plane. In other words, it is not possible to find such curves that satisfy the given conditions."
