    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. In this case, we want to minimize the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) within the interval [0, 2π]. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem using PSO:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Create 20 particles with random positions and velocities within the interval [0, 2π].\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle: Evaluate the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) for each particle's position.\n\n3. Update personal best (pBest) and global best (gBest): For each particle, if the current fitness is better than its pBest, update its pBest. Then, compare each particle's pBest with the gBest. If a particle's pBest is better than the current gBest, update the gBest.\n\n4. Update the particles' velocities and positions: For each particle, update its velocity and position using the following equations:\n\n   - v_i(t+1) = v_i(t) + c1 * rand() * (pBest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * rand() * (gBest - x_i(t))\n   - x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n\n   where v_i(t) is the current velocity of particle i, x_i(t) is the current position of particle i, c1 and c2 are the cognitive and social learning factors, and rand() is a random number between 0 and 1.\n\n5. Apply the maximum velocity limiting factor (Vmax): If the updated velocity of a particle exceeds Vmax, set its velocity to Vmax.\n\n6. Check for convergence: Repeat steps 2-5 for 100 iterations or until the change in gBest is smaller than a predefined threshold.\n\nAfter completing these steps, the gBest will represent the minimum value of the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) within the interval [0, 2π]. Note that this is a heuristic algorithm, and the result might not be the exact global minimum, but it should be a good approximation."
