    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by successively replacing each square in the pattern with a smaller version of the pattern itself. In each iteration, the perimeter of the fractal increases.\n\nFor the first iteration, the perimeter is given as 12 units. In the second iteration, each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller square is added at the center of each side. This results in 5 smaller squares on each side, so the perimeter of the second iteration is 12 * (5/3) = 20 units.\n\nFor the third iteration, the same process is repeated for each of the smaller squares. Each side of the smaller squares is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller square is added at the center of each side. This results in 5 smaller squares on each side of the smaller squares, so the perimeter of the third iteration is 20 * (5/3) = 100/3 units.\n\nFor the fourth iteration, the process is repeated again for each of the smaller squares in the third iteration. Each side of these smaller squares is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller square is added at the center of each side. This results in 5 smaller squares on each side of the smaller squares, so the perimeter of the fourth iteration is (100/3) * (5/3) = 500/9 units.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal is 500/9 units."
