    "message_2": "To find the probability of either theft or vandalism, we simply add the individual probabilities of each event. \n\nProbability of theft = 0.30\nProbability of vandalism = 0.20\n\nProbability of theft or vandalism = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen incident in the neighborhood is either theft or vandalism is 0.50 or 50%."
