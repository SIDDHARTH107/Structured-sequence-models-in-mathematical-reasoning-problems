    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, product A and product B. The profit for each unit of product A is $10 and for product B it is $15. The company has a limited time of 50 hours per week for production. It takes 2 hours to produce a unit of product A and 3 hours to produce a unit of product B. The company wants to maximize its profit. Using bat algorithm, determine how many units of each product the company should produce per week to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "The bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. However, this problem can be solved more easily using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints (production time):\n2x + 3y ≤ 50 hours\n\nNon-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraint:\n\n2x + 3y = 50\ny = (50 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area below the line y = (50 - 2x) / 3 and above the x and y axes.\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 16.67), and (25, 0). We will now evaluate the objective function at these points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 16.67) = 10(0) + 15(16.67) = $250.05 (rounded to two decimal places)\nP(25, 0) = 10(25) + 15(0) = $250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 16.67), which means the company should produce 0 units of product A and approximately 16.67 units of product B per week to maximize its profit. However, since the company can only produce whole units, they should produce 17 units of product B, which will result in a profit of $255."
