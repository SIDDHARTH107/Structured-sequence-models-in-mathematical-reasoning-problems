    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of chairs: A and B. Each chair of type A requires 3 meters of fabric, 20 screws, and 10 minutes of labor to produce. Each chair of type B requires 4 meters of fabric, 10 screws, and 15 minutes of labor to produce. The company has 150 meters of fabric, 900 screws, and 675 minutes of labor available. The profit per chair of type A is $20 and for type B is $25. What is the maximum profit the company can make from producing chairs?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs of type A and y be the number of chairs of type B.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\nFabric: 3x + 4y ≤ 150\nScrews: 20x + 10y ≤ 900\nLabor: 10x + 15y ≤ 675\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 25y.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1) Fabric constraint:\n3x + 4y ≤ 150\nWe can solve for y:\ny ≤ (150 - 3x) / 4\n\n2) Screws constraint:\n20x + 10y ≤ 900\nWe can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by 10:\n2x + y ≤ 90\nNow, solve for y:\ny ≤ 90 - 2x\n\n3) Labor constraint:\n10x + 15y ≤ 675\nWe can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by 5:\n2x + 3y ≤ 135\nNow, solve for y:\ny ≤ (135 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1) Intersection of fabric and screws constraints:\n3x + 4y = 150\n20x + 10y = 900\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate y:\n30x + 40y = 1500\n40x + 20y = 1800\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n10x = 300\nx = 30\n\nNow, substitute x back into the fabric constraint to find y:\n3(30) + 4y = 150\n90 + 4y = 150\n4y = 60\ny = 15\n\nSo, the intersection point is (30, 15).\n\n2) Intersection of fabric and labor constraints:\n3x + 4y = 150\n2x + 3y = 135\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4 to eliminate x:\n9x + 12y = 450\n8x + 12y = 540\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n-x = -90\nx = 90\n\nNow, substitute x back into the fabric constraint to find y:\n3(90) + 4y = 150\n270 + 4y = 150\n4y = -120\ny = -30\n\nSince y cannot be negative, there is no intersection point between the fabric and labor constraints.\n\n3) Intersection of screws and labor constraints:\n2x + y = 90\n2x + 3y = 135\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 3 to eliminate y:\n6x + 3y = 270\n2x + 3y = 135\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n4x = 135\nx = 33.75\n\nSince x must be a whole number, there is no intersection point between the screws and labor constraints.\n\nNow we need to check the feasible region's vertices (0, 0), (30, 15), (45, 0), and (0, 45) in the profit function:\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 25(0) = $0\nP(30, 15) = 20(30) + 25(15) = $600 + $375 = $975\nP(45, 0) = 20(45) + 25(0) = $900\nP(0, 45) = 20(0) + 25(45) = $1125\n\nThe maximum profit is $1125 when producing 0 chairs of type A and 45 chairs of type B."
