    "message_1": "A researcher wants to test whether the mean lifespan of three species of butterflies are the same or not. She collected a sample of 10 butterflies from each species and recorded their lifespans in days. Using ANOVA at a 5% significance level, can she conclude that the means of the lifespans of the three species are different? \n\nHere are the lifespans (in days):\nSpecies 1: 6, 8, 7, 9, 10, 11, 8, 7, 6, 9\nSpecies 2: 12, 14, 15, 13, 14, 15, 16, 13, 12, 13\nSpecies 3: 7, 6, 8, 7, 9, 8, 9, 10, 7, 8",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and the F-statistic. Then, we will compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table at a 5% significance level.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the means of each group and the overall mean.\nSpecies 1 mean (M1) = (6+8+7+9+10+11+8+7+6+9)/10 = 81/10 = 8.1\nSpecies 2 mean (M2) = (12+14+15+13+14+15+16+13+12+13)/10 = 137/10 = 13.7\nSpecies 3 mean (M3) = (7+6+8+7+9+8+9+10+7+8)/10 = 79/10 = 7.9\n\nOverall mean (M) = (81+137+79)/30 = 297/30 = 9.9\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB).\nSSB = Σn_i(M_i - M)^2\nSSB = 10*(8.1-9.9)^2 + 10*(13.7-9.9)^2 + 10*(7.9-9.9)^2\nSSB = 10*(-1.8)^2 + 10*(3.8)^2 + 10*(-2)^2\nSSB = 32.4 + 144.4 + 40 = 216.8\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW).\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - M_i)^2\nFor Species 1: Σ(x_ij - 8.1)^2 = 14.4\nFor Species 2: Σ(x_ij - 13.7)^2 = 14.4\nFor Species 3: Σ(x_ij - 7.9)^2 = 14.4\nSSW = 14.4 + 14.4 + 14.4 = 43.2\n\nStep 4: Calculate the F-statistic.\nF = (SSB/(k-1)) / (SSW/(N-k))\nHere, k is the number of groups (3) and N is the total number of observations (30).\nF = (216.8/(3-1)) / (43.2/(30-3))\nF = (216.8/2) / (43.2/27)\nF = 108.4 / 1.6\nF = 67.75\n\nStep 5: Find the critical value from the F-distribution table.\nAt a 5% significance level and with degrees of freedom (2, 27), the critical value is approximately 3.35.\n\nStep 6: Compare the F-statistic to the critical value.\nSince the F-statistic (67.75) is greater than the critical value (3.35), we reject the null hypothesis that the means of the lifespans of the three species are the same.\n\nConclusion:\nAt a 5% significance level, the researcher can conclude that the means of the lifespans of the three species are different."
