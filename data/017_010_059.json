    "message_2": "There are two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 10. These are:\n\n1. The cyclic group C_10 (also denoted as Z_10), which is generated by a single element of order 10.\n2. The dihedral group D_5 (also denoted as D_{10}), which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon.\n\nProof:\n\nLet G be a group of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since 5 is prime, P_5 is cyclic and isomorphic to Z_5. Similarly, P_2 is isomorphic to Z_2.\n\nNow, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide the order of the group (10) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means that P_5 is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSince P_2 and P_5 have coprime orders, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_2 ∩ P_5 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, we can form the product set P_2P_5 = {ab | a ∈ P_2, b ∈ P_5}. This set has 10 elements, which are all distinct since the intersection of P_2 and P_5 is trivial. Thus, P_2P_5 = G.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: P_2 is also a normal subgroup of G. In this case, G is the direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_5 ≅ Z_2 × Z_5 ≅ Z_10. This gives us the cyclic group of order 10.\n\nCase 2: P_2 is not a normal subgroup of G. In this case, we can show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_5. Let a be a generator of P_5 and b be a generator of P_2. Since P_5 is normal in G, we have b⁻¹ab ∈ P_5 for all a ∈ P_5. Let b⁻¹ab = a^r for some r. Then, we have:\n\nb⁻¹a^2b = (b⁻¹ab)(b⁻¹ab) = a^r a^r = a^(2r)\nb⁻¹a^3b = (b⁻¹ab)(b⁻¹a^2b) = a^r a^(2r) = a^(3r)\n...\nb⁻¹a^5b = (b⁻¹a^4b)(b⁻¹ab) = a^(4r) a^r = a^(5r)\n\nSince a^5 = e, we have a^(5r) = e, which implies that 5r is a multiple of 5. Thus, r is an integer. Since a and b have orders 5 and 2, respectively, we can define the operation * on the set {a^i b^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ 4, 0 ≤ j ≤ 1} as follows:\n\n(a^i b^j) * (a^k b^l) = a^(i + k) b^(j + l - r^l k)\n\nThis operation makes G isomorphic to the dihedral group D_5.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 10: the cyclic group C_10 and the dihedral group D_5. Each group of order 10 is isomorphic to exactly one of these classes."
