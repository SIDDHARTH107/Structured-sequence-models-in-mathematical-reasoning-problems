    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers \"c\" for which the function f_c(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. A point \"c\" is in the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with z = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of z remains bounded.\n\nTo find the smallest value of \"c\" that causes the formula to diverge after 50 iterations, we can use the fact that if the absolute value of z ever becomes greater than 2, the sequence will diverge. We can then iterate the formula for each value of \"c\" and check if it diverges after 50 iterations.\n\nHere's a simple algorithm to find the smallest value of \"c\" that causes divergence after 50 iterations:\n\n1. Initialize c = 0 + 0i\n2. Iterate the formula z = z^2 + c for 50 times, starting with z = 0\n3. If the absolute value of z becomes greater than 2 at any point during the iterations, increment c by a small value (e.g., 0.001) and repeat steps 2-3\n4. If the absolute value of z remains less than or equal to 2 after 50 iterations, return the current value of c as the smallest value that causes divergence\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can find the smallest value of \"c\" that causes the Mandelbrot set formula to diverge after 50 iterations when z is initialized to 0 + 0i. Note that the result will depend on the increment value used in step 3, and the smaller the increment, the more accurate the result will be."
