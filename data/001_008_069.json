    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 < 13, we need to isolate x. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 5 - 5 < 13 - 5\n   2x < 8\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   (2x)/2 < 8/2\n   x < 4\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the inequality 2x + 5 < 13 are x < 4."
