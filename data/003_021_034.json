    "message_1": "Suppose you have two vectors, vector A with components (3, 4) and vector B with components (6, -8). Using trigonometry, find the angle between these two vectors, rounded to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product of two vectors A and B is given by:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(6² + (-8)²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the vectors:\n\nA · B = (3 * 6) + (4 * -8) = 18 - 32 = -14\n\nNow we can use the dot product formula to find the angle:\n\n-14 = (5)(10)cos(θ)\n-14 = 50cos(θ)\ncos(θ) = -14/50\nθ = arccos(-14/50)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 107.18°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 107°."
