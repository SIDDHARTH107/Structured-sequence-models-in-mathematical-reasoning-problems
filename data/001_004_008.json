    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 2x² + 8x + 6, we can first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients, which is 2. We can then factor out the GCF:\n\n2(x² + 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials that multiply to x² + 4x + 3. To do this, we need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (3) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (4).\n\nThe two numbers that meet these conditions are 3 and 1, since 3 × 1 = 3 and 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, we can factor the quadratic expression as (x + 3)(x + 1).\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 2x² + 8x + 6 is:\n\n2(x + 3)(x + 1)"
