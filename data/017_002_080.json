    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we first need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 8. The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding subgroup.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\n2. Subgroups of order 2: We need to find elements of order 2 in G. Since G is cyclic, we know that the order of an element divides the order of the group. The element a^4 has order 2 because (a^4)^2 = a^8 = e. So, the subgroup generated by a^4 is of order 2, which is {e, a^4}.\n\n3. Subgroups of order 4: We need to find elements of order 4 in G. The element a^2 has order 4 because (a^2)^4 = a^8 = e. So, the subgroup generated by a^2 is of order 4, which is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6}.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 8: The entire group G itself, generated by the element a, is a subgroup of order 8.\n\nNow, we need to prove that every subgroup of G is cyclic. We have already found all the subgroups of G, so we just need to show that each of them is cyclic.\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {e} is cyclic, as it is generated by the identity element e.\n\n2. The subgroup {e, a^4} is cyclic, as it is generated by the element a^4.\n\n3. The subgroup {e, a^2, a^4, a^6} is cyclic, as it is generated by the element a^2.\n\n4. The entire group G is cyclic by definition, as it is generated by the element a.\n\nThus, we have shown that every subgroup of G is cyclic."
