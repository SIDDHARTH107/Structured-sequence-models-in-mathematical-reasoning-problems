    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition with two firms, where Firm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower. The market demand curve is given by P=100-Q where P is price and Q is quantity. The cost function for each firm is C(Qi) = 10Qi, where Qi is the quantity produced by firm i. Assume that Firm 1 announces its quantity first, and Firm 2 observes it before choosing its own quantity. What is the optimal quantity of each firm, and what are the corresponding profits?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction function for Firm 2 (the follower) and then find the optimal quantity for Firm 1 (the leader) taking into account Firm 2's reaction function.\n\nFirst, let's find the profit function for each firm. Profit is given by the revenue minus the cost:\n\nπi = (P * Qi) - C(Qi)\n\nThe revenue for each firm is given by the price multiplied by the quantity produced:\n\nRi = P * Qi = (100 - Q) * Qi = (100 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Qi\n\nThe cost function is given as C(Qi) = 10Qi.\n\nNow, let's find the profit function for each firm:\n\nπ1 = R1 - C(Q1) = (100 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q1 - 10Q1\nπ2 = R2 - C(Q2) = (100 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 10Q2\n\nNext, we need to find the reaction function for Firm 2. To do this, we will maximize Firm 2's profit with respect to Q2, taking Q1 as given:\n\n∂π2/∂Q2 = ∂((100 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 10Q2)/∂Q2 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2, we get the reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nQ2 = (90 - Q1)/2\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal quantity for Firm 1, taking into account Firm 2's reaction function. We will substitute the reaction function into Firm 1's profit function:\n\nπ1 = (100 - (Q1 + (90 - Q1)/2)) * Q1 - 10Q1\n\nSimplifying the profit function:\n\nπ1 = (100 - Q1 - 45 + Q1/2) * Q1 - 10Q1\nπ1 = (55 - Q1/2) * Q1 - 10Q1\n\nNow, we will maximize Firm 1's profit with respect to Q1:\n\n∂π1/∂Q1 = ∂((55 - Q1/2) * Q1 - 10Q1)/∂Q1 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1, we get:\n\nQ1 = 20\n\nNow, we can find the optimal quantity for Firm 2 using its reaction function:\n\nQ2 = (90 - Q1)/2 = (90 - 20)/2 = 35\n\nSo, the optimal quantity for Firm 1 is 20, and the optimal quantity for Firm 2 is 35.\n\nFinally, we can find the corresponding profits for each firm:\n\nπ1 = (55 - 20/2) * 20 - 10 * 20 = 35 * 20 - 200 = 500\nπ2 = (100 - (20 + 35)) * 35 - 10 * 35 = 45 * 35 - 350 = 1225\n\nThus, the optimal quantities for Firm 1 and Firm 2 are 20 and 35, respectively, with corresponding profits of 500 and 1225."
