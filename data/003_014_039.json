    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and midline of the given function y = 3sin(2x - pi/4) - 1, we need to identify the values of A, B, C, and D in the general sine function form y = A sin(Bx - C) + D.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nA = 3\nB = 2\nC = pi/4\nD = -1\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which represents the maximum value of the sine function from its midline. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period: The period of the sine function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. The period is given by the formula (2π) / |B|. In this case, the period is (2π) / |2| = π.\n\n3. Midline (D): The midline is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the sine function. It is given by the value of D. In this case, the midline is y = -1.\n\nNow, let's sketch the graph of the function y = 3sin(2x - pi/4) - 1:\n\n1. Draw the midline y = -1 as a horizontal dashed line.\n2. Mark the amplitude on the y-axis, which is 3 units above and below the midline. So, the maximum value of the function is 3 - 1 = 2, and the minimum value is -1 - 3 = -4.\n3. Mark the period on the x-axis, which is π. Divide the period into four equal parts to represent the critical points of the sine function (maximum, minimum, and zero-crossings).\n4. Starting at the phase shift (C/B = (pi/4) / 2 = pi/8), plot the critical points of the sine function: maximum at pi/8, zero-crossing at 3pi/8, minimum at 5pi/8, and zero-crossing at 7pi/8.\n5. Connect the critical points with a smooth curve to complete the graph of the function y = 3sin(2x - pi/4) - 1.\n\nIn summary:\n\nAmplitude: 3\nPeriod: π\nMidline: y = -1"
