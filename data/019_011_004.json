    "message_1": "Suppose a school has three mathematics teachers (Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C) and three logic books (Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3). Each teacher is assigned one of the books for the semester, but for each book, there is only one teacher assigned. How many different assignments of books to teachers are possible?",
    "message_2": "We can use the counting principle to solve this problem. There are 3 choices for the teacher to be assigned Book 1, 2 choices left for the teacher to be assigned Book 2, and 1 choice left for the teacher to be assigned Book 3.\n\nSo, the total number of different assignments of books to teachers is:\n\n3 (choices for Book 1) × 2 (choices for Book 2) × 1 (choice for Book 3) = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 different assignments."
