    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$, we first find the derivative of the function with respect to $x$:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x) = 3x^2 - 3$\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$3x^2 - 3 = 0$\n\n$x^2 = 1$\n\n$x = \\pm 1$\n\nSo, the critical points of $f(x)$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.\n\n(b) To calculate the Morse index of each critical point, we need to find the second derivative of the function:\n\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x^3 - 3x) = 6x$\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\n$f''(-1) = -6$\n\n$f''(1) = 6$\n\nThe Morse index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives). In this case, the Hessian matrix is just a $1 \\times 1$ matrix with the single entry being the second derivative. So, the Morse index of $x = -1$ is $1$ (since $-6$ is negative), and the Morse index of $x = 1$ is $0$ (since $6$ is positive).\n\n(c) Morse theory tells us that the number of critical points with a given index is invariant under small perturbations of the function. In this case, we have found that there is one critical point with index $0$ (at $x = 1$) and one critical point with index $1$ (at $x = -1$). Since the function is a cubic polynomial, there are no critical points with index $2$. Therefore, the number of critical points with index $0, 1,$ and $2$ are $1, 1,$ and $0$, respectively."
