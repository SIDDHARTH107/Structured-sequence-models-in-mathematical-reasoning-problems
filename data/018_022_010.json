    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B. This is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nSimilarly, the symmetric difference of sets B and A, denoted as B Δ A, is the same as A Δ B.\n\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A Δ B and B Δ A.\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B Δ A and A Δ B.\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = (B Δ A) x (A Δ B). This means that the symmetric difference of sets A and B is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
