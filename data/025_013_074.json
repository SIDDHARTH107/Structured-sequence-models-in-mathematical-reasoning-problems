    "message_1": "Consider an elliptic curve on a complex plane defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$. Find the Jacobian of this curve and determine whether it is a simple or non-simple abelian variety.",
    "message_2": "An elliptic curve is a smooth projective curve of genus 1 with a specified base point. The equation given, $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$, defines an elliptic curve over the complex numbers. The Jacobian of an elliptic curve is an abelian variety that parametrizes the degree 0 divisors on the curve. In the case of elliptic curves, the Jacobian is isomorphic to the curve itself.\n\nFor elliptic curves, the Jacobian is always a simple abelian variety. An abelian variety is simple if it cannot be expressed as a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties. Since elliptic curves are one-dimensional, they cannot be decomposed into lower-dimensional abelian varieties.\n\nTherefore, the Jacobian of the given elliptic curve is a simple abelian variety."
