    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two products, A and B. Producing one unit of product A requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of assembly time, while producing one unit of product B requires 1 hour of machine time and 3 hours of assembly time. The manufacturer has 40 hours machine time and 30 hours of assembly time available each week. The profit per unit of product A is $20 and for product B is $30. How many units of each product should the manufacturer produce each week to maximize their profit?\n\nWrite down the objective function and constraint equations as a system of linear equations and solve the problem using matrix methods.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraint equations:\n1. Machine time: 2x + y ≤ 40\n2. Assembly time: x + 3y ≤ 30\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nWe can rewrite the constraint equations as a system of linear equations:\n\n2x + y = 40 (machine time)\nx + 3y = 30 (assembly time)\n\nNow, we can use matrix methods to solve this system of linear equations. First, we write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  1 | 40 |\n| 1  3 | 30 |\n\nNext, we perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix into row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 2:\n\n| 1  3 | 30 |\n| 2  1 | 40 |\n\n2. Replace row 2 with row 2 - 2 * row 1:\n\n| 1  3 |  30 |\n| 0 -5 | -20 |\n\nNow, we can read the solution from the row-echelon form:\n\nx + 3y = 30\n-5y = -20\n\nSolving for y: y = 4\n\nSubstituting y back into the first equation:\n\nx + 3(4) = 30\nx + 12 = 30\nx = 18\n\nSo, the manufacturer should produce 18 units of product A and 4 units of product B each week to maximize their profit.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, substitute the values of x and y into the objective function:\n\nP = 20(18) + 30(4) = 360 + 120 = $480"
