    "message_2": "To find the value of x, we first need to find the second derivative of the function f(z) = z^3 - 3z^2 + 2z.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(z):\nf'(z) = d/dz (z^3 - 3z^2 + 2z) = 3z^2 - 6z + 2\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(z):\nf''(z) = d/dz (3z^2 - 6z + 2) = 6z - 6\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 6 = 0\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n6x = 6\n\nDivide by 6:\nx = 1\n\nSo, the value of x for which f''(x) = 0 is x = 1."
