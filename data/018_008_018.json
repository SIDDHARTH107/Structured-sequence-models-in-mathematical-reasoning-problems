    "message_1": "Let A={1,2} and B={3,4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that the results are not equal and explain why the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a is in A and b is in B.\n\nGiven A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B (A × B):\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of B and A (B × A):\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the results of A × B and B × A are not equal:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThe reason the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative is that the ordered pairs in the Cartesian product depend on the order of the elements in the sets. In A × B, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set A, and the second element comes from set B. In B × A, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set B, and the second element comes from set A. Since the order of elements in the ordered pairs is different, the Cartesian product is not commutative."
