    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knapsack with a capacity of 15 pounds, and you are given a set of items with their respective weights and values:\n\nItem 1: weight = 5 lbs, value = $10\nItem 2: weight = 7 lbs, value = $14\nItem 3: weight = 3 lbs, value = $7\nItem 4: weight = 6 lbs, value = $12\n\nAssuming you can only fit 10 pounds worth of items in your knapsack, what is the maximum value of items you can take with you? (You can take a partial item if needed.)",
    "message_2": "To maximize the value of items in the knapsack, we should calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item:\n\nItem 1: value-to-weight ratio = $10 / 5 lbs = $2/lb\nItem 2: value-to-weight ratio = $14 / 7 lbs = $2/lb\nItem 3: value-to-weight ratio = $7 / 3 lbs = $2.33/lb\nItem 4: value-to-weight ratio = $12 / 6 lbs = $2/lb\n\nWe should prioritize items with a higher value-to-weight ratio. In this case, Item 3 has the highest ratio. Since we can only fit 10 pounds worth of items, we should first take Item 3 (3 lbs, $7).\n\nNow we have 7 pounds of capacity left in the knapsack. All remaining items have the same value-to-weight ratio ($2/lb). We can take Item 1 (5 lbs, $10) and still have 2 pounds of capacity left.\n\nSince we can take a partial item, we can take 2/5 of Item 4 (2 lbs, $4) to fill the remaining capacity.\n\nThe maximum value of items we can take is $7 (Item 3) + $10 (Item 1) + $4 (partial Item 4) = $21."
