    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll use related rates. We are given the rate at which the volume is increasing (dV/dt = 10 cubic feet per minute) and we need to find the rate at which the surface area is increasing (dA/dt) when the radius is 3 feet.\n\nFirst, let's write down the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere:\n\nVolume: V = (4/3)πr^3\nSurface Area: A = 4πr^2\n\nNow, we'll differentiate both equations with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π(3r^2)(dr/dt)\ndA/dt = 4π(2r)(dr/dt)\n\nWe are given dV/dt = 10 cubic feet per minute, and we want to find dA/dt when r = 3 feet. First, we need to find dr/dt when r = 3 feet.\n\nFrom the volume equation:\n\n10 = (4/3)π(3(3^2))(dr/dt)\n10 = 36π(dr/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dr/dt:\n\ndr/dt = 10 / (36π) ≈ 0.088\n\nNow that we have dr/dt, we can find dA/dt when r = 3 feet:\n\ndA/dt = 4π(2(3))(0.088)\ndA/dt ≈ 24π(0.088)\ndA/dt ≈ 6.63\n\nSo, the surface area of the balloon is increasing at a rate of approximately 6.63 square feet per minute when the radius is 3 feet."
