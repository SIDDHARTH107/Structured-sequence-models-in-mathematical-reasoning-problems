    "message_2": "To find the missing fourth term in the sequence, we can first try to identify a pattern between the given terms. The differences between consecutive terms are:\n\n13 - 5 = 8\n29 - 13 = 16\n\nThe differences are increasing by a factor of 2 (8 * 2 = 16). Assuming this pattern continues, the next difference should be 16 * 2 = 32. \n\nSo, the missing fourth term in the sequence would be 29 + 32 = 61."
