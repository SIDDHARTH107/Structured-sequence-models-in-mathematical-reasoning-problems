    "message_2": "To find the maximum height reached on the flagpole's shadow, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the flagpole as h, the angle of elevation as A, and the length of the shadow on the ground as s. We are given:\n\nh = 20 meters\nA = 60 degrees\n\nWe want to find the maximum height reached on the flagpole's shadow, which is the point where the shadow meets the flagpole. This height can be found using the tangent function:\n\ntan(A) = h / s\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the shadow (s):\n\ntan(60) = 20 / s\ns = 20 / tan(60)\n\nSince tan(60) = √3, we have:\n\ns = 20 / √3 ≈ 11.5 meters\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height reached on the flagpole's shadow using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nh^2 = s^2 + max_height^2\n\n20^2 = 11.5^2 + max_height^2\n400 = 132.25 + max_height^2\nmax_height^2 = 267.75\nmax_height = √267.75 ≈ 16.4 meters\n\nTherefore, the maximum height that can be reached on the flagpole's shadow on the ground is approximately 16.4 meters, rounded to the nearest tenth."
