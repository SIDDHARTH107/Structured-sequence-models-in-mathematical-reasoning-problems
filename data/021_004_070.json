Round the answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 - 3x + 2 at x = 2 using the centered finite difference method with step size h = 0.1, we will first approximate the first derivative using the centered finite difference method, and then use the same method to approximate the second derivative.\n\nStep 1: Approximate the first derivative at x = 2\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2.1) - f(1.9)) / (2 * 0.1)\n\nCalculate f(2.1) and f(1.9):\nf(2.1) = 3(2.1)^4 - 2(2.1)^3 + (2.1)^2 - 3(2.1) + 2 ≈ 31.1663\nf(1.9) = 3(1.9)^4 - 2(1.9)^3 + (1.9)^2 - 3(1.9) + 2 ≈ 20.5451\n\nf'(2) ≈ (31.1663 - 20.5451) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ 53.061\n\nStep 2: Approximate the second derivative at x = 2\nf''(x) ≈ (f'(x + h) - f'(x - h)) / (2h)\nf''(2) ≈ (f'(2.1) - f'(1.9)) / (2 * 0.1)\n\nCalculate f'(2.1) and f'(1.9) using the same method as in Step 1:\nf'(2.1) ≈ (f(2.2) - f(2.0)) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ (42.9528 - 31.1663) / 0.2 ≈ 58.9325\nf'(1.9) ≈ (f(2.0) - f(1.8)) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ (31.1663 - 12.4504) / 0.2 ≈ 93.5795\n\nf''(2) ≈ (58.9325 - 93.5795) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ -173.235\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of the function at x = 2 using the centered finite difference method with step size h = 0.1 is approximately -173.24 (rounded to two decimal places)."
