    "message_1": "Here's an example numerical problem for a math student to solve using tabu search:\n\nA company produces three products, A, B, and C, using three machines, X, Y, and Z. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours on machine X, 1 hour on machine Y, and 3 hours on machine Z. Each unit of product B requires 1 hour on machine X, 2 hours on machine Y, and 2 hours on machine Z. Each unit of product C requires 3 hours on machine X, 3 hours on machine Y, and 1 hour on machine Z. The company has 40 hours of machine time available on machine X, 50 hours available on machine Y, and 30 hours available on machine Z. The profit per unit of product A is $10, the profit per unit of product B is $12, and the profit per unit of product C is $15. Find the optimal production schedule that maximizes the company's profit using tabu search.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function is the total profit, which is the sum of the profit per unit of each product multiplied by the number of units produced.\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are the available machine hours for each machine (X, Y, and Z).\n\n3. Initialize the tabu list and set its size: The tabu list is a memory structure that stores previously visited solutions to avoid cycling. We'll set its size to a reasonable number, say 5.\n\n4. Generate an initial solution: Randomly generate a production schedule that satisfies the constraints.\n\n5. Perform the tabu search:\n\n   a. Generate neighboring solutions: Create a set of neighboring solutions by slightly modifying the current solution (e.g., increasing or decreasing the number of units produced for each product).\n\n   b. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution and check if it satisfies the constraints.\n\n   c. Update the tabu list: If a neighboring solution is better than the current solution and not in the tabu list, replace the current solution with the neighboring solution and add the previous solution to the tabu list. If the tabu list is full, remove the oldest solution from the list.\n\n   d. Repeat steps 5a-5c for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., no improvement in the objective function for a certain number of iterations).\n\n6. Return the best solution found during the search.\n\nApplying the tabu search algorithm to this problem, we can find the optimal production schedule that maximizes the company's profit. Note that the actual solution will depend on the random initial solution and the specific tabu search parameters used."
