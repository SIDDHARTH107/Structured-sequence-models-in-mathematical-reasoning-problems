    "message_2": "To find the bearing of the plane after the wind has blown it 100 km, we can use vector addition to determine the resultant velocity of the plane. Let's break down the velocities into their components.\n\nThe plane's velocity is 200 km/h due north, so its components are:\nV_plane = (0, 200)\n\nThe wind's velocity is 50 km/h from the southeast. To find its components, we can use the fact that southeast is 45 degrees from the east and 45 degrees from the south. Therefore, the components are:\nV_wind = (-50cos(45°), -50sin(45°))\nV_wind ≈ (-35.36, -35.36)\n\nNow, we can add the components of the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity to find the resultant velocity:\nV_resultant = (0 + (-35.36), 200 + (-35.36))\nV_resultant ≈ (-35.36, 164.64)\n\nNext, we can find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity. The magnitude can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n|V_resultant| = √((-35.36)^2 + (164.64)^2)\n|V_resultant| ≈ 167.7 km/h\n\nThe direction can be found using the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nθ = arctan(164.64 / 35.36)\nθ ≈ 77.6°\n\nSince the angle is measured from the north, the bearing of the plane after the wind has blown it 100 km is approximately N77.6°E."
