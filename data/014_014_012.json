Create a 5x5 Playfair square using the key \"CRYPTOLOGY\".\n\n   First, remove any duplicate letters from the key and then fill in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\", which is often combined with \"I\" in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   C R Y P T\n   O L G A B\n   D E F H I\n   K M N Q S\n   U V W X Z\n\n2. Split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a letter is repeated, insert an \"X\" between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an \"X\" at the end.\n\n   MATHLETE -> MA TH LE TE\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the following rules:\n\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around to the beginning of the row if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around to the top of the column if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\n   MA -> (same row) -> TH\n   TH -> (rectangle) -> YR\n   LE -> (same column) -> KI\n   TE -> (rectangle) -> OG\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message.\n\n   Encrypted message: THYRKIOG"
