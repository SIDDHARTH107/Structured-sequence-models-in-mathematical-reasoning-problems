    "message_1": "In a city with a population of 100,000 people, there are 2,000 individuals who are diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder. Assuming that the disorder is equally likely to occur in males and females, what is the probability that a person selected at random from the population has the rare genetic disorder?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a person having the rare genetic disorder, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of individuals with the disorder) / (Total population)\n\nIn this case, there are 2,000 individuals with the disorder and a total population of 100,000 people.\n\nProbability = 2,000 / 100,000 = 0.02 or 2%\n\nSo, the probability that a person selected at random from the population has the rare genetic disorder is 2%."
