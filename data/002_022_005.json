    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 7 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. What is the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 7 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 7 * 3^2\nV = 2 * (3.14159)^2 * 7 * 9\nV ≈ 2 * 9.8696 * 7 * 9\nV ≈ 1236.6336 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 1236.63 cubic centimeters."
