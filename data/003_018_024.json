The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 5sin(3x)\ndy/dx = d(5sin(3x))/dx\n\nFirst, we'll find the derivative of the outer function (5sin(u)) with respect to u, where u = 3x:\n\nd(5sin(u))/du = 5cos(u)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative of the inner function (3x) with respect to x:\n\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (d(5sin(3x))/du) * (du/dx)\ndy/dx = (5cos(u)) * (3)\ndy/dx = 15cos(u)\n\nSince u = 3x, we can substitute it back into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = 15cos(3x)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx = 15cos(3(π/6))\ndy/dx = 15cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0:\n\ndy/dx = 15 * 0\ndy/dx = 0\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 5sin(3x) at x = π/6 is 0."
