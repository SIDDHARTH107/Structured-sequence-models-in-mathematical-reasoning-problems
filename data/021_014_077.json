    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using genetic algorithms, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual\n3. Select parents for reproduction\n4. Perform crossover and mutation to create offspring\n5. Replace the old population with the new one\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met\n\nStep 1: Initialize the population\nLet's create an initial population of 10 individuals with random x values within the constraint (2x - 4 ≤ 0). Since x ≤ 2, we can generate random x values between 0 and 2.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the fitness of each individual\nWe'll use the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 1 as the fitness function. Calculate the fitness for each individual in the population.\n\nStep 3: Select parents for reproduction\nSelect individuals for reproduction based on their fitness. Higher fitness individuals have a higher chance of being selected. We can use methods like roulette wheel selection or tournament selection.\n\nStep 4: Perform crossover and mutation to create offspring\nCrossover: Select two parents and create offspring by combining their x values. For example, we can use the average of the parents' x values as the offspring's x value.\n\nMutation: Apply a small random change to the offspring's x value to introduce diversity in the population.\n\nStep 5: Replace the old population with the new one\nReplace the old population with the offspring created in step 4.\n\nStep 6: Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met\nContinue iterating through steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm, we'll obtain an approximate value for x that maximizes f(x) within the constraint. Note that the genetic algorithm provides an approximate solution, and the quality of the solution depends on the parameters and the number of iterations."
