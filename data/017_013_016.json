    "message_2": "To determine whether a group G of order 18 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 18. Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 9 and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q of order 2 in G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 2. If n_3 = 1, then the unique Sylow 3-subgroup P is normal in G. If n_3 = 2, then G has two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups, say P and P'. Since |P| = |P'| = 9 and |P ∩ P'| = 1, we have |PP'| = |P||P'|/|P ∩ P'| = 9 * 9 / 1 = 81 / 1 = 81. But |G| = 18, which is a contradiction. Therefore, n_3 = 1, and P is normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroup Q. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 9 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, then the unique Sylow 2-subgroup Q is normal in G. If n_2 = 9, then there are 9 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 2. Since G has 18 elements, and each Sylow 2-subgroup contributes one non-identity element, all non-identity elements of G are contained in these Sylow 2-subgroups. However, this is a contradiction since P, a Sylow 3-subgroup, has 8 non-identity elements. Therefore, n_2 = 1, and Q is normal in G.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, and |P ∩ Q| = 1 (because their orders are coprime), we have G ≅ P × Q by the internal direct product theorem. Now, P is a group of order 9, which is a power of a prime, so P is cyclic, i.e., P ≅ C9. Q is a group of order 2, so Q is also cyclic, i.e., Q ≅ C2. Therefore, G ≅ C9 × C2.\n\nNow, we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find that G ≅ C9 × C2 ≅ C18. Thus, the group G of order 18 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18."
