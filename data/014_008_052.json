    "message_2": "A block cipher with a block size of 64 bits means that the input data (plaintext) is divided into blocks of 64 bits each, which are then encrypted using a specific key. The number of possible keys depends on the key size, not the block size. \n\nIf you provide the key size, I can calculate the number of possible keys for you."
