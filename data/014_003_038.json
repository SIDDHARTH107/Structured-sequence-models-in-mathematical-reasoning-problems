    "message_1": "Suppose that a message has been encrypted via ElGamal public key cryptosystem where the modulus is 29, the base is 2, and the public key is (5, 21). The message is represented as an integer m, which is less than 29, and its corresponding ciphertext is (23, 4). What is the decrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the ElGamal ciphertext, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the shared secret key: s = y^a mod p, where y is the first part of the ciphertext, a is the private key, and p is the modulus.\n2. Compute the inverse of the shared secret key: s_inv = s^(-1) mod p.\n3. Decrypt the message: m = (s_inv * b) mod p, where b is the second part of the ciphertext.\n\nHowever, we don't have the private key a in this problem. Instead, we have the public key (5, 21), where 5 is the base and 21 is the result of the encryption function. We can use this information to find the private key a.\n\nThe encryption function is: 21 â‰¡ 2^a mod 29. We need to find the value of a that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trying different values of a:\n\n2^1 mod 29 = 2\n2^2 mod 29 = 4\n2^3 mod 29 = 8\n2^4 mod 29 = 16\n2^5 mod 29 = 3\n2^6 mod 29 = 6\n2^7 mod 29 = 12\n2^8 mod 29 = 24\n2^9 mod 29 = 19\n2^10 mod 29 = 9\n2^11 mod 29 = 18\n2^12 mod 29 = 7\n2^13 mod 29 = 14\n2^14 mod 29 = 28\n2^15 mod 29 = 27\n2^16 mod 29 = 25\n2^17 mod 29 = 21\n\nWe found that 2^17 mod 29 = 21, so the private key a = 17.\n\nNow we can decrypt the message:\n\n1. Compute the shared secret key: s = 23^17 mod 29 = 3.\n2. Compute the inverse of the shared secret key: s_inv = 3^(-1) mod 29. We can find this by trying different values:\n\n3 * 1 mod 29 = 3\n3 * 2 mod 29 = 6\n3 * 3 mod 29 = 9\n...\n3 * 10 mod 29 = 1\n\nSo, s_inv = 10.\n\n3. Decrypt the message: m = (10 * 4) mod 29 = 40 mod 29 = 11.\n\nThe decrypted message is 11."
