    "message_2": "To find the sum of the first 10 odd numbers using inductive logic, we can start by observing the pattern of the first few odd numbers and their sums:\n\n1. 1 = 1\n2. 1 + 3 = 4\n3. 1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n4. 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\n\nWe can see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n^2:\n\n1. 1^2 = 1\n2. 2^2 = 4\n3. 3^2 = 9\n4. 4^2 = 16\n\nNow, we can apply this pattern to find the sum of the first 10 odd numbers:\n\n10^2 = 100\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 odd numbers is 100."
