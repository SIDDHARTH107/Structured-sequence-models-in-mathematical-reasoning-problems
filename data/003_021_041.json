    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product of two vectors v1 and v2 is given by:\n\nv1 • v2 = |v1| * |v2| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, |v1| and |v2| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and v1 • v2 is the dot product of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v1 and v2:\n\nv1 • v2 = (2 * -1) + (1 * 3) = -2 + 3 = 1\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of v1 and v2:\n\n|v1| = √(2^2 + 1^2) = √(4 + 1) = √5\n|v2| = √((-1)^2 + 3^2) = √(1 + 9) = √10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n1 = (√5) * (√10) * cos(θ)\n\nTo isolate cos(θ), divide both sides by (√5) * (√10):\n\ncos(θ) = 1 / (√5 * √10) = 1 / √50\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(1 / √50)\n\nθ ≈ 1.8235 radians or approximately 104.48 degrees"
