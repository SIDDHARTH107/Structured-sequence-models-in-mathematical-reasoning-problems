    "message_2": "The sine of 45 degrees can be found using the unit circle. In the unit circle, the sine value corresponds to the y-coordinate of the point where the angle intersects the circle. For a 45-degree angle, this point is at (1/√2, 1/√2) since it lies on the line y=x. Therefore, the sine of 45 degrees is 1/√2, which can also be written as √2/2."
