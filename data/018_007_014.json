    "message_2": "The power set of a set A is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself. For a set with n elements, the cardinality (number of elements) of its power set is 2^n.\n\nFor the set A = {1, 2, 3}, we can list all the possible subsets:\n\n1. {} (the empty set)\n2. {1}\n3. {2}\n4. {3}\n5. {1, 2}\n6. {1, 3}\n7. {2, 3}\n8. {1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, the power set of A is P(A) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }.\n\nThe cardinality of set A is 3 (since it has 3 elements), and the cardinality of the power set P(A) is 8 (since it has 8 elements). \n\nTo show that the cardinality of the power set is greater than the cardinality of the set A, we can compare their cardinalities:\n\nCardinality of P(A) = 2^n = 2^3 = 8\nCardinality of A = 3\n\nSince 8 > 3, the cardinality of the power set P(A) is greater than the cardinality of the set A."
