    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, which is denoted as A×B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA×B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, which is denoted as B×A.\n\nB×A = {(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n\nNext, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A×B) and A, denoted as (A×B) △ A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nTo find the symmetric difference, we need to represent A as a set of ordered pairs. Since A has only single elements, we can represent it as a set of ordered pairs with the second element being an empty set, like this:\n\nA = {(1, ∅), (2, ∅)}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference (A×B) △ A:\n\n(A×B) △ A = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (1, ∅), (2, ∅)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B×A), denoted as A △ (B×A). We already have A represented as a set of ordered pairs, so we can directly find the symmetric difference:\n\nA △ (B×A) = {(1, ∅), (2, ∅), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n\nComparing the two results, we can see that:\n\n(A×B) △ A = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (1, ∅), (2, ∅)}\n\nA △ (B×A) = {(1, ∅), (2, ∅), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n\nSince (A×B) △ A ≠ A △ (B×A), the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
