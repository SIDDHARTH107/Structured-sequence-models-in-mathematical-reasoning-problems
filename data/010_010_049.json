Then, using Morse theory, calculate the number of critical points of $f(x,y)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y)$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y - 6$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n$2x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$\n\n$2y - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 3$\n\nSo, there is one critical point at $(1,3)$. To determine the nature of this critical point, we need to find the second partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\n$D = \\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = 4$\n\nSince $D > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} > 0$, the critical point at $(1,3)$ is a local minimum.\n\nUsing Morse theory, we can calculate the number of critical points of $f(x,y)$. Morse theory states that the number of critical points is equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of the function. In this case, the function has only one critical point, which is a local minimum. Therefore, the sum of the Betti numbers is 1, and there is only one critical point for $f(x,y)$."
