Prove that there exists a continuous map $g: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ factors through the canonical projection $\\pi: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow S^1$, i.e., $f = \\pi \\circ g$. Moreover, show that any two such maps $g$ and $h$ are homotopic.",
    "message_2": "Since $f_*: \\pi_1(X) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(S^1)$ is the trivial map, we know that $f$ sends all loops in $X$ to null-homotopic loops in $S^1$. Let $p: \\tilde{S^1} \\rightarrow S^1$ be the universal cover of $S^1$ with $\\tilde{S^1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. We have the following commutative diagram:\n\n```\nX --f--> S^1\n|         |\ng         p\n|         |\nv         v\nR ------> S^1\n```\n\nSince $S^1$ is simply connected, there exists a unique lifting $\\tilde{f}: X \\rightarrow \\tilde{S^1}$ of $f$ such that $\\tilde{f}(x_0) = p^{-1}(f(x_0))$ for some basepoint $x_0 \\in X$. This means that $f = p \\circ \\tilde{f}$. Define $g = \\tilde{f}$, then $g: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $f = \\pi \\circ g$.\n\nNow, let $g, h: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be two continuous maps such that $f = \\pi \\circ g$ and $f = \\pi \\circ h$. We want to show that $g$ and $h$ are homotopic. Since $f = \\pi \\circ g = \\pi \\circ h$, we have $\\pi \\circ (g - h) = 0$. This means that $g - h$ maps $X$ into the kernel of $\\pi$, which is the set of integer multiples of $2\\pi$. \n\nDefine a homotopy $H: X \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by $H(x, t) = g(x) + t(h(x) - g(x))$. We have $H(x, 0) = g(x)$ and $H(x, 1) = h(x)$. Since $g - h$ maps $X$ into integer multiples of $2\\pi$, we have $\\pi(H(x, t)) = \\pi(g(x) + t(h(x) - g(x))) = \\pi(g(x)) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in X$ and $t \\in [0, 1]$. Thus, $H$ is a homotopy between $g$ and $h$ that factors through $\\pi$, and so $g$ and $h$ are homotopic."
