    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires an employee and offers them a choice between two types of contracts: a fixed salary of  $50,000 or a commission-based salary which gives the employee 25% of their generated revenue. The employee has a private cost of $20,000 to put forth the necessary effort to generate revenue. If the employee chooses the commission-based salary, their output is unknown to the employer and has a 50% chance of being either $90,000 or $70,000. Assume the employee's utility is linear in terms of income, and the employer's utility equals the company's profit. Determine which contract the employee will choose and calculate the expected profit for the company.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected income for the employee under the commission-based salary. There is a 50% chance of generating $90,000 in revenue and a 50% chance of generating $70,000 in revenue. The employee will receive 25% of the generated revenue as their salary.\n\nExpected revenue = 0.5 * $90,000 + 0.5 * $70,000 = $45,000 + $35,000 = $80,000\n\nThe employee's commission-based salary would be 25% of the expected revenue:\n\nCommission-based salary = 0.25 * $80,000 = $20,000\n\nNow, let's consider the employee's net income under both contracts, taking into account the private cost of $20,000 to generate revenue:\n\nFixed salary net income = $50,000\n\nCommission-based salary net income = $20,000 - $20,000 = $0\n\nSince the employee's utility is linear in terms of income, they will choose the fixed salary contract as it provides a higher net income.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for the company under the chosen contract. The company's profit is the difference between the generated revenue and the employee's salary.\n\nUnder the fixed salary contract, the expected revenue is still $80,000:\n\nExpected profit = Expected revenue - Fixed salary\nExpected profit = $80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000\n\nSo, the expected profit for the company when the employee chooses the fixed salary contract is $30,000."
