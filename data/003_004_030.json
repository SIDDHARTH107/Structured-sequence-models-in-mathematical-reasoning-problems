    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3sin(2x) - 2cos(x) = 0 on the interval [0, 2π), we can first use the double angle formula for sine. The double angle formula for sine is:\n\nsin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into our equation:\n\n3(2sin(x)cos(x)) - 2cos(x) = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n6sin(x)cos(x) - 2cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2cos(x):\n\n2cos(x)(3sin(x) - 1) = 0\n\nThis equation will be true if either of the factors is equal to zero:\n\n2cos(x) = 0 or 3sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nLet's solve each equation separately:\n\n1) 2cos(x) = 0\n\ncos(x) = 0\n\nThe solutions for this equation on the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx = π/2 and x = 3π/2\n\n2) 3sin(x) - 1 = 0\n\nsin(x) = 1/3\n\nThe solutions for this equation on the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx = arcsin(1/3) and x = π - arcsin(1/3)\n\nx ≈ 0.3398 and x ≈ 2.8018\n\nSo, the solutions for the original equation on the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx ≈ 0.3398, π/2, x ≈ 2.8018, and 3π/2."
