    "message_1": "Let X be a topological space such that every continuous function from X to the real numbers is constant. Prove that X is a connected space.\n\nSuppose X is not a connected space, so X can be written as the disjoint union of two non-empty open sets A and B. Then, we can define the continuous function f: X → R by f(x) = 0 if x ∈ A and f(x) = 1 if x ∈ B. This function is continuous, but not constant, contradicting the hypothesis. Therefore, X must be a connected space.",
    "message_2": "We have already established that if X is not connected, we can define a continuous function f: X → R that is not constant, which contradicts the given hypothesis. Since this contradiction arises from the assumption that X is not connected, we must conclude that X is indeed a connected space."
