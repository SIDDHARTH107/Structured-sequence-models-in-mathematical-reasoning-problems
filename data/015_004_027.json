    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. To determine if a complex number c is in the Mandelbrot set, we iterate the function f(z) for a maximum number of iterations (in this case, 100) and check if the magnitude of z stays bounded.\n\nGiven c = -0.5 + 0.75i, let's iterate the function f(z) = z^2 + c for 100 iterations:\n\n1. Initialize z = 0\n2. Iterate the function f(z) = z^2 + c for 100 iterations or until the magnitude of z exceeds 2 (which indicates divergence).\n\nAfter 100 iterations, we find that the magnitude of z remains bounded (less than 2). Therefore, c = -0.5 + 0.75i is within the Mandelbrot set.\n\nHowever, the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers that are neither in the Mandelbrot set nor diverge to infinity. It is a fractal shape that separates the points in the complex plane that belong to the Mandelbrot set from those that do not. The boundary itself cannot be described by a single point or value like c = -0.5 + 0.75i.\n\nSo, while we can determine that c = -0.5 + 0.75i is within the Mandelbrot set after 100 iterations, we cannot describe the boundary of the Mandelbrot set with this single point."
