    "message_2": "To determine whether each of the subgroups is cyclic, we will check if the order of the generator of each subgroup divides the order of G.\n\na) H = <9>\nThe order of 9 in G is the smallest positive integer n such that 9^n is congruent to 1 modulo 54. We can calculate:\n\n9^1 ≡ 9 (mod 54)\n9^2 ≡ 81 ≡ 27 (mod 54)\n9^3 ≡ 729 ≡ 1 (mod 54)\n\nSo, the order of 9 in G is 3. Since 3 divides 54, the subgroup H is cyclic.\n\nb) K = <54>\nThe order of 54 in G is the smallest positive integer n such that 54^n is congruent to 1 modulo 54. However, since 54 is congruent to 0 modulo 54, there is no positive integer n such that 54^n is congruent to 1 modulo 54. Therefore, K is not a subgroup of G.\n\nc) L = <18>\nThe order of 18 in G is the smallest positive integer n such that 18^n is congruent to 1 modulo 54. We can calculate:\n\n18^1 ≡ 18 (mod 54)\n18^2 ≡ 324 ≡ 18 (mod 54)\n18^3 ≡ 5832 ≡ 1 (mod 54)\n\nSo, the order of 18 in G is 3. Since 3 divides 54, the subgroup L is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, H and L are cyclic subgroups of G, while K is not a subgroup of G."
