    "message_1": "A torus has an outer radius of 6cm and an inner radius of 4cm. What is the volume of the torus? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube (outer radius - inner radius) and r is the radius of the tube.\n\nIn this case, the outer radius is 6 cm and the inner radius is 4 cm. So, R = (6 - 4) / 2 = 1 cm (since we want the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the tube) and r = 4 cm (the radius of the tube).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 1 * 4^2\nVolume ≈ 2 * (3.14159)^2 * 1 * 16\nVolume ≈ 2 * 9.8696 * 16\nVolume ≈ 315.827\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 315.83 cm³, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
