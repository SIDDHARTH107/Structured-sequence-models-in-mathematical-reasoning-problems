    "message_1": "If the diameter of a circle is 14 cm, what is the perimeter of the circle in cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle, you can use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 14 cm, we can plug it into the formula:\n\nC = π(14)\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 × 14\n\nC ≈ 43.9823 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
