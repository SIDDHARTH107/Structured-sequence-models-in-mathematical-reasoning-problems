    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 gallons of water with 2 lbs of salt dissolved in it. Water containing 0.10 lbs of salt per gallon is entering the tank at a rate of 3 gallons per minute, and the well mixed solution is leaving the tank at the same rate. Write the differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank and use it to find how much salt is in the tank after 30 minutes.",
    "message_2": "Let A(t) be the amount of salt in the tank at time t (in minutes). At time t = 0, A(0) = 2 lbs.\n\nWater containing 0.10 lbs of salt per gallon is entering the tank at a rate of 3 gallons per minute, so the rate of salt entering the tank is 0.10 * 3 = 0.3 lbs/min.\n\nSince the well-mixed solution is leaving the tank at the same rate of 3 gallons per minute, the concentration of salt in the tank at any time t is A(t) / 500 (lbs/gallon). Therefore, the rate of salt leaving the tank is (A(t) / 500) * 3 (lbs/min).\n\nNow, we can write the differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank:\n\ndA/dt = rate of salt entering - rate of salt leaving\ndA/dt = 0.3 - (3A(t) / 500)\n\nTo solve this first-order linear differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^(∫(-3/500)dt) = e^(-3t/500).\n\nMultiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-3t/500) dA/dt - (3/500)e^(-3t/500)A(t) = 0.3e^(-3t/500)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product A(t)e^(-3t/500):\n\nd/dt [A(t)e^(-3t/500)] = 0.3e^(-3t/500)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d[A(t)e^(-3t/500)] = ∫0.3e^(-3t/500) dt\n\nA(t)e^(-3t/500) = -50e^(-3t/500) + C\n\nNow, we solve for the constant C using the initial condition A(0) = 2:\n\n2 = -50e^(0) + C\nC = 52\n\nSo, the equation for A(t) is:\n\nA(t) = 50e^(-3t/500) + 52\n\nNow, we can find the amount of salt in the tank after 30 minutes:\n\nA(30) = 50e^(-3(30)/500) + 52 ≈ 50e^(-0.18) + 52 ≈ 42.47 lbs\n\nAfter 30 minutes, there are approximately 42.47 lbs of salt in the tank."
