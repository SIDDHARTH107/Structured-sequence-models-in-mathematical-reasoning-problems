    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5 cm)²\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25 cm²\nSurface area = 100π cm²\n\nApproximately, using the value of π as 3.14159:\n\nSurface area ≈ 100 * 3.14159 cm²\nSurface area ≈ 314.159 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 314.159 cm²."
