    "message_2": "A symplectic matrix A of size 2n x 2n satisfies the property A^TJA = J, where J is the standard symplectic matrix of size 2n x 2n. One important property of symplectic matrices is that if λ is an eigenvalue of A, then so is its complex conjugate λ* and its inverse 1/λ.\n\nGiven the eigenvalues 2-i, 3, 5, and 2+i, we can find the other eigenvalues using the property mentioned above:\n\nFor 2-i, the complex conjugate is 2+i (already given), and the inverse is 1/(2-i) = (2+i)/5.\nFor 3, the complex conjugate is 3 (already given), and the inverse is 1/3.\nFor 5, the complex conjugate is 5 (already given), and the inverse is 1/5.\n\nNow we have all the eigenvalues: 2-i, 2+i, 3, 5, (2+i)/5, and 1/3.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Therefore, the determinant of A is:\n\ndet(A) = (2-i)(2+i)(3)(5)((2+i)/5)(1/3)\n\ndet(A) = [(2-i)(2+i)][(3)(5)][((2+i)/5)(1/3)]\n\nSince (2-i)(2+i) = (2^2 - (-1)^2) = 3, we have:\n\ndet(A) = (3)(15)((2+i)/5)(1/3)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the 3's and the 5's:\n\ndet(A) = (2+i)\n\nSo, the determinant of the symplectic matrix A is 2+i."
