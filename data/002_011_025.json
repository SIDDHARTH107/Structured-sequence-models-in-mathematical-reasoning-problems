    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 5 cm and the other leg with a length of 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse, as determined by the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nc² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\nc² = 169 cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √169 cm²\nc = 13 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm."
