    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal is independent of the iteration level. For the Vicsek fractal, the Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 3. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497, regardless of the iteration level."
