    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the ball after 2 seconds, we can use the following equation:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nGiven:\nInitial velocity (u) = 20 m/s\nAcceleration due to gravity (a) = -9.8 m/s^2\nTime (t) = 2 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the equation:\n\nv = 20 + (-9.8) * 2\nv = 20 - 19.6\nv = 0.4 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball after 2 seconds is 0.4 m/s.\n\nThe acceleration of the ball remains constant throughout its motion, which is the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the acceleration of the ball after 2 seconds is still -9.8 m/s^2."
