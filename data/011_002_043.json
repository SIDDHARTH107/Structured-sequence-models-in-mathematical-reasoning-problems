    "message_2": "To find the 7th term of the binomial expansion of (x + y)^9, we can use the binomial theorem formula:\n\nC(n, k) * x^(n-k) * y^k\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n is the exponent (in this case, 9), and k is the term number minus 1 (since the first term corresponds to k = 0).\n\nFor the 7th term, k = 6 (since k starts from 0). So, we have:\n\nC(9, 6) * x^(9-6) * y^6\n\nFirst, let's find C(9, 6):\n\nC(9, 6) = 9! / (6! * (9-6)!)\nC(9, 6) = 9! / (6! * 3!)\nC(9, 6) = (9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\nC(9, 6) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(9, 6) = 84\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the binomial theorem formula:\n\n84 * x^(9-6) * y^6\n84 * x^3 * y^6\n\nSo, the 7th term of the binomial expansion of (x + y)^9 is 84x^3y^6."
