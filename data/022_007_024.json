    "message_1": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the polynomial $P(z) = z^n + z^{n-1} + \\cdots + z + 1$ has a root which is a real number?\n\nHint: Recall the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Also, remember Liouville's theorem which states that every bounded entire function is constant.",
    "message_2": "Let's first rewrite the polynomial $P(z)$ as a geometric series:\n\n$P(z) = 1 + z + z^2 + \\cdots + z^{n-1} + z^n = \\frac{z^{n+1} - 1}{z - 1}$, for $z \\neq 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f(z) = (z - 1)P(z) = z^{n+1} - 1$. This is a polynomial of degree $n+1$ with complex coefficients. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, $f(z)$ has $n+1$ complex roots, counting multiplicities. Since $P(z)$ is just $f(z)$ divided by $(z - 1)$, $P(z)$ has $n$ complex roots, counting multiplicities.\n\nNow, let's consider the roots of $P(z)$. If $z = 1$, then $P(z) = n+1$, so $z = 1$ is not a root of $P(z)$. If $z$ is a root of $P(z)$, then $z^{n+1} - 1 = 0$, which means $z^{n+1} = 1$. This implies that $z$ is an $(n+1)$-th root of unity, i.e., $z = e^{2k\\pi i/(n+1)}$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $P(z)$ has a real root. If $z$ is a real root, then $z = e^{2k\\pi i/(n+1)}$ must be real. This can only happen if $k = 0$ or $k = (n+1)/2$. If $k = 0$, then $z = 1$, but we already know that $z = 1$ is not a root of $P(z)$. So, we must have $k = (n+1)/2$. This implies that $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have $P(z) = z + 1$, which has a real root $z = -1$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $P(z)$ has a real root is $n = \\boxed{1}$."
