    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate the x variable by subtracting the first equation from the second equation and the first equation from the third equation:\n\n(2x - y + z) - (x + y + z) = 4 - 5\nx - 2y = -1  (Equation 1)\n\n(x + 3y - 2z) - (x + y + z) = 8 - 5\n2y - 3z = 3  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a new system of equations with two variables:\n\nx - 2y = -1\n2y - 3z = 3\n\nNext, we can solve for x in Equation 1:\n\nx = 2y - 1\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the original first equation:\n\n(2y - 1) + y + z = 5\n3y - 1 + z = 5\n\nNow we have another system of equations with two variables:\n\n3y - 1 + z = 5\n2y - 3z = 3\n\nSolve for z in Equation 2:\n\n3z = 2y - 3\nz = (2y - 3)/3\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into the 3y - 1 + z = 5 equation:\n\n3y - 1 + (2y - 3)/3 = 5\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n9y - 3 + 2y - 3 = 15\n11y - 6 = 15\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n11y = 21\ny = 21/11\n\nNow that we have the value for y, we can find the values for x and z using the expressions we found earlier:\n\nx = 2(21/11) - 1 = 42/11 - 11/11 = 31/11\n\nz = (2(21/11) - 3)/3 = (42 - 33)/33 = 9/33 = 1/3\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 31/11\ny = 21/11\nz = 1/3\n\nSince we found a unique solution, the system has a unique solution."
