    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x - 5. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 3\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with x0 = 2. We'll iterate the process until we reach the desired accuracy of four decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 2 - ( (2^3 - 3*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 3) )\nx1 = 2 - ( (-1) / (9) )\nx1 = 2 + 1/9\nx1 ≈ 2.1111\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = 2.1111\nx2 = x1 - ( (x1^3 - 3*x1 - 5) / (3*(x1^2) - 3) )\nx2 ≈ 2.0946\n\nIteration 3:\nx1 = 2.0946\nx2 = x1 - ( (x1^3 - 3*x1 - 5) / (3*(x1^2) - 3) )\nx2 ≈ 2.0946\n\nSince the result did not change after the third iteration (up to four decimal places), we can conclude that the root of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x - 5 is approximately x ≈ 2.0946."
