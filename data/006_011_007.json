    "message_1": "In a factory, it has been observed that on average, accidents occur once in every 15 days. What is the probability that there will be at least two accidents in the next 30 days? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, 30 days) given a known average rate of occurrence (in this case, 1 accident per 15 days).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events in the given time interval\n- λ is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, λ = 2 accidents per 30 days, since there is 1 accident per 15 days)\n- k is the number of events we are interested in (in this case, at least 2 accidents)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we will find the probability of having 0 or 1 accident in the next 30 days, and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of having at least 2 accidents.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-2) * 2^0) / 0! = (0.13534 * 1) / 1 = 0.13534\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-2) * 2^1) / 1! = (0.13534 * 2) / 1 = 0.27067\n\nNow, we find the probability of having at least 2 accidents:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.13534 - 0.27067 = 0.59399\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the probability of having at least two accidents in the next 30 days is 0.59 or 59%."
