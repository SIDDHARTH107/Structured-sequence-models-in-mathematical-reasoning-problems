    "message_2": "To find the Taylor series expansion of f(z) = e^(2z) centered at z = 0, we need to find the coefficients of the series by taking the derivatives of f(z) and evaluating them at z = 0.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion of a function f(z) centered at z = 0 is given by:\n\nf(z) = Σ [f^(n)(0) * z^n / n!], where n goes from 0 to infinity, and f^(n)(0) is the nth derivative of f(z) evaluated at z = 0.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(z):\n\nf(z) = e^(2z)\nf'(z) = 2e^(2z)\nf''(z) = 4e^(2z)\nf'''(z) = 8e^(2z)\n...\n\nIn general, the nth derivative of f(z) is given by:\n\nf^(n)(z) = (2^n)e^(2z)\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at z = 0:\n\nf(0) = e^(2*0) = 1\nf'(0) = 2e^(2*0) = 2\nf''(0) = 4e^(2*0) = 4\nf'''(0) = 8e^(2*0) = 8\n...\n\nIn general, the nth derivative of f(z) evaluated at z = 0 is:\n\nf^(n)(0) = 2^n\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Taylor series formula:\n\nf(z) = Σ [(2^n * z^n) / n!]\n\nSo, the Taylor series expansion of f(z) = e^(2z) centered at z = 0 is:\n\nf(z) = Σ [(2^n * z^n) / n!], where the sum goes from n = 0 to infinity."
