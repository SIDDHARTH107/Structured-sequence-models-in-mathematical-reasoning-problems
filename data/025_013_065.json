    "message_2": "To find the order of the group J(F), we first need to find the points on the curve C over the field F. We can do this by plugging in the values of F into the equation y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 1 and checking for solutions.\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = (0)^3 - 2(0) + 1 = 1\ny = 1 (since y = 0 doesn't satisfy the equation)\n\nSo, we have one point (0, 1).\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = (1)^3 - 2(1) + 1 = 0\ny = 0 (since y = 1 doesn't satisfy the equation)\n\nSo, we have another point (1, 0).\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = (2)^3 - 2(2) + 1 = 5 â‰¡ 2 (mod 3)\nThere are no solutions for y in this case.\n\nSo, we have two points on the curve C: (0, 1) and (1, 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the group J(F). The group J(F) is generated by the points on the curve C, and its order is equal to the number of points on the curve plus the point at infinity (the identity element of the group).\n\nTherefore, the order of the group J(F) is 2 (points on the curve) + 1 (point at infinity) = 3."
