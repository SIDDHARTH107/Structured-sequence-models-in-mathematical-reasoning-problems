    "message_1": "In a non-parametric test, a sample of 15 students were asked to rate their satisfaction level with the teaching quality on a scale from 1 to 10. The results were as follows: 7, 9, 5, 8, 6, 4, 7, 6, 8, 3, 4, 9, 5, 6, and 8. \n\nDetermine the median satisfaction score and calculate the interquartile range (IQR) for this sample.",
    "message_2": "To determine the median satisfaction score, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9\n\nSince there are 15 data points, the median is the middle value, which is the 8th value in the ordered list:\n\n3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, (6), 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9\n\nThe median satisfaction score is 6.\n\nTo calculate the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nLower half: 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6\nUpper half: 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half, which is the 4th value:\n\n3, 4, 4, (5), 5, 6, 6\n\nQ1 = 5\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half, which is the 4th value:\n\n7, 7, 8, (8), 8, 9, 9\n\nQ3 = 8\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\nIQR = 8 - 5\nIQR = 3\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR) for this sample is 3."
