    "message_2": "The given displacement equation is x(t) = 4cos(2t + π/6) cm. This equation is in the form of x(t) = Acos(ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase shift.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the amplitude is the coefficient of the cosine function, which is 4 cm.\n\n2. Angular frequency (ω) and frequency (f):\nThe angular frequency, ω, is the coefficient of the time variable t inside the cosine function. In this case, ω = 2 rad/s. The frequency, f, is related to the angular frequency by the formula ω = 2πf. Solving for f, we get:\n\nf = ω / (2π) = 2 / (2π) = 1/π Hz\n\n3. Period (T):\nThe period is the time it takes for one complete oscillation. It is the inverse of the frequency. So, T = 1/f = π seconds.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 4 cm, the frequency is 1/π Hz, and the period is π seconds."
