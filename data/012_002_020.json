    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the given graph, we can use the greedy coloring algorithm. We start by coloring the first vertex with the first color, then move to the next vertex and assign the smallest possible color that has not been used by any of its adjacent vertices.\n\nHere's one possible coloring for the given graph:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 with color A).\n3. Color vertex 3 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 with color A).\n4. Color vertex 4 with color C (since it's adjacent to vertices 2 and 3 with colors B and A, respectively).\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertices 2 and 4 with colors B and C, respectively).\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 4 with color C).\n\nThe coloring looks like this:\n\n```\n    A---B\n   /   / \\\n  B---C---A\n       \\  |\n        \\ |\n          B\n```\n\nThe minimum number of colors required to color the given graph is 3."
