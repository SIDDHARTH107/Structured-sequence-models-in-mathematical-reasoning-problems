    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nA metal rod of length 2 meters has a temperature distribution given by T(x) = 20 + 5cos(pi*x/2), where x is the distance in meters from one end of the rod. What is the temperature at the midpoint of the rod?\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, the student can solve for the temperature at any point along the rod by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the given temperature distribution.",
    "message_2": "In this case, we don't need to use the Fourier transform to find the temperature at the midpoint of the rod. We can simply plug in the midpoint value into the given temperature distribution function T(x).\n\nThe midpoint of the rod is at x = 1 meter (since the rod is 2 meters long). So, we can find the temperature at the midpoint by plugging x = 1 into the function:\n\nT(1) = 20 + 5cos(pi*1/2)\n\nT(1) = 20 + 5cos(pi/2)\n\nSince cos(pi/2) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nT(1) = 20 + 5*0\n\nT(1) = 20\n\nSo, the temperature at the midpoint of the rod is 20 degrees Celsius."
