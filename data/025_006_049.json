    "message_2": "For a projective space P^n over a field k, the cohomology groups can be computed using the cellular cohomology. The projective space P^n has a cell decomposition with one cell in each even dimension from 0 to 2n.\n\nThe cellular cochain complex for P^n is given by:\n\n0 → k → k → ... → k → 0\n\nwhere there are n+1 copies of k, and the non-zero differential maps are given by:\n\nd^{2i-1}: k → k for i = 1, 2, ..., n\n\nNow, we want to compute the third cohomology group H^3(P^n, k). Since the cellular cochain complex only has non-zero terms in even dimensions, the differential maps d^2 and d^4 are both zero. Therefore, H^3(P^n, k) is isomorphic to the kernel of d^4 divided by the image of d^2.\n\nHowever, since both d^2 and d^4 are zero maps, their kernel and image are trivial. Thus, H^3(P^n, k) is isomorphic to the trivial group, i.e., H^3(P^n, k) = 0."
