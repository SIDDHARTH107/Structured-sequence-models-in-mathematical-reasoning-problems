    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers have their suitcases randomly assigned a value between 1 and 100 dollars. They must independently declare a value for their suitcases, and the person with the lower declared value will receive that amount of money from the higher declared value. If they both declare the same value, they both receive that amount of money. \n\nWhat should each traveler declare as the value of their suitcase to maximize their own payout, and what will their payout be in that scenario?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both travelers declare the minimum value, which is 1 dollar in this case. This is because each traveler has an incentive to declare a value one dollar less than their opponent to gain an extra dollar, and this process continues until they reach the minimum value.\n\nTo maximize their own payout, each traveler should declare their suitcase value as 1 dollar. In this scenario, both travelers will declare the same value (1 dollar) and will receive a payout of 1 dollar each."
