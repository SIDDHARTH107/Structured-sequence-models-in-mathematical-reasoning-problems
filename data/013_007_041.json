Each community is allowed to catch up to 1000 fish per year. If community A decreases its annual catch by 10%, community B increases its annual catch by 5%, and community C increases its annual catch by 20%, what will be the new annual catch for each community? (Assuming that each community chooses to optimize their own fishing yields.)",
    "message_2": "Let's calculate the new annual catch for each community based on the given percentages:\n\nCommunity A:\nDecreases its annual catch by 10%.\n10% of 1000 fish = (10/100) * 1000 = 100 fish\nNew annual catch for community A = 1000 - 100 = 900 fish\n\nCommunity B:\nIncreases its annual catch by 5%.\n5% of 1000 fish = (5/100) * 1000 = 50 fish\nNew annual catch for community B = 1000 + 50 = 1050 fish\n\nCommunity C:\nIncreases its annual catch by 20%.\n20% of 1000 fish = (20/100) * 1000 = 200 fish\nNew annual catch for community C = 1000 + 200 = 1200 fish\n\nSo, the new annual catch for each community will be:\n- Community A: 900 fish\n- Community B: 1050 fish\n- Community C: 1200 fish"
