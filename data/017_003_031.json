    "message_2": "A generator of a cyclic group of order 7 is an element that, when raised to successive powers, generates all the elements of the group. In the case of a cyclic group of order 7, the generator is an element \"g\" such that:\n\ng^1 = g,\ng^2,\ng^3,\ng^4,\ng^5,\ng^6,\ng^7 = e (the identity element)\n\nFor example, in the multiplicative group of integers modulo 7 (denoted as Z_7^*), the generators are 3 and 5. This is because:\n\n3^1 = 3,\n3^2 = 2,\n3^3 = 6,\n3^4 = 4,\n3^5 = 5,\n3^6 = 1 (mod 7)\n\nand\n\n5^1 = 5,\n5^2 = 4,\n5^3 = 6,\n5^4 = 2,\n5^5 = 3,\n5^6 = 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the generators of a cyclic group of order 7 are 3 and 5 in the case of Z_7^*. Note that the specific generators depend on the group in question, but the concept of a generator remains the same."
