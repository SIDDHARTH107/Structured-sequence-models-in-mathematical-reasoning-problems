The factory has eight machines available for the production process, and each machine can only perform one step at a time. How many machines should be allocated to each step to minimize the total production time?\n\n| Step | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 |\n|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1    | 5         | 2         | 6         | 4         |\n| 2    | 3         | 1         | 2         | 6         |\n| 3    | 4         | 3         | 5         | 2         |\n| 4    | 2         | 5         | 1         | 3         |",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total production time, we need to allocate the machines to the steps in such a way that the slowest step is minimized. We will first find the fastest machine for each step and then allocate the machines accordingly.\n\nStep 1: The fastest machine is Machine 2 with a time of 2.\nStep 2: The fastest machine is Machine 2 with a time of 1.\nStep 3: The fastest machine is Machine 4 with a time of 2.\nStep 4: The fastest machine is Machine 3 with a time of 1.\n\nNow, we need to allocate the 8 machines to these steps. Since steps 2 and 4 have the lowest time (1), we should allocate more machines to these steps to minimize the bottleneck. We can allocate 3 machines to each of steps 2 and 4, and 1 machine to each of steps 1 and 3.\n\nAllocation:\nStep 1: 1 machine (Machine 2)\nStep 2: 3 machines (Machine 2)\nStep 3: 1 machine (Machine 4)\nStep 4: 3 machines (Machine 3)\n\nWith this allocation, the production time for each step will be:\nStep 1: 1000 units * 2 minutes/unit = 2000 minutes\nStep 2: 1000 units * 1 minute/unit / 3 machines = 333.33 minutes (round up to 334 minutes)\nStep 3: 1000 units * 2 minutes/unit = 2000 minutes\nStep 4: 1000 units * 1 minute/unit / 3 machines = 333.33 minutes (round up to 334 minutes)\n\nThe slowest step is Step 1 and Step 3, both taking 2000 minutes. Therefore, the total production time is 2000 minutes."
