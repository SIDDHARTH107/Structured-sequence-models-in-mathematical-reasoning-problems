    "message_1": "A metal bar, 10 cm long, is heated to 200°C. Find the temperature distribution along the bar assuming the initial temperature of the bar is 25°C using Fourier Transform. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.0001 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the bar, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x,0) = 25°C for 0 < x < 10 cm\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0,t) = 200°C for t > 0\nT(10,t) = 25°C for t > 0\n\nFirst, we need to find the steady-state temperature distribution, which is the solution of the heat equation when ∂T/∂t = 0:\n\n0 = α ∂²T(x) / ∂x²\n\nIntegrating twice, we get:\n\nT(x) = -Ax² + Bx + C\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 200°C => C = 200\nT(10) = 25°C => -100A + 10B + 200 = 25\n\nNow, we need to find the transient temperature distribution, which is the difference between the actual temperature and the steady-state temperature:\n\nu(x,t) = T(x,t) - T(x)\n\nThe transient temperature distribution satisfies the heat equation and the following initial and boundary conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = 0 for 0 < x < 10 cm\nu(0,t) = 0 for t > 0\nu(10,t) = 0 for t > 0\n\nWe can solve this problem using the Fourier Transform. The solution is given by:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx/L) * exp(-α(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the bar (10 cm), and B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find B_n, we need to use the initial condition u(x,0) = 0:\n\n0 = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nSince the initial condition is zero, the Fourier coefficients B_n are also zero. Therefore, the transient temperature distribution u(x,t) is zero.\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution along the bar is the sum of the steady-state and transient temperature distributions:\n\nT(x,t) = T(x) + u(x,t) = T(x) = -Ax² + Bx + 200\n\nWe still need to find A and B. Using the boundary condition T(10) = 25°C, we get:\n\n25 = -100A + 10B + 200\n\nSolving this equation, we find:\n\nA = 0.0175\nB = -0.15\n\nSo, the temperature distribution along the bar is:\n\nT(x,t) = -0.0175x² - 0.15x + 200\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution along the bar at any position x and time t."
