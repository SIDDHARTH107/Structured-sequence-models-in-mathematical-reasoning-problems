    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow that can be sent through the network while satisfying the requirements of each source and sink, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Create a residual graph with capacities of each edge as shown in the original graph.\n\n2. Initialize the max flow to 0.\n\n3. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). An augmenting path is a path from the source to the sink in the residual graph with available capacity.\n\n4. If no augmenting path is found, return the max flow.\n\n5. If an augmenting path is found, find the minimum capacity along the path. This is the bottleneck capacity.\n\n6. Update the residual graph by subtracting the bottleneck capacity from the capacities of the forward edges and adding the bottleneck capacity to the capacities of the reverse edges.\n\n7. Add the bottleneck capacity to the max flow.\n\n8. Repeat steps 3-7 until no augmenting path is found.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can find the maximum flow in the given network:\n\n1. Initial max flow = 0\n\n2. Find an augmenting path: S1 -> Sink1 (bottleneck capacity = 12)\n\n3. Update max flow: 0 + 12 = 12\n\n4. Update residual graph\n\n5. Find an augmenting path: S1 -> Sink2 (bottleneck capacity = 3)\n\n6. Update max flow: 12 + 3 = 15\n\n7. Update residual graph\n\n8. Find an augmenting path: S2 -> Sink2 (bottleneck capacity = 7)\n\n9. Update max flow: 15 + 7 = 22\n\n10. Update residual graph\n\n11. Find an augmenting path: S2 -> Sink3 (bottleneck capacity = 3)\n\n12. Update max flow: 22 + 3 = 25\n\n13. Update residual graph\n\n14. Find an augmenting path: S3 -> Sink3 (bottleneck capacity = 5)\n\n15. Update max flow: 25 + 5 = 30\n\n16. Update residual graph\n\nNo more augmenting paths can be found. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be sent through the network while satisfying the requirements of each source and sink is 30 units."
