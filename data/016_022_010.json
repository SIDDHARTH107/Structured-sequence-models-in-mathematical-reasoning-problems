    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller triangles from a larger triangle. The number of small triangles at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^(level - 1)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of small triangles at the fifth level:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^(5 - 1) = 3^4 = 81\n\nThere are 81 small triangles in the fifth level of the Sierpinski pyramid if the first level has one triangle."
