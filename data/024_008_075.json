    "message_2": "To compute the Ricci curvature, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\nΓᵢⱼₖ = 1/2 * gᵢₗ ( ∂gₗⱼ/∂xᵏ + ∂gₗᵏ/∂xⱼ - ∂gⱼᵏ/∂xₗ )\n\nwhere gᵢₗ is the inverse of the metric tensor g. Since g is a symmetric matrix, we can find its inverse using the formula:\n\ng⁻¹ = 1/|g| * adj(g)\n\nwhere |g| is the determinant of g and adj(g) is the adjugate of g. The determinant of g is:\n\n|g| = (2*2) - (1*1) = 3\n\nThe adjugate of g is:\n\nadj(g) = [ 2 -1 ]\n         [ -1 2 ]\n\nSo, the inverse of g is:\n\ng⁻¹ = 1/3 * [ 2 -1 ]\n           [ -1 2 ]\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric tensor is constant, all its partial derivatives are zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\nΓᵢⱼₖ = 0\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor, which is given by:\n\nRᵢⱼₖₗ = ∂Γᵢⱼₗ/∂xᵏ - ∂Γᵢⱼᵏ/∂xₗ + ΓᵢₘₗΓₘⱼᵏ - ΓᵢₘᵏΓₘⱼₗ\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Riemann curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nRᵢⱼₖₗ = 0\n\nFinally, we compute the Ricci curvature tensor, which is given by:\n\nRᵢⱼ = Rₖᵢₖⱼ\n\nSince the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, the Ricci curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nRᵢⱼ = 0\n\nThus, the Ricci curvature of this manifold at the point (1,1) is zero."
