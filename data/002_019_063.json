    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 12 cm. What is the surface area of the cone, rounded to the nearest tenth?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 5 cm and l = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 12)\nSurface Area = π(5)(17)\nSurface Area = 85π\n\nNow, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 85 × 3.14\nSurface Area ≈ 267.3\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the surface area of the cone is approximately 267.3 square centimeters."
