    "message_2": "To perform hierarchical clustering using the Manhattan distance metric, we will follow the agglomerative approach, which starts with each observation as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until the desired number of clusters is reached. In this case, we want to end up with two clusters.\n\n1. Calculate the Manhattan distance between all pairs of observations:\n\n   d((1,2),(3,4)) = |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   d((1,2),(5,6)) = |1-5| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n   d((1,2),(2,2)) = |1-2| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n   d((1,2),(4,4)) = |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   d((1,2),(6,6)) = |1-6| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9\n   d((3,4),(5,6)) = |3-5| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   d((3,4),(2,2)) = |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   d((3,4),(4,4)) = |3-4| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1\n   d((3,4),(6,6)) = |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   d((5,6),(2,2)) = |5-2| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n   d((5,6),(4,4)) = |5-4| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   d((5,6),(6,6)) = |5-6| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1\n   d((2,2),(4,4)) = |2-4| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   d((2,2),(6,6)) = |2-6| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n   d((4,4),(6,6)) = |4-6| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n2. Find the smallest distance and merge the corresponding clusters:\n\n   The smallest distance is 1, which occurs between three pairs of observations: (1,2) and (2,2), (3,4) and (4,4), and (5,6) and (6,6). We can choose any of these pairs to merge first. Let's merge (1,2) and (2,2):\n\n   Clusters: {[(1,2), (2,2)]}, {(3,4)}, {(5,6)}, {(4,4)}, {(6,6)}\n\n3. Recalculate the distances between the new cluster and the remaining clusters:\n\n   d([(1,2),(2,2)],(3,4)) = min(d((1,2),(3,4)), d((2,2),(3,4))) = min(4, 3) = 3\n   d([(1,2),(2,2)],(5,6)) = min(d((1,2),(5,6)), d((2,2),(5,6))) = min(8, 7) = 7\n   d([(1,2),(2,2)],(4,4)) = min(d((1,2),(4,4)), d((2,2),(4,4))) = min(5, 4) = 4\n   d([(1,2),(2,2)],(6,6)) = min(d((1,2),(6,6)), d((2,2),(6,6))) = min(9, 8) = 8\n\n4. Merge the next closest clusters:\n\n   The smallest distance is now 1 again, between (3,4) and (4,4), and (5,6) and (6,6). We can merge either pair. Let's merge (3,4) and (4,4):\n\n   Clusters: {[(1,2), (2,2)]}, {[(3,4), (4,4)]}, {(5,6)}, {(6,6)}\n\n5. Recalculate the distances between the new cluster and the remaining clusters:\n\n   d([(3,4),(4,4)],[(1,2),(2,2)]) = min(d((3,4),(1,2)), d((3,4),(2,2)), d((4,4),(1,2)), d((4,4),(2,2))) = min(4, 3, 5, 4) = 3\n   d([(3,4),(4,4)],(5,6)) = min(d((3,4),(5,6)), d((4,4),(5,6))) = min(4, 3) = 3\n   d([(3,4),(4,4)],(6,6)) = min(d((3,4),(6,6)), d((4,4),(6,6))) = min(5, 4) = 4\n\n6. Merge the next closest clusters:\n\n   The smallest distance is now 3, between [(1,2),(2,2)] and [(3,4),(4,4)], and [(3,4),(4,4)] and (5,6). We can merge either pair. Let's merge [(1,2),(2,2)] and [(3,4),(4,4)]:\n\n   Clusters: {[(1,2), (2,2), (3,4), (4,4)]}, {(5,6)}, {(6,6)}\n\n7. We have reached the desired number of clusters (2). The final two clusters are:\n\n   Cluster 1: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,4), (4,4)]\n   Cluster 2: [(5,6), (6,6)]"
