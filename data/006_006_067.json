    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes in n trials\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, also written as nCx or \"n choose x\"\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of free throw shots)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, the number of shots made)\n- p is the probability of success on an individual trial (in this case, the probability of making a free throw)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 10 (the player takes 10 free throw shots)\n- x = 7 (we want to find the probability of making exactly 7 shots)\n- p = 0.7 (the player makes 70% of his free throws)\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, x), which is the number of combinations of 10 items taken 7 at a time:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * 3!)\nC(10, 7) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(7) = C(10, 7) * 0.7^7 * (1-0.7)^(10-7)\nP(7) = 120 * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3\nP(7) â‰ˆ 0.2668\n\nSo, the probability of the player making exactly 7 of the 10 free throw shots is approximately 26.68%."
