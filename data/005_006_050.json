If a random sample of 100 bags is selected, what is the probability that the average weight of the bags is less than 148 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 100 bags.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The mean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) is equal to the population mean (μ), which is 150 grams.\n\nμx̄ = μ = 150 grams\n\nNext, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄). This is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation (σ) by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1 gram\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 148 grams. The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) from the sample mean (x̄) and then dividing by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄).\n\nz = (x̄ - μx̄) / σx̄ = (148 - 150) / 1 = -2\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability that the average weight of the bags is less than 148 grams by looking up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator with a normal distribution function.\n\nThe probability for a z-score of -2 is approximately 0.0228 or 2.28%. So, there is a 2.28% chance that the average weight of the 100 bags is less than 148 grams."
