    "message_1": "A committee of 5 students is to be formed from a group of 10 students. If two of the 10 students are identical twins who refuse to join the committee together, how many different committees can be formed?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the concept of combinations. First, let's find the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 students from a group of 10 students without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, r is the number of students to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to form a committee with both twins in it. We can treat the twins as a single entity, so we have 9 entities (8 individual students and 1 pair of twins) to choose from. We need to select 4 entities (since the twins count as 1) to form a committee of 5 students:\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!(9-4)!)\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!5!)\nC(9, 4) = 126\n\nNow, to find the number of committees that can be formed without both twins, we subtract the number of committees with both twins from the total number of committees:\n\nTotal committees without both twins = Total committees - Committees with both twins\nTotal committees without both twins = 252 - 126\nTotal committees without both twins = 126\n\nSo, there are 126 different committees that can be formed without both twins."
