    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the space obtained by removing a point from the unit circle in the complex plane, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the space: The space we are considering is the unit circle in the complex plane with a point removed. Let's denote this space as X.\n\n2. Determine the homotopy equivalence: The space X is homotopy equivalent to the punctured plane, i.e., the complex plane with the origin removed. This is because we can continuously deform the unit circle with a point removed into the punctured plane without changing the topology.\n\n3. Find the fundamental group of the homotopy equivalent space: The fundamental group of the punctured plane is known to be the group of integers, denoted as Z. This is because any loop in the punctured plane can be continuously deformed into a loop that winds around the origin a certain number of times (positive for counterclockwise and negative for clockwise), and the winding number is an integer.\n\n4. Conclusion: The fundamental group of the space obtained by removing a point from the unit circle in the complex plane is isomorphic to the group of integers, Z."
