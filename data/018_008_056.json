    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nLet's find AxB and BxA:\n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nBxA = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nBxA = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in AxB and BxA are not the same. For example, (1,3) is in AxB but not in BxA, and (3,1) is in BxA but not in AxB. Therefore, AxB â‰  BxA, which proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
