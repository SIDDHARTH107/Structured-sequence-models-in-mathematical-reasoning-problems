    "message_2": "A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nB × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}.\n\nNow, let's compare A × B and B × A. We can see that the ordered pairs in A × B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B × A. For example, (1, 4) ∈ A × B but (1, 4) ∉ B × A. Similarly, (4, 1) ∈ B × A but (4, 1) ∉ A × B.\n\nTherefore, A × B is not equal to B × A."
