    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces electronic components. It is known that on average, 3% of the components produced are defective. If the company produces 10,000 components in a week, what is the probability that at least 300 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective components\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of components produced (10,000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective components\n- p is the probability of a component being defective (0.03 in this case)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a component not being defective (0.97 in this case)\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 300 defective components, which means we need to find the probability of having 300, 301, 302, ..., up to 10,000 defective components. To do this, we can find the probability of having less than 300 defective components and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X >= 300) = 1 - P(X < 300) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 299)]\n\nCalculating each probability for P(X = 0) to P(X = 299) would be very time-consuming, so we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution to make the calculation easier.\n\nThe normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution, which are given by:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nFor this problem, μ = 10,000 * 0.03 = 300 and σ = sqrt(10,000 * 0.03 * 0.97) ≈ 16.93.\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWe want to find P(X >= 300), which is equivalent to finding P(Z >= (300 - 300) / 16.93) = P(Z >= 0). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that P(Z >= 0) ≈ 0.5.\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 300 defective components is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
