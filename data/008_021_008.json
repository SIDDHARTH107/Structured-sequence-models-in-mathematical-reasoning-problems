    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations by dividing the second equation by -2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n1) 5x + 3y - z = 1\n2) 5x + 3y - z = 1\n3) 5x + 3y - z = 1\n\nNow, we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and they all lie on the same line represented by the equation 5x + 3y - z = 1."
