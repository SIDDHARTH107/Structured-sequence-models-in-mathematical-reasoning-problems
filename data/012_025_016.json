    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once. In the given graph, we can find a Hamiltonian cycle starting and ending at vertex A as follows:\n\nA → B → C → E → D → F → G → H → A\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian cycle is A-B-C-E-D-F-G-H-A."
