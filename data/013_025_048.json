    "message_1": "The Traveler's Dilemma is a game where two players simultaneously decide on a bid for a prize. The player with the lower bid gets the prize but also receives a penalty equal to their bid, while the player with the higher bid gets nothing but pays the amount of their bid as a penalty. \n\nHere's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve about the Traveler's Dilemma:\n\nTwo travelers, Alice and Bob, are each given the opportunity to submit a bid for a cash prize. The rules are that the winning bid is the lowest unique bid, and the winner receives the cash prize plus their bid, while the loser pays his or her bid as a penalty. \n\nAlice and Bob each submit a bid, and the bids are:\n\nAlice: $50\nBob: $49\n\nAssuming that both Alice and Bob follow a rational strategy, what will be the outcome of this game? How much money will Alice receive or pay as a penalty, and how much money will Bob receive or pay as a penalty?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, Bob has the lower bid of $49, so he wins the cash prize. Since the winner receives the cash prize plus their bid, Bob receives a total of $49 + cash prize. Alice, having the higher bid, loses and pays her bid of $50 as a penalty.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of the cash prize is not provided in the problem, so we cannot determine the exact amount Bob receives. But we can conclude that Alice pays a penalty of $50 and Bob receives the cash prize plus his bid of $49."
