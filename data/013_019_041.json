    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, A and B, and they are trying to split a prize of $100. However, before they make their split, they can communicate with each other through a messaging system. Player A can either send a message of \"fair split\" or \"unequal split\" to Player B. If Player B receives a message of \"fair split\", then they will split the prize equally. If Player B receives a message of \"unequal split\", then Player A will offer a proposal for the split, and Player B can either accept or reject it. If Player B rejects the offer, then both players walk away with nothing.\n\nAssuming rational behavior from both players, what is the optimal strategy for Player A? What is the expected payoff for each player under this strategy?",
    "message_2": "The optimal strategy for Player A is to send a message of \"unequal split\" and then propose a split that gives Player B slightly more than $50. This is because Player B, being rational, would prefer to accept a split that gives them slightly more than $50 rather than risk getting nothing by rejecting the offer. Player A should propose a split that gives them as much as possible while still ensuring that Player B accepts the offer.\n\nFor example, Player A could propose a split of $49.99 for themselves and $50.01 for Player B. In this case, Player B would accept the offer, as they would receive slightly more than they would in a fair split. Player A would also benefit from this strategy, as they would receive almost half of the prize.\n\nUnder this strategy, the expected payoff for Player A would be $49.99, and the expected payoff for Player B would be $50.01."
