    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nWe can also use the fact that in a planar graph, each face is bounded by at least 3 edges, and each edge is shared by 2 faces. Therefore, we have:\n\n3f ≤ 2e\n\nNow, we are given a graph with 7 vertices (v = 7) and 10 edges (e = 10). We want to find the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 7 vertices can have.\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can write:\n\nf = e - v + 2\n\nSubstituting the inequality 3f ≤ 2e, we get:\n\n3(e - v + 2) ≤ 2e\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\n3e - 3v + 6 ≤ 2e\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nNow, we can substitute v = 7:\n\ne ≤ 3(7) - 6\ne ≤ 21 - 6\ne ≤ 15\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 7 vertices can have is 15. Since our given graph has 10 edges, which is less than or equal to 15, it is possible for the graph to be planar."
