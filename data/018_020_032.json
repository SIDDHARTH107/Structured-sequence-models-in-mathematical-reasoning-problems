    "message_2": "First, we find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 3, 5} ∪ {2, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we find the union of this result with C:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∪ {2, 5, 6, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n\nFinally, we find the symmetric difference of the union we just found and A:\n\n({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} ∆ A) = {2, 4, 6, 8} ∪ {1, 3, 7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of the union and A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}."
