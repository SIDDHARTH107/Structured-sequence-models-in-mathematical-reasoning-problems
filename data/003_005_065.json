    "message_2": "To find the value of arccos(0.5) + arctan(1/3) in degrees, we first need to find the individual values of arccos(0.5) and arctan(1/3) in degrees.\n\n1. arccos(0.5):\nThe arccos function is the inverse of the cosine function. We know that cos(60°) = 0.5, so arccos(0.5) = 60°.\n\n2. arctan(1/3):\nThe arctan function is the inverse of the tangent function. To find the angle whose tangent is 1/3, we can use a calculator or a table of trigonometric values. Using a calculator, we find that arctan(1/3) ≈ 18.435°.\n\nNow, we can add the two angles together:\n\narccos(0.5) + arctan(1/3) = 60° + 18.435° ≈ 78.435°."
