    "message_2": "To prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, we will use proof by contradiction. We will assume that the square root of 2 is rational and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that the square root of 2 is rational. This means that it can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and b is not equal to 0.\n\nIf the square root of 2 is equal to a/b, then we can square both sides of the equation:\n\n2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by b^2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n2b^2 = a^2\n\nThis equation tells us that a^2 is an even number since it is equal to 2 times another integer (b^2). If a^2 is even, then a must also be even (since the square of an odd number is always odd). Let's say a = 2c, where c is an integer.\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the equation:\n\n2b^2 = (2c)^2 = 4c^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nb^2 = 2c^2\n\nNow, we see that b^2 is also an even number since it is equal to 2 times another integer (c^2). If b^2 is even, then b must also be even (for the same reason as before). Let's say b = 2d, where d is an integer.\n\nHowever, this means that both a and b are even, which contradicts our original assumption that a and b have no common factors other than 1 (i.e., they are coprime). This contradiction means that our initial assumption that the square root of 2 is rational must be false.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 2 is irrational."
