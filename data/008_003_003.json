    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to bring the matrix to its row echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, -1, 4],\n [2, 1, -3],\n [-5, 0, 7]]\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have a non-zero element in the first row and first column.\n\n[[2, 1, -3],\n [3, -1, 4],\n [-5, 0, 7]]\n\nStep 2: Add (-3/2) * row 1 to row 2 and add (5/2) * row 1 to row 3 to eliminate the elements below the first element in the first column.\n\n[[2, 1, -3],\n [0, -2.5, 8.5],\n [0, 2.5, -0.5]]\n\nStep 3: Multiply row 2 by (-1/2.5) to have a non-zero element in the second row and second column.\n\n[[2, 1, -3],\n [0, 1, -3.4],\n [0, 2.5, -0.5]]\n\nStep 4: Add (-2.5) * row 2 to row 3 to eliminate the element below the second element in the second column.\n\n[[2, 1, -3],\n [0, 1, -3.4],\n [0, 0, 8]]\n\nStep 5: Divide row 3 by 8 to have a non-zero element in the third row and third column.\n\n[[2, 1, -3],\n [0, 1, -3.4],\n [0, 0, 1]]\n\nNow, the matrix A is in its row echelon form. All rows are non-zero, so the rank of the matrix A is 3."
