    "message_1": "Sure, here's a linear programming problem for the student to solve:\n\nA furniture manufacturer produces two types of tables: a standard table and a deluxe table. Each standard table requires 3 hours of carpentry work and 1 hour of finishing work, while each deluxe table requires 2 hours of carpentry work and 2 hours of finishing work. The manufacturer has 30 hours of carpentry work available each day and 20 hours of finishing work available each day. If the profit on each standard table is $50 and the profit on each deluxe table is $70, how many tables of each type should be produced each day to maximize the daily profit?\n\nPlease note that the answer may depend on the assumptions made during the solution of the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of standard tables and y be the number of deluxe tables produced each day. We want to maximize the daily profit, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nP(x, y) = 50x + 70y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 30 (Carpentry hours constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 20 (Finishing hours constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 30\n   y ≤ (30 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 20\n   y ≤ (20 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied, and x and y are non-negative.\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. Intersection of y = (30 - 3x) / 2 and y = (20 - x) / 2:\n   (30 - 3x) / 2 = (20 - x) / 2\n   30 - 3x = 20 - x\n   2x = 10\n   x = 5\n   y = (20 - 5) / 2 = 7.5\n   Point A: (5, 7.5)\n\nB.

Intersection of y = (20 - x) / 2 and y = 0:\n   x = 20\n   Point C: (20, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each corner point:\n\nP(A) = 50(5) + 70(7.5) = 250 + 525 = $775\nP(B) = 50(0) + 70(15) = 0 + 1050 = $1,050\nP(C) = 50(20) + 70(0) = 1000 + 0 = $1,000\n\nThe maximum daily profit occurs at point B, where 0 standard tables and 15 deluxe tables are produced, resulting in a profit of $1,050."
