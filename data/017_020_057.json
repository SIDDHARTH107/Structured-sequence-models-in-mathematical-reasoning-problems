    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 40: 40 = 2^3 * 5^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups by using the formula for the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization: p(3) * p(1) = 3 * 1 = 3. The possible abelian groups are: Z_40, Z_20 x Z_2, and Z_8 x Z_5.\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups. To do this, we can use the fact that a group of order 40 must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup (since the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup is 8, which is the smallest prime divisor of 40). Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Since P is normal, we know that the group G is a semidirect product of P and Q, i.e., G = P â‹Š Q. The number of non-abelian groups depends on the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from Q to Aut(P).\n\n4. Since P is a group of order 5, it is cyclic, and Aut(P) is isomorphic to Z_4. The group Q can be one of the following: Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, or Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. We need to count the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from each of these groups to Z_4.\n\n   a) For Q = Z_8, there are three non-trivial homomorphisms to Z_4 (since Z_4 has three non-identity elements).\n   b) For Q = Z_4 x Z_2, there are three non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_4 to Z_4 and one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_2 to Z_4. However, we need to subtract the one homomorphism that is the direct product of these two (to avoid double counting), so there are 3 + 1 - 1 = 3 non-trivial homomorphisms.\n   c) For Q = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms to Z_4, since Z_4 has no non-trivial elements of order 2.\n\n5. In total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\n6. Combining the abelian and non-abelian groups, there are 3 + 6 = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
