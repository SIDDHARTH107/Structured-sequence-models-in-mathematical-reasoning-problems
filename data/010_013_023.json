Suppose $E$ is equipped with a metric $g$ that is compatible with the bundle structure. \n\nFor a point $p\\in M$, let $S_pE$ denote the sphere bundle of $E$ over $p$. That is, $S_pE$ consists of all vectors in $E_p$ of length $1$ with respect to the metric $g_p$.\n\nSuppose that $E$ is trivial, i.e., $E\\cong M\\times \\mathbb{R}^k$ as a bundle. Compute the homotopy group $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE)$ for each point $p\\in M$.",
    "message_2": "Since $E$ is trivial, we have $E \\cong M \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$. Then, for each point $p \\in M$, we have $E_p \\cong \\{p\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^k \\cong \\mathbb{R}^k$. The sphere bundle $S_pE$ consists of all vectors in $E_p$ of length $1$ with respect to the metric $g_p$. Since $E_p \\cong \\mathbb{R}^k$, we have $S_pE \\cong S^{k-1}$, where $S^{k-1}$ is the $(k-1)$-dimensional sphere.\n\nNow we want to compute the homotopy group $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE)$. Since $S_pE \\cong S^{k-1}$, we have $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE) \\cong \\pi_{n-1}(S^{k-1})$. The homotopy groups of spheres are well-known:\n\n1. If $n-1 < k-1$, then $\\pi_{n-1}(S^{k-1}) = 0$.\n2. If $n-1 = k-1$, then $\\pi_{n-1}(S^{k-1}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3. If $n-1 > k-1$, then $\\pi_{n-1}(S^{k-1})$ is more complicated and depends on the specific values of $n$ and $k$. However, for our purposes, it is enough to know that the homotopy group is nontrivial in general.\n\nSo, for each point $p \\in M$, the homotopy group $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE)$ is as follows:\n\n1. If $n-1 < k-1$, then $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE) = 0$.\n2. If $n-1 = k-1$, then $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3. If $n-1 > k-1$, then $\\pi_{n-1}(S_pE)$ is nontrivial in general, and its specific structure depends on the values of $n$ and $k$."
