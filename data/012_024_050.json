    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, since we don't know if the graph is planar, we can use the inequality for non-planar graphs: E ≤ 3V - 6.\n\nIn our case, V = 12 and E = 18. Let's check if the inequality holds:\n\n18 ≤ 3 * 12 - 6\n18 ≤ 36 - 6\n18 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality does not hold, the graph is non-planar. Now, we need to find the genus of the graph. The genus is the minimum number of handles that need to be added to a sphere to embed the graph without edge crossings.\n\nWe can use the Heawood formula to find an upper bound for the genus:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6, where g is the genus.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for g:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nSubstituting the values of V and E:\n\ng ≥ (18 - 3 * 12 + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (-18) / 6\ng ≥ -3\n\nSince the genus cannot be negative, the minimum genus is 0. However, we already determined that the graph is non-planar, so the genus must be at least 1.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the graph is 1."
