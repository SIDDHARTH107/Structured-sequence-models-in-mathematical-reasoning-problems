    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to topological quantum field theory:\n\nConsider an oriented closed surface S with genus g. Let Z(S) denote the partition function of a certain topological quantum field theory associated to S (which takes values in a certain algebra A). Suppose we know that Z(S) = |A|^g, where |A| denotes the dimension of A as a vector space. \n\nWhat is Z(T), the partition function of the same topological quantum field theory associated to the torus T, which has genus 1?",
    "message_2": "Given that Z(S) = |A|^g for a surface S with genus g, we can find the partition function Z(T) for the torus T, which has genus 1, by substituting g = 1 into the formula:\n\nZ(T) = |A|^1 = |A|\n\nSo, the partition function Z(T) of the topological quantum field theory associated to the torus T is equal to the dimension of the algebra A as a vector space."
