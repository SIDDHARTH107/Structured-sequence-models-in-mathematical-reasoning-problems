    "message_1": "A car travels along a curve in two dimensions represented by the function $r(t)=(2t, 3t-1)$. The car carries a vector with coordinates $v (1,2)$ at time $t=0$. Determine the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve $r(t)$ at time $t=2$.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve $r(t)$ at time $t=2$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at $t=2$. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to time:\n\n$r'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t, 3t-1) = (2, 3)$\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve. The parallel transport of a vector is the vector that remains parallel to the original vector as it moves along the curve. In this case, we want to find the vector $v_{\\parallel}$ that is parallel to $v$ and has the same magnitude as $v$.\n\nTo find $v_{\\parallel}$, we can project $v$ onto the tangent vector $r'(t)$:\n\n$v_{\\parallel} = \\frac{v \\cdot r'(t)}{r'(t) \\cdot r'(t)} r'(t)$\n\n$v_{\\parallel} = \\frac{(1,2) \\cdot (2,3)}{(2,3) \\cdot (2,3)} (2,3)$\n\n$v_{\\parallel} = \\frac{8}{13} (2,3)$\n\n$v_{\\parallel} = (\\frac{16}{13}, \\frac{24}{13})$\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector $v$ along the curve $r(t)$ at time $t=2$ is $v_{\\parallel} = (\\frac{16}{13}, \\frac{24}{13})$."
