    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The number of line segments in a Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^n - 1\n\nwhere n is the order of the Hilbert curve.\n\nFor a fourth-order Hilbert curve, n = 4. Plugging this into the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 4^4 - 1 = 256 - 1 = 255\n\nSo, a fourth-order Hilbert curve requires 255 line segments."
