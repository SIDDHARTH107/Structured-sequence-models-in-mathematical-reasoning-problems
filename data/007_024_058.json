    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 9 base 7, we can use the baby-step giant-step algorithm. \n\n1. Calculate m = ceil(sqrt(23 - 1)) = ceil(sqrt(22)) = 5\n2. Create two lists: baby steps and giant steps.\n3. Calculate the baby steps: 7^0, 7^1, ..., 7^(m-1) (mod 23)\n   1, 7, 3, 21, 9\n4. Calculate the giant steps: 7^(-m), 7^(-2m), ..., 7^(-km) (mod 23) multiplied by 9\n   First, find the modular inverse of 7^m (mod 23): (7^5)^(-1) (mod 23)\n   Using the extended Euclidean algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem, we find that the modular inverse of 7^5 (mod 23) is 3.\n   Now, calculate the giant steps: 9 * 7^(-m), 9 * 7^(-2m), ..., 9 * 7^(-km) (mod 23)\n   9 * 3^0, 9 * 3^1, 9 * 3^2, ...\n   9, 4, 12\n5. Compare the two lists and find a match:\n   9 is in both lists.\n6. Let i be the index of the match in the baby steps list and j be the index of the match in the giant steps list.\n   i = 4, j = 0\n7. Calculate x = im + j = 4 * 5 + 0 = 20\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 9 base 7 (mod 23) is x = 20, since 7^20 â‰¡ 9 (mod 23)."
