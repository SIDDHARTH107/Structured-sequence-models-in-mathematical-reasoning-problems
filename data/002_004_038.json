    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. \n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 10 cm and the width (W) is 7 cm. \n\nSo, the perimeter (P) is:\n\nP = 2(10 + 7)\nP = 2(17)\nP = 34 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 34 cm."
