    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext '11001011' using a Feistel cipher with a 4-bit round function, we will perform the following steps for 2 rounds of encryption:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into two equal parts: L0 = '1100' and R0 = '1011'.\n2. Perform the first round of encryption:\n   a. Calculate the output of the round function F(R0, K1), where K1 is the first round key derived from the initial key '0011'. Since the round function is not specified, we will denote the output as F1.\n   b. XOR the output of the round function with L0: L1 = L0 ⊕ F1.\n   c. Swap the right and left halves: R1 = R0 and L1 = L1.\n3. Perform the second round of encryption:\n   a. Calculate the output of the round function F(R1, K2), where K2 is the second round key derived from the initial key '0011'. Since the round function is not specified, we will denote the output as F2.\n   b. XOR the output of the round function with L1: L2 = L1 ⊕ F2.\n   c. Swap the right and left halves: R2 = R1 and L2 = L2.\n\nThe ciphertext will be the concatenation of L2 and R2.\n\nHowever, without the specific round function and key schedule, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. The final ciphertext will be in the form L2R2, where L2 = L1 ⊕ F2 and R2 = R1."
