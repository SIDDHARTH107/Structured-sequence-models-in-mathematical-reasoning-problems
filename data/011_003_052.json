    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose three items from a set of five distinct items using Pascal's triangle, we can use the combination formula, which is represented as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 5 and k = 3.\n\nPascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The rows of Pascal's triangle represent the coefficients in the binomial expansion, and the numbers in each row are the combinations of choosing k items from n items.\n\nHere's the beginning of Pascal's triangle:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n```\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose three items from a set of five distinct items, we look at the row where n = 5 (the 6th row, since the first row is n = 0) and the entry where k = 3 (the 4th entry, since the first entry is k = 0). In this case, the number is 10.\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to choose three items from a set of five distinct items using Pascal's triangle."
