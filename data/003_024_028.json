    "message_1": "A vector has a magnitude of 10 units and makes an angle of 30 degrees with a second vector. What is the projection of the first vector onto the second vector?",
    "message_2": "The projection of the first vector onto the second vector can be found using the formula:\n\nProjection = |A| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| is the magnitude of the first vector and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 10 units and θ = 30 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (in radians) = (30 degrees * π) / 180 = π/6\n\nNow, we can find the projection:\n\nProjection = 10 * cos(π/6) = 10 * (√3/2) = 5√3 units\n\nSo, the projection of the first vector onto the second vector is 5√3 units."
