    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases its length with each iteration. In the first iteration, the length of the curve is 2 units. With each subsequent iteration, the curve is scaled down by a factor of 2 and replicated 4 times.\n\nSo, the length of the curve in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength of the curve in the nth iteration = 2^n * Length of the curve in the first iteration\n\nFor the 3rd iteration, n = 3:\n\nLength of the curve in the 3rd iteration = 2^3 * Length of the curve in the first iteration\nLength of the curve in the 3rd iteration = 8 * 2\nLength of the curve in the 3rd iteration = 16 units"
