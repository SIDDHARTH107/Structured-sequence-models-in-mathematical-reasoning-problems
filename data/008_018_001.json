    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using block matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 13 |\n    | 31 |\n    | 49 |\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)) and multiply it with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nTo find the inverse of A, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 2(6*10 - 7*9) - 3(5*10 - 7*8) + 4(5*9 - 6*8)\n       = 2(60 - 63) - 3(50 - 56) + 4(45 - 48)\n       = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\n       = -6 + 18 - 12\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the matrix A is singular, and it does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use block matrices to solve this system of equations. We need to use other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule, to analyze the system further and determine if it has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution."
