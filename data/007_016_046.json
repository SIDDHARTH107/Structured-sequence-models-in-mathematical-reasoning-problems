    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe prime numbers greater than 100 are: 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, ...\n\nLet's check each one:\n\n1. For p = 101, 2p + 1 = 203, which is not prime (divisible by 7).\n2. For p = 103, 2p + 1 = 207, which is not prime (divisible by 3).\n3. For p = 107, 2p + 1 = 215, which is not prime (divisible by 5).\n4. For p = 109, 2p + 1 = 219, which is not prime (divisible by 3).\n5. For p = 113, 2p + 1 = 227, which is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 100 is 113."
