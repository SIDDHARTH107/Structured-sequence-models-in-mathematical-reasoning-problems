    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\nA * X = B\n```\n\nWhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\n```\nA = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 2  4  2 |\n    | 3  6  3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 4 |\n    | 8 |\n    | 12 |\n```\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\n```\ndet(A) = 1*(4*3 - 2*6) - 2*(2*3 - 2*3) + 1*(2*6 - 4*3)\n       = 1*(12 - 12) - 2*(6 - 6) + 1*(12 - 12)\n       = 0\n```\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is 0, it is a singular matrix, which means it does not have an inverse. This implies that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. It could either have infinitely many solutions or no solution at all.\n\nTo determine if the system has infinitely many solutions or no solution, we can use the rank method. We find the rank of matrix A and the augmented matrix [A|B].\n\nMatrix A:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 |\n| 2  4  2 |\n| 3  6  3 |\n```\n\nRow reduce matrix A:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 |\n| 0  0  0 | (R2 - 2*R1)\n| 0  0  0 | (R3 - 3*R1)\n```\n\nThe rank of matrix A is 1 (number of non-zero rows).\n\nNow, let's find the rank of the augmented matrix [A|B]:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | 4 |\n| 2  4  2 | 8 |\n| 3  6  3 | 12|\n```\n\nRow reduce the augmented matrix [A|B]:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | 4 |\n| 0  0  0 | 0 | (R2 - 2*R1)\n| 0  0  0 | 0 | (R3 - 3*R1)\n```\n\nThe rank of the augmented matrix [A|B] is also 1.\n\nSince the rank of matrix A and the augmented matrix [A|B] are equal, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. The system is dependent, and the equations describe the same line in three-dimensional space."
