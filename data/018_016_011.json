    "message_2": "1. A × B\nThe Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n2. B × A\nSimilarly, the Cartesian product B × A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n3. (A × B) ∪ (B × A)\nThe union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets. So, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n4. (B × A) ∪ (A × B)\nSince the union operation is commutative, (B × A) ∪ (A × B) = (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's analyze the commutativity of the Cartesian product with respect to union:\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ≠ (B × A) because the ordered pairs in the two sets are different. However, the union operation itself is commutative, as shown in steps 3 and 4, where (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = (B × A) ∪ (A × B).\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, but the union operation is commutative."
