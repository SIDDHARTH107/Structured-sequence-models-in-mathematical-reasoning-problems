    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 1 on the interval [0, 2], we need to first find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it to zero.\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 1\nf'(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow, we set f'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x - 6 = 0\n6x = 6\nx = 1\n\nSo, we have one critical point at x = 1. Now, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 2] as well as the critical point to determine the maximum and minimum values of the function.\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^2 - 6(0) + 1 = 1\nf(1) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 1 = -2\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) + 1 = 1\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 2] is -2, which occurs at x = 1. The maximum value of the function on the interval is 1, which occurs at both x = 0 and x = 2."
