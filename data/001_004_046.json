    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 completely, we can first recognize it as a quadratic in terms of x^2. Let y = x^2, then the polynomial becomes:\n\ny^2 - 4y + 4\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic:\n\n(y - 2)(y - 2)\n\nSince y = x^2, we can substitute it back:\n\n(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 is:\n\n(x^2 - 2)^2"
