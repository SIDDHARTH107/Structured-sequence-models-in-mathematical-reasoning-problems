    "message_2": "Proof 1: If A is compact, then A is closed and bounded.\n\nLet A be a compact subset of the metric space X. \n\nTo show that A is bounded, we need to show that there exists some positive real number M such that for any two points x, y in A, the distance between x and y is less than or equal to M. Since A is compact, for any open cover of A, there exists a finite subcover. Consider the open cover of A consisting of open balls of radius 1 centered at each point in A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover of this open cover, say {B(x_1, 1), B(x_2, 1), ..., B(x_n, 1)}. Let M = max{d(x_i, x_j) + 2 : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}. Then for any x, y in A, there exist i, j such that x ∈ B(x_i, 1) and y ∈ B(x_j, 1). By the triangle inequality, d(x, y) ≤ d(x, x_i) + d(x_i, x_j) + d(x_j, y) ≤ 1 + d(x_i, x_j) + 1 ≤ M. Thus, A is bounded.\n\nTo show that A is closed, we need to show that the complement of A in X, denoted by A^c, is open. Let x be an arbitrary point in A^c. Since A is compact, for any open cover of A, there exists a finite subcover. Consider the open cover of A consisting of open balls B(y, d(x, y)/2) for each y in A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover of this open cover, say {B(y_1, d(x, y_1)/2), B(y_2, d(x, y_2)/2), ..., B(y_n, d(x, y_n)/2)}. Let r = min{d(x, y_i)/2 : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Then the open ball B(x, r) does not intersect A, because if z ∈ B(x, r) and z ∈ B(y_i, d(x, y_i)/2) for some i, then d(x, z) < r ≤ d(x, y_i)/2, which contradicts the triangle inequality. Thus, B(x, r) is a subset of A^c, and A^c is open. Therefore, A is closed.\n\nProof 2: If A is closed and bounded, then A is compact.\n\nLet A be a closed and bounded subset of the metric space X. We will prove that A is compact using the sequential compactness definition, which states that a subset of a metric space is compact if and only if every sequence in the subset has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in the subset.\n\nLet {x_n} be an arbitrary sequence in A. Since A is bounded, the sequence {x_n} is also bounded. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, every bounded sequence in a metric space has a convergent subsequence. Let {x_{n_k}} be a convergent subsequence of {x_n} that converges to a point x. Since A is closed, the limit point x must be in A. Thus, every sequence in A has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in A, and A is compact.\n\nNumerical example:\n\nLet X be the metric space of real numbers with the standard Euclidean metric, and let A = {0} U {1/n : n is a positive integer}. We will show that A is compact.\n\nFirst, we show that A is closed. Let x be a limit point of A. If x > 1, then there exists an open ball B(x, (x-1)/2) that does not intersect A, which contradicts the fact that x is a limit point. If 0 < x ≤ 1, then there exists a positive integer N such that 1/N < x. Since 1/n > 0 for all positive integers n, we have x ≥ 1/N > 0. Thus, x ∈ A. Therefore, A is closed.\n\nNext, we show that A is bounded. Let x, y ∈ A. If x = 0, then d(x, y) = y ≤ 1. If x ≠ 0, then x = 1/n for some positive integer n, and d(x, y) = |x - y| ≤ |x - 0| + |0 - y| = x + y ≤ 1 + 1 = 2. Thus, A is bounded.\n\nSince A is closed and bounded, A is compact."
