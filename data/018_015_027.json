    "message_2": "First, let's find AxB (the Cartesian product of A and B). AxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. \n\nAxB = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nNow let's find BxA (the Cartesian product of B and A). BxA is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nBxA = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of the two sets (AxB) ∩ (BxA). The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(AxB) ∩ (BxA) = {} (empty set)\n\nThe intersection is an empty set, which means there are no common elements between AxB and BxA.\n\nNow let's show that the intersection is not commutative. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter, i.e., A ∩ B = B ∩ A. In this case, we are looking at (AxB) ∩ (BxA) and (BxA) ∩ (AxB).\n\n(AxB) ∩ (BxA) = {} (empty set)\n(BxA) ∩ (AxB) = {} (empty set)\n\nIn this case, the intersection is commutative since (AxB) ∩ (BxA) = (BxA) ∩ (AxB). However, it is important to note that the Cartesian products AxB and BxA themselves are not commutative, as AxB ≠ BxA. The intersection operation is commutative, but the Cartesian product operation is not."
