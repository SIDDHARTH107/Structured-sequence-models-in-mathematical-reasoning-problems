    "message_2": "1. Show that the surface is a sphere centered at point (1,1,1):\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as follows:\n\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 1$\n\nNow, we can group the terms:\n\n$(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 1$\n\nThis is the equation of a sphere with center at point (1,1,1) and radius 1.\n\n2. Find the radius of the sphere:\n\nAs we found in the previous step, the radius of the sphere is 1.\n\n3. Calculate the area of the portion of the sphere that lies above the plane z=0:\n\nSince the sphere is centered at (1,1,1) and has a radius of 1, the portion of the sphere above the plane z=0 is a hemisphere. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $A = 4\\pi r^2$, where r is the radius. Therefore, the surface area of a hemisphere is half of the surface area of a sphere, which is $A_\\text{hemisphere} = 2\\pi r^2$.\n\nIn this case, the radius is 1, so the surface area of the hemisphere above the plane z=0 is:\n\n$A_\\text{hemisphere} = 2\\pi (1)^2 = 2\\pi$\n\nSo, the area of the portion of the sphere that lies above the plane z=0 is $2\\pi$ square units."
