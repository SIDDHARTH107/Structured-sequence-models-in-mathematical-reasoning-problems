    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 857 is divided by 12 using modular arithmetic, we can use the modulo operation:\n\n857 ≡ r (mod 12)\n\nwhere r is the remainder. To find r, we can divide 857 by 12 and find the remainder:\n\n857 ÷ 12 = 71 with a remainder of 5\n\nSo, 857 ≡ 5 (mod 12). The remainder when 857 is divided by 12 is 5."
