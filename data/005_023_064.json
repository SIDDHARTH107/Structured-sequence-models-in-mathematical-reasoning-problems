    "message_1": "Suppose that a teacher graded her students by giving them a math test. The average score of the class is 85 out of 100, with a standard deviation of 7. However, there is one student who scored 30. Using the z-score method, determine if this student's score is an outlier or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the student's score is an outlier using the z-score method, we first need to calculate the z-score. The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the individual score, μ is the mean (average) score, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 30, μ = 85, and σ = 7. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (30 - 85) / 7\nz = (-55) / 7\nz ≈ -7.86\n\nA z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean an individual score is. In general, a z-score with an absolute value greater than 2 or 3 is considered an outlier, depending on the specific context or field.\n\nIn this case, the z-score is approximately -7.86, which is much greater than the absolute value of 2 or 3. Therefore, we can conclude that the student's score of 30 is an outlier."
