    "message_1": "Suppose a high school has 300 students and 40% of them have scored an A grade in their mathematics test. What is the probability that if we randomly select 5 students from this school, at least 2 of them have scored an A grade in their mathematics test?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (A grades) in n trials (students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (A grade) for each trial (student)\n- n is the total number of trials (students)\n- k is the number of successes (A grades)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (we are selecting 5 students)\n- p = 0.4 (40% of the students have an A grade)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 2 of the 5 students have scored an A grade, which means we need to find the probability for 2, 3, 4, and 5 A grades and sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\n\nWe will now calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\n1. P(X = 2):\nC(5, 2) = 10\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (0.4)^2 * (0.6)^3 ≈ 0.2304\n\n2. P(X = 3):\nC(5, 3) = 10\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.4)^3 * (0.6)^2 ≈ 0.3456\n\n3. P(X = 4):\nC(5, 4) = 5\nP(X = 4) = 5 * (0.4)^4 * (0.6)^1 ≈ 0.1536\n\n4. P(X = 5):\nC(5, 5) = 1\nP(X = 5) = 1 * (0.4)^5 * (0.6)^0 ≈ 0.01024\n\nNow, we will sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 0.2304 + 0.3456 + 0.1536 + 0.01024 ≈ 0.73984\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least 2 of the 5 randomly selected students have scored an A grade in their mathematics test is approximately 0.73984 or 73.98%."
