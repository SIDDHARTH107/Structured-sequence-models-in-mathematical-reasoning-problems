    "message_2": "To find the probability of obtaining exactly 5 heads in 8 coin tosses, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (coin tosses), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), and p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin).\n\nIn this case, n = 8, k = 5, and p = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we need to find the binomial coefficient (n choose k), which is calculated as:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere ! denotes the factorial.\n\n(8 choose 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!) = 8! / (5!3!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = (56) * (0.5)^5 * (0.5)^(8-5) = 56 * 0.03125 * 0.125 = 0.21875\n\nSo, the probability of obtaining exactly 5 heads in 8 coin tosses is 0.21875 or 21.875%."
