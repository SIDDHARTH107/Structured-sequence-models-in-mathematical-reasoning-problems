    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = 7 - 2x\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\nx - 3(7 - 2x) = -11\n\nNext, we'll simplify and solve for x:\n\nx - 21 + 6x = -11\n7x - 21 = -11\n\nNow, add 21 to both sides:\n\n7x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nx = 10/7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for y:\n\ny = 7 - 2(10/7)\n\nMultiply:\n\ny = 7 - 20/7\n\nTo subtract, we need a common denominator, which is 7:\n\ny = 49/7 - 20/7\n\nSubtract:\n\ny = 29/7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 10/7 and y = 29/7"
