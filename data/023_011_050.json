    "message_1": "A signal with a period of 10 ms and an amplitude of 5 V is given. Using the Fourier transform, find the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the signal.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the signal, we can use the formula:\n\nfundamental frequency (f) = 1 / period (T)\n\nGiven the period T = 10 ms (0.01 seconds), we can calculate the fundamental frequency:\n\nf = 1 / 0.01 = 100 Hz\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency of the signal is 100 Hz.\n\nSince the given signal has an amplitude of 5 V, the amplitude of the fundamental frequency component in the Fourier transform will also be 5 V.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the signal are 100 Hz and 5 V, respectively."
