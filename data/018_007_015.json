    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 5 elements. What is the size of its power set and how does it compare to the size of A? Prove that the power set of A is always larger than A.",
    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The size of the power set of a set with n elements is 2^n.\n\nIn this case, A has 5 elements, so the size of its power set P(A) is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of P(A) to the size of A. The size of A is 5, and the size of P(A) is 32. Clearly, the size of P(A) is larger than the size of A.\n\nTo prove that the power set of A is always larger than A, consider the following:\n\n1. The empty set is always a subset of A, so it is an element of P(A). This means that P(A) has at least one element that is not in A.\n\n2. A itself is also an element of P(A), but A is not an element of A (since A is a set of elements, not a set of sets). This means that P(A) has at least one more element than A.\n\n3. For every element x in A, there is a subset of A that contains only x. This subset is also an element of P(A). Therefore, P(A) has at least as many elements as A.\n\nCombining these observations, we can conclude that the power set of A is always larger than A."
