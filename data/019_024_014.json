    "message_1": "While Abductive logic typically deals with finding the best explanation for an observation, we can still create a specific problem within this topic. \n\nProblem: \nA math student has observed that if they add 3 to a number and then subtract 2 from their new result, they always end up with a multiple of 5. Using abductive logic, can the student determine what the original number was?\n\nSolution:\nLet x be the original number.\nTherefore, by abductive logic, we can work backwards from the final result (a multiple of 5) to determine what x must have been. \n\nAdding 2 to the final result gives a number that is 2 less than a multiple of 5.\nSubtracting 3 from this intermediate result gives a number that is 1 less than a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the original number x must have been equal to a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. In other words, x = 5n + 4, where n is a non-negative integer.",
