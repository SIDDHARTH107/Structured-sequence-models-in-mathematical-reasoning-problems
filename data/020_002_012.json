    "message_1": "Here is a nonlinear programming problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a manufacturer produces two types of chairs, A and B, each made from the same type of wood and using the same amount of labor. The manufacturer has 200 units of wood and 100 units of labor available. Each type A chair sells for $200, and each type B chair sells for $150. The manufacturer wants to produce a total of 800 chairs, with at least 100 type A chairs. The cost of producing a type A chair is $100, while the cost of producing a type B chair is $80.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of chairs of each type that the manufacturer should produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A chairs and y be the number of type B chairs. We are given the following constraints:\n\n1. Wood constraint: x + y ≤ 200 (since there are 200 units of wood available)\n2. Labor constraint: x + y ≤ 100 (since there are 100 units of labor available)\n3. Total chairs constraint: x + y = 800\n4. Type A chairs constraint: x ≥ 100\n\nThe profit function to maximize is given by:\n\nP(x, y) = 200x + 150y - 100x - 80y = 100x + 70y\n\nSince we have a constraint that x + y = 800, we can rewrite the profit function in terms of x:\n\nP(x) = 100x + 70(800 - x) = 100x + 56000 - 70x = 30x + 56000\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal value of x that satisfies the constraints and maximizes the profit function. \n\nFirst, let's consider the wood constraint:\n\nx + y ≤ 200\nx + (800 - x) ≤ 200\n800 - x ≤ 200\nx ≥ 600\n\nNext, let's consider the labor constraint:\n\nx + y ≤ 100\nx + (800 - x) ≤ 100\n800 - x ≤ 100\nx ≥ 700\n\nFinally, let's consider the type A chairs constraint:\n\nx ≥ 100\n\nTaking into account all the constraints, we have:\n\n700 ≤ x ≤ 800\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the profit function P(x) in this interval. Since P(x) is a linear function, the maximum will occur at one of the endpoints of the interval. \n\nP(700) = 30(700) + 56000 = 21000 + 56000 = 77000\nP(800) = 30(800) + 56000 = 24000 + 56000 = 80000\n\nSince P(800) > P(700), the maximum profit occurs when x = 800. Therefore, the manufacturer should produce 800 type A chairs and 0 type B chairs to maximize profit. The maximum profit will be $80,000."
