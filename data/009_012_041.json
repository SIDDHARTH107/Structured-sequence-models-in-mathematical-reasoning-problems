    "message_1": "Consider a predator-prey model with rabbits (prey) and foxes (predators) in a forest. The differential equations that model the population dynamics of rabbits ($R$) and foxes ($F$) are given by:\n\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = aR - bRF $$\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dt} = cRF - dF $$\n\nwhere $a,b,c$ and $d$ are positive constants that represent the rates of growth and predation. Suppose the initial population of rabbits is 500 and the initial population of foxes is 50. The values of the constants are as follows: $a = 0.02$, $b=0.00004$, $c=0.4$, and $d=0.06$.\n\nWhat will happen to the population of rabbits and foxes over time? Use a numerical method, such as Euler's method or Runge-Kutta method, to estimate the populations after 10 years, given the time step size of 0.1 years. Round your answers to the nearest whole number.",
