    "message_1": "A sample of Polonium-210 has an initial mass of 10 grams. Its half-life is approximately 138 days. How many grams of Polonium-210 will remain after 414 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 10 grams, the time elapsed is 414 days, and the half-life is 138 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 10 * (1/2)^(414 / 138)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the exponent:\n\n414 / 138 = 3\n\nNow we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal mass = 10 * (1/2)^3\n\nNext, we need to calculate the value of (1/2)^3:\n\n(1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nNow we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal mass = 10 * 1/8\n\nFinally, we can calculate the final mass:\n\nFinal mass = 10 * 1/8 = 10/8 = 1.25 grams\n\nSo, after 414 days, there will be 1.25 grams of Polonium-210 remaining."
