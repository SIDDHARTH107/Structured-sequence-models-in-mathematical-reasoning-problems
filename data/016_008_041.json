    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after one iteration, the original line segment is replaced by four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original. So, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after one iteration is approximately 1.2619."
