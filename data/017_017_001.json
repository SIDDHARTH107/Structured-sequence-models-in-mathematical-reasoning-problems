    "message_2": "To determine the number of subgroups of order 5 in a group of order 30, we can use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 30, and let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nAccording to Sylow's Theorems:\n\n1. There exists a Sylow 5-subgroup of G.\n2. All Sylow 5-subgroups of G are conjugate.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, n_5, divides the order of G, and n_5 â‰¡ 1 (mod 5).\n\nSince the order of G is 30, we can factor it as 2 * 3 * 5. The possible divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. We need to find the divisors that are congruent to 1 modulo 5. These are 1 and 6.\n\nIf n_5 = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, which would be a normal subgroup. However, if n_5 = 6, there are six distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nIn general, we cannot determine the exact number of Sylow 5-subgroups without more information about the group G. However, based on the information given, there are either 1 or 6 subgroups of order 5 in a group of order 30."
