However, they would both rather be together than alone. The payoffs (in dollars) for each person are given in the following matrix:\n\n|    | Opera | Football |\n|----|-------|----------|\n| **Opera** | 4,3   | 0,0      |\n| **Football** | 0,0   | 3,4      |\n\nAssuming that they make their choices simultaneously, what is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best response for each player given the other player's choice. \n\nIf Alice chooses Opera, Bob's best response is to choose Opera as well (3 > 0). If Alice chooses Football, Bob's best response is to choose Football (4 > 0).\n\nIf Bob chooses Opera, Alice's best response is to choose Opera (4 > 0). If Bob chooses Football, Alice's best response is to choose Football (3 > 0).\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best response given the other player's choice. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when Alice chooses Opera and Bob chooses Opera, resulting in a payoff of (4, 3)."
