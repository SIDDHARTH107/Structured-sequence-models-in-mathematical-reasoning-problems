    "message_2": "To solve the equation tan(x) + 1 = 0, we first isolate tan(x):\n\ntan(x) = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π) that satisfy this equation.\n\nRecall that the tangent function has a period of π, so we can find the general solution for x:\n\nx = arctan(-1) + kπ, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, we find the principal value of arctan(-1), which is:\n\nx = arctan(-1) = -π/4\n\nSince we want the solutions in the interval [0, 2π), we add multiples of π to the principal value until we find all the solutions in the given interval:\n\nx = -π/4 + π = 3π/4\nx = -π/4 + 2π = 7π/4\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π) are:\n\nx = 3π/4, 7π/4"
