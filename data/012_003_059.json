    "message_2": "The given graph can be visualized as two separate cycles: one with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the other with vertices {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. In each cycle, we can select at most half of the vertices (rounded down) to form an independent set, as selecting more would result in adjacent vertices being part of the set.\n\nFor the cycle with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we can select at most 2 vertices, for example, {1, 3} or {2, 4}. Similarly, for the cycle with vertices {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, we can select at most 2 vertices, for example, {6, 8} or {7, 9}.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 2 + 2 = 4."
