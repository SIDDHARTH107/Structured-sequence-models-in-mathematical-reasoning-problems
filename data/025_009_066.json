    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_3$ of algebraic curves of genus $g=3$, we can use the formula for the dimension of the moduli space of smooth curves of genus $g$:\n\nDimension = $3g-3$\n\nIn this case, $g=3$, so we have:\n\nDimension = $3(3)-3 = 9-3 = 6$\n\nThus, the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_3$ has 6 independent moduli."
