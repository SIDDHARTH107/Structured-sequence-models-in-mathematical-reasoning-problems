    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 over the interval [0, 3], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 4x - 5\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n4x - 5 = 0\n4x = 5\nx = 5/4 = 1.25\n\nNow, we have one critical point at x = 1.25. Next, we need to evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval (x = 0 and x = 3):\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^2 - 5(0) + 3 = 3\nf(1.25) = 2(1.25)^2 - 5(1.25) + 3 = -0.5\nf(3) = 2(3)^2 - 5(3) + 3 = 6\n\nNow, we can compare the function values at these points to determine the maximum and minimum values:\n\nMinimum value: f(1.25) = -0.5\nMaximum value: f(3) = 6\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function over the interval [0, 3] is -0.5, and the maximum value is 6."
