    "message_1": "In a financial company, the probability of a certain type of fraud occurring is 0.25. If the company has 100 employees, what is the probability that at least one employee is involved in that fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one employee being involved in the fraud, it's easier to first find the probability of no employees being involved in the fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of an employee not being involved in the fraud is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nFor all 100 employees to not be involved in the fraud, the probability is 0.75^100 = 1.928749847963918e-14 (approximately).\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one employee being involved in the fraud, we subtract the probability of no employees being involved from 1:\n\n1 - 1.928749847963918e-14 â‰ˆ 0.99999999999998\n\nSo, the probability of at least one employee being involved in the fraud is approximately 0.99999999999998 or 99.999999999998%."
