    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA force of 20 N is used to move an object in the direction of the force. The distance the object is moved is 10 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force using integration, we can use the formula for work, which is the integral of force with respect to distance:\n\nW = ∫F dx\n\nIn this case, the force (F) is constant at 20 N, so the integral becomes:\n\nW = ∫(20) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate over the distance the object is moved, which is from 0 to 10 meters. So, the limits of integration are 0 and 10:\n\nW = ∫(20) dx from 0 to 10\n\nIntegrating the constant 20 with respect to x, we get:\n\nW = 20x | from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = 20(10) - 20(0)\n\nW = 200 - 0\n\nW = 200 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 200 Joules."
