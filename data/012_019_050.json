    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of the graph G, we can use the edge chromatic number, which is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of a graph such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. The edge chromatic number is denoted by χ'(G).\n\nFor a simple graph G with maximum degree Δ(G), the edge chromatic number is bounded by Vizing's theorem:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nIn our case, we have a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges. Let's find the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph. Since the graph has 7 vertices, the maximum possible degree for a vertex is 6. However, if a vertex has a degree of 6, it would connect to all other vertices, and the total number of edges would be at least (6+5+4+3+2+1) / 2 = 21 / 2 = 10.5, which is greater than the 9 edges we have. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be less than 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the maximum degree Δ(G) is 5. In this case, the total number of edges would be at least (5+4+3+2+1) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5, which is less than or equal to the 9 edges we have. So, it's possible that the maximum degree Δ(G) is 5.\n\nNow, we can apply Vizing's theorem:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n5 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 6\n\nSince χ'(G) must be an integer, the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of the graph G is χ'(G) = 5."
