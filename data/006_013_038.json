    "message_1": "A certain region has a probability of 0.05 of experiencing a flood in any given year. What is the probability that at least one flood occurs within the next 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one flood occurring within the next 10 years, we can first find the probability of no floods occurring in the next 10 years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no flood in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nThe probability of no floods occurring in the next 10 years is the product of the probabilities of no flood occurring in each of the 10 years:\n\n0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one flood occurring within the next 10 years:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability of at least one flood occurring within the next 10 years is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
