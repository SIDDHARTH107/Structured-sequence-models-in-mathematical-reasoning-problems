    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-abelian groups of order 120, we first need to find all possible group structures of order 120. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. We will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of 2-Sylow subgroups are 1 and 15.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups must divide 2^3 * 5 = 40, and must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of 3-Sylow subgroups are 1, 4, and 10.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups must divide 2^3 * 3 = 24, and must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible numbers of 5-Sylow subgroups are 1 and 6.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This case corresponds to the cyclic group C120, which is abelian, so we don't consider it.\n\n2. Fifteen 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This case corresponds to the semidirect product (C2 × C2 × C2) ⋊ (C3 × C5), which is non-abelian.\n\n3. One 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This case corresponds to the semidirect product (C2 × C2 × C2) ⋊ (A4 × C5), which is non-abelian.\n\n4. One 2-Sylow, ten 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This case corresponds to the semidirect product (C2 × C2 × C2) ⋊ (S4 × C5), which is non-abelian.\n\n5. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroup: This case corresponds to the semidirect product (C2 × C2 × C2) ⋊ (C3 × S5), which is non-abelian.\n\nSo, there are 4 non-abelian group structures of order 120.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of them are isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 or the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2. Since C120 is abelian, none of the non-abelian groups are isomorphic to it.\n\nThe alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 has order 60 * 2 * 2 = 240, which is not equal to 120. Therefore, none of the non-abelian groups of order 120 are isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 120, and none of them are isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 or the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2."
