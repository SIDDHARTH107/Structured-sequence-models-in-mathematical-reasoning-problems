    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}. We will consider each case separately.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q. Since P is a group of order 16, it is either cyclic (C16) or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 8 (C2 × C8). In either case, G is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 48 (C48).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16, and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Since Q is unique, it is normal in G. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is a semidirect product P ⋊ Q. The action of Q on P can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, and we are in the same situation as in Case 1. If the action is nontrivial, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. Since P is unique, it is normal in G. Let Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is a semidirect product P ⋊ Q. The action of Q on P can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, and we are in the same situation as in Case 1. If the action is nontrivial, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is a semidirect product P ⋊ Q. The action of Q on P can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, and we are in the same situation as in Case 1. If the action is nontrivial, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn summary, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4 (which occurs when the action of Q on P is trivial in Cases 2, 3, or 4), or one of the non-abelian groups of order 48 (which occurs when the action of Q on P is nontrivial in Cases 2, 3, or 4)."
