    "message_2": "To find the largest number that can divide both 252 and 105 into equal parts, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers. We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nStep 1: Divide the larger number (252) by the smaller number (105) and find the remainder.\n252 รท 105 = 2 with a remainder of 42.\n\nStep 2: Replace the larger number (252) with the smaller number (105) and the smaller number with the remainder (42), and repeat the division.\n105 รท 42 = 2 with a remainder of 21.\n\nStep 3: Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n42 รท 21 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 21. Therefore, the largest number that can divide both 252 and 105 into equal parts is 21."
