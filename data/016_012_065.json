    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is constructed through a series of iterations, where each iteration increases the complexity of the curve. \n\nIn the first iteration, the initial line segment is divided into 9 equal parts, and the curve is formed by connecting these parts in a specific pattern. The length of the curve after the first iteration is 9 times the length of each part, which is 9 * (1/9) = 1 unit.\n\nIn each subsequent iteration, the same process is applied to each of the 9 segments from the previous iteration. This means that the length of the curve after each iteration remains the same, which is 1 unit.\n\nTherefore, the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations is still 1 unit."
