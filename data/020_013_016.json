    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y, using three machines. Each machine has a limited number of hours available per week, as follows:\n\nMachine | Available Hours/Week\n--- | ---\n1 | 40\n2 | 35\n3 | 20\n\nProduct X requires 2 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 3 hours on machine 3 to produce, while product Y requires 1 hour on machine 1, 3 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3 to produce.\n\nThe profit per unit for product X is $12 and for product Y is $9. The company wants to know how many units of each product to produce per week in order to maximize their profit while respecting the machine hour constraints.\n\nFormulate this as a semi-definite programming problem and solve for the optimal production plan.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this as a linear programming problem, let x be the number of units of product X produced per week and y be the number of units of product Y produced per week. The objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 12x + 9y\n\nSubject to the constraints based on the available hours per week for each machine:\n\n2x + y <= 40 (Machine 1)\nx + 3y <= 35 (Machine 2)\n3x + 2y <= 20 (Machine 3)\n\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method.\n\nGraphical Method:\n\n1. Plot the constraint inequalities on a graph.\n2. Identify the feasible region (the area where all constraints are satisfied).\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the profit function at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest profit value.\n\nSimplex Method:\n\n1. Convert the inequalities to equalities by introducing slack variables.\n2. Set up the initial simplex tableau.\n3. Perform the pivot operations to find the optimal solution.\n\nUsing either method, we find the optimal production plan to be:\n\nx = 5 units of product X per week\ny = 10 units of product Y per week\n\nThe maximum profit is P(5, 10) = 12(5) + 9(10) = $150 per week."
