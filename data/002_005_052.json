    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. Find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nl = 10 cm\nw = 6 cm\nh = 4 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd = √((10 cm)² + (6 cm)² + (4 cm)²)\nd = √(100 cm² + 36 cm² + 16 cm²)\nd = √(152 cm²)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately:\n\nd ≈ 12.33 cm"
