    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, for the given function f(x) = x^2 - 10x - 20, we can find the minimum value using calculus.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we can take the derivative and set it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 10\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n2x - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 5\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to check if it's a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, we have a minimum at x = 5. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x = 5 back into the original function:\n\nf(5) = (5)^2 - 10(5) - 20 = 25 - 50 - 20 = -45\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 10x - 20 is -45."
