    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal, we first need to represent the input signal in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform. The input signal is given as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 4 units and a frequency of 2 rad/s:\n\nx(t) = 4*sin(2t)\n\nThe Fourier transform of a sinusoidal function is given by:\n\nX(jω) = A * [δ(ω - ω₀) - δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, ω₀ is the frequency of the sinusoidal function, and δ is the Dirac delta function. In our case, A = 2 (since the amplitude of the sinusoidal function is 4, and the Fourier transform of sin(ωt) has a factor of 1/2), and ω₀ = 2 rad/s. Therefore, the Fourier transform of the input signal is:\n\nX(jω) = 2 * [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency response of the system, which is the transfer function G(s) evaluated at s = jω:\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 3) / (ω^3j - 3ω^2j + 2ωj + 1)\n\nTo find the steady-state response of the system, we multiply the frequency response G(jω) by the Fourier transform of the input signal X(jω):\n\nY(jω) = G(jω) * X(jω)\n\nY(jω) = 2 * [(jω + 3) / (ω^3j - 3ω^2j + 2ωj + 1)] * [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to Y(jω) to find the steady-state response y(t) in the time domain:\n\ny(t) = 2 * [(jω + 3) / (ω^3j - 3ω^2j + 2ωj + 1)] * [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)] dω\n\nSince the Dirac delta function is non-zero only at ω = 2 and ω = -2, we can simplify the integral:\n\ny(t) = 2 * [(j(2) + 3) / (2^3j - 3(2)^2j + 2(2)j + 1)] * e^(j2t) - 2 * [(j(-2) + 3) / ((-2)^3j - 3(-2)^2j + 2(-2)j + 1)] * e^(-j2t)\n\ny(t) = 2 * [(2j + 3) / (8j - 12j + 4j + 1)] * e^(j2t) - 2 * [(-2j + 3) / (-8j - 12j - 4j + 1)] * e^(-j2t)\n\ny(t) = 2 * [(2j + 3) / (1)] * e^(j2t) - 2 * [(-2j + 3) / (1)] * e^(-j2t)\n\ny(t) = (4j + 6) * e^(j2t) - (-4j + 6) * e^(-j2t)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the complex exponentials as sinusoidal functions:\n\ny(t) = (4j + 6) * (cos(2t) + jsin(2t)) - (-4j + 6) * (cos(-2t) + jsin(-2t))\n\ny(t) = (6cos(2t) + 4jsin(2t)) + (6cos(2t) - 4jsin(2t))\n\ny(t) = 12cos(2t)\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system to the sinusoidal input signal with a frequency of 2 rad/s and an amplitude of 4 units is:\n\ny(t) = 12cos(2t)"
