    "message_2": "Let's first describe the simplicial complex $K$ and its vertices. A 3-simplex can be represented as a tetrahedron with vertices $v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3$. The simplicial complex $K$ consists of this single 3-simplex and all its faces, i.e., $K = \\{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, [v_0, v_1], [v_0, v_2], [v_0, v_3], [v_1, v_2], [v_1, v_3], [v_2, v_3], [v_0, v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_1, v_3], [v_0, v_2, v_3], [v_1, v_2, v_3], [v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3]\\}$.\n\nNow let's consider the action of the cyclic group $G$ of order 2 on $K$. Since $G$ acts by inverting one of the vertices, without loss of generality, let's assume it inverts vertex $v_0$. The action of $G$ on $K$ can be described as follows:\n\n- $g \\cdot v_0 = v_0^{-1}$\n- $g \\cdot v_i = v_i$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$\n- $g \\cdot [v_0, v_i] = [v_0^{-1}, v_i]$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$\n- $g \\cdot [v_i, v_j] = [v_i, v_j]$ for $1 \\leq i < j \\leq 3$\n- $g \\cdot [v_0, v_i, v_j] = [v_0^{-1}, v_i, v_j]$ for $1 \\leq i < j \\leq 3$\n- $g \\cdot [v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3] = [v_0^{-1}, v_1, v_2, v_3]$\n\nNow we can compute the quotient space $K/G$. The vertices of $K/G$ are the orbits of the vertices of $K$ under the action of $G$. We have two orbits: $\\{v_0, v_0^{-1}\\}$ and $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. Let's denote the representatives of these orbits as $u_0$ and $u_1$, respectively.\n\nThe edges of $K/G$ are the orbits of the edges of $K$ under the action of $G$. We have the following orbits:\n\n- $\\{[v_0, v_1], [v_0^{-1}, v_1]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1]$\n- $\\{[v_0, v_2], [v_0^{-1}, v_2]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1]$\n- $\\{[v_0, v_3], [v_0^{-1}, v_3]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1]$\n- $\\{[v_1, v_2], [v_1, v_3], [v_2, v_3]\\}$, represented by $[u_1, u_1]$\n\nThe 2-simplices of $K/G$ are the orbits of the 2-simplices of $K$ under the action of $G$. We have the following orbits:\n\n- $\\{[v_0, v_1, v_2], [v_0^{-1}, v_1, v_2]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1, u_1]$\n- $\\{[v_0, v_1, v_3], [v_0^{-1}, v_1, v_3]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1, u_1]$\n- $\\{[v_0, v_2, v_3], [v_0^{-1}, v_2, v_3]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1, u_1]$\n\nThe 3-simplices of $K/G$ are the orbits of the 3-simplices of $K$ under the action of $G$. We have the following orbit:\n\n- $\\{[v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3], [v_0^{-1}, v_1, v_2, v_3]\\}$, represented by $[u_0, u_1, u_1, u_1]$\n\nNow we can compute the cohomology groups of $K/G$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$. The cellular chain complex for $K/G$ is given by:\n\n$0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{d_3} \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\xrightarrow{d_2} \\mathbb{Z}^4 \\xrightarrow{d_1} \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\rightarrow 0$\n\nWe have the following boundary maps:\n\n- $d_1: \\mathbb{Z}^4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^2$ is the zero map, since all edges are degenerate.\n- $d_2: \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^4$ is also the zero map, since all 2-simplices are degenerate.\n- $d_3: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^3$ is the zero map, since the 3-simplex is degenerate.\n\nThus, the cohomology groups of $K/G$ are given by:\n\n- $H^0(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker d_1 / \\operatorname{im} d_0 = \\mathbb{Z}^2 / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}^2$\n- $H^1(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker d_2 / \\operatorname{im} d_1 = \\mathbb{Z}^4 / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}^4$\n- $H^2(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker d_3 / \\operatorname{im} d_2 = \\mathbb{Z}^3 / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}^3$\n- $H^3(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker d_4 / \\operatorname{im} d_3 = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nSo the cohomology groups of $K/G$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ are:\n\n$H^0(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$\n\n$H^1(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^4$\n\n$H^2(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^3$\n\n$H^3(K/G; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$"
