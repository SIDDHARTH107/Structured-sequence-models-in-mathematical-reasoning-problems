    "message_2": "To find the intersection of B and C, we first need to understand what a complement is. A complement of a set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since B and C are two different complements of A, they must be defined with respect to different universal sets.\n\nLet U1 be the universal set for B and U2 be the universal set for C. Then, B = U1 - A and C = U2 - A. To find the intersection of B and C, we need to find the elements that are common to both B and C.\n\nSince B and C are complements of A with respect to different universal sets, there may not be any elements common to both B and C. However, if there is an overlap between U1 and U2, then the intersection of B and C will be the set of elements in that overlap that are not in A.\n\nWithout more information about the universal sets U1 and U2, we cannot determine the exact intersection of B and C."
