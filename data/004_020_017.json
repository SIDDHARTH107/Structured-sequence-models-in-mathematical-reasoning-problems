    "message_1": "A 100-lb crate is being lifted 10 feet vertically by a rope that weighs 0.5 lbs/ft. How much work is done in lifting the crate? Use integration to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done in lifting the crate, we need to consider both the weight of the crate and the weight of the rope. The weight of the crate is constant, but the weight of the rope changes as it is lifted.\n\nLet x be the distance lifted, then the weight of the rope lifted is 0.5x lbs. The total weight being lifted at any point x is (100 + 0.5x) lbs.\n\nWork is defined as the force applied multiplied by the distance over which the force is applied. In this case, the force is the weight being lifted, and the distance is the height lifted (10 feet). We can use integration to find the total work done.\n\nThe work done in lifting the crate and the rope can be expressed as the integral of the weight function with respect to the distance lifted:\n\nW = âˆ«(100 + 0.5x) dx from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can integrate the function:\n\nW = [100x + 0.25x^2] from 0 to 10\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = (100(10) + 0.25(10)^2) - (100(0) + 0.25(0)^2)\nW = (1000 + 25(10)) - 0\nW = 1000 + 250\nW = 1250\n\nSo, the total work done in lifting the crate is 1250 foot-pounds."
