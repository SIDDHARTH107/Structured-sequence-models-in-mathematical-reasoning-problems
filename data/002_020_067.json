    "message_1": "A sector of a circle with a radius of 10 cm has a central angle of 60 degrees. What is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60 / 360) * 2 * π * 10\nArc length = (1/6) * 20π\nArc length = 10π/3 cm\n\nNow, let's add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = (10π/3) + 2 * 10\nPerimeter = (10π/3) + 20\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (10π/3) + 20 cm."
