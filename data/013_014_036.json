The bidders have private values for this item that are independently drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100. The auctioneer can choose between two auction formats: a first-price sealed-bid auction and a second-price sealed-bid auction. Which auction format should the auctioneer choose if her goal is to maximize expected revenue?\n\nAssume that if the bidders tie with the same bid, then the auctioneer flips a coin to determine the winner, where each bidder has an equal chance of winning in such an event. Also, assume that both bidders are risk-neutral and bid truthfully according to their valuations. Finally, assume that the auctioneer sets a reserve price of $40.\n\nWhat is the expected revenue for each auction format, and which one should the auctioneer choose?",
    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the bidding strategies for each auction format.\n\n1. First-price sealed-bid auction:\nIn this format, the highest bidder wins and pays their bid. Bidders will shade their bids below their true valuations to avoid overpaying. For bidder A, let B(A) be the bid function, and let V(A) be the true valuation. Bidder A will choose B(A) to maximize their expected utility:\n\nEU(A) = P(A wins | B(A)) * (V(A) - B(A))\n\nSince both bidders' valuations are uniformly distributed, the probability that A wins given B(A) is B(A)/100. Therefore:\n\nEU(A) = (B(A)/100) * (V(A) - B(A))\n\nTaking the first-order condition with respect to B(A) and setting it to zero, we get:\n\ndEU(A)/dB(A) = V(A)/100 - 2B(A)/100 = 0\n\nSolving for B(A), we get the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy:\n\nB(A) = V(A)/2\n\n2. Second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction):\nIn this format, the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid. Bidders will bid their true valuations, as there is no incentive to shade their bids. Therefore, B(A) = V(A).\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected revenue for each auction format, considering the reserve price of $40.\n\n1. First-price sealed-bid auction:\nThe expected revenue is the product of the probability that the auction is successful (i.e., the highest bid is above the reserve price) and the expected winning bid conditional on the auction being successful.\n\nThe probability that the auction is successful is the probability that at least one bidder has a valuation above $40. Since both valuations are uniformly distributed, this probability is:\n\nP(success) = 1 - P(both valuations ≤ 40) = 1 - (40/100)^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected winning bid conditional on the auction being successful. Since both bidders follow the symmetric bidding strategy B(A) = V(A)/2, the expected winning bid is half the expected highest valuation conditional on at least one valuation being above $40. This expected highest valuation can be calculated as:\n\nE[max(V(A), V(B)) | max(V(A), V(B)) > 40] = 100 - E[min(V(A), V(B)) | min(V(A), V(B)) ≤ 40]\n\nUsing the fact that E[min(V(A), V(B))] = 100/3, we get:\n\nE[max(V(A), V(B)) | max(V(A), V(B)) > 40] = 100 - (100/3) = 200/3\n\nTherefore, the expected winning bid is half of this value:\n\nE[winning bid | success] = (200/3)/2 = 100/3\n\nFinally, the expected revenue for the first-price sealed-bid auction is:\n\nE[revenue] = P(success) * E[winning bid | success] = 0.84 * (100/3) ≈ 27.78\n\n2. Second-price sealed-bid auction:\nThe expected revenue is the product of the probability that the auction is successful (i.e., the highest bid is above the reserve price) and the expected second-highest bid conditional on the auction being successful. The probability of success is the same as in the first-price auction:\n\nP(success) = 0.84\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected second-highest bid conditional on the auction being successful. This is equal to the expected highest valuation conditional on both valuations being below $40:\n\nE[max(V(A), V(B)) | max(V(A), V(B)) ≤ 40] = 40 - E[min(V(A), V(B)) | min(V(A), V(B)) ≤ 40]\n\nUsing the fact that E[min(V(A), V(B)) | min(V(A), V(B)) ≤ 40] = 40/3, we get:\n\nE[max(V(A), V(B)) | max(V(A), V(B)) ≤ 40] = 40 - (40/3) = 80/3\n\nFinally, the expected revenue for the second-price sealed-bid auction is:\n\nE[revenue] = P(success) * E[second-highest bid | success] = 0.84 * (80/3) ≈ 22.40\n\nComparing the expected revenues, the auctioneer should choose the first-price sealed-bid auction, as it yields a higher expected revenue of approximately $27.78, compared to the second-price sealed-bid auction's expected revenue of approximately $22.40."
