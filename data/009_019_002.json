Assume that a = 2, b = 1, and that X(0) = 1. \n\nFind the expected value of X(t) and its variance for t = 5.",
    "message_2": "To solve this stochastic differential equation, we first recognize that it is a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. The general form of a GBM is:\n\ndX(t) = μ*X(t)*dt + σ*X(t)*dW(t)\n\nComparing this with the given equation, we have μ = a = 2 and σ = b = 1.\n\nNow, we know that the solution to a GBM is given by:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))\n\nGiven that X(0) = 1, a = 2, and b = 1, we have:\n\nX(t) = exp((2 - (1^2)/2) * t + 1 * W(t))\nX(t) = exp((3/2) * t + W(t))\n\nNow, we want to find the expected value and variance of X(t) for t = 5.\n\n1. Expected value of X(t):\n\nE[X(t)] = E[exp((3/2) * t + W(t))]\n\nSince W(t) is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance t, we can use the moment-generating function of a normal random variable:\n\nE[exp((3/2) * t + W(t))] = exp((3/2) * t + (1^2) * t / 2)\nE[X(5)] = exp((3/2) * 5 + (1^2) * 5 / 2)\nE[X(5)] = exp(15/2)\n\n2. Variance of X(t):\n\nVar[X(t)] = E[X(t)^2] - (E[X(t)])^2\n\nFirst, we find E[X(t)^2]:\n\nE[X(t)^2] = E[exp(2 * ((3/2) * t + W(t)))]\nE[X(t)^2] = exp(2 * (3/2) * t + 2 * (1^2) * t)\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(2 * (3/2) * 5 + 2 * (1^2) * 5)\nE[X(5)^2] = exp(20)\n\nNow, we find the variance:\n\nVar[X(5)] = E[X(5)^2] - (E[X(5)])^2\nVar[X(5)] = exp(20) - (exp(15/2))^2\n\nSo, the expected value of X(5) is exp(15/2) and its variance is exp(20) - (exp(15/2))^2."
