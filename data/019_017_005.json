    "message_1": "Consider the first-order language L = {0, 1, +, ×}, where 0 is a constant symbol for the additive identity, 1 is a constant symbol for the multiplicative identity, and + and × are binary function symbols for addition and multiplication, respectively. Let T be the set of all sentences in the language L that are true in the structure (Z, 0, 1, +, ×), where Z is the set of integers with the usual interpretations of the symbols.\n\nDetermine whether the sentence ∀x∀y(x × y = y × x) belongs to T or not.",
    "message_2": "The sentence ∀x∀y(x × y = y × x) states that for all integers x and y, the product of x and y is equal to the product of y and x. This is a statement of the commutative property of multiplication for integers.\n\nSince the commutative property of multiplication holds for integers, the sentence ∀x∀y(x × y = y × x) is true in the structure (Z, 0, 1, +, ×), where Z is the set of integers with the usual interpretations of the symbols.\n\nTherefore, the sentence ∀x∀y(x × y = y × x) belongs to T."
