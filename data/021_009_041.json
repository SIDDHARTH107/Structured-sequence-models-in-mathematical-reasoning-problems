    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any given point.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum value of f(x). We will start with an initial guess for x, and then iteratively update the value of x using the following formula:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * f'(x_old)\n\nWe will continue updating x until the difference between x_new and x_old is less than the given tolerance (0.001). We will also need to choose a learning rate, which determines the step size in each iteration. A smaller learning rate may require more iterations to converge, while a larger learning rate may overshoot the minimum.\n\nLet's choose an initial guess x_old = 0 and a learning rate of 0.01.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_new = 0 - 0.01 * (3(0)^2 - 12(0) + 11) = 0 - 0.01 * 11 = -0.11\n\nIteration 2:\nx_new = -0.11 - 0.01 * (3(-0.11)^2 - 12(-0.11) + 11) ≈ -0.11 - 0.01 * 9.673 = -0.20673\n\nWe will continue this process until the difference between x_new and x_old is less than 0.001.\n\nAfter several iterations, we find that the value of x converges to approximately 1.882.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging this value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(1.882) ≈ (1.882)^3 - 6(1.882)^2 + 11(1.882) - 6 ≈ -1.999\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is approximately -1.999, and the corresponding value of x is approximately 1.882, within a tolerance of 0.001."
