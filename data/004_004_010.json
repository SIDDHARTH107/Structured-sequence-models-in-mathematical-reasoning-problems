    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of y = x^2 + 4x + 5 between x = 1 and x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of y = x^2 + 4x + 5 with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 4x + 5) dx = (1/3)x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 1 and x = 5:\n\n[(1/3)(5^3) + 2(5^2) + 5(5)] - [(1/3)(1^3) + 2(1^2) + 5(1)]\n= [(1/3)(125) + 50 + 25] - [(1/3) + 2 + 5]\n= [41.67 + 50 + 25] - [8.33]\n= 116.67 - 8.33\n= 108.34\n\nSo, the area under the curve of y = x^2 + 4x + 5 between x = 1 and x = 5 is approximately 108.34 square units."
