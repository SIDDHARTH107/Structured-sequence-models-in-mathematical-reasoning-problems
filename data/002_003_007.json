    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * side^2\n\nIn this case, the side length is 6 centimeters. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (6 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 6 * 36 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 216 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube with a side length of 6 centimeters is 216 square centimeters."
