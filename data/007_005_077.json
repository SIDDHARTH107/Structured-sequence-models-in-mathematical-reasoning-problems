    "message_2": "To find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 12, 18, and 20, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n- 12 = 2^2 * 3\n- 18 = 2 * 3^2\n- 20 = 2^2 * 5\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n- The highest power of 2 is 2^2 (from 12 and 20).\n- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 18).\n- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 20).\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 18, and 20 is 180."
