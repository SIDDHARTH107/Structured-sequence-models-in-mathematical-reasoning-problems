    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products A and B. The production of A requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor, while the production of B requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor. The total machine time available per day is 24 hours and labor availability is 16 hours per day. The profit per unit of A is $20 and the profit per unit of B is $30. What is the optimal number of units of A and B that should be produced each day to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced each day. The constraints for machine time and labor availability can be written as:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 24 (machine time constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 16 (labor constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nWe need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and maximize the profit.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 24\ny ≤ (24 - 2x) / 3\n\nx + 2y ≤ 16\ny ≤ (16 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,8), (4,6), and (12,0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0,8) = 20(0) + 30(8) = $240\n3. P(4,6) = 20(4) + 30(6) = $80 + $180 = $260\n4. P(12,0) = 20(12) + 30(0) = $240\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 4 units of product A and 6 units of product B, with a total profit of $260 per day."
