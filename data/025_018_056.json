    "message_2": "To determine the number of singular points on this algebraic variety using Mori theory, we first need to find the singular points by calculating the partial derivatives of the defining equations and setting them equal to zero.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 and G(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^3 - z^3.\n\nCalculate the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\n∂G/∂x = 3x^2\n∂G/∂y = -3y^2\n∂G/∂z = -3z^2\n\nNow set the partial derivatives equal to zero:\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n2z = 0 => z = 0\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n-3y^2 = 0 => y = 0\n-3z^2 = 0 => z = 0\n\nThe only solution to these equations is the origin (0, 0, 0). However, this point does not satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. Therefore, there are no singular points on this algebraic variety."
