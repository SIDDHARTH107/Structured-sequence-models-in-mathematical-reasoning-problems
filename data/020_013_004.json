    "message_2": "To solve this semi-definite programming problem, we first need to find the eigenvalues of the given matrix and ensure that they are all non-negative. The matrix is:\n\nA = [1 1 0; 1 2 x3; 0 x3 4]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the following equation:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The determinant of (A - λI) is:\n\n|1-λ  1    0  |\n| 1   2-λ  x3 |\n| 0   x3   4-λ|\n\nCalculating the determinant, we get:\n\n(1-λ)((2-λ)(4-λ) - x3^2) - 1(1(4-λ) - x3^2) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nλ^3 - 7λ^2 + 16λ - 12 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation to ensure that they are all non-negative. We can use numerical methods or software to find the roots. The roots are approximately:\n\nλ1 ≈ 0.5359\nλ2 ≈ 2.0000\nλ3 ≈ 4.4641\n\nSince all eigenvalues are non-negative, the matrix A is positive semi-definite.\n\nNow, we need to solve the linear constraints:\n\nx1 + 2x2 = 3\nx3 >= 0\n\nWe can rewrite the first constraint as:\n\nx1 = 3 - 2x2\n\nNow, we can substitute x1 into the objective function:\n\nf(x) = (3 - 2x2) + 2x2 + 3x3 = 3 + 3x3\n\nSince x3 >= 0, the objective function is unbounded, and there is no optimal value for the objective function. However, if there is an additional constraint on x3, we can find the optimal value and the values of the decision variables."
