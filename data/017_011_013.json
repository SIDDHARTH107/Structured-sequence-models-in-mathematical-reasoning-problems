    "message_2": "To prove that there does not exist a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q, we will first analyze the properties of the quaternion group Q and then show that no group of order 12 can have these properties.\n\nThe quaternion group Q is a non-abelian group of order 8, and it is given by the following presentation:\n\nQ = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\nNow, let's assume there exists a group G of order 12 that is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q. Let φ: Q → G be an isomorphism. Since Q is of order 8, G must also be of order 8, which contradicts our assumption that G has order 12. Therefore, there cannot exist a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q.\n\nAlternatively, we can also prove this by analyzing the properties of groups of order 12 and showing that none of them can be isomorphic to Q.\n\nA group of order 12 has the form p^2q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers. In this case, p = 2 and q = 3. By the Sylow theorems, there must exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 4 and |Q| = 3.\n\nNow, let's analyze the quaternion group Q. It has three subgroups of order 4, namely:\n\nH1 = {±1, ±i}\nH2 = {±1, ±j}\nH3 = {±1, ±k}\n\nAll of these subgroups are normal in Q, and they are all isomorphic to the Klein four-group V_4. The quaternion group Q does not have any subgroup of order 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the group G of order 12. Since |P| = 4, P must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group Z_4 or the Klein four-group V_4. If P is isomorphic to Z_4, then G cannot be isomorphic to Q, as Q does not have any cyclic subgroups of order 4. If P is isomorphic to V_4, then G still cannot be isomorphic to Q, as G has a subgroup of order 3 (namely Q), while Q does not have any subgroups of order 3.\n\nIn conclusion, there does not exist a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q."
