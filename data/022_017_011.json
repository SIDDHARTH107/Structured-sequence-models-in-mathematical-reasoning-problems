    "message_2": "To solve this differential equation using complex analysis, we first rewrite it in terms of a complex variable. Let $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real variables. Then, we can rewrite the given differential equation as:\n\n$$(z\\bar{z})\\frac{d^2y}{dz\\bar{z}} - z\\bar{z}\\frac{dy}{dz} + 2y = 0$$\n\nNow, we introduce the Wirtinger derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)$$\n\nUsing these derivatives, we can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\n$$4(z\\bar{z})\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z\\partial \\bar{z}} - 4z\\bar{z}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} + 8y = 0$$\n\nNow, we look for a solution of the form $y(z, \\bar{z}) = f(z)g(\\bar{z})$. Plugging this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$$4(z\\bar{z})f''(z)g(\\bar{z}) - 4z\\bar{z}f'(z)g(\\bar{z}) + 8f(z)g(\\bar{z}) = 0$$\n\nDividing by $4f(z)g(\\bar{z})$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{z\\bar{z}f''(z)}{f(z)} - \\frac{z\\bar{z}f'(z)}{f(z)} + 2 = 0$$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $z$ only, it must be independent of $\\bar{z}$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{z\\bar{z}f''(z)}{f(z)} - \\frac{z\\bar{z}f'(z)}{f(z)} + 2 = k$$\n\nwhere $k$ is a constant. This equation can be separated into two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{zf''(z)}{f(z)} - \\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)} = k_1$$\n$$\\frac{\\bar{z}f''(\\bar{z})}{f(\\bar{z})} - \\frac{\\bar{z}f'(\\bar{z})}{f(\\bar{z})} = k_2$$\n\nwhere $k_1$ and $k_2$ are constants such that $k_1 + k_2 = k$. Now, we solve these two differential equations separately.\n\nFor the first equation, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{zf''(z)}{f(z)} - \\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)} = k_1$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE for $f'(z)$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(zf'(z)\\right) = k_1f(z)$$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$$zf'(z) = k_1\\int f(z) dz + C_1$$\n\nDividing by $z$ and integrating again, we obtain:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{k_1}{2}\\int z\\int f(z) dz dz + C_1\\int \\frac{1}{z} dz + C_2$$\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, we have:\n\n$$g(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{k_2}{2}\\int \\bar{z}\\int g(\\bar{z}) d\\bar{z} d\\bar{z} + C_3\\int \\frac{1}{\\bar{z}} d\\bar{z} + C_4$$\n\nThus, the general solution to the original differential equation is given by:\n\n$$y(z, \\bar{z}) = f(z)g(\\bar{z}) = \\left(\\frac{k_1}{2}\\int z\\int f(z) dz dz + C_1\\int \\frac{1}{z} dz + C_2\\right)\\left(\\frac{k_2}{2}\\int \\bar{z}\\int g(\\bar{z}) d\\bar{z} d\\bar{z} + C_3\\int \\frac{1}{\\bar{z}} d\\bar{z} + C_4\\right)$$\n\nwhere $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ are constants of integration."
