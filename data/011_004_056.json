    "message_2": "Since there are 5 options for each of the 6 multiple-choice questions, a student can select one option for each question in 5 ways. To find the total number of ways to select one option for all 6 questions, we use the multiplication principle:\n\n5 (ways for question 1) * 5 (ways for question 2) * 5 (ways for question 3) * 5 (ways for question 4) * 5 (ways for question 5) * 5 (ways for question 6)\n\n5^6 = 15,625\n\nSo, there are 15,625 ways for a student to select exactly one option for each of the 6 questions."
