    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. We can also write this as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) for any a not divisible by p.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 17^23 is divided by 5. Since 5 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem. We have:\n\n17^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we want to find 17^23 (mod 5). We can rewrite 17^23 as (17^4)^5 * 17^3. Using the property we found above:\n\n(17^4)^5 * 17^3 ≡ 1^5 * 17^3 (mod 5)\n1 * 17^3 ≡ 17^3 (mod 5)\n\nNow we just need to find the remainder of 17^3 when divided by 5:\n\n17^3 = 4913\n4913 ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the remainder when 17^23 is divided by 5 is 3."
