    "message_2": "To show that G must have at least one subgroup of order 2 and one subgroup of order 3, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet the order of G be 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, there must exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p of the order of G. In this case, we have prime factors 2, 3, and 5.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 * 5, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2 * 5, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n3. n_5 divides 2 * 3, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFor n_2, the possible divisors of 3 * 5 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The only one satisfying n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) is n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 15. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is then normal in G. If n_2 = 15, there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 2.\n\nFor n_3, the possible divisors of 2 * 5 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The only one satisfying n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) is n_3 = 1 or n_3 = 10. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is then normal in G. If n_3 = 10, there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nNow we know that G must have at least one subgroup of order 2 and one subgroup of order 3. The number of different possible subgroups of order 2 can be 1 or 15, and the number of different possible subgroups of order 3 can be 1 or 10.\n\nHowever, these subgroups do not uniquely determine the structure of G up to isomorphism. For example, if G is the cyclic group of order 30, it has a unique subgroup of order 2 and a unique subgroup of order 3. On the other hand, if G is a non-abelian group of order 30, it can have multiple subgroups of order 2 and 3. In both cases, the subgroups of order 2 and 3 do not uniquely determine the structure of G up to isomorphism."
