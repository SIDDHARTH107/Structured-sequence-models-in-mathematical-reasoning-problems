Next, we will find the complements of A and B, and then find their Cartesian product. Finally, we will compare the two results to show that they are not equal.\n\n1.

Find (A × B)′:\nSince A × B contains all possible ordered pairs of elements from A and B, the complement of A × B would be the set of all ordered pairs that are not in A × B. Let's assume the universal set U contains elements from 1 to 6, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Therefore, the statement is true: (A × B)′ ≠ A′ × B′."
