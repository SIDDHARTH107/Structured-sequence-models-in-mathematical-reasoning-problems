    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 3.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (Δ):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac\nΔ = (-5)^2 - 4(2)(3)\nΔ = 25 - 24\nΔ = 1\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the two solutions for x:\n\nx = (-(-5) ± √(1)) / 2(2)\nx = (5 ± 1) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\nx1 = (5 + 1) / 4\nx1 = 6 / 4\nx1 = 3 / 2\n\nx2 = (5 - 1) / 4\nx2 = 4 / 4\nx2 = 1\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0 are x1 = 3/2 and x2 = 1."
