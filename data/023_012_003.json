    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-3,3], we first need to determine if the function is even or odd. Since f(-x) = (-x)^2 = x^2 = f(x), the function is even. Therefore, we only need to find the coefficients for the cosine terms in the Fourier series.\n\nThe Fourier series for an even function is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function, a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor the given function, the period is 6, so L = 3. Now, let's find the coefficients a_0 and a_n.\n\na_0 = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0) dx] from -L to L\na_n = (2 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nSince f(x) = x^2, we have:\n\na_0 = (1 / 3) * ∫[x^2 dx] from -3 to 3\na_n = (2 / 3) * ∫[x^2 * cos(n * π * x / 3) dx] from 0 to 3\n\nNow, let's compute the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1 / 3) * [(x^3 / 3)| from -3 to 3] = (1 / 3) * [(27 / 3) - (-27 / 3)] = 9\n\nTo find a_n, we need to integrate x^2 * cos(n * π * x / 3) with respect to x. This can be done using integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(n * π * x / 3) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (3 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 3)\n\nNow, integrate by parts:\n\n∫[x^2 * cos(n * π * x / 3) dx] = (3 / (n * π)) * x^2 * sin(n * π * x / 3) - (3 / (n * π)) * ∫[2x * sin(n * π * x / 3) dx]\n\nFor the remaining integral, use integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * π * x / 3) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-3 / (n * π)) * cos(n * π * x / 3)\n\nNow, integrate by parts:\n\n∫[2x * sin(n * π * x / 3) dx] = -6 / (n^2 * π^2) * x * cos(n * π * x / 3) - (-6 / (n^2 * π^2)) * ∫[cos(n * π * x / 3) dx]\n\nThe remaining integral is straightforward:\n\n∫[cos(n * π * x / 3) dx] = (3 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 3)\n\nNow, substitute back:\n\na_n = (2 / 3) * [(3 / (n * π)) * x^2 * sin(n * π * x / 3) - (3 / (n * π)) * (-6 / (n^2 * π^2) * x * cos(n * π * x / 3) - (-6 / (n^2 * π^2)) * (3 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 3))]| from 0 to 3\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, sin(n * π) = 0, and cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, we have:\n\na_n = (2 / 3) * [(-1)^n * 6 / (n^2 * π^2) * 3 - 0] = (-1)^n * 12 / (n^2 * π^2)\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-3, 3] is:\n\nf(x) = 9 + Σ[(-1)^n * (12 / (n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π * x / 3)]\n\nNow, let's check the convergence at x = 0:\n\nf(0) = 9 + Σ[(-1)^n * (12 / (n^2 * π^2)) * cos(0)]\n\nSince cos(0) = 1, we have:\n\nf(0) = 9 + Σ[(-1)^n * (12 / (n^2 * π^2))]\n\nThe sum converges by the alternating series test, and f(0) = 0^2 = 0. Therefore, the Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x^2 at x = 0."
