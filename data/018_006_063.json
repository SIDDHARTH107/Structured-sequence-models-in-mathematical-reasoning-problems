    "message_2": "Let's denote the universal set as U. The complement of X, denoted as X', contains all the elements in U that are not in X. The union of X and its complement, denoted as X âˆª X', contains all the elements in X and all the elements in X'.\n\nSince X and X' are disjoint sets (they have no elements in common), the number of elements in their union is the sum of the number of elements in each set. We know that X has 50 elements, but we need to know the number of elements in the universal set U to determine the number of elements in X'.\n\nIf we know the number of elements in U, we can calculate the number of elements in X' as |U| - |X|. However, without information about the universal set U, we cannot determine the number of elements in the union of X and its complement."
