Consider its Jacobian variety JX, which is an abelian variety of dimension 2. Let D(X) be the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on X, and D(JX) be the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on JX. \n\nShow that there exists a Fourier-Mukai equivalence F: D(X) -> D(JX) such that for any coherent sheaf E on X, \n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\operatorname{Hom}_{D(X)}(E,E\\otimes\\omega_X) = \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\operatorname{Hom}_{D(JX)}(F(E),F(E)\\otimes\\alpha),\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_X$ is the canonical bundle on X and $\\alpha$ is the Poincaré line bundle on JX. Moreover, compute the group of autoequivalences of D(X) that commute with F.",
    "message_2": "To show the existence of a Fourier-Mukai equivalence F: D(X) -> D(JX), we will use the Fourier-Mukai transform associated with the Poincaré line bundle on JX. The Poincaré line bundle is a line bundle on the product X x JX, which is a universal family of line bundles on X parametrized by JX. The Fourier-Mukai transform is defined as the integral functor:\n\nF(E) = Rπ_{2*}(π_1^*E ⊗ α),\n\nwhere π_1 and π_2 are the projections from X x JX to X and JX, respectively, and Rπ_{2*} denotes the derived direct image functor.\n\nNow, let E be a coherent sheaf on X. We want to show that\n\ndim_C Hom_D(X)(E, E ⊗ ω_X) = dim_C Hom_D(JX)(F(E), F(E) ⊗ α).\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier-Mukai transform and the projection formula, we can compute the right-hand side:\n\nHom_D(JX)(F(E), F(E) ⊗ α) = Hom_D(X x JX)(π_1^*E ⊗ α, π_1^*(E ⊗ ω_X) ⊗ α).\n\nNow, we can use the relative duality theorem for the projection π_1:\n\nHom_D(X x JX)(π_1^*E ⊗ α, π_1^*(E ⊗ ω_X) ⊗ α) = Hom_D(X)(E, E ⊗ ω_X ⊗ Rπ_{1*}(α^2)).\n\nSince α is the Poincaré line bundle, we have Rπ_{1*}(α^2) = O_X, the structure sheaf of X. Therefore,\n\nHom_D(X)(E, E ⊗ ω_X ⊗ Rπ_{1*}(α^2)) = Hom_D(X)(E, E ⊗ ω_X),\n\nwhich proves the desired equality.\n\nNow, let's compute the group of autoequivalences of D(X) that commute with F. Since X is a smooth projective curve of genus 2, the group of autoequivalences of D(X) is generated by the shift functor [1], tensoring with line bundles, and the Atiyah-Bott autoequivalence associated with the Jacobian JX. The shift functor and tensoring with line bundles commute with F by construction. The Atiyah-Bott autoequivalence commutes with F because it is induced by the action of JX on itself by translations, which is compatible with the Fourier-Mukai transform. Therefore, the group of autoequivalences of D(X) that commute with F is the whole group of autoequivalences of D(X)."
