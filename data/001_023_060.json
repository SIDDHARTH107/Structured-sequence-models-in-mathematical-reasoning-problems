    "message_2": "To solve the equation tan²x - 3 = 0, we first isolate tan²x:\n\ntan²x = 3\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\ntan(x) = ±√3\n\nWe are looking for solutions in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π. The tangent function has a period of π, so we will find the solutions in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π and then add π to find the solutions in the interval π ≤ x ≤ 2π.\n\nFor the positive square root, we have:\n\ntan(x) = √3\n\nx = arctan(√3)\n\nx = π/3\n\nFor the negative square root, we have:\n\ntan(x) = -√3\n\nx = arctan(-√3)\n\nx = 2π/3\n\nNow, we add π to each solution to find the solutions in the interval π ≤ x ≤ 2π:\n\nx = π/3 + π = 4π/3\n\nx = 2π/3 + π = 5π/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π are:\n\nx = π/3, 2π/3, 4π/3, 5π/3"
