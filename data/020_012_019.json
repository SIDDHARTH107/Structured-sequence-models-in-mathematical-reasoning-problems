    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 7 in the interval [-2, 5], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 7)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 10x - 4\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 10x - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -10, and c = -4:\n\nx = (10 ± √((-10)^2 - 4(3)(-4))) / (2(3))\nx = (10 ± √(100 + 48)) / 6\nx = (10 ± √148) / 6\n\nThe two critical points are:\n\nx1 = (10 + √148) / 6 ≈ 3.846\nx2 = (10 - √148) / 6 ≈ 0.487\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at these critical points, as well as at the endpoints of the interval, x = -2 and x = 5:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 5(-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 7 = -8 - 20 + 8 + 7 = -13\nf(0.487) ≈ (0.487)^3 - 5(0.487)^2 - 4(0.487) + 7 ≈ 5.556\nf(3.846) ≈ (3.846)^3 - 5(3.846)^2 - 4(3.846) + 7 ≈ -20.556\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 5(5)^2 - 4(5) + 7 = 125 - 125 - 20 + 7 = -13\n\nThe global minimum of the function in the interval [-2, 5] occurs at x ≈ 3.846, with a value of f(x) ≈ -20.556."
