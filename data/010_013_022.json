Suppose that $g_{12}(x)=\\begin{pmatrix} x & 1 \\\\ 0 & x \\end{pmatrix}$ for any $x\\in U_1 \\cap U_2$. \n\nWhat is the rank of the vector bundle over $S^1$?",
    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the vector bundle, we need to find the dimension of the fibers. In this case, the transition function $g_{12}(x)$ is a 2x2 matrix, which means the fibers are 2-dimensional. Therefore, the rank of the vector bundle over $S^1$ is 2."
