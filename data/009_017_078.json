    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the equation for the voltage across an inductor and a resistor in series. The voltage across the inductor (V_L) is given by:\n\nV_L = L * (di/dt)\n\nwhere L is the inductance and di/dt is the rate of change of current with respect to time.\n\nThe voltage across the resistor (V_R) is given by Ohm's law:\n\nV_R = R * I\n\nwhere R is the resistance and I is the current.\n\nThe total voltage across the circuit (V_total) is the sum of the voltages across the inductor and resistor:\n\nV_total = V_L + V_R\n\nSince the initial current is zero, we can use the equation for the current in an RL circuit:\n\nI(t) = I_max * (1 - e^(-t/(L/R)))\n\nwhere I_max is the maximum current (5A in this case), t is the time (5 seconds), and L/R is the time constant of the circuit.\n\nFirst, let's find the time constant:\n\nL/R = 0.2H / 20Ω = 0.01s\n\nNow, we can find the current at t = 5 seconds:\n\nI(5) = 5A * (1 - e^(-5/0.01)) ≈ 5A\n\nSince the current is almost at its maximum value, the rate of change of current with respect to time (di/dt) is very small, and the voltage across the inductor (V_L) is also very small. Therefore, the total voltage across the circuit is approximately equal to the voltage across the resistor:\n\nV_total ≈ V_R = R * I(5) = 20Ω * 5A = 100V\n\nSo, the voltage across the circuit at t = 5 seconds is approximately 100V."
