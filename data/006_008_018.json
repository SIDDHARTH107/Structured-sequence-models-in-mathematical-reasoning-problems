    "message_2": "To find the odds that it will not rain on that day, we first need to find the probability that it will not rain. Since the probability of rain is 0.3, the probability of no rain is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nOdds are expressed as a ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the odds of no rain are:\n\nOdds (No Rain) = Probability (No Rain) / Probability (Rain)\nOdds (No Rain) = 0.7 / 0.3\nOdds (No Rain) = 7 / 3\n\nSo, the odds that it will not rain on that day are 7:3."
