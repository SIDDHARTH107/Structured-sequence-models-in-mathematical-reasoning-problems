The company has collected the following data:\n\n|Customer|Age (years)|Estimated Annual Income ($)| \n|--------|-----------|---------------------------|\n|1       |30         |60,000                     |\n|2       |22         |40,000                     |\n|3       |35         |80,000                     |\n|4       |28         |50,000                     |\n|5       |42         |100,000                    |\n|6       |48         |120,000                    |\n|7       |39         |75,000                     |\n|8       |25         |45,000                     |\n|9       |33         |70,000                     |\n|10      |29         |55,000                     |\n\nUsing K-means clustering with K=3, group the customers based on their age and estimated annual income.

    "message_2": "To perform K-means clustering, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids randomly.\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Update the centroids by taking the average of all the data points assigned to each centroid.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nLet's initialize the centroids randomly using three data points from the dataset:\n\nCentroid 1: (30, 60,000)\nCentroid 2: (35, 80,000)\nCentroid 3: (42, 100,000)\n\nNow, we will assign each data point to the nearest centroid and update the centroids:\n\nIteration 1:\nCluster 1: (30, 60,000), (22, 40,000), (28, 50,000), (25, 45,000), (29, 55,000)\nCluster 2: (35, 80,000), (39, 75,000), (33, 70,000)\nCluster 3: (42, 100,000), (48, 120,000)\n\nUpdate Centroids:\nCentroid 1: (26.8, 50,000)\nCentroid 2: (35.67, 75,000)\nCentroid 3: (45, 110,000)\n\nIteration 2:\nCluster 1: (30, 60,000), (22, 40,000), (28, 50,000), (25, 45,000), (29, 55,000)\nCluster 2: (35, 80,000), (39, 75,000), (33, 70,000)\nCluster 3: (42, 100,000), (48, 120,000)\n\nThe centroids did not change significantly after the second iteration, so we can stop here.\n\nFinal Clusters:\nCluster 1: (30, 60,000), (22, 40,000), (28, 50,000), (25, 45,000), (29, 55,000)\nCluster 2: (35, 80,000), (39, 75,000), (33, 70,000)\nCluster 3: (42, 100,000), (48, 120,000)\n\nInterpretation:\nCluster 1 represents younger customers with lower annual incomes.\nCluster 2 represents middle-aged customers with moderate annual incomes.\nCluster 3 represents older customers with higher annual incomes.\n\nThe company can use this information to target different products or services to each cluster based on their age and income characteristics."
