    "message_2": "According to the principle of non-monotonic logic, which allows for the possibility of revising conclusions based on new information, we can solve the problem as follows:\n\n1. Initially, there are 5 apples in the basket.\n2. John takes 3 apples out of the basket, leaving 2 apples in the basket.\n3. John puts back 2 apples, increasing the total number of apples in the basket to 4.\n\nSo, there are currently 4 apples in the basket."
