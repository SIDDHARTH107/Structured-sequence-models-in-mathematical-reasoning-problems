    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2, we need to find the points of intersection and then integrate the difference of the functions over that interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection by setting the two functions equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n2x^2 = 2x\nx^2 = x\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the points of intersection are x = 0 and x = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the difference of the functions:\n\n(2x - x^2) - (x^2) = 2x - 2x^2\n\nNow, we'll integrate this function over the interval [0, 1]:\n\n∫(2x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nTo integrate, we'll use the power rule:\n\n∫(2x - 2x^2) dx = 2∫x dx - 2∫x^2 dx = 2(x^2/2) - 2(x^3/3) + C = x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds 0 and 1:\n\n[x^2 - (2/3)x^3] from 0 to 1 = (1^2 - (2/3)(1^3)) - (0^2 - (2/3)(0^3)) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 is 1/3 square units."
