    "message_2": "a) Yes, the function f(z) = (z-1)/(z+2) can be analytically continued beyond the open unit disk, i.e., into a larger domain containing the point z = -2, giving a single-valued function in that domain.\n\nTo see this, we can rewrite the function f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z-1)/(z+2) = 1 - (3/(z+2))\n\nNow, the function g(z) = 3/(z+2) has a simple pole at z = -2, but it can be analytically continued into the entire complex plane except for the point z = -2. Therefore, the function f(z) = 1 - g(z) can also be analytically continued into the entire complex plane except for the point z = -2.\n\nb) Since the function f(z) has a singularity at z = -2, it is not possible to assign a value to f(-2) directly. However, we can find the limit of f(z) as z approaches -2:\n\nlim (z -> -2) f(z) = lim (z -> -2) (1 - (3/(z+2)))\n\nAs z approaches -2, the term (3/(z+2)) approaches infinity, so the limit does not exist. Therefore, we cannot assign a value to f(-2)."
