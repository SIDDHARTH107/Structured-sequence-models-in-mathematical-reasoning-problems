    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 7 vertices and 11 edges. Determine the genus of G.",
    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the formula:\n\ngenus(G) = (E - N + 2 - 2C) / 2\n\nwhere E is the number of edges, N is the number of vertices, and C is the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have E = 11 and N = 7. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of connected components, we'll assume that the graph is connected, which means C = 1.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\ngenus(G) = (11 - 7 + 2 - 2(1)) / 2\ngenus(G) = (6) / 2\ngenus(G) = 3\n\nSo, the genus of the graph G is 3."
