    "message_1": "Question: Bob wants to send a confidential message to Alice using the one-time pad encryption technique. The message to be sent is \"HELLO\". Assume that the plaintext message is converted to binary form and the key used for the encryption is also in binary form. The key is a random string of 5 bits generated by rolling a fair die 5 times. What is the probability that the message can be decrypted correctly by Alice if an eavesdropper intercepts the message? (Note: Assume that the eavesdropper has no knowledge of the key used for the encryption).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the message can be decrypted correctly by Alice if an eavesdropper intercepts the message, we need to consider the possible keys and the probability of each key being used.\n\nSince the key is generated by rolling a fair die 5 times, there are 6^5 = 7776 possible keys. However, since the key is a random string of 5 bits, we need to consider only the keys that can be represented in binary form (i.e., only the numbers from 1 to 31, as 0 is not a valid key). There are 31 such keys.\n\nNow, let's consider the one-time pad encryption technique. In this method, the plaintext message is XORed with the key to produce the ciphertext. To decrypt the message, the ciphertext is XORed with the same key, which results in the original plaintext message. Since the eavesdropper has no knowledge of the key, they would have to try all possible keys to decrypt the message.\n\nHowever, since the one-time pad encryption technique is perfectly secure when used with a truly random key, the eavesdropper has no advantage in guessing the correct key. Therefore, the probability that the eavesdropper can decrypt the message correctly is the same as the probability of guessing the correct key at random.\n\nThe probability of guessing the correct key at random is 1/31, as there are 31 valid keys. So, the probability that the message can be decrypted correctly by Alice if an eavesdropper intercepts the message is 1/31, or approximately 0.0323, or 3.23%."
