    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (5, 8), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The slope formula is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (x1, y1) = (2, 5) and (x2, y2) = (5, 8):\n\nm = (8 - 5) / (5 - 2)\nm = 3 / 3\nm = 1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (2, 5) and the slope m = 1:\n\ny - 5 = 1(x - 2)\ny - 5 = x - 2\n\nTo put it in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we can add 5 to both sides:\n\ny = x + 3\n\nSo, the equation of the line is y = x + 3.\n\nTo graph the line on the coordinate plane, we can plot the two given points (2, 5) and (5, 8) and draw a line through them. The slope of the line is 1, which means that the line goes up 1 unit for every 1 unit it goes to the right."
