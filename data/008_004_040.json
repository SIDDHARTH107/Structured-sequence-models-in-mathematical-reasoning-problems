    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and add it to the third equation.\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n2x + 4y - 2z = 0\n\nAdd this to the second equation:\n(2x - 3y + 2z) + (2x + 4y - 2z) = 0\n4x + y = 0\ny = -4x\n\nFirst equation * 3:\n3x + 6y - 3z = 0\n\nAdd this to the third equation:\n(-3x + 5y - 4z) + (3x + 6y - 3z) = 0\n11y - 7z = 0\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\ny = -4x\n11y - 7z = 0\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\n11(-4x) - 7z = 0\n-44x - 7z = 0\n\nNow let's eliminate z from the first and the new second equation. Multiply the first equation by 7 and add it to the second equation:\n\nFirst equation * 7:\n7x + 14y - 7z = 0\n\nAdd this to the new second equation:\n(-44x - 7z) + (7x + 14y - 7z) = 0\n-37x + 14y = 0\n\nNow substitute y = -4x back into this equation:\n\n-37x + 14(-4x) = 0\n-37x - 56x = 0\n-93x = 0\n\nNow we can find the value of x:\n\nx = 0\n\nNow substitute x = 0 back into the equation y = -4x:\n\ny = -4(0)\ny = 0\n\nFinally, substitute x = 0 and y = 0 back into the first equation:\n\n0 + 2(0) - z = 0\n-z = 0\n\nSo, z = 0.\n\nThe values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system are x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
