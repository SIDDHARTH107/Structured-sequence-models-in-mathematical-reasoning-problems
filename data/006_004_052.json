    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of winning this game, we need to find the total number of possible combinations and the number of winning combinations.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of combinations for selecting 5 numbers from 1 to 50. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of elements (in this case, 50) and k is the number of elements to be chosen (in this case, 5).\n\nC(50, 5) = 50! / (5!(50-5)!)\nC(50, 5) = 50! / (5!45!)\nC(50, 5) = (50 × 49 × 48 × 47 × 46) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(50, 5) = 2,118,760\n\nNow, let's find the total number of combinations for selecting 1 additional number from 1 to 5. Since there's only one number to choose, the total number of combinations is simply 5.\n\nTo find the total number of possible combinations for the entire game, we multiply the combinations for the two parts:\n\nTotal combinations = 2,118,760 (combinations for 5 numbers) × 5 (combinations for 1 additional number)\nTotal combinations = 10,593,800\n\nThere is only 1 winning combination (the correct 5 numbers and the correct additional number) out of the total combinations. So, the probability of winning the game is:\n\nProbability = (Number of winning combinations) / (Total number of combinations)\nProbability = 1 / 10,593,800\n\nThe probability of winning the game is 1 in 10,593,800."
