    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of X, we use the formula:\n\nχ(X) = Σ(-1)^i * b_i\n\nwhere b_i are the Betti numbers of X.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nχ(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3\nχ(X) = 4 - 2 + 3 - 1\nχ(X) = 4\n\nNow, let's verify Poincaré duality. Poincaré duality states that for a compact, orientable manifold X of dimension n, the homology groups satisfy:\n\nH_i(X) ≅ H_{n-i}(X)\n\nIn our case, we don't know the dimension of X, but we can still check if the Betti numbers satisfy the necessary conditions for Poincaré duality.\n\nSince b_0 = 4, b_1 = 2, b_2 = 3, and b_3 = 1, we can see that:\n\nb_0 = b_3\nb_1 = b_2\n\nThis implies that the homology groups satisfy the necessary conditions for Poincaré duality, as the Betti numbers are symmetric with respect to the middle dimension.\n\nIn conclusion, the Euler characteristic of X is 4, and the homology groups of X satisfy the necessary conditions for Poincaré duality."
