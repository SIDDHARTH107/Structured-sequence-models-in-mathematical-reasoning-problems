    "message_2": "To find all possible group structures up to isomorphism for a group of order 36, we first need to find all possible divisors of 36. The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. We will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures.\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted as n_2, must divide 36 and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities for n_2 are 1, 3, and 9.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted as n_3, must divide 36 and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal. The group structure in this case is Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_6, which is isomorphic to Z_36.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and the group structure is Z_3 × (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2). This is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_8, which is a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the group structure is Z_2 × (Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3). This is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_9, which is a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. There are no normal Sylow subgroups, so the group structure is a semidirect product. The possible structures are Z_4 ⋊ Z_9 and Z_2 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_9). The first structure is isomorphic to Z_36, and the second structure is a non-abelian group.\n\nIn summary, there are four possible group structures up to isomorphism for a group of order 36:\n\n1. Z_36 (abelian)\n2. Z_3 × Z_8 (non-abelian)\n3. Z_2 × Z_9 (non-abelian)\n4. Z_2 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_9) (non-abelian)"
