Employee 2 requires five hours to complete task 1, two hours to complete task 2, and three hours to complete task 3. Employee 3 requires four hours to complete task 1, six hours to complete task 2, and four hours to complete task 3. Employee 4 requires eight hours to complete task 1, four hours to complete task 2, and six hours to complete task 3. Employee 5 requires six hours to complete task 1, five hours to complete task 2, and four hours to complete task 3. Employee 6 requires three hours to complete task 1, six hours to complete task 2, and eight hours to complete task 3. What is the minimum amount of time required to complete all six tasks with each employee assigned to exactly one task?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum amount of time required to complete all six tasks, we need to assign each employee to the task they can complete the fastest. We will use the Hungarian Algorithm to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's create a cost matrix based on the given data:\n\n| Employee | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1        | 2      | 3      | 5      |\n| 2        | 5      | 2      | 3      |\n| 3        | 4      | 6      | 4      |\n| 4        | 8      | 4      | 6      |\n| 5        | 6      | 5      | 4      |\n| 6        | 3      | 6      | 8      |\n\nNow, we will apply the Hungarian Algorithm:\n\n1. Subtract the smallest value in each row from all the values in that row:\n\n| Employee | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1        | 0      | 1      | 3      |\n| 2        | 3      | 0      | 1      |\n| 3        | 0      | 2      | 0      |\n| 4        | 4      | 0      | 2      |\n| 5        | 2      | 1      | 0      |\n| 6        | 0      | 3      | 5      |\n\n2. Subtract the smallest value in each column from all the values in that column:\n\n| Employee | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1        | 0      | 1      | 3      |\n| 2        | 3      | 0      | 1      |\n| 3        | 0      | 2      | 0      |\n| 4        | 4      | 0      | 2      |\n| 5        | 2      | 1      | 0      |\n| 6        | 0      | 3      | 5      |\n\n3. Find the minimum number of lines needed to cover all zeros in the matrix. In this case, we need 3 lines:\n\n- Horizontal line through row 1\n- Horizontal line through row 2\n- Vertical line through column 1\n\nSince the number of lines (3) is equal to the number of tasks (3), we can now find the optimal assignment:\n\n- Employee 1 is assigned to Task 1 (cost = 2 hours)\n- Employee 2 is assigned to Task 2 (cost = 2 hours)\n- Employee 3 is assigned to Task 3 (cost = 4 hours)\n\nThe other employees are not assigned to any of the tasks since they are not part of the optimal assignment.\n\nThe minimum amount of time required to complete all six tasks is the sum of the costs of the optimal assignment: 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 hours."
