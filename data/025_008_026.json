    "message_2": "1. To show that the variety is smooth, we need to check that its partial derivatives do not vanish simultaneously at any point on the variety. Let's compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 - 1) = 3x^2 + 6xy + 3y^2\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 - 1) = 3x^2 + 6xy + 3y^2\\]\n\nNotice that both partial derivatives are equal. Now, let's find the points where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n\\[3x^2 + 6xy + 3y^2 = 0\\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 0\\]\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[(x + y)^2 = 0\\]\n\nThis implies that x = -y. Now, let's substitute this back into the original equation:\n\n\\[(-y)^3 + 3(-y)^2y + 3(-y)y^2 + y^3 = 1\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[-y^3 + 3y^3 - 3y^3 + y^3 = 1\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[0 = 1\\]\n\nSince this is a contradiction, there are no points on the variety where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. Therefore, the variety is smooth.\n\n2. To compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p, q}$, we first need to determine the dimension of the variety. Since the equation is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in two variables, the variety is a curve in the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The curve is also non-singular, as we showed in part 1. \n\nFor a smooth projective curve of genus g, the Hodge numbers are given by:\n\n\\[h^{0, 0} = h^{1, 0} = h^{0, 1} = 1\\]\n\\[h^{1, 1} = 2g\\]\n\\[h^{p, q} = 0 \\text{ for } p + q \\neq 0, 1, 2\\]\n\nTo find the genus g, we can use the formula for a smooth plane curve of degree d:\n\n\\[g = \\frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2}\\]\n\nIn our case, d = 3, so:\n\n\\[g = \\frac{(3 - 1)(3 - 2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1\\]\n\nThus, the Hodge numbers for this variety are:\n\n\\[h^{0, 0} = h^{1, 0} = h^{0, 1} = 1\\]\n\\[h^{1, 1} = 2\\]\n\\[h^{p, q} = 0 \\text{ for } p + q \\neq 0, 1, 2\\]"
