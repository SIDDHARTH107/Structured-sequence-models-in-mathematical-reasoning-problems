    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\n    A = | 1  2 -1 |\n        | 2 -1  2 |\n        | 3  2  3 |\n\n    x = | x |\n        | y |\n        | z |\n\n    b = | 8 |\n        | 3 |\n        | 2 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a technique used to decompose a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R:\n\n1. Find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A:\n\n    u1 = a1 = (1, 2, 3)\n    u2 = a2 - proj(u1, a2) = (2, -1, 2) - ((2, -1, 2)·(1, 2, 3))/(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) * (1, 2, 3) = (-1/2, -2, 1/2)\n    u3 = a3 - proj(u1, a3) - proj(u2, a3) = (-1, 2, 3) - ((-1, 2, 3)·(1, 2, 3))/(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) * (1, 2, 3) - ((-1, 2, 3)·(-1/2, -2, 1/2))/((-1/2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (1/2)^2) * (-1/2, -2, 1/2) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince u3 is a zero vector, we have a linearly dependent column in A, which means that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. Therefore, we cannot use QR decomposition to solve this system of linear equations."
