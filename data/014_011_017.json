    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a columnar transposition cipher with the key \"3142\", we first need to arrange the message in a grid based on the key length. In this case, the key length is 4, so we create a grid with 4 columns:\n\nH E L L\nO W O R\nL D - -\n\nWe fill in the grid row by row, and we add two padding characters (-) to complete the grid. Now, we read the grid column by column, but we reorder the columns based on the key \"3142\":\n\n3 1 4 2\nL H O E\nD O W L\n- L - R\n\nThe encrypted message is obtained by reading the reordered grid column by column: \"LHDOEWLL-LR\". We can remove the padding characters to get the final encrypted message: \"LHDOEWLLLR\"."
