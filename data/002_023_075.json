    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (4^2)\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 16\nSurface Area = 64 * π\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 201.06 square centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)."
