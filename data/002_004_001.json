    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 7cm and the width is 5cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(7 + 5)\nPerimeter = 2(12)\nPerimeter = 24cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 24cm."
