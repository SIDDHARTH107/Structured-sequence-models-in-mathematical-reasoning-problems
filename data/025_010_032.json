Let Div(X) be the group of divisors on X, and let Div^0(X) be the subgroup of divisors of degree zero. Let L(D) be the Riemann-Roch space of a divisor D on X. \n\nFind the number of linearly independent global sections of the divisor D = P - Q, where P and Q are points on X with coordinates (4, 5) and (1, 8), respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of linearly independent global sections of the divisor D = P - Q, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the curve X. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the Riemann-Roch space L(D), K is the canonical divisor, deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D, and g is the genus of the curve X.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus g of the curve X. Since X is given by the equation y^2 = x^3 - x, it is an elliptic curve, and its genus is g = 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the degree of the divisor D. Since D = P - Q, its degree is deg(D) = deg(P) - deg(Q) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For an elliptic curve, the canonical divisor is the zero divisor, so K = 0.\n\nFinally, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(-D) = 0 + 1 - 1\nl(D) - l(D) = 0\n\nSince l(D) - l(D) = 0, we have l(D) = l(D), which means that there is 1 linearly independent global section of the divisor D = P - Q."
