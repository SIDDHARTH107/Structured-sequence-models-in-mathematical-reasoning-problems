    "message_1": "In an auction with three bidders, bidder A values the item at $100, bidder B values the item at $85, and bidder C values the item at $95. The auction follows an ascending-bid, sealed-bid, first-price format. What is the expected revenue for the seller?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid, first-price auction, each bidder submits a single bid without knowing the bids of the other participants. The highest bidder wins the auction and pays their bid price.\n\nTo determine the expected revenue for the seller, we need to consider the bidding strategies of the bidders. In a first-price auction, bidders typically shade their bids below their true valuation to avoid overpaying. However, since we don't have information on the bidders' strategies, we will assume that each bidder bids their true valuation.\n\nIn this case, bidder A would submit a bid of $100, bidder B would submit a bid of $85, and bidder C would submit a bid of $95. Bidder A would win the auction with a bid of $100.\n\nTherefore, the expected revenue for the seller in this auction is $100."
