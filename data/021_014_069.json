    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using genetic algorithms, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of 50 random integers between 0 and 5.\n2. Selection: Perform tournament selection.\n3. Crossover: Perform single-point crossover.\n4. Mutation: Apply mutation with a rate of 0.1.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 100 generations.\n6. Find the best solution in the final population.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Initialization:\n\nWe generate an initial population of 50 random integers between 0 and 5:\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 0, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 0, 2]\n\n2. Selection:\n\nWe perform tournament selection by randomly selecting two individuals from the population and choosing the one with the lower fitness (f(x)) as the winner. We repeat this process until we have a new population of the same size (50).\n\n3. Crossover:\n\nWe perform single-point crossover by randomly selecting pairs of individuals from the new population and applying crossover at a random point in their binary representation. For example, if we have the pair (2, 4), their binary representations are 010 and 100. We could apply crossover at the second position, resulting in the offspring (0, 6).\n\n4. Mutation:\n\nWe apply mutation with a rate of 0.1 by randomly flipping a bit in the binary representation of an individual with a probability of 0.1. For example, if we have the individual 3 (011), we could flip the second bit, resulting in the mutated individual 1 (001).\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 100 generations.\n\nAfter performing 100 generations of evolution, we will have a final population that has evolved towards the optimal solution.\n\n6. Find the best solution in the final population:\n\nWe find the individual with the lowest fitness (f(x)) in the final population. This individual represents the minimum value of the objective function f(x) and the corresponding value of x.\n\nNote that since this is a simple optimization problem with a small search space, it is likely that the genetic algorithm will find the optimal solution (x = 0, f(x) = 0) relatively quickly. However, the genetic algorithm approach is more useful for complex optimization problems with larger search spaces and more complex constraints."
