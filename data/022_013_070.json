    "message_2": "To find the analytic function, we can integrate the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Let's start by integrating the first equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx = \\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dx$$\n\n$$u(x,y) = \\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dx + g(y)$$\n\nwhere $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$.\n\nNow, let's integrate the second equation with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} dy = -\\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} dy$$\n\n$$u(x,y) = -\\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} dy + h(x)$$\n\nwhere $h(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nComparing the two expressions for $u(x,y)$, we have:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dx + g(y) = -\\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} dy + h(x)$$\n\nNow, let's differentiate this equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} + h'(x)$$\n\nand with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y \\partial x} + g'(y)$$\n\nSince mixed partial derivatives are equal, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + h'(x)$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + g'(y)$$\n\nNow, we can integrate the second equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$$v(x,y) = \\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dx + g'(y)x + k(y)$$\n\nwhere $k(y)$ is another arbitrary function of $y$. Using the given conditions $u(1,0) = 0$ and $v(0,1) = 2$, we can find the functions $g(y)$ and $k(y)$:\n\n$$0 = u(1,0) = h(1)$$\n\n$$h(x) = x - 1$$\n\n$$2 = v(0,1) = k(1)$$\n\n$$k(y) = 2$$\n\nSo, the analytic function $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = (x - 1) + i\\left(\\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dx + (y - 1)x + 2\\right)$$\n\nTo find the exact form of $f(z)$, we would need more information about the function $v(x,y)$. However, this expression gives a general form for the analytic function that satisfies the given conditions and Cauchy-Riemann equations."
