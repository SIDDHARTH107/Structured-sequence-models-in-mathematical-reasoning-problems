    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To compute φ(15), we need to find the number of integers less than or equal to 15 that are relatively prime to 15.\n\n15 = 3 × 5, which are both prime numbers. We can use the formula for the totient function for a product of distinct prime factors:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn our case, n = 15, p1 = 3, and p2 = 5. Applying the formula:\n\nφ(15) = 15 × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/5) = 15 × (2/3) × (4/5) = 15 × (8/15) = 8.\n\nSo, φ(15) = 8. There are 8 positive integers less than or equal to 15 that are relatively prime to 15: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14."
