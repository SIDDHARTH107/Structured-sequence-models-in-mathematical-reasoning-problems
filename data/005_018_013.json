    "message_1": "The survival times of patients with a certain disease are recorded in months, starting from the date of diagnosis. A statistician wants to estimate the survival function of the patients using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Given the following data set of survival times of 10 patients:\n\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16\n\nWhat is the estimated survival probability for patients at 11 months after diagnosis?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the survival probability at 11 months using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we first need to determine the number of patients at risk and the number of events (deaths) at each time point. We also need to calculate the survival probability at each time point. Here's the data:\n\nTime (months) | Number at risk | Number of events (deaths)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n3             | 10             | 1\n4             | 9              | 1\n5             | 8              | 1\n6             | 7              | 1\n7             | 6              | 1\n9             | 5              | 1\n12            | 4              | 1\n13            | 3              | 1\n15            | 2              | 1\n16            | 1              | 1\n\nNow, we calculate the survival probability at each time point using the formula:\n\nS(t) = S(t-1) * (1 - (Number of events at time t / Number at risk at time t))\n\nTime (months) | Survival Probability\n-------------------------------------\n3             | (1 - (1/10)) = 0.9\n4             | 0.9 * (1 - (1/9)) = 0.8\n5             | 0.8 * (1 - (1/8)) = 0.7\n6             | 0.7 * (1 - (1/7)) ≈ 0.6\n7             | 0.6 * (1 - (1/6)) = 0.5\n9             | 0.5 * (1 - (1/5)) = 0.4\n12            | 0.4 * (1 - (1/4)) = 0.3\n13            | 0.3 * (1 - (1/3)) ≈ 0.2\n15            | 0.2 * (1 - (1/2)) = 0.1\n16            | 0.1 * (1 - (1/1)) = 0\n\nSince we want to estimate the survival probability at 11 months, we look for the last time point before 11 months, which is 9 months. The estimated survival probability at 11 months is the same as the survival probability at 9 months, which is 0.4 or 40%."
