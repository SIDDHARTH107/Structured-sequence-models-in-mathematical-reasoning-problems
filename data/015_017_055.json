    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - 0.4 * (x_n^2 + y_n^2)^0.5\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Ikeda map with parameters a = 0.9 and b = 0.4, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the map and then find the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = [ ∂x_{n+1}/∂x_n  ∂x_{n+1}/∂y_n ]\n              [ ∂y_{n+1}/∂x_n  ∂y_{n+1}/∂y_n ]\n\nAfter calculating the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = [ a * cos(t_n) + a * x_n * sin(t_n) * ∂t_n/∂x_n   -a * y_n * sin(t_n) * ∂t_n/∂x_n ]\n              [ a * sin(t_n) - a * x_n * cos(t_n) * ∂t_n/∂x_n   a * cos(t_n) + a * y_n * cos(t_n) * ∂t_n/∂x_n ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix. This can be done numerically by iterating the Ikeda map for a large number of steps, computing the Jacobian matrix at each step, and then finding the largest eigenvalue of the product of the Jacobian matrices.\n\nHowever, finding the maximum Lyapunov exponent analytically or numerically for the Ikeda map with specific parameters is a complex task and requires specialized software or programming skills. It is beyond the scope of this platform to provide a specific numerical value for the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters."
