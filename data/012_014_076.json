We can find a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of G1 and G2 that preserves the adjacency of the vertices as follows:\n\nLet's map the vertices of G1 to the vertices of G2:\n- A -> 1\n- B -> 2\n- C -> 3\n- D -> 4\n\nNow let's check if the edges are preserved under this mapping:\n- (A,B) in G1 corresponds to (1,2) in G2\n- (B,C) in G1 corresponds to (2,3) in G2\n- (C,D) in G1 corresponds to (3,4) in G2\n- (D,A) in G1 corresponds to (4,1) in G2\n\nSince the adjacency of the vertices is preserved under this mapping, the two graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic.
