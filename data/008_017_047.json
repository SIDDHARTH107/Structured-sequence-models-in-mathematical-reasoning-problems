To solve for the variable matrix x, we can find the inverse of matrix A and multiply it by the constant matrix b.\n\nA^(-1) = | 1/3  0   0  |\n         |  0  1/2  0  |\n         |  0   0  1/4 |\n\nNow, multiply A^(-1) by b:\n\nx = A^(-1) * b\n\n  | 1/3  0   0  |   | 12 |   | 4 |\n  |  0  1/2  0  | * |  8 | = | 4 |\n  |  0   0  1/4 |   | 16 |   | 4 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 4\ny = 4\nz = 4"
