    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to arrange a set of 6 parentheses such that they are properly matched, we can use the formula for the nth Catalan number: C(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n).\n\nIn this case, we have 6 parentheses, which means we have 3 pairs of parentheses. So, n = 3.\n\nC(3) = (1/(3+1)) * (2*3 choose 3)\nC(3) = (1/4) * (6 choose 3)\nC(3) = (1/4) * (6! / (3! * 3!))\nC(3) = (1/4) * (720 / (6 * 6))\nC(3) = (1/4) * 120\nC(3) = 30\n\nThere are 30 ways to arrange the 6 parentheses such that they are properly matched."
