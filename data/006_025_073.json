    "message_1": "In a theater performance, there are 5 musical acts, each with a probability of 0.8 of being well-received by the audience. What is the probability that at least 4 of the musical acts will be well-received by the audience?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 4 of the musical acts will be well-received, we need to consider two cases: exactly 4 acts are well-received, and all 5 acts are well-received.\n\n1. Exactly 4 acts are well-received: There are 5 different ways this can happen (the first 4 acts are well-received and the last one is not, the first 3 and the last one are well-received and the fourth one is not, etc.). The probability of any one of these scenarios happening is (0.8)^4 * (1 - 0.8) = (0.8)^4 * 0.2. So the probability of exactly 4 acts being well-received is 5 * (0.8)^4 * 0.2.\n\n2. All 5 acts are well-received: The probability of this happening is (0.8)^5.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two cases to find the probability that at least 4 acts will be well-received:\n\nP(at least 4 acts well-received) = P(exactly 4 acts well-received) + P(all 5 acts well-received)\n= 5 * (0.8)^4 * 0.2 + (0.8)^5\n= 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2 + 0.32768\n= 0.4096 + 0.32768\n= 0.73728\n\nSo, the probability that at least 4 of the musical acts will be well-received by the audience is approximately 0.73728 or 73.73%."
