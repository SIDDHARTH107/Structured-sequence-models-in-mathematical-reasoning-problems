Find a minimal model Y of X where Y is defined by the equations:\n\n$u^2+v^2+w^2=uv+uw+vw=0$\n\nand there is a birational map $\\phi: X \\dashrightarrow Y$ with the following properties:\n\n1. $\\phi$ is an isomorphism in codimension one.\n\n2. $\\phi$ contracts no exceptional curves in X.",
    "message_2": "To find a minimal model Y of X, we first need to find a birational map $\\phi: X \\dashrightarrow Y$ that satisfies the given properties. Let's define the map $\\phi$ as follows:\n\n$\\phi(x, y, z) = (u, v, w) = (x+y, x+z, y+z)$\n\nWe can check that this map is birational by finding its inverse:\n\n$\\phi^{-1}(u, v, w) = (x, y, z) = \\left(\\frac{u+v}{2}, \\frac{u+w}{2}, \\frac{v+w}{2}\\right)$\n\nNow, let's verify that $\\phi$ satisfies the given properties:\n\n1. $\\phi$ is an isomorphism in codimension one.\n\nTo show this, we need to check that the Jacobian matrix of $\\phi$ has rank 2 (since we are working in three-dimensional space). The Jacobian matrix of $\\phi$ is:\n\n$J_\\phi = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of any 2x2 minor of this matrix is non-zero, so the rank of $J_\\phi$ is 2, and $\\phi$ is an isomorphism in codimension one.\n\n2. $\\phi$ contracts no exceptional curves in X.\n\nAn exceptional curve in X is a curve that is contracted to a point in Y. Since $\\phi$ is an isomorphism in codimension one, it does not contract any curves in X.\n\nNow that we have a birational map $\\phi: X \\dashrightarrow Y$, let's find the equations defining Y. We have:\n\n$u = x+y$\n\n$v = x+z$\n\n$w = y+z$\n\nWe can express $x, y, z$ in terms of $u, v, w$ using the inverse map:\n\n$x = \\frac{u+v}{2}$\n\n$y = \\frac{u+w}{2}$\n\n$z = \\frac{v+w}{2}$\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation defining X:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{u+v}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u+w}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{v+w}{2}\\right)^2 = 1$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$\\frac{u^2 + 2uv + v^2}{4} + \\frac{u^2 + 2uw + w^2}{4} + \\frac{v^2 + 2vw + w^2}{4} = 1$\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n$u^2 + 2uv + v^2 + u^2 + 2uw + w^2 + v^2 + 2vw + w^2 = 4$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2u^2 + 2v^2 + 2w^2 + 2uv + 2uw + 2vw = 4$\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n$u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + uv + uw + vw = 2$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = uv + uw + vw$\n\nThis is the equation defining Y. So, the minimal model Y of X is defined by the equation:\n\n$u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = uv + uw + vw$\n\nand the birational map $\\phi: X \\dashrightarrow Y$ is given by:\n\n$\\phi(x, y, z) = (u, v, w) = (x+y, x+z, y+z)$"
