    "message_2": "The given sinusoidal function is y = 3sin(2x - π/3) + 5. \n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to look at the term inside the sine function, which is (2x - π/3). The general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, the function is already in the general form, so we can directly identify the phase shift. The phase shift is C, which in our case is -(-π/3) = π/3.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the given sinusoidal function is π/3."
