    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the ground. A person standing some distance away from the base of the flagpole measures the angle of elevation to the top of the pole and finds it to be 35 degrees. The person then walks 35 feet closer to the pole and measures the angle of elevation to be 45 degrees. How tall is the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h, the initial distance from the person to the flagpole as x, and the distance after walking 35 feet closer as (x-35). We can use the tangent function to relate the angles, heights, and distances.\n\nFrom the initial position:\ntan(35°) = h/x\n\nAfter walking 35 feet closer:\ntan(45°) = h/(x-35)\n\nWe know that tan(45°) = 1, so:\nh = x - 35\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for h into the first equation:\ntan(35°) = (x - 35)/x\n\nTo solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:\nx * tan(35°) = x - 35\n\nx * tan(35°) - x = -35\n\nx * (tan(35°) - 1) = -35\n\nx = -35 / (tan(35°) - 1)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\nx ≈ 61.93 feet\n\nNow we can find the height of the flagpole by substituting x back into the equation for h:\nh = x - 35\nh = 61.93 - 35\nh ≈ 26.93 feet\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 26.93 feet."
