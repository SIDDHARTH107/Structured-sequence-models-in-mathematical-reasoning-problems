    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 12 years. If there are initially 80 grams of the substance, how much of it will be left after 24 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 80 grams, the time elapsed is 24 years, and the half-life is 12 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 80 * (1/2)^(24 / 12)\n\nFinal amount = 80 * (1/2)^2\n\nFinal amount = 80 * (1/4)\n\nFinal amount = 20 grams\n\nSo, after 24 years, there will be 20 grams of the radioactive substance left."
