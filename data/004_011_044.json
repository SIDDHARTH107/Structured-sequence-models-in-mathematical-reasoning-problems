    "message_1": "A spherical balloon is being inflated with helium gas at a rate of 5 cm³/s. At what rate is the radius of the balloon increasing when its volume is 500 cm³? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the volume of a sphere and the concept of related rates.\n\nThe volume V of a sphere with radius r is given by the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 5 cm³/s (the rate at which the volume is increasing) and we want to find dr/dt (the rate at which the radius is increasing) when V = 500 cm³.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius when the volume is 500 cm³:\n\n500 = (4/3)πr³\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr³ = (3/4)(500/π)\nr³ ≈ 119.4\nr ≈ 4.93 cm\n\nNow, we will differentiate the volume formula with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (4/3)π(3r²)(dr/dt)\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\ndV/dt = 4πr²(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values: dV/dt = 5 cm³/s and r ≈ 4.93 cm:\n\n5 = 4π(4.93)²(dr/dt)\n\nSolving for dr/dt, we get:\n\ndr/dt ≈ 5 / (4π(4.93)²)\ndr/dt ≈ 0.0082 cm/s\n\nSo, the rate at which the radius of the balloon is increasing when its volume is 500 cm³ is approximately 0.0082 cm/s, or 0.01 cm/s when rounded to two decimal places."
