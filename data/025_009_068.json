    "message_2": "There seems to be a misunderstanding in the question. An elliptic curve is a smooth curve of genus 1, not genus 2. A curve of genus 2 is called a hyperelliptic curve. So, I will provide the answer for both elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 over the field of complex numbers.\n\n1. Elliptic curves (genus 1) over the field of complex numbers:\n\nElliptic curves are defined by a Weierstrass equation of the form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\n\nwhere A and B are complex numbers, and the discriminant Î” = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2) is nonzero to ensure the curve is smooth.\n\nSince A and B can be any complex numbers (except for the condition on the discriminant), there are infinitely many smooth elliptic curves over the field of complex numbers.\n\n2. Hyperelliptic curves (genus 2) over the field of complex numbers:\n\nA hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 can be defined by an equation of the form:\n\ny^2 = f(x)\n\nwhere f(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 or 6 with complex coefficients, and the curve is smooth if the polynomial has distinct roots.\n\nAgain, since the coefficients of the polynomial can be any complex numbers (with the condition of distinct roots), there are infinitely many smooth hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 over the field of complex numbers."
