    "message_2": "Let's analyze each group to determine if it meets the conditions of group G.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: This group has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, where a has order 8. The only element with order 2 in this group is a^4. Therefore, C8 is not isomorphic to group G.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: This group has elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1. In this group, every non-identity element has order 4 (e.g., i^4 = j^4 = k^4 = 1). Therefore, Q8 is not isomorphic to group G.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: This group represents the symmetries of a square and has elements {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r represents a rotation and s represents a reflection. In this group, r has order 4, and all other non-identity elements have order 2. Therefore, D4 is not isomorphic to group G.\n\nSince none of the given groups have every element of order 2, none of them are isomorphic to a group G of order 8 where every element of G has order 2."
