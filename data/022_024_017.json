    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the heat equation:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nT'(t) + λT(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0 with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with eigenfunctions X_n(x) = sin(nπx) and eigenvalues λ_n = n²π² for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow solve the second equation for T(t):\n\nT'(t) + λT(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the solution:\n\nT_n(t) = e^(-λ_nt) = e^(-n²π²t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of the product of eigenfunctions and their corresponding time functions:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑(c_n * sin(nπx) * e^(-n²π²t))\n\nTo find the coefficients c_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x) = x²(1-x):\n\nx²(1-x) = ∑(c_n * sin(nπx))\n\nWe can find the coefficients c_n by using the orthogonality property of sine functions and integrating both sides with respect to x from 0 to 1:\n\n∫(x²(1-x) * sin(nπx) dx) = c_n * ∫(sin²(nπx) dx)\n\nc_n = (2 / (nπ)) * ∫(x²(1-x) * sin(nπx) dx)\n\nTo find c_n, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nc_n = (2 / (nπ)) * [-((2x³ - 3x² + x) * cos(nπx) / nπ) - (6x² - 6x + 1) * sin(nπx) / (n²π²)] from 0 to 1\n\nc_n = (2 / (nπ)) * [(2 - 3 + 1) * (-1)^n - (6 - 6 + 1) * 0] = (2 / (nπ)) * (2 * (-1)^n)\n\nFinally, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[((2 * (-1)^n) / (nπ)) * sin(nπx) * e^(-n²π²t)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
