    "message_1": "The following system of linear equations represents the number of tickets sold for a music concert at different price points:\n\n$3x + 2y + z = 1800$\n\n$4x + 3y + 2z = 2400$\n\nWhat is the number of tickets sold for each price point if the total number of tickets sold is 5000?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find a third equation involving x, y, and z. We know that the total number of tickets sold is 5000, so we can write the third equation as:\n\n$x + y + z = 5000$\n\nNow we have a system of three linear equations with three variables:\n\n1) $3x + 2y + z = 1800$\n\n2) $4x + 3y + 2z = 2400$\n\n3) $x + y + z = 5000$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate z from equations 1 and 2. To do this, we'll multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 3 by -1:\n\n1) $6x + 4y + 2z = 3600$\n\n3) $-x - y - z = -5000$\n\nNow, add equations 1 and 3:\n\n$5x + 3y = -1400$\n\nNext, we'll eliminate z from equations 2 and 3. To do this, we'll multiply equation 2 by 1 and equation 3 by -2:\n\n2) $4x + 3y + 2z = 2400$\n\n3) $-2x - 2y - 2z = -10000$\n\nNow, add equations 2 and 3:\n\n$2x + y = -7600$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n$5x + 3y = -1400$\n\n$2x + y = -7600$\n\nWe can eliminate y by multiplying the second equation by -3 and adding it to the first equation:\n\n$5x + 3y = -1400$\n\n$-6x - 3y = 22800$\n\nAdd the two equations:\n\n$-x = 21400$\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n$x = -21400$\n\nSince the number of tickets sold cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given information is inconsistent. Please check the problem statement and provide the correct information."
