    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and edges {(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,6),(3,7)}.\n\nWe can visualize the graph as follows:\n\n1 - 2 - 4\n|   |\n3 - 5\n|\n6\n|\n7\n\nNow, let's try to color the vertices with the minimum number of colors:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertices 2 and 3 with color B, as they are adjacent to vertex 1.\n3. Color vertices 4 and 5 with color A, as they are adjacent to vertex 2.\n4. Color vertices 6 and 7 with color A, as they are adjacent to vertex 3.\n\nThe coloring would look like this:\n\nA - B - A\n|   |\nB - A\n|\nA\n|\nA\n\nAs we can see, no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and we used only two colors (A and B). Therefore, the chromatic number of the given graph G is 2."
