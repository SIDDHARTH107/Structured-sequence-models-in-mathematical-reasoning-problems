    "message_1": "A factory has a production line that can manufacture two types of products, A and B. The production line can work for a maximum of 20 hours per day. Product A requires 2 hours of production time and brings in a profit of $200 per unit. Product B requires 3 hours of production time and brings in a profit of $300 per unit. How many units of products A and B should the factory manufacture in a day to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe total production time constraint is:\n2x + 3y ≤ 20\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 200x + 300y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the constraint equation is an equality:\n2x + 3y = 20\n\nIf x = 0, then y = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 (but y must be an integer, so y = 6)\nIf y = 0, then x = 20/2 = 10\n\nSo, we have two points (0, 6) and (10, 0). Now, we'll find the integer points in the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 6): P = 200(0) + 300(6) = $1800\n2. (10, 0): P = 200(10) + 300(0) = $2000\n3. (8, 1): P = 200(8) + 300(1) = $1900\n4. (6, 2): P = 200(6) + 300(2) = $1800\n5. (4, 4): P = 200(4) + 300(4) = $2000\n\nComparing the profits, we can see that the maximum profit is $2000, which can be achieved by producing either 10 units of product A and 0 units of product B or 4 units of product A and 4 units of product B."
