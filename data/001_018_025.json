    "message_2": "To simplify the given logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\n1. log base b (a) - log base b (c) = log base b (a/c)\n2. n * log base b (a) = log base b (a^n)\n\nApplying the properties:\n\nlog base 2 (8) - log base 2 (2) + 2log base 2 (3)\n\n= log base 2 (8/2) + log base 2 (3^2)  [using property 1 and 2]\n\n= log base 2 (4) + log base 2 (9)\n\nNow, we can use the property of logarithms to combine the two logarithms:\n\nlog base 2 (4) + log base 2 (9) = log base 2 (4 * 9) [using property 1 in reverse]\n\n= log base 2 (36)\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog base 2 (36)"
