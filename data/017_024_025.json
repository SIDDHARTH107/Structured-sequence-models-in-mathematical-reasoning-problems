Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor's exponent:\n   - For 2^5: (5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n   - For 3^1: (1)\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order: n(G) = product of p(n_i), where p(n_i) is the partition function for each prime factor's exponent.\n   - For 2^5: p(5) = 7\n   - For 3^1: p(1) = 1\n   - n(G) = 7 * 1 = 7\n4. Use the formula for the number of non-abelian groups of a given order: n(NA) = n(T) - n(G), where n(T) is the total number of groups of a given order and n(G) is the number of abelian groups of a given order.\n   - n(T) can be found using the number of groups of order p^n for each prime factor: n(T) = n(2^5) * n(3^1) = 15 * 1 = 15\n   - n(NA) = 15 - 7 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 96."
