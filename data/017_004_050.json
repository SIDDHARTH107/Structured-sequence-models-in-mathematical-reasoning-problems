    "message_2": "To find all possible groups of order 25 up to isomorphism, we can use the fact that the number of groups of order p^2, where p is a prime number, is exactly 2. In this case, p = 5, so there are two groups of order 25 up to isomorphism.\n\n1. The first group is the cyclic group of order 25, denoted as C_25 or Z_25. This group is generated by a single element of order 25, and its elements can be represented as {0, 1, 2, ..., 24} under addition modulo 25. This group is clearly cyclic, as it is generated by a single element.\n\n2. The second group is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted as C_5 × C_5 or Z_5 × Z_5. This group consists of ordered pairs (a, b), where a and b are elements of Z_5, and the group operation is component-wise addition modulo 5. This group is not cyclic, as it does not have an element of order 25. However, it is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, as it is formed by taking the direct product of two such groups.\n\nIn summary, there are two groups of order 25 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C_25 and the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, C_5 × C_5."
