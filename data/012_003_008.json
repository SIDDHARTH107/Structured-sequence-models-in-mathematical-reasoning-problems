    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to see or process images. However, I can help you understand the concept of maximum independent set and guide you through the process of finding it for a given graph.\n\nAn independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). The maximum independent set is the largest possible independent set in a graph.\n\nTo find the maximum independent set for a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify all possible independent sets in the graph.\n2. Compare the sizes of these independent sets.\n3. Choose the largest independent set.\n\nNote that finding the maximum independent set is an NP-hard problem, meaning that there is no known algorithm that can solve it efficiently for all graphs. However, for small graphs, you can use a brute-force approach to find the maximum independent set.\n\nIf you can provide a textual description of the graph or adjacency matrix, I can help you find the maximum independent set."
