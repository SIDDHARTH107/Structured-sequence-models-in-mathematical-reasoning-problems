What is the minimum length of fencing needed to surround the field if wire fencing costs $4 per meter along the lengths and $8 per meter along the widths? (Hint: Use calculus to find the dimensions that minimize the cost of fencing.)",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the field parallel to the river be x meters and the width perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since the area of the rectangular field is 240 square meters, we have the equation:\n\nx * y = 240\n\nThe cost of fencing is $4 per meter along the lengths and $8 per meter along the widths. Since one side of the field is bounded by a river and does not need to be fenced, the total cost of fencing is:\n\nC(x, y) = 4x + 8y\n\nWe want to minimize the cost of fencing. To do this, we can use calculus. First, we need to express the cost function in terms of one variable. We can do this by solving the area equation for y:\n\ny = 240/x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y in the cost function:\n\nC(x) = 4x + 8(240/x)\n\nNow we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nC'(x) = 4 - (1920/x^2) = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n4x^2 = 1920\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nx^2 = 480\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nx = sqrt(480)\n\nNow we need to find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 240/x = 240/sqrt(480)\n\nNow we have the dimensions of the field that minimize the cost of fencing:\n\nx = sqrt(480) meters\ny = 240/sqrt(480) meters\n\nFinally, we can find the minimum length of fencing needed:\n\nMinimum fencing = 4x + 8y = 4(sqrt(480)) + 8(240/sqrt(480)) â‰ˆ 62.35 meters\n\nSo the minimum length of fencing needed to surround the field is approximately 62.35 meters."
