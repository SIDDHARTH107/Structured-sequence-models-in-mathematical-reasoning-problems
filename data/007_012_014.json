    "message_2": "To prove that 59 is a prime number using Wilson's theorem, we need to show that (59-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 59). \n\nFirst, let's calculate (59-1)!:\n(59-1)! = 58!\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 58! is divided by 59. We can use the property of modular arithmetic that (a * b) mod p = ((a mod p) * (b mod p)) mod p.\n\n58! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * 58\n\nLet's compute the remainder of each factor when divided by 59:\n\n1 mod 59 = 1\n2 mod 59 = 2\n3 mod 59 = 3\n...\n58 mod 59 = 58\n\nNow, let's pair the factors in the following way:\n\n(2 * 58) mod 59 = 116 mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n(3 * 57) mod 59 = 171 mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n(4 * 56) mod 59 = 224 mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n...\n(29 * 30) mod 59 = 870 mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n\nNow, let's multiply all these pairs together:\n\n(1 * 1 * 1 * ... * 1) mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n\nSince we have 29 pairs, we can rewrite it as:\n\n1^29 mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n\nNow, we need to multiply this result by the remaining unpaired factor, which is 1:\n\n(1 * 1) mod 59 = 1 (mod 59)\n\nSo, 58! ≡ 1 (mod 59). However, according to Wilson's theorem, we need to show that (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In our case, -1 (mod 59) is equivalent to 58 (mod 59) since 58 + 1 = 59, which is divisible by 59.\n\nThus, we have shown that 58! ≡ 58 (mod 59), which satisfies Wilson's theorem, and therefore, 59 is a prime number."
