    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations: \n\n3x + y = 10 \n0.003x + 0.001y = 1 \n\nUse matrix inversion to find the solution. What is the value of x and y, rounded to two decimal places?",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix inversion, we first write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3    1  |\n    | 0.003  0.001 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 1  |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (3)(0.001) - (1)(0.003) = 0.003 - 0.003 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the matrix A is singular and does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use matrix inversion to solve this system of linear equations."
