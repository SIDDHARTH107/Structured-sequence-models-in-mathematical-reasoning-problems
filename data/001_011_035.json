    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2/x + 3/2x = 1/4, we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for x and 2x is 2x. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(2 * 2) / (x * 2) + (3 * 1) / (2x * 1) = 1/4\n(4/2x) + (3/2x) = 1/4\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n(4 + 3) / 2x = 1/4\n7/2x = 1/4\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n7 * 4 = 2x * 1\n28 = 2x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2 to isolate x:\n\nx = 28/2\nx = 14\n\nSo, the solution for x is 14."
