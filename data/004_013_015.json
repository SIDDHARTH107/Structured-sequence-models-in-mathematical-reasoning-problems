    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 12 on the interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\n1. Find the derivative of the function:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\n2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\nx = 4, x = 2\n\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints of the interval:\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) - 12 = -12\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) - 12 = -4\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) - 12 = 4\n\n4. Compare the function values to determine the maximum and minimum values:\nThe maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is 4, which occurs at x = 4.\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is -4, which occurs at x = 2."
