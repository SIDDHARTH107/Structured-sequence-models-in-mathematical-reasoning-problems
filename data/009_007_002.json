    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nConsider a rectangular channel where water flows with a velocity of 3 m/s. The width of the channel is 1.5 m and the depth is 0.5 m. Assume that the flow is laminar and the viscosity of water is 1.002 x 10^-3 Pa s. Calculate the shear stress at the bottom of the channel using Navier-Stokes equations.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shear stress at the bottom of the channel, we can use the following equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for a laminar flow in a rectangular channel:\n\nτ = μ * (du/dy)\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, du is the change in velocity in the x-direction, and dy is the change in distance in the y-direction.\n\nIn this case, we are given the following information:\n\n- Velocity (u) = 3 m/s\n- Width (b) = 1.5 m\n- Depth (h) = 0.5 m\n- Dynamic viscosity (μ) = 1.002 x 10^-3 Pa s\n\nSince the flow is laminar and fully developed, the velocity profile is parabolic, and the maximum velocity occurs at the center of the channel. The velocity gradient (du/dy) is maximum at the bottom of the channel (y = 0) and can be calculated using the following equation for a rectangular channel:\n\n(du/dy) = -3 * U_max / h^2\n\nwhere U_max is the maximum velocity at the center of the channel. To find U_max, we can use the average velocity (u) and the equation for the average velocity in a laminar flow:\n\nu = 2/3 * U_max\n\nSolving for U_max:\n\nU_max = 3 * (3/2) = 4.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the velocity gradient (du/dy) at the bottom of the channel:\n\n(du/dy) = -3 * 4.5 / 0.5^2 = -27 m/s^2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the shear stress (τ):\n\nτ = μ * (du/dy) = (1.002 x 10^-3 Pa s) * (-27 m/s^2) = -0.027054 Pa\n\nThe shear stress at the bottom of the channel is approximately -0.027 Pa. The negative sign indicates that the shear stress acts in the opposite direction of the flow."
