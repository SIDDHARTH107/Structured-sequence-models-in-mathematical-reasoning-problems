    "message_2": "Paraconsistent logic is a subfield of logic and mathematics that deals with the study of logical systems in which contradictions do not necessarily lead to the explosion of truth values. In classical logic, if a contradiction is found, it is assumed that any statement can be proven true (this is known as the principle of explosion). However, paraconsistent logic aims to develop systems where contradictions can coexist without causing an explosion of truth values.\n\nThe motivation behind paraconsistent logic is to provide a more realistic and flexible framework for reasoning, especially in situations where inconsistencies may arise naturally, such as in human reasoning, legal systems, or scientific theories. Paraconsistent logic has applications in artificial intelligence, computer science, and philosophy, among other fields.\n\nOne of the most well-known paraconsistent logics is the so-called \"Logic of Paradox\" (LP), developed by philosopher Graham Priest. In LP, a statement can be both true and false simultaneously, which is known as a \"dialetheia.\" Other paraconsistent logics include \"relevant logic\" and \"inconsistency-tolerant logics.\"\n\nNow, let's frame a question for the student to solve:\n\nConsider a simple paraconsistent logical system with the following rules:\n\n1. If A is true, then A or B is true.\n2. If A and B are true, then A is true.\n3. If A is true and A is false, then B is true.\n\nGiven these rules, can you determine if the following statements are true, false, or undetermined in this paraconsistent logical system?\n\na) If A is true and B is false, is A or B true?\nb) If A is false and B is true, is A and B true?\nc) If A is true and A is false, is B true?"
