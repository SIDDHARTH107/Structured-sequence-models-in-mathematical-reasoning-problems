    "message_1": "A company produces a new product that costs $10 to manufacture. The company has done market research and determined that the demand for the product can be modeled by the equation p = 200 - 5q, where p is the price in dollars and q is the quantity in hundreds. What price should the company charge to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the price (p) that maximizes the profit function. Profit is given by the equation:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue can be found by multiplying the price (p) by the quantity (q), and the cost can be found by multiplying the cost per unit ($10) by the quantity (q). So, the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = pq - 10q\n\nWe can substitute the demand equation (p = 200 - 5q) into the profit function:\n\nProfit = (200 - 5q)q - 10q\n\nNow, we need to find the value of q that maximizes the profit function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to q and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dq = 200 - 10q - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for q:\n\n10q = 190\nq = 19\n\nNow that we have the value of q that maximizes profit, we can find the corresponding price by plugging q back into the demand equation:\n\np = 200 - 5(19)\np = 200 - 95\np = 105\n\nSo, the company should charge $105 to maximize their profit."
