Find the frequencies and amplitudes of the two sine waves that compose the function using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we are given a function f(t) that is already composed of two sine waves. The Fourier transform is not necessary to find the frequencies and amplitudes of these sine waves, as they are directly given in the function.\n\nThe function is:\n\nf(t) = 2sin(2πt/10) + 3sin(2πt/15)\n\nThe first sine wave has an amplitude of 2 and a frequency of (2π/10) = π/5. This means it completes one full cycle every 10 days.\n\nThe second sine wave has an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of (2π/15) = 2π/15. This means it completes one full cycle every 15 days.\n\nSo, the frequencies and amplitudes of the two sine waves are:\n\n1st sine wave: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = π/5\n2nd sine wave: Amplitude = 3, Frequency = 2π/15"
