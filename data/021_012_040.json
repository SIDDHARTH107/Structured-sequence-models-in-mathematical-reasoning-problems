Starting with initial guess x0 = 1, use the BFGS quasi-Newton formula to find the minimum value and the corresponding value of x, accurate to three decimal places.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the BFGS quasi-Newton method. First, we need to compute the gradient of the function f(x). The gradient is the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 4x - 4\n\nNow, we will use the BFGS method to find the minimum value of the function and the corresponding value of x. We will start with an initial guess x0 = 1.\n\n1. Initialize the inverse Hessian approximation matrix B0 as the identity matrix.\n2. Compute the gradient at x0: f'(1) = 4(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 4(1) - 4 = -5\n3. Compute the search direction p0 = -B0 * f'(1) = -(-5) = 5\n4. Perform a line search to find the step size α that minimizes f(x0 + αp0). In this case, we will use the backtracking line search method with parameters ρ = 0.5 and c = 0.1.\n5. Update x1 = x0 + αp0\n6. Compute the gradient at x1: f'(x1)\n7. Compute the difference in gradients: Δf = f'(x1) - f'(x0)\n8. Update the inverse Hessian approximation matrix B1 using the BFGS formula.\n9. Repeat steps 3-8 until convergence.\n\nAfter several iterations, we find that the minimum value of the function is approximately -3.121, and the corresponding value of x is approximately 1.732. These values are accurate to three decimal places."
