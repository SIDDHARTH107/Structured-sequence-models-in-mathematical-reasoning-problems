    "message_2": "Mirror symmetry is a phenomenon in algebraic geometry that relates Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y. The mirror manifold Y has Hodge numbers that are interchanged compared to X, i.e., h¹¹(Y) = h²¹(X) and h²¹(Y) = h¹¹(X).\n\nGiven a Calabi-Yau manifold X with Hodge numbers h¹¹(X) = 1 and h²¹(X) = 101, its mirror manifold Y will have Hodge numbers h¹¹(Y) = 101 and h²¹(Y) = 1.\n\nThe dimension of a Calabi-Yau manifold is given by the sum of its Hodge numbers: dim(X) = h¹¹(X) + h²¹(X). In this case, dim(X) = 1 + 101 = 102.\n\nSince mirror manifolds have the same dimension, the dimension of the mirror manifold Y is also 102."
