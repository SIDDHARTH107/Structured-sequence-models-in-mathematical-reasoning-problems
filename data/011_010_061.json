    "message_2": "To triangulate a regular octagon, we need to divide it into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals. Let's use the method of dynamic programming to solve this problem.\n\nLet T(n) be the number of ways to triangulate a regular polygon with n sides. We can see that T(3) = 1, as there is only one way to triangulate a triangle (by doing nothing).\n\nNow, let's consider a regular octagon (n = 8). We can choose one of its vertices as a base point, and then connect it to all other non-adjacent vertices. This will divide the octagon into smaller polygons. For example, if we choose vertex A as the base point, we can connect it to vertices C, D, E, and F (skipping adjacent vertices B and G). This will divide the octagon into a quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, and another pentagon, respectively.\n\nNow, we can use the dynamic programming approach to find the number of ways to triangulate these smaller polygons:\n\nT(4) = 1 (there is only one way to triangulate a quadrilateral, by drawing one diagonal)\nT(5) = 5 (there are five ways to triangulate a pentagon)\nT(6) = 14 (there are fourteen ways to triangulate a hexagon)\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways to triangulate the octagon by summing the products of the number of ways to triangulate the smaller polygons created by each diagonal:\n\nT(8) = T(4) * T(5) + T(5) * T(6) + T(6) * T(5) + T(5) * T(4)\nT(8) = 1 * 5 + 5 * 14 + 14 * 5 + 5 * 1\nT(8) = 5 + 70 + 70 + 5\nT(8) = 150\n\nSo, there are 150 ways to triangulate a regular octagon without any intersecting line segments inside the octagon."
