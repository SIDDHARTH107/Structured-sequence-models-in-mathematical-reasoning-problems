    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the points (3, -1, 2), (2, 5, -3), and (1, 2, 1), we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find two vectors lying on the plane by subtracting the coordinates of the points.\n2. Calculate the cross product of these two vectors to find the normal vector of the plane.\n3. Use the normal vector and any of the given points to find the equation of the plane.\n\nStep 1: Find two vectors lying on the plane\nVector A = (2, 5, -3) - (3, -1, 2) = (-1, 6, -5)\nVector B = (1, 2, 1) - (3, -1, 2) = (-2, 3, -1)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cross product of the two vectors\nNormal vector N = A x B = (6*(-1) - 5*3, -5*(-2) - (-1)*(-1), 3*(-1) - 6*(-2))\nN = (-6 - 15, 10 - 1, -3 + 12)\nN = (-21, 9, 9)\n\nStep 3: Use the normal vector and any of the given points to find the equation of the plane\nThe equation of the plane is given by N â€¢ (X - P) = 0, where N is the normal vector, X is a point on the plane (x, y, z), and P is any of the given points.\n\nUsing point (3, -1, 2), we have:\n-21(x - 3) + 9(y + 1) + 9(z - 2) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n-21x + 9y + 9z = -6 + 9 - 18\n-21x + 9y + 9z = -15\n\nSo, the equation of the plane passing through the points (3, -1, 2), (2, 5, -3), and (1, 2, 1) is:\n-21x + 9y + 9z = -15"
