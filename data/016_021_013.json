    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is created by iteratively replacing each line segment with two segments connected by an equilateral triangle. Each iteration increases the total length of the curve by a factor of 2.\n\nLet's denote the length of the curve after n iterations as L_n. The initial length of the curve, L_0, is 1 unit.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve doubles, so L_1 = 2 * L_0 = 2 units.\n\nAfter the second iteration, the length of the curve doubles again, so L_2 = 2 * L_1 = 4 units.\n\nWe can generalize this pattern for any number of iterations n:\n\nL_n = 2^n * L_0\n\nNow, we want to find the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 5 iterations:\n\nL_5 = 2^5 * L_0 = 32 * 1 = 32 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after 5 iterations is 32 units."
