    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the smallest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of G, we can use the inequality:\n\ng ≤ 2 * m / (n - g + 1)\n\nwhere g is the girth, m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices. In this case, m = 18 and n = 12.\n\nLet's try g = 3 (the smallest possible cycle length):\n\n3 ≤ 2 * 18 / (12 - 3 + 1)\n3 ≤ 36 / 10\n3 ≤ 3.6\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that the girth of G is 3. However, we need to check if a graph with 12 vertices and 18 edges can have a girth of 3. \n\nA graph with girth 3 can be a complete bipartite graph, where vertices are divided into two sets and every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set. The number of edges in a complete bipartite graph with sets of size p and q is given by:\n\nm = p * q\n\nSince we have 18 edges, we need to find two integers p and q such that p * q = 18. The possible pairs are (1, 18), (2, 9), (3, 6), and (6, 3). However, the sum of p and q must be equal to the total number of vertices, which is 12. The only pair that satisfies this condition is (3, 6).\n\nTherefore, the graph G can be a complete bipartite graph with sets of size 3 and 6, which has a girth of 3. So, the girth of G is 3."
