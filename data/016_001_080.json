    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is given by the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 2. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nCalculating this value to four decimal places, we get:\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849"
