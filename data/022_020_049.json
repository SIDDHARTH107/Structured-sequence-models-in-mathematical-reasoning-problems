    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, y) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\nu(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)\n\nSubstitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}=X''(x)Y(y)+X(x)Y''(y)=0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by XY:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}+\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}=0$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ^2:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}=-\\lambda^2$\n\n$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}=\\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x)+\\lambda^2X(x)=0$\n\n$Y''(y)-\\lambda^2Y(y)=0$\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\n$X(x)=A\\cos(\\lambda x)+B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions for x:\n\n$u(x, 0) = X(x)Y(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow X(x) = 0$ since $Y(0) \\neq 0$\n\n$u(x, 1) = X(x)Y(1) = 0 \\Rightarrow X(x) = 0$ since $Y(1) \\neq 0$\n\nThis implies that $A = 0$ and $B \\neq 0$. Thus, the solution for X(x) is:\n\n$X(x)=B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nNow, solve the second equation for Y(y):\n\n$Y(y)=C\\cosh(\\lambda y)+D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions for y:\n\n$u(0, y) = X(0)Y(y) = 2\\sin(\\pi y) \\Rightarrow Y(y) = \\frac{2}{B}\\sin(\\pi y)$\n\n$u(1, y) = X(1)Y(y) = \\sin(\\pi y) \\Rightarrow Y(y) = \\frac{1}{B}\\sin(\\pi y)$\n\nSince the boundary conditions are satisfied for λ = π, we can write the solution as:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = B\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$\n\nNow, we need to determine the value of B. Since u(0, y) = 2sin(πy), we have:\n\n$B\\sin(0)\\sin(\\pi y) = 2\\sin(\\pi y)$\n\nThis implies that B = 2. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x, y) = 2\\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$\n\nFinally, we can find the value of u(1/2, 1/2):\n\n$u(1/2, 1/2) = 2\\sin(\\pi (1/2))\\sin(\\pi (1/2)) = 2(1)(1) = 2$\n\nSo, the value of u(1/2, 1/2) is 2."
