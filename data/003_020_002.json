    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on level ground. Approaching the pole, you measure the angle of elevation to the top of the pole to be 42 degrees. You then take a few steps back, and the angle of elevation is now 23 degrees. If you are 50 meters away from the base of the pole, what is the height of the flagpole in meters?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h meters, and the distance from the first measurement point to the base of the flagpole as x meters. From the given information, we can set up two right triangles with the flagpole as one side and the ground as the other side.\n\nFor the first triangle, with angle 42 degrees and distance x meters, we can use the tangent function:\ntan(42) = h/x\n\nFor the second triangle, with angle 23 degrees and distance (x+50) meters, we can also use the tangent function:\ntan(23) = h/(x+50)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (h and x):\n\n1) h = x * tan(42)\n2) h = (x+50) * tan(23)\n\nWe can solve this system by setting the two expressions for h equal to each other:\n\nx * tan(42) = (x+50) * tan(23)\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx * tan(42) - x * tan(23) = 50 * tan(23)\nx * (tan(42) - tan(23)) = 50 * tan(23)\n\nx = (50 * tan(23)) / (tan(42) - tan(23))\n\nUsing a calculator to find the tangent values and perform the calculations:\n\nx ≈ (50 * 0.4245) / (0.9004 - 0.4245)\nx ≈ 21.225 / 0.4759\nx ≈ 44.6 meters\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the flagpole using equation 1:\n\nh = x * tan(42)\nh ≈ 44.6 * 0.9004\nh ≈ 40.1 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 40.1 meters."
