    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z-3) centered at z=2, we first need to rewrite the function in terms of (z-2). Let's do this by adding and subtracting 2 in the denominator:\n\nf(z) = 1/((z-2) - 1)\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula to expand the function:\n\n1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = (z-2) and we have:\n\nf(z) = 1/(-1 + (z-2)) = -1/(1 - (2-z))\n\nNow, we can expand f(z) using the geometric series formula:\n\nf(z) = -1(1 + (2-z) + (2-z)^2 + (2-z)^3 + ...)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z-3) centered at z=2:\n\nf(z) = -1 - (z-2) - (z-2)^2 - (z-2)^3 - ...\n\nThe convergence conditions for the geometric series are given by:\n\n|2-z| < 1\n\nThis means that the Laurent series converges for:\n\n1 < z < 3\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z-3) centered at z=2 is:\n\nf(z) = -1 - (z-2) - (z-2)^2 - (z-2)^3 - ...\n\nAnd it converges for 1 < z < 3."
