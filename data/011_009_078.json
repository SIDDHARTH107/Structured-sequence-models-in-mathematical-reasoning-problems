    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. The nth Bell number, denoted as B(n), represents the number of ways to partition a set with n elements.\n\nFor a set with 5 elements, we need to find the 5th Bell number, B(5).\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are: B(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2, B(3) = 5, B(4) = 15.\n\nThere are different ways to compute Bell numbers, one of which is using the Bell triangle. The Bell triangle is constructed as follows:\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n...\n\nEach number in the triangle is the sum of the number above it and the number to the left of the number above it. The first number in each row is the same as the last number in the previous row, and these numbers form the sequence of Bell numbers.\n\nFrom the Bell triangle, we can see that B(5) = 52.\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 elements."
