    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (4x^2 - x - 3)/(3x^2 + x + 2) as x approaches 2, we can simply substitute the value of x = 2 into the function and simplify:\n\nf(2) = (4(2)^2 - 2 - 3)/(3(2)^2 + 2 + 2)\n\nf(2) = (4(4) - 2 - 3)/(3(4) + 2 + 2)\n\nf(2) = (16 - 2 - 3)/(12 + 2 + 2)\n\nf(2) = (11)/(16)\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 2 is 11/16."
