    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x - 1, we will apply the power rule for derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nFor f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x - 1, we have three terms to differentiate:\n\n1. The derivative of 2x^3:\nUsing the power rule, we get (3)(2)x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n\n2. The derivative of 5x:\nUsing the power rule, we get (1)(5)x^(1-1) = 5x^0 = 5.\n\n3. The derivative of -1 (a constant):\nThe derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 5 - 0 = 6x^2 + 5.\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x - 1 is f'(x) = 6x^2 + 5."
