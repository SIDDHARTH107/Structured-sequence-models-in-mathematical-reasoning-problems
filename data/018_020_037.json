    "message_1": "Let A = {5, 7, 9, 13} and B = {9, 13, 15, 20}. Find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) ∪ A and (A ∪ A) ∆ (B ∪ B), and prove that the two results are equal, showing that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 20}\nA ∩ B = {9, 13}\n\nA ∆ B = {5, 7, 15, 20}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∪ A and (A ∪ A) ∆ (B ∪ B):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ A = {5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 20} (since A is already included in A ∪ B)\n\n(A ∪ A) ∆ (B ∪ B) = A ∆ B (since A ∪ A = A and B ∪ B = B)\n\nA ∆ B = {5, 7, 15, 20}\n\nNow, we can see that (A ∆ B) ∪ A = (A ∪ A) ∆ (B ∪ B), which is {5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 20}. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over union."
