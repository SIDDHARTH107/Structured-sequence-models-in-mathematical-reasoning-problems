Determine the number of linearly independent $1$-forms with poles only at the points $[0:1:0]$, $[1:0:0]$, $[1:1:1]$, and $[\\lambda:1:\\lambda]$, where $[\\cdot:\\cdot:\\cdot]$ denotes homogeneous coordinates in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of linearly independent 1-forms with poles only at the specified points, we will compute the dimension of the space of meromorphic 1-forms with poles of order at most 1 at these points. We will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for this purpose.\n\nLet $D = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4$, where $p_1 = [0:1:0]$, $p_2 = [1:0:0]$, $p_3 = [1:1:1]$, and $p_4 = [\\lambda:1:\\lambda]$. We want to compute the dimension of the space $L(D)$ of meromorphic 1-forms with poles of order at most 1 at these points.\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have\n$$\n\\dim L(D) - \\dim L(K_C - D) = \\deg D + 1 - g,\n$$\nwhere $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of the curve $C$, and $g$ is the genus of $C$. \n\nFirst, let's compute the degree of $D$. Since each point has a pole of order at most 1, we have $\\deg D = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n\nNext, we need to compute the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. The curve $C$ has degree 3, so by the genus-degree formula, we have\n$$\ng = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1.\n$$\n\nNow, let's compute the canonical divisor $K_C$. Since $C$ is a smooth plane curve of degree 3, we have $K_C = (3-2)(3-1)H = 2H$, where $H$ is the class of a line in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. \n\nFinally, we need to compute the dimension of the space $L(K_C - D)$. Since $K_C - D = 2H - 4 = -2H$, we have $L(K_C - D) = \\{0\\}$, and thus $\\dim L(K_C - D) = 0$.\n\nPlugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get\n$$\n\\dim L(D) - 0 = 4 + 1 - 1,\n$$\nwhich implies that\n$$\n\\dim L(D) = 4.\n$$\n\nTherefore, there are 4 linearly independent 1-forms with poles only at the points $[0:1:0]$, $[1:0:0]$, $[1:1:1]$, and $[\\lambda:1:\\lambda]$."
