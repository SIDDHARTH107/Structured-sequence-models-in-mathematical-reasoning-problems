    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sin(30°) without using a calculator, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 right triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest side, the side opposite the 60° angle is the middle-length side, and the hypotenuse is the longest side.\n\nThe sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we want to find sin(30°), so we need the ratio of the side opposite the 30° angle to the hypotenuse.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle has a length of 1, and the hypotenuse has a length of 2. Therefore, sin(30°) = 1/2."
