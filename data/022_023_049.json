Suppose a string is fixed at both ends, and has a length of $L=2\\pi$. Also suppose that the string is initially at rest, and at time $t=0$ it is struck with a hammer so that it starts to vibrate according to the function $u(x,0) = \\sin(x)$. What is the displacement $u(x,t)$ of the string at time $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2c}$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2 \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2 = c^2 \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2 T(t) = 0$\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{k^2}{c^2} X(x) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{k}{c}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{k}{c}x)$\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(2\\pi) = 0$. Applying these conditions, we get:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n\n$X(2\\pi) = B\\sin(\\frac{k}{c}2\\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have:\n\n$\\frac{k}{c}2\\pi = n\\pi$ for $n = 1,2,3,\\dots$\n\nSo, $k = nc$ for $n = 1,2,3,\\dots$. Now, the general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(kt) + D\\sin(kt)$\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, we have the initial condition $T'(0) = 0$. Applying this condition, we get:\n\n$T'(0) = -kC\\sin(0) + kD\\cos(0) = kD = 0$\n\nSince $k$ cannot be zero, we must have $D = 0$. Therefore, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin(\\frac{nk}{c}x) \\cos(nkt)$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $C_n$ using the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(x)$. We have:\n\n$\\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin(\\frac{nk}{c}x)$\n\nUsing the orthogonality of sine functions, we can find $C_n$:\n\n$C_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L \\sin(x) \\sin(\\frac{nk}{c}x) dx$\n\nFor $L = 2\\pi$ and $k = nc$, we get:\n\n$C_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(x) \\sin(n x) dx$\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have:\n\n$C_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(x) \\sin(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFor $n > 1$, we have:\n\n$C_n = 0$\n\nSo, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(x) \\cos(t)$\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement of the string at time $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2c}$:\n\n$u(x,\\frac{\\pi}{2c}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(x) \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$\n\nSo, the displacement of the string at time $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2c}$ is 0."
