    "message_2": "To solve the given stochastic differential equation (SDE), we can use the technique of integrating factors. The SDE is given by:\n\ndX(t) = (2X(t) + 3) dt + 4dW(t)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the SDE in the following form:\n\ndX(t) - 2X(t) dt = 3 dt + 4dW(t)\n\nNow, we will find an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of X(t) with respect to t:\n\nIntegrating factor = exp(∫2 dt) = exp(2t)\n\nNext, multiply both sides of the SDE by the integrating factor:\n\nexp(2t) dX(t) - 2X(t) exp(2t) dt = 3 exp(2t) dt + 4 exp(2t) dW(t)\n\nNow, the left-hand side of the equation is the differential of the product of X(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd(X(t) exp(2t)) = 3 exp(2t) dt + 4 exp(2t) dW(t)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(X(t) exp(2t)) = ∫(3 exp(2t) dt + 4 exp(2t) dW(t))\n\nX(t) exp(2t) - X(0) exp(0) = ∫(3 exp(2t) dt) + ∫(4 exp(2t) dW(t))\n\nSince X(0) = 1, we have:\n\nX(t) exp(2t) - 1 = ∫(3 exp(2t) dt) + ∫(4 exp(2t) dW(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals on the right-hand side. The first integral is a standard integral:\n\n∫(3 exp(2t) dt) = (3/2) exp(2t) + C\n\nThe second integral is an Ito integral, which has an expected value of zero:\n\nE[∫(4 exp(2t) dW(t))] = 0\n\nSo, we have:\n\nX(t) exp(2t) - 1 = (3/2) exp(2t) + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition X(0) = 1:\n\n1 - 1 = (3/2) + C\n\nC = -3/2\n\nNow, we can write the solution for X(t):\n\nX(t) exp(2t) = (3/2) exp(2t) - (3/2)\n\nFinally, divide both sides by exp(2t) to find the solution for X(t):\n\nX(t) = (3/2) - (3/2) exp(-2t)\n\nThis is the solution to the given stochastic differential equation."
