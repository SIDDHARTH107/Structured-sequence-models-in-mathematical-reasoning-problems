    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 6 in the interval [0, 5], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to 0 or undefined.\n\n1. Find the derivative of the function:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5\n\n2. Set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:\n3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -4, and c = 5:\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(3)(5))) / 2(3)\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 60)) / 6\nx = (4 ± √(-44)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means there are no critical points in the interior of the interval.\n\n3. Evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval:\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 5(0) - 6 = -6\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 2(5)^2 + 5(5) - 6 = 125 - 50 + 25 - 6 = 94\n\nSince there are no critical points in the interior of the interval, the maximum and minimum values of the function occur at the endpoints of the interval. Therefore, the maximum value of the function is 94 at x = 5, and the minimum value of the function is -6 at x = 0."
