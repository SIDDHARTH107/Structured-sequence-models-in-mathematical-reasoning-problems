    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x + 2)/(x + 2) as x approaches -2, we first try to simplify the function. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\nf(x) = ((x + 1)(x + 2))/(x + 2)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x + 2) terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = x + 1\n\nNow the function is simplified, and we can find the limit as x approaches -2:\n\nlim (x -> -2) (x + 1) = -2 + 1 = -1\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x + 2)/(x + 2) as x approaches -2 is -1."
