    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * |E| / |V|,\n\nwhere |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have |E| = 12 and |V| = 9. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 12 / 9 = 24 / 9 ≈ 2.67.\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer, which is 3. Therefore, the girth of G is at most 3.\n\nNow, let's check if it's possible to have a graph with 9 vertices, 12 edges, and a girth of 3. A graph with a girth of 3 contains at least one triangle (a cycle of length 3). We can construct such a graph by starting with a triangle and adding 6 more vertices, each connected to two vertices of the triangle. This graph will have 9 vertices and 12 edges, as required.\n\nThus, the girth of G is 3."
