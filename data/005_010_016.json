    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs and the probability of a bulb being defective is 5%. A quality control inspector selects 10 bulbs at random for inspection. What is the probability that at least one of the bulbs in the sample is defective, using Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the bulbs in the sample is defective, we can use the complementary probability rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nLet A be the event that at least one bulb is defective, and A' be the event that none of the bulbs are defective. We want to find P(A), the probability that at least one bulb is defective.\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A')\n\nThe probability of a single bulb not being defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the bulbs are selected at random and we assume independence, the probability of all 10 bulbs not being defective is the product of the probabilities of each bulb not being defective:\n\nP(A') = (0.95)^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow we can find the probability of at least one bulb being defective:\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, using Bayesian statistics, the probability that at least one of the bulbs in the sample is defective is approximately 40.13%."
