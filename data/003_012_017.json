    "message_1": "A student standing 20 meters away from a flagpole notices that the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole is 40 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 40 degrees, the distance from the student to the flagpole is 20 meters (adjacent side), and we want to find the height of the flagpole (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(40°) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(40°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 40 degrees:\n\ntan(40°) ≈ 0.8391\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\nheight ≈ 20 * 0.8391\n\nheight ≈ 16.782 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 16.782 meters."
