    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. In this case, the largest complete subgraph is any of the four triangles formed by three vertices, such as ABC, ABD, ACD, or BCD. Each of these subgraphs has 3 vertices, so the clique number of this graph is 3."
