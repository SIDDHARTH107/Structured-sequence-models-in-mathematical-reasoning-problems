    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a radius of 20 meters and completes one full revolution in 40 seconds. A passenger boards the Ferris wheel at the bottom and starts ascending. The height of the passenger at any given time can be modeled by the function h(t) = 20 + 20cos(π/20)t, where t is the time in seconds after boarding the Ferris wheel. What is the maximum height above the ground that the passenger reaches and at what time does it occur?",
    "message_2": "The function h(t) = 20 + 20cos(π/20)t models the height of the passenger at any given time. To find the maximum height, we need to find the maximum value of the function.\n\nThe maximum value of the cosine function is 1, which occurs when the argument (π/20)t is equal to 0 or a multiple of 2π. Since the passenger starts at the bottom of the Ferris wheel, the maximum height will occur when the argument is equal to 0.\n\nSo, when t = 0, we have:\n\nh(t) = 20 + 20cos(0)\nh(t) = 20 + 20(1)\nh(t) = 20 + 20\nh(t) = 40\n\nThe maximum height above the ground that the passenger reaches is 40 meters. This occurs at t = 0 seconds, which is when the passenger first boards the Ferris wheel."
