    "message_2": "The length of a Hilbert curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * initial_length\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 4 iterations:\n\nLength = (2^4 - 1) * 1\nLength = (16 - 1) * 1\nLength = 15 units\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve after 4 iterations is 15 units."
