    "message_1": "A production line manufactures light bulbs, but due to several factors, the weights of the bulbs vary. In the past, the weight of the bulbs followed a normal distribution with a mean of 30 grams and a standard deviation of 4 grams. \n\nWhat is the probability that a sample of 25 light bulbs will have a mean weight less than 28 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean (for large enough sample sizes) will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 30 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 4 grams, and the sample size (n) is 25 light bulbs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / sqrt(n)\nσ_sample_mean = 4 / sqrt(25)\nσ_sample_mean = 4 / 5\nσ_sample_mean = 0.8 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for a sample mean of 28 grams:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (28 - 30) / 0.8\nz = -2 / 0.8\nz = -2.5\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.5:\n\nP(z < -2.5) ≈ 0.0062\n\nSo, the probability that a sample of 25 light bulbs will have a mean weight less than 28 grams is approximately 0.62%."
