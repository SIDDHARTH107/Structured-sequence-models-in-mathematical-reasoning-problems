    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament, each team plays against every other team exactly once. For 8 teams, we can use the combination formula to find the total number of games played:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams (8) and k is the number of teams in each game (2).\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!6!)\nC(8, 2) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(8, 2) = (8 × 7) / (2 × 1)\nC(8, 2) = 28\n\nSo, a total of 28 games are played in the round-robin tournament of 8 teams."
