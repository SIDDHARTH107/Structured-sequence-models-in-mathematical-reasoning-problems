    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of a population of adult male students in a university are normally distributed with a mean of 175cm and a standard deviation of 5cm. If a random sample of 100 adult male students is selected from this population, what is the probability that the mean height of this sample is between 174cm and 176cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the mean height of a sample of 100 adult male students is between 174cm and 176cm, we need to use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 175cm, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 5cm. Since we have a sample size (n) of 100, we can calculate the standard deviation of the sample mean (σx̄) using the formula:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nσx̄ = 5 / √100\nσx̄ = 5 / 10\nσx̄ = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the sample mean range of 174cm and 176cm:\n\nz1 = (174 - μ) / σx̄\nz1 = (174 - 175) / 0.5\nz1 = -1\n\nz2 = (176 - μ) / σx̄\nz2 = (176 - 175) / 0.5\nz2 = 1\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability between these two z-scores. The probability of a z-score being between -1 and 1 is approximately 0.6827 or 68.27%.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean height of a sample of 100 adult male students is between 174cm and 176cm is approximately 68.27%."
