    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first need to write the augmented matrix of the system:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  1 |  10 ]\n[ 4 -2 -1 |  -5 ]\n[ 6  5  2 |  20 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 (to get a leading 1 in the first row):\n\n```\n[ 4 -2 -1 |  -5 ]\n[ 2  3  1 |  10 ]\n[ 6  5  2 |  20 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (1/2) * Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 4 -2 -1 |  -5 ]\n[ 1  3/2 1/2 |  5 ]\n[ 6  5  2 |  20 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - 4 * Row 2, and Row 3 with Row 3 - 6 * Row 2:\n\n```\n[  0  8  -3 | -25 ]\n[  1  3/2 1/2 |  5 ]\n[  0 -4  -1 | -10 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 + (1/2) * Row 1:\n\n```\n[  0  8  -3 | -25 ]\n[  1  3/2 1/2 |  5 ]\n[  0  0  -2 | -20 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 3 with (-1/2) * Row 3, and Row 1 with Row 1 - 4 * Row 3:\n\n```\n[  0  8  0 |  15 ]\n[  1  3/2 1/2 |  5 ]\n[  0  0  1 |  10 ]\n```\n\n6. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - (1/2) * Row 3:\n\n```\n[  0  8  0 |  15 ]\n[  1  3/2  0 |  0 ]\n[  0  0  1 |  10 ]\n```\n\n7. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - (3/2) * Row 2:\n\n```\n[  0  8  0 |  15 ]\n[  1  0  0 | -3 ]\n[  0  0  1 |  10 ]\n```\n\n8. Replace Row 1 with (1/8) * Row 1:\n\n```\n[  0  1  0 | 15/8 ]\n[  1  0  0 |  -3 ]\n[  0  0  1 |  10 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = -3\ny = 15/8\nz = 10"
