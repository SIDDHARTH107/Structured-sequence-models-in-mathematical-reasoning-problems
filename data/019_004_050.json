    "message_1": "Consider the following temporal logic statement:\n\n\"Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.\"\n\nWrite a formal proof to show whether this statement is true or false. Provide a numerical example to support your argument.",
    "message_2": "This statement is known as the Goldbach Conjecture, which is an unsolved problem in number theory. Although it has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values and found to be true in those cases, no general proof or counterexample has been discovered yet. Therefore, we cannot provide a formal proof for this statement. However, we can provide a few numerical examples to demonstrate the conjecture for some even numbers.\n\nExample 1:\nConsider the even number 10.\n10 = 3 (prime) + 7 (prime)\n\nExample 2:\nConsider the even number 20.\n20 = 7 (prime) + 13 (prime)\n\nExample 3:\nConsider the even number 42.\n42 = 5 (prime) + 37 (prime)\n\nThese examples support the Goldbach Conjecture for the given even numbers, but they do not serve as a proof for the general case. The conjecture remains an open question in mathematics."
