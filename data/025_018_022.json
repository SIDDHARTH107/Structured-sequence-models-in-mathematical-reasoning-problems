    "message_2": "1. To find the singular points of the curve, we first compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2 - x^3 - x^2) = -3x^2 - 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2 - x^3 - x^2) = 2y$\n\nA point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the curve is singular if and only if both partial derivatives vanish at that point, i.e.,\n\n$-3x_0^2 - 2x_0 = 0$ and $2y_0 = 0.$\n\nThe second equation implies that $y_0 = 0.$ Substituting this into the curve equation, we get $0 = x_0^3 + x_0^2,$ which implies that $x_0(x_0 + 1) = 0.$ Thus, $x_0 = 0$ or $x_0 = -1.$\n\nSo, the singular points of the curve are $(0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0).$\n\n2. To compute the self-intersection number of the divisor $D$ on the curve using Mori theory, we first need to find the intersection points of the curve and the divisor $D.$ The equation for $D$ is $y = x - 1,$ so we can substitute this into the curve equation:\n\n$(x - 1)^2 = x^3 + x^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$x^3 + x^2 - 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0$\n\n$x^3 - x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0$\n\nNow we need to find the intersection points of the curve and the divisor $D.$ Since the curve is singular at $(0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0),$ we can use these points to compute the self-intersection number. Let's consider the intersection multiplicities at these points.\n\nAt $(0, 0),$ we have $y = x - 1,$ so $y = -1.$ The tangent vector to the curve at this point is given by the gradient of the curve equation:\n\n$\\nabla(y^2 - x^3 - x^2) = (-3x^2 - 2x, 2y)$\n\nAt $(0, 0),$ the gradient is $(0, 0),$ which means that the tangent vector is not well-defined. Therefore, the intersection multiplicity at $(0, 0)$ is $1.$\n\nAt $(-1, 0),$ we have $y = x - 1,$ so $y = -2.$ The tangent vector to the curve at this point is given by the gradient of the curve equation:\n\n$\\nabla(y^2 - x^3 - x^2) = (-3x^2 - 2x, 2y)$\n\nAt $(-1, 0),$ the gradient is $(1, 0),$ which means that the tangent vector is well-defined and transverse to the divisor $D.$ Therefore, the intersection multiplicity at $(-1, 0)$ is also $1.$\n\nNow, we can compute the self-intersection number of the divisor $D$ on the curve using the intersection multiplicities:\n\n$D \\cdot D = 1 + 1 = 2.$\n\nSo, the self-intersection number of the divisor $D$ on the curve is $2.$"
