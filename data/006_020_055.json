    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a community of 200 people, at least 3 share the same birthday?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least 3 people sharing the same birthday, we will find the probability that no more than 2 people share the same birthday and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's first find the probability that no one shares a birthday (all 200 people have different birthdays). There are 365 days in a year, so the probability for the first person is 365/365, for the second person it's 364/365 (since we don't want them to have the same birthday as the first person), for the third person it's 363/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability that all 200 people have different birthdays is:\n\nP(all different) = (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (166/365)\n\nNow, let's find the probability that exactly 2 people share a birthday and the rest have different birthdays. We need to choose 2 people out of 200 to have the same birthday, which can be done in C(200, 2) ways (combinations). Then, we need to assign a birthday to this pair, which can be done in 365 ways. The remaining 198 people should have different birthdays, which can be done in P(364, 198) ways (permutations). The total number of ways to assign birthdays to 200 people is 365^200.\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 people share a birthday is:\n\nP(exactly 2) = (C(200, 2) * 365 * P(364, 198)) / 365^200\n\nNow, we can find the probability that no more than 2 people share a birthday:\n\nP(no more than 2) = P(all different) + P(exactly 2)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that at least 3 people share a birthday:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - P(no more than 2)\n\nCalculating these probabilities numerically:\n\nP(all different) ≈ 0.000029\nP(exactly 2) ≈ 0.0017\nP(no more than 2) ≈ 0.001729\nP(at least 3) ≈ 1 - 0.001729 ≈ 0.998271\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 people share the same birthday in a community of 200 people is approximately 99.83%."
