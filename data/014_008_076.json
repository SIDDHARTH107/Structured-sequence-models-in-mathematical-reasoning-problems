    "message_1": "A block cipher encrypts data in blocks of fixed size. Suppose you have a block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks and uses a secret key of size 128 bits. If you want to encrypt a message of length 512 bits, how many blocks of ciphertext will be generated?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of blocks of ciphertext that will be generated, you need to divide the message length by the block size.\n\nMessage length: 512 bits\nBlock size: 64 bits\n\nNumber of blocks = Message length / Block size = 512 bits / 64 bits = 8 blocks\n\nSo, 8 blocks of ciphertext will be generated."
