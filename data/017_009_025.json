    "message_2": "There seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. All groups of order 9 are abelian, so there is no non-abelian group of order 9. Let's prove that all groups of order 9 are abelian.\n\nLet G be a group of order 9. Since 9 = 3^2, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 â‰¡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 9\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. Let's denote this 3-Sylow subgroup by H. Since |H| = 9, we have H = G. Since G is a p-group (p is a prime number), G must be abelian.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_3 = 3. In this case, there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, each of order 3. Let's denote them by H_1, H_2, and H_3. Since the order of each 3-Sylow subgroup is 3, they are all cyclic and isomorphic to C3, the cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNotice that the intersection of any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups must be trivial, i.e., contain only the identity element. This is because if there is a non-identity element in the intersection, then the intersection would have at least two elements, which would imply that the intersection is a subgroup of order 3. But this would contradict the fact that the 3-Sylow subgroups are distinct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of elements in the union of the three 3-Sylow subgroups. Each 3-Sylow subgroup has 3 elements, but since their pairwise intersections are trivial, we have to subtract the identity element twice (once for each pair of subgroups). So, the total number of elements in the union is 3 * 3 - 2 = 7.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, because G has 9 elements, and we have only accounted for 7 of them. Therefore, the assumption that n_3 = 3 must be false, and we are left with the only possibility that n_3 = 1.\n\nAs we have shown earlier, if n_3 = 1, then G is abelian. Thus, all groups of order 9 are abelian, and there is no non-abelian group of order 9."
