    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of smaller tetrahedra needed to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron up to the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nFor the 3rd iteration, we can plug in n = 3 into the formula:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = (4^3 - 1) / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = (64 - 1) / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = 63 / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = 21\n\nSo, 21 smaller tetrahedra are needed to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron after the 3rd iteration."
