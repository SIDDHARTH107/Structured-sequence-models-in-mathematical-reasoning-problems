    "message_2": "Let G be a group with the property that the order of its elements divides 12. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must be a divisor of the order of G. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nNow, let's consider the three groups mentioned: the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, and the dihedral group D6.\n\n1. Cyclic group C12: This group has 12 elements, generated by a single element of order 12. The orders of the elements in C12 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}, which are all divisors of 12. Therefore, G could be isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. Alternating group A4: This group has 12 elements and is the group of even permutations of 4 elements. The orders of the elements in A4 are {1, 2, 3}, which are all divisors of 12. Therefore, G could be isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. Dihedral group D6: This group has 12 elements and is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon. The orders of the elements in D6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}, which are all divisors of 12. Therefore, G could be isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group such that the order of its elements divides 12, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
