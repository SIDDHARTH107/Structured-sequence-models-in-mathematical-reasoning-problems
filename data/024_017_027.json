Determine the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 1, 0, 0\\rangle$ along the curved path $C(t)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 1, 0, 0\\rangle$ along the curved path $C(t) = (4\\cos(t), 4\\sin(t), 3t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ of the curve $C(t)$.\n\nThe tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ is given by the derivative of the curve $C(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\mathbf{T}(t) = \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\left\\langle -4\\sin(t), 4\\cos(t), 3 \\right\\rangle$.\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport equation for the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ along the curve $C(t)$. The parallel transport equation is given by:\n\n$\\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{T}(t)} \\mathbf{v}$.\n\nHere, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{T}(t)} \\mathbf{v}$ is the covariant derivative of $\\mathbf{v}$ in the direction of the tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$. Since $\\mathbf{v}$ is a constant vector, its covariant derivative is zero:\n\n$\\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{T}(t)} \\mathbf{v} = 0$.\n\nThis means that the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is parallel transported along the curve $C(t)$ without changing its direction or magnitude. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 1, 0, 0\\rangle$ along the curved path $C(t) = (4\\cos(t), 4\\sin(t), 3t)$ is simply the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ itself:\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{parallel transport}} = \\langle 1, 0, 0\\rangle$."
