    "message_1": "A committee consisting of 4 members is to be formed from a group of 8 students. How many different committees can be formed if 2 of the 8 students cannot be on the same committee? Use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary counting method, which involves finding the total number of possible committees without any restrictions and then subtracting the number of committees that include the two students who cannot be on the same committee.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible committees without any restrictions. This can be found using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (8 in this case) and k is the number of students to be chosen for the committee (4 in this case).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1)\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo there are 70 possible committees without any restrictions.\n\nNow, let's find the number of committees that include the two students who cannot be on the same committee. Since these two students must be on the committee, we only need to choose 2 more students from the remaining 6 students.\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!4!)\nC(6, 2) = (6*5) / (2*1)\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nSo there are 15 committees that include the two students who cannot be on the same committee.\n\nNow, we can use the complementary counting method to find the number of committees that can be formed without the two students being on the same committee:\n\nTotal committees - Committees with both students = Valid committees\n70 - 15 = 55\n\nTherefore, there are 55 different committees that can be formed without the two students being on the same committee."
