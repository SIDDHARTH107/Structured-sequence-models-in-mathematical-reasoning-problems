    "message_2": "Since G has order 10, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be a subgroup of order 5 and K be a subgroup of order 2. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H must be cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Similarly, K must be cyclic and isomorphic to C2.\n\nNow, let h be a generator of H and k be a generator of K. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, by the Lagrange's theorem, the order of hk must be the product of the orders of h and k, which is 10. Thus, G has an element of order 10, and we can denote it as g. So, G = ⟨g⟩.\n\nWe can now construct the group table for G. Let G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, k, kg, kg^2, kg^3, kg^4}. The table will look like this:\n\n```\n   | e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  k  kg  kg^2  kg^3  kg^4\n----------------------------------------------\ne  | e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  k  kg  kg^2  kg^3  kg^4\ng  | g  g^2  g^3  g^4  e  kg  kg^2  kg^3  kg^4  k\ng^2| g^2  g^3  g^4  e  g  kg^2  kg^3  kg^4  k  kg\ng^3| g^3  g^4  e  g  g^2  kg^3  kg^4  k  kg  kg^2\ng^4| g^4  e  g  g^2  g^3  kg^4  k  kg  kg^2  kg^3\nk  | k  kg  kg^2  kg^3  kg^4  e  g  g^2  g^3  g^4\nkg | kg  kg^2  kg^3  kg^4  k  g  g^2  g^3  g^4  e\nkg^2| kg^2  kg^3  kg^4  k  kg  g^2  g^3  g^4  e  g\nkg^3| kg^3  kg^4  k  kg  kg^2  g^3  g^4  e  g  g^2\nkg^4| kg^4  k  kg  kg^2  kg^3  g^4  e  g  g^2  g^3\n```\n\nNow, we need to prove that G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10. Since G is not isomorphic to C10, it must be non-abelian. We know that G has a subgroup of order 5, H, and a subgroup of order 2, K. Since H is normal in G (as the index of H in G is 2), we have that G is the semidirect product of H and K, denoted as G = H ⋊ K.\n\nThe only non-trivial automorphism of H is inversion, which sends each element to its inverse. Since K is isomorphic to C2, it has two possible actions on H: the trivial action (which would make G the direct product of H and K, and thus isomorphic to C10) and the non-trivial action, which is inversion.\n\nSince G is not isomorphic to C10, K must act on H by inversion. Therefore, G is the semidirect product of H and K with K acting on H by inversion. This uniquely defines the non-abelian group of order 10, and thus G must be isomorphic to it."
