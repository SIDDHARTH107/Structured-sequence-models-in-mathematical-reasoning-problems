    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a curve. The length of the Dragon Curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (2^(n-1))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(6-1))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve after six iterations is 32 units."
