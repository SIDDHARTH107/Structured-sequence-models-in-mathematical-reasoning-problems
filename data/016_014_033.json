    "message_1": "Suppose a Lévy C curve starts at point (0,0) and ends at point (4,4), and in each iteration, the curve is scaled down by a factor of 2. What is the total length of the curve after 5 iterations?",
    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. The initial length of the curve is the distance between the starting and ending points, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates: √((4-0)^2 + (4-0)^2) = √(16+16) = √32.\n\nIn each iteration, the curve is scaled down by a factor of 2, but the number of segments in the curve doubles. Therefore, the total length of the curve after each iteration increases by a factor of √2.\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the length of the curve will be (√32) * (√2)^5 = (√32) * (2^(5/2)) = (√32) * (√32) = 32.\n\nSo, the total length of the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations is 32."
