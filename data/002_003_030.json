    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 5 centimeters. Find its surface area.",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of a cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 faces).\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself. In this case, the side length is 5 centimeters.\n\nArea of one face = side length × side length = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by 6 to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6 × area of one face = 6 × 25 square centimeters = 150 square centimeters.\n\nSo, the surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
