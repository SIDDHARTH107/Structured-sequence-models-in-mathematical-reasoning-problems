    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B and then find the intersection of A and the result. Next, find the symmetric difference of B and A and then find the intersection of B and the result. Show that the order of the intersection result is different in the two cases, thus proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and the result:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = A ∩ {1, 4} = {1}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A:\n\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B and the result:\n\nB ∩ (B ∆ A) = B ∩ {1, 4} = {4}\n\nWe can see that the order of the intersection result is different in the two cases:\n\nA ∩ (A ∆ B) = {1} ≠ {4} = B ∩ (B ∆ A)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
