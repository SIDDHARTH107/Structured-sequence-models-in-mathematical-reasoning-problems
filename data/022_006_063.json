    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the circle |z - 1| = 2, we first rewrite the function f(z) in terms of z - 1:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1)^2\n\nNow, let w = z - 1. Then, |w| = 2, and we have:\n\nf(z) = w^2\n\nWe want to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| = |w^2| on the circle |w| = 2.\n\nBy the Maximum Modulus Principle, the maximum value of |f(z)| occurs on the boundary of the circle |w| = 2. Since |w| = 2, we have:\n\n|f(z)| = |w^2| = |(2e^(iθ))^2| = |4e^(2iθ)| = 4\n\nSo, the maximum value of |f(z)| is 4.\n\nBy the Minimum Modulus Principle, the minimum value of |f(z)| occurs in the interior of the circle |w| = 2. However, since f(z) = w^2, the function f(z) is not analytic at w = 0. Therefore, the minimum value of |f(z)| must also occur on the boundary of the circle |w| = 2. In this case, we can find the minimum value by considering the points where the derivative of f(z) vanishes:\n\nf'(z) = 2(z - 1)\n\nSetting f'(z) = 0, we get z = 1. However, this point is not on the circle |z - 1| = 2. Therefore, the minimum value of |f(z)| must occur at the point where the circle |z - 1| = 2 intersects the real axis. This occurs at z = -1 and z = 3. Evaluating f(z) at these points, we get:\n\nf(-1) = (-1 - 1)^2 = 4\nf(3) = (3 - 1)^2 = 4\n\nSo, the minimum value of |f(z)| is also 4.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| on the circle |z - 1| = 2 are both 4."
