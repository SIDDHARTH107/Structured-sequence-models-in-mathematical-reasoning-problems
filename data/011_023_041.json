    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nFor a complete graph with 8 vertices, you would need 8-1=7 colors. This is because, in a complete graph, each vertex is adjacent to all other vertices, so each vertex must have a unique color.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete, the number of colors needed could be less than 7. The minimum number of colors needed for a graph is determined by its chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors needed."
