    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after any number of iterations. It remains constant, regardless of the number of iterations. To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each line segment is divided into 4 new segments of equal length, so N = 4. The scaling factor is 3, as each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the number of iterations."
