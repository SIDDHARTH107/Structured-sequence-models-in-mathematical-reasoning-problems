    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x - 1, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x).\n\nUsing the power rule, the first derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x - 1) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 12x^2 + 2) = 36x^2 - 24x\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x - 1 is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 24x."
