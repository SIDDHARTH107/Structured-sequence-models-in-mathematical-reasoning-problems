    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set y = x^2 equal to y = 2x - 3:\n\nx^2 = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)² - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 12)) / 2\nx = (2 ± √(-8)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b² - 4ac) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that the two curves do not intersect, and there is no bounded area between them."
