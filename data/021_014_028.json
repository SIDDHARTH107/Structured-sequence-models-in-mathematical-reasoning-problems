    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute code or run algorithms in real-time. However, I can guide you through the process of solving the optimization problem using genetic algorithms.\n\n1. Representation: Represent the solution (x) as a binary string of a fixed length, say 10 bits. This will give us a precision of 2^(-10) = 0.0009765625.\n\n2. Population: Initialize a population of N random solutions (binary strings) within the range of 0 to 5.\n\n3. Fitness function: Define a fitness function to evaluate the quality of each solution. In this case, the fitness function can be f(x) = x(5-x).\n\n4. Selection: Select pairs of solutions (parents) from the population based on their fitness. You can use methods like roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, or rank selection.\n\n5. Crossover: Apply a crossover operator on the selected parents to create offspring. One-point, two-point, or uniform crossover can be used.\n\n6. Mutation: Apply a mutation operator on the offspring with a certain probability (mutation rate) to introduce diversity in the population. You can flip a random bit in the binary string.\n\n7. Replacement: Replace the least fit individuals in the population with the offspring.\n\n8. Termination: Repeat steps 4 to 7 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a desired level of fitness.\n\n9. Solution: The best individual in the final population will represent the approximate maximum value of the function f(x) = x(5-x).\n\nNote that the genetic algorithm is a heuristic method and may not always find the exact maximum value. However, it can provide a good approximation. For this specific problem, you can also solve it analytically by finding the critical points of the function and determining the maximum value."
