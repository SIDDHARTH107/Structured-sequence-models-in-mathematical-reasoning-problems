    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2. This will give us:\n\n4x + 6y = 22 (1st equation multiplied by 2)\n4x - 5y = -13 (2nd equation)\n\nNow, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 22 - (-13)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n11y = 35\n\nNow, we will solve for y by dividing both sides by 11:\n\ny = 35 / 11\ny = 3.1818 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either the first or second equation to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(3.1818) = 11\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 9.5454 = 11\n\nNow, we will solve for x by subtracting 9.5454 from both sides:\n\n2x = 1.4546\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 1.4546 / 2\nx = 0.7273 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 0.7273\ny = 3.1818"
