    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 4, we will use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we will plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use a substitution method. Let u = 1 + (9/4)x, then du/dx = 9/4, and dx = (4/9)du.\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nWhen x = 0, u = 1 + (9/4)(0) = 1\nWhen x = 4, u = 1 + (9/4)(4) = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] sqrt(u) * (4/9) du\n\nL = (4/9) ∫[1, 10] u^(1/2) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 10]\n\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * (10*sqrt(10) - 1)\n\nL ≈ 12.96\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 0 to x = 4 is approximately 12.96."
