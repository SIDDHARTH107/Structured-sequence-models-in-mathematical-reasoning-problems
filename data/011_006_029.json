    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations with repetitions. Since the fruits are identical, we only need to consider the number of each type of fruit we choose.\n\nLet's use the variables A, B, and O to represent the number of apples, bananas, and oranges we select, respectively. We want to find the number of solutions to the equation:\n\nA + B + O = 6\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n0 ≤ A ≤ 5 (since there are 5 apples)\n0 ≤ B ≤ 4 (since there are 4 bananas)\n0 ≤ O ≤ 3 (since there are 3 oranges)\n\nWe can solve this using generating functions or by simply listing out the possible combinations.\n\n1.
