    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 96: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Find all possible abelian invariants for the group: (2^5, 3^1), (2^4, 2, 3), (2^3, 2^2, 3), (2^2, 2^2, 2, 3), (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3)\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, and n and m are their respective powers: \n   G(p^n * q^m) = (p^(2n) - p^n) * (q^(2m) - q^m) / (p^n - p^(n-1)) * (q^m - q^(m-1))\n4. Calculate the number of non-isomorphic groups for each abelian invariant:\n   - G(2^5 * 3^1) = (2^10 - 2^5) * (3^2 - 3^1) / (2^5 - 2^4) * (3^1 - 3^0) = 16\n   - G(2^4 * 2 * 3) = (2^8 - 2^4) * (3^2 - 3^1) / (2^4 - 2^3) * (3^1 - 3^0) = 7\n   - G(2^3 * 2^2 * 3) = (2^6 - 2^3) * (3^2 - 3^1) / (2^3 - 2^2) * (3^1 - 3^0) = 3\n   - G(2^2 * 2^2 * 2 * 3) = (2^4 - 2^2) * (3^2 - 3^1) / (2^2 - 2^1) * (3^1 - 3^0) = 1\n   - G(2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3) = (2^2 - 2^1) * (3^2 - 3^1) / (2^1 - 2^0) * (3^1 - 3^0) = 1\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 is 16 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 28.\n\nThe corresponding group structures can be found by examining each abelian invariant and the possible combinations of cyclic groups that can be formed. For example, for the abelian invariant (2^5, 3^1), the group structure would be C_32 x C_3, where C_n denotes a cyclic group of order n. Similarly, for the abelian invariant (2^4, 2, 3), the group structures would be C_16 x C_2 x C_3, C_8 x C_4 x C_3, and so on.\n\nListing all 28 group structures is beyond the scope of this answer, but they can be found by exploring the possible combinations of cyclic groups for each abelian invariant."
