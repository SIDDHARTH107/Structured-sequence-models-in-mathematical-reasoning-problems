    "message_2": "1. $\\varphi_1(x) = \\exists y(x=y+y)$: This formula states that there exists a natural number $y$ such that $x = y + y$. This is true for all even numbers in $\\mathbb{N}$. However, it is not true for odd numbers, as they cannot be expressed as the sum of two equal natural numbers. Therefore, $\\varphi_1$ is not true in $\\mathbb{N}$ for all $x$.\n\n2. $\\varphi_2(x) = \\forall y(x \\neq y)$: This formula states that for all natural numbers $y$, $x$ is not equal to $y$. This is false in $\\mathbb{N}$, as for any natural number $x$, there exists a natural number $y$ such that $x = y$ (specifically, when $x = y$).\n\n3. $\\varphi_3(x) = x \\neq 0$: This formula states that $x$ is not equal to 0. This is false in $\\mathbb{N}$, as 0 is a natural number and there exists an $x$ such that $x = 0$.\n\n4. $\\varphi_4(x) = \\neg \\exists y(x = y \\cdot y)$: This formula states that there does not exist a natural number $y$ such that $x = y \\cdot y$. This is true for all prime numbers and some composite numbers in $\\mathbb{N}$, as they cannot be expressed as the square of a natural number. However, it is not true for perfect squares (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...), as they can be expressed as the square of a natural number. Therefore, $\\varphi_4$ is not true in $\\mathbb{N}$ for all $x$."
