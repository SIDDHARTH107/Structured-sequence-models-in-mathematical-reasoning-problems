    "message_2": "To find the total number of line segments in a Vicsek fractal of order 3, we need to understand how the number of line segments increases with each order.\n\nA Vicsek fractal starts with a square grid. In order 0, there is just a single square, which has 4 line segments.\n\nFor order 1, each line segment of the order 0 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 4 line segments in the order 0 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 4 * 4 = 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal.\n\nFor order 2, each line segment of the order 1 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 16 line segments in the order 1 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 16 * 4 = 64 line segments in the order 2 fractal.\n\nFor order 3, each line segment of the order 2 fractal is replaced by a smaller copy of the entire fractal. Since there are 64 line segments in the order 2 fractal, and each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller line segments, there are 64 * 4 = 256 line segments in the order 3 fractal.\n\nSo, the total number of line segments in a Vicsek fractal of order 3 is 256."
