    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has $100,000 to invest and wants to create a portfolio consisting of two assets, asset A and asset B. Asset A has an expected return of 8% and a standard deviation of 12%, while asset B has an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 15%. The correlation between the two assets is 0.4. What is the optimal allocation of funds between the two assets to minimize the portfolio risk?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation of funds between the two assets to minimize the portfolio risk, we need to calculate the minimum variance portfolio. The minimum variance portfolio is the portfolio with the lowest possible risk, given the assets' standard deviations and correlation.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the investment in asset A, and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in asset B. The portfolio variance (σ²) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσ² = (x * σ_A)² + ((1-x) * σ_B)² + 2 * x * (1-x) * σ_A * σ_B * ρ_AB\n\nwhere σ_A and σ_B are the standard deviations of asset A and asset B, respectively, and ρ_AB is the correlation between the two assets.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nσ² = (x * 0.12)² + ((1-x) * 0.15)² + 2 * x * (1-x) * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4\n\nTo minimize the portfolio risk, we need to find the value of x that minimizes the portfolio variance. To do this, we can take the derivative of the variance equation with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(σ²)/dx = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n0 = 2 * 0.12² * x - 2 * 0.15² * x + 2 * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4 - 2 * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4 * x\n\n0 = x * (2 * 0.12² - 2 * 0.15² - 2 * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4) + 2 * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4\n\nx = (2 * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4) / (2 * 0.12² - 2 * 0.15² + 2 * 0.12 * 0.15 * 0.4)\n\nx ≈ 0.573\n\nSo, the optimal allocation of funds to minimize the portfolio risk is approximately 57.3% in asset A and 42.7% in asset B. In terms of the initial investment of $100,000, this would mean investing $57,300 in asset A and $42,700 in asset B."
