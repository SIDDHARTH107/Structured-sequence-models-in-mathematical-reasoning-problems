    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions of the diophantine equation 2x + 5y = 13, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients (2 and 5) divides the constant term (13). In this case, the GCD of 2 and 5 is 1, which divides 13. So, there will be integer solutions.\n\n2. Find a particular solution. We can do this by using the extended Euclidean algorithm or by trial and error. Let's use trial and error:\n\n   For y = 0, 2x = 13, which doesn't yield an integer solution for x.\n   For y = 1, 2x = 13 - 5 = 8, which gives x = 4.\n   So, one particular solution is (x, y) = (4, 1).\n\n3. Express the general solution. Since the GCD of 2 and 5 is 1, the general solution can be expressed as:\n\n   x = x0 + 5t\n   y = y0 - 2t\n\n   where (x0, y0) is the particular solution we found, and t is an integer.\n\n4. Substitute the particular solution into the general solution:\n\n   x = 4 + 5t\n   y = 1 - 2t\n\n5. Now, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different values of t:\n\n   For t = 0, (x, y) = (4, 1)\n   For t = 1, (x, y) = (9, -1)\n   For t = -1, (x, y) = (-1, 3)\n   And so on...\n\nSo, the general integer solution for the diophantine equation 2x + 5y = 13 is given by:\n\n   x = 4 + 5t\n   y = 1 - 2t\n\nwhere t is an integer."
