    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to produce a product using two different machines: machine X can produce 4 units per hour and machine Y can produce 5 units per hour. However, machine X can only be used at most 8 hours per day while machine Y can be used up to 10 hours per day. Each unit produced using machine X is sold for $10 and each unit produced using machine Y is sold for $12. If the company wants to maximize their daily profit, how many units of each machine should they use?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of hours machine X is used as x and the number of hours machine Y is used as y. We know that:\n\nx ≤ 8 (machine X can be used at most 8 hours per day)\ny ≤ 10 (machine Y can be used up to 10 hours per day)\n\nThe total number of units produced by machine X is 4x, and the total number of units produced by machine Y is 5y. The revenue generated by machine X is 10(4x) = 40x, and the revenue generated by machine Y is 12(5y) = 60y.\n\nThe company wants to maximize their daily profit, which is the sum of the revenues generated by both machines. So, the objective function to maximize is:\n\nP = 40x + 60y\n\nSince we want to maximize the profit, we will use the constraints to find the maximum value of the objective function.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when machine X is used for the maximum allowed time (8 hours):\n\nx = 8\nP = 40(8) + 60y = 320 + 60y\n\nNow, let's consider the case when machine Y is used for the maximum allowed time (10 hours):\n\ny = 10\nP = 40x + 60(10) = 40x + 600\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the combination of x and y that gives the highest value of P. Since machine Y generates more revenue per hour, it makes sense to use it for the maximum allowed time (10 hours). \n\nNow we need to find the value of x that maximizes the profit when y = 10:\n\nP = 40x + 600\n\nSince machine X can be used for at most 8 hours, we can try using it for the full 8 hours:\n\nx = 8\nP = 40(8) + 600 = 920\n\nSo, the maximum daily profit is $920, which is achieved when machine X is used for 8 hours and machine Y is used for 10 hours. In this case, machine X produces 4 * 8 = 32 units, and machine Y produces 5 * 10 = 50 units."
