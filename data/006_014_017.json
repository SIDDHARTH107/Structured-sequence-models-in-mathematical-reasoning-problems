    "message_1": "A system has 5 independent components, and each component has a probability of failing of 0.2. What is the probability that at least two components will fail?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least two components will fail, we can first find the probabilities of the complementary events (i.e., 0, 1, or all components failing) and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1.\n\nLet's denote the probability of failure as p = 0.2 and the probability of not failing as q = 1 - p = 0.8.\n\n1. Probability of 0 components failing (all components working): \nThis is simply the probability that all components do not fail, which is q^5 = 0.8^5.\n\n2. Probability of 1 component failing (4 components working): \nWe can use the binomial probability formula for this case: C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n-k), where n is the total number of components, k is the number of components failing, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k failures from n components.\n\nFor 1 component failing, we have C(5, 1) * p^1 * q^4 = 5 * 0.2^1 * 0.8^4.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the probabilities of these complementary events and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(at least 2 components failing) = 1 - [P(0 components failing) + P(1 component failing)]\n\nP(at least 2 components failing) = 1 - [0.8^5 + 5 * 0.2^1 * 0.8^4]\n\nP(at least 2 components failing) ≈ 1 - [0.32768 + 5 * 0.2 * 0.4096]\n\nP(at least 2 components failing) ≈ 1 - [0.32768 + 0.4096]\n\nP(at least 2 components failing) ≈ 1 - 0.73728\n\nP(at least 2 components failing) ≈ 0.26272\n\nSo, the probability that at least two components will fail is approximately 0.26272 or 26.27%."
