    "message_1": "A group of 8 friends wants to travel together and visit each other's houses. They have a list of 12 possible houses they can visit. Assuming that any set of 3 friends can visit 1 house at a time, how many different ways can the 8 friends split into groups to visit all 12 houses?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to divide the 8 friends into groups of 3 and then assign those groups to the 12 houses.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to divide the 8 friends into groups of 3. We can use the combination formula for this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (the number of friends) and k = 3 (the size of each group). So, we have:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = 56\n\nNow, we have 56 different ways to form a group of 3 friends. However, we need to divide the remaining 5 friends into groups of 3 and 2. We can use the combination formula again:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = 10\n\nNow, we have 56 ways to form the first group of 3 friends and 10 ways to form the second group of 3 friends. We multiply these two numbers to find the total number of ways to divide the 8 friends into groups of 3 and 2:\n\n56 * 10 = 560\n\nNow, we need to assign these groups to the 12 houses. We can use the permutation formula for this:\n\nP(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (the number of houses) and k = 2 (the number of groups). So, we have:\n\nP(12, 2) = 12! / (12-2)! = 12! / 10! = 132\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to divide the friends into groups (560) by the number of ways to assign the groups to the houses (132):\n\n560 * 132 = 73,920\n\nSo, there are 73,920 different ways for the 8 friends to split into groups and visit all 12 houses."
