    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + y' - 6y = 0, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + r - 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(r + 3)(r - 2) = 0\n\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are r1 = -3 and r2 = 2. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = C1 * e^(-3t) + C2 * e^(2t)\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions to find the particular solution:\n\n1. y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = C1 * e^(0) + C2 * e^(0)\n1 = C1 + C2\n\n2. y'(0) = 0:\n\nTo find y'(t), we differentiate y(t) with respect to t:\n\ny'(t) = -3 * C1 * e^(-3t) + 2 * C2 * e^(2t)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition y'(0) = 0:\n\n0 = -3 * C1 * e^(0) + 2 * C2 * e^(0)\n0 = -3 * C1 + 2 * C2\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\nC1 + C2 = 1\n-3C1 + 2C2 = 0\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nC1 = 1/5\nC2 = 4/5\n\nThus, the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions is:\n\ny(t) = (1/5) * e^(-3t) + (4/5) * e^(2t)"
