The distance (in kilometers) between each building is given in the following adjacency matrix:\n\n  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n--|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n1 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 |\n2 | 4 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 11| 0 |\n3 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n4 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 9 | 14| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 10| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n6 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 14| 10| 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |\n7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 6 |\n8 | 8 | 11| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 7 |\n9 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 7 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the minimum length of fiber optic cables needed to connect all the buildings in the city?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum length of fiber optic cables needed to connect all the buildings in the city, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Both algorithms are used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges.\n\nHere, I will use Prim's algorithm:\n\n1. Start with an empty set of edges (the minimum spanning tree).\n2. Choose an arbitrary vertex (let's choose vertex 1).\n3. Find the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the minimum spanning tree to a vertex not in the minimum spanning tree.\n4. Add that edge to the minimum spanning tree.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all vertices are included in the minimum spanning tree.\n\nFollowing Prim's algorithm:\n\n1. Start with vertex 1.\n2. The smallest edge is (1, 2) with a weight of 4. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n3. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1 or 2 is (2, 3) with a weight of 8. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n4. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1, 2, or 3 is (3, 9) with a weight of 2. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n5. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, or 9 is (3, 6) with a weight of 4. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n6. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 6, or 9 is (6, 7) with a weight of 2. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n7. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, or 9 is (7, 8) with a weight of 1. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n8. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, or 9 is (4, 3) with a weight of 7. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n9. The smallest edge connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 is (4, 5) with a weight of 9. Add it to the minimum spanning tree.\n\nNow all vertices are included in the minimum spanning tree. The edges in the minimum spanning tree are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 9), (3, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (4, 3), and (4, 5). The sum of the weights of these edges is 4 + 8 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 9 = 37.\n\nSo, the minimum length of fiber optic cables needed to connect all the buildings in the city is 37 kilometers."
