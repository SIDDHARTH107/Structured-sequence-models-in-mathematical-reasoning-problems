    "message_2": "In type theory, a function from a set A with 4 elements to a set B with 3 elements can be represented as a mapping from each element in A to an element in B. Since there are 3 elements in B, each element in A can be mapped to any of the 3 elements in B.\n\nTo find the total number of possible functions, we can use the formula:\n\n(number of elements in B)^(number of elements in A)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n3^4 = 81\n\nSo there are 81 possible functions from a set A with 4 elements to a set B with 3 elements according to type theory."
