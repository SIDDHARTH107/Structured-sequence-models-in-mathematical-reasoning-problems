    "message_2": "To find the value of the 100th term in this sequence, we first need to determine the pattern of the differences between successive terms. Let's look at the differences between each term:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n9 - 5 = 4\n14 - 9 = 5\n20 - 14 = 6\n\nThe differences between successive terms are increasing by 1 each time. This indicates that the sequence is a quadratic sequence. We can represent this sequence using the formula:\n\nan = a + (n - 1)d + (n - 1)(n - 2)e/2\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a is the first term, d is the common difference, and e is the second difference (the difference between the differences).\n\nIn this case, a = 2, d = 3, and e = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nan = 2 + (n - 1)3 + (n - 1)(n - 2)1/2\n\nNow, we want to find the value of the 100th term (n = 100). Plugging n = 100 into the formula, we get:\n\na100 = 2 + (100 - 1)3 + (100 - 1)(100 - 2)1/2\na100 = 2 + 99 * 3 + 99 * 98 * 1/2\na100 = 2 + 297 + 99 * 49\na100 = 2 + 297 + 4851\na100 = 5150\n\nSo, the value of the 100th term in this sequence is 5150."
