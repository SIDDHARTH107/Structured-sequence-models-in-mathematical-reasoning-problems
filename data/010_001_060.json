    "message_2": "The closure of a set A in a topological space (X, τ) is the smallest closed set containing A. A closed set is a set whose complement (relative to X) is open in τ.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of A in X. Since A = {a, b}, the complement of A is X - A = {c, d}.\n\nNow, let's check if the complement of A is open in τ. Since {c, d} is not an element of τ, the complement of A is not open. Therefore, A is not closed.\n\nTo find the closure of A, we need to find the smallest closed set containing A. We can do this by taking the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n\nClosed sets containing A are those whose complements are open sets in τ that do not contain a or b. The open sets in τ that do not contain a or b are {∅, {c}}. The complements of these open sets are {a, b, c, d} and {a, b, d}, respectively. \n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these closed sets: {a, b, c, d} ∩ {a, b, d} = {a, b, d}.\n\nSo, the closure of the set A = {a, b} is {a, b, d}."
