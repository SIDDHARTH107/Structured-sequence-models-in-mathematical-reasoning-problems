    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nIn this case, we have a straight wire with a current of 10 A. We want to find the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm (0.02 m) from the center of the wire. We can use a circular loop with a radius of 0.02 m as our path for the line integral.\n\nAmpere's Law can be written as:\n\n∮B * dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a straight wire, the magnetic field (B) is constant along the circular path, so we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nThe closed line integral of dl around the circular path is just the circumference of the circle:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field (B):\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The current enclosed by the loop is the same as the current in the wire, which is 10 A. The distance from the center of the wire is 0.02 m.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 10 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = 100π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire is approximately 100π × 10^(-6) T, or around 3.14 × 10^(-4) T."
