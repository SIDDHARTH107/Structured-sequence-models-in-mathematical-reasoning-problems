    "message_2": "To find the Ricci curvature of a sphere of radius 5, we first need to find the metric tensor for the sphere. The metric tensor for a sphere of radius R in spherical coordinates (θ, φ) is given by:\n\ng = diag(R^2, R^2 * sin^2(θ))\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols, which are given by:\n\nΓ^i_jk = 1/2 * g^(il) * (∂g_lk/∂x^j + ∂g_lj/∂x^k - ∂g_jk/∂x^l)\n\nFor a sphere, the non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\nΓ^θ_θφ = -sin(θ) * cos(θ)\nΓ^θ_φθ = Γ^θ_φφ = cot(θ)\nΓ^φ_θθ = sin(θ) * cos(θ)\nΓ^φ_θφ = Γ^φ_φθ = cot(θ)\n\nNow, we can compute the Riemann curvature tensor, which is given by:\n\nR^i_jkl = ∂Γ^i_jl/∂x^k - ∂Γ^i_jk/∂x^l + Γ^i_mk * Γ^m_jl - Γ^i_ml * Γ^m_jk\n\nFor a sphere, the non-zero components of the Riemann curvature tensor are:\n\nR^θ_φθφ = R^φ_θφθ = R\n\nNow, we can compute the Ricci curvature tensor, which is given by:\n\nRic_jk = R^i_jik\n\nFor a sphere, the Ricci curvature tensor is:\n\nRic_θθ = R^θ_θθθ = R\nRic_φφ = R^φ_φφφ = R * sin^2(θ)\n\nFinally, we can compute the Ricci scalar, which is given by:\n\nRic = g^(jk) * Ric_jk\n\nFor a sphere, the Ricci scalar is:\n\nRic = 2/R^2\n\nNow, substituting the radius R = 5, we get:\n\nRic = 2/(5^2) = 2/25\n\nSo, the Ricci curvature at any point on the sphere of radius 5 is 2/25."
