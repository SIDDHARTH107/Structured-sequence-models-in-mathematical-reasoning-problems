    "message_2": "There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling the die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an even number) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = (3 even numbers) / (6 possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of rolling an even number on a fair six-sided die is 1/2 or 50%."
