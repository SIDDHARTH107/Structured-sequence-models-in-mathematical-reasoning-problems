    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = ax² + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: h = -b/(2a). In this case, a = 2 and b = 8.\n\nh = -8 / (2 * 2) = -8 / 4 = -2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate (h) back into the equation:\n\nk = 2(-2)² + 8(-2) - 3\nk = 2(4) - 16 - 3\nk = 8 - 16 - 3\nk = -11\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (-2, -11).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is x = h, which in this case is x = -2.\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² + 8x - 3\n\nWe can try to factor the equation, but it doesn't factor easily. So, we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-8 ± √(8² - 4 * 2 * -3)) / (2 * 2)\nx = (-8 ± √(64 + 24)) / 4\nx = (-8 ± √88) / 4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = (-8 + √88) / 4 and x = (-8 - √88) / 4.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)² + 8(0) - 3\ny = -3\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = -3.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Vertex: (-2, -11)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = -2\n- X-intercepts: x = (-8 + √88) / 4 and x = (-8 - √88) / 4\n- Y-intercept: y = -3"
