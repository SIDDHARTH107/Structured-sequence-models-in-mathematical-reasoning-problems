    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.03. If the company has 100 employees, what is the probability that at least 3 employees are involved in this type of fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (fraudulent employees) in n trials (employees), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.03), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.97).\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 3 employees being involved in fraud, so we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., 100 employees being involved in fraud and sum those probabilities. Alternatively, we can find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 employees being involved in fraud and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) - P(2)\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 employees:\n\nP(0) = C(100, 0) * (0.03)^0 * (0.97)^100 ≈ 0.047\nP(1) = C(100, 1) * (0.03)^1 * (0.97)^99 ≈ 0.235\nP(2) = C(100, 2) * (0.03)^2 * (0.97)^98 ≈ 0.367\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of at least 3 employees being involved in fraud:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - 0.047 - 0.235 - 0.367 ≈ 0.351\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 employees are involved in this type of fraud is approximately 0.351 or 35.1%."
