    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we need to integrate the given function with respect to x.\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 2x\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(3x^2 - 2x) dx\n\ny = ∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(2x) dx\n\nNow, we integrate each term:\n\ny = (3/3)x^3 - (2/2)x^2 + C\n\nSimplifying, we get the general solution:\n\ny = x^3 - x^2 + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
