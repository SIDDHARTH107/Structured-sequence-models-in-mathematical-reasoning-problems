    "message_2": "To solve the equation x^3 + 4x^2 - 7x - 10 = 0, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (10) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±5, and ±10.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 1 is a root, since (1)^3 + 4(1)^2 - 7(1) - 10 = 0. Now, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n1 |  1   4  -7 -10\n     |      1   5   2\n  -------------------\n       1   5  -2  -8\n```\n\nSo, the remaining quadratic factor is x^2 + 5x - 2. We can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 8)) / 2\n\nx = (-5 ± √33) / 2\n\nThus, the roots of the equation are x = 1, x = (-5 + √33) / 2, and x = (-5 - √33) / 2.\n\nTo graph the polynomial function, we can plot the roots on the x-axis and sketch the curve based on the behavior of the polynomial. Since the leading term is x^3, the function will have a similar shape to a cubic function. The graph will pass through the x-intercepts at x = 1, x = (-5 + √33) / 2, and x = (-5 - √33) / 2. The graph will start in the negative y direction for negative x values and end in the positive y direction for positive x values.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\ny\n|\n|                        *\n|                   *\n|               *\n|           *\n|      *\n| *\n|----------------------------- x\n|   *\n|      *\n|          *\n|             *\n|                *\n|\n```\n\nThe exact shape of the graph may vary, but this gives a general idea of the polynomial function's behavior on the x-y plane."
