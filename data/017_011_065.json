The dihedral group D_12 (symmetries of a regular 12-gon).\n3. The alternating group A_4 (even permutations of 4 elements).\n4. The direct product C_3 x C_4 (generated by an element of order 3 and an element of order 4).\n5. The direct product C_2 x C_2 x C_3 (generated by two elements of order 2 and one element of order 3).\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic, meaning they have different structures and cannot be mapped onto each other by a group isomorphism."
