    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific problem for a math student to solve on probability of a certain stock price change:\n\nSuppose that the daily percentage change in the price of a particular stock is normally distributed with a mean of 0.5% and a standard deviation of 1.2%. What is the probability that the stock will increase in value by more than 2.5% on any given day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Z-score formula to standardize the value we are interested in (2.5% increase) and then use the standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we are interested in (2.5% increase), μ is the mean (0.5%), and σ is the standard deviation (1.2%).\n\nZ = (2.5 - 0.5) / 1.2\nZ = 2 / 1.2\nZ ≈ 1.67\n\nNow that we have the Z-score, we can use the Z-table to find the probability. The Z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than the given Z-score. Since we want to find the probability that the stock will increase in value by more than 2.5%, we need to find the probability that the value is greater than the Z-score of 1.67.\n\nP(Z > 1.67) = 1 - P(Z < 1.67)\n\nLooking up the Z-score of 1.67 in the Z-table, we find that P(Z < 1.67) ≈ 0.9525.\n\nP(Z > 1.67) = 1 - 0.9525\nP(Z > 1.67) ≈ 0.0475\n\nSo, the probability that the stock will increase in value by more than 2.5% on any given day is approximately 4.75%."
