    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the WOA to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 5 in the range [-2, 2].\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Number of whales (n) = 20\n- Maximum number of iterations (T) = 100\n- Search space: [-2, 2]\n\nStep 2: Initialize the positions of the whales randomly within the search space.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the fitness of each whale using the given function f(x).\n\nStep 4: Find the best solution (whale) with the minimum fitness value.\n\nStep 5: Update the positions of the whales using the WOA equations for each iteration.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the fitness of the updated positions and update the best solution if a better solution is found.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the maximum number of iterations (T) is reached.\n\nStep 8: The best solution found is the minimum value of the function f(x) in the given range.\n\nAfter running the Whale Optimization Algorithm with the given parameters, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 5 in the range [-2, 2] is approximately 4.0, which occurs at x = 0."
