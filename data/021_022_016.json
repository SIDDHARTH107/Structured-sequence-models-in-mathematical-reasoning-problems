    "message_1": "A company produces two types of lamps, A and B. The profit per unit of lamp A is $10 and for lamp B it is $12. The company has a production capacity of 5000 units per month. To increase the profit, the company decides to use the Firefly algorithm to optimize its production. The algorithm must determine how many units of each lamp should be produced to maximize profit, given the following constraints:\n\n- Production capacity of 5000 units per month.\n- Lamp A takes 2 hours to produce, and Lamp B takes 3 hours to produce.\n- The production time available per month is 12000 hours.\n- A maximum of 2000 units of Lamp A can be sold per month, and a maximum of 2500 units of Lamp B can be sold per month.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can make per month using the Firefly algorithm? How many units of Lamp A and Lamp B should be produced to achieve this profit level?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Lamp A produced and y be the number of units of Lamp B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 12y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5000 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 12000 (production time constraint)\n3. x ≤ 2000 (maximum units of Lamp A that can be sold)\n4. y ≤ 2500 (maximum units of Lamp B that can be sold)\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we can use linear programming techniques. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 5000\n2. 2x + 3y = 12000\n3. x = 2000\n4. y = 2500\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where these lines intersect:\n\nA. (2000, 0)\nB. (2000, 2500)\nC. (0, 2500)\nD. (0, 4000)\nE. (2400, 2000)\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nA. P(2000, 0) = 10(2000) + 12(0) = $20,000\nB. P(2000, 2500) = 10(2000) + 12(2500) = $50,000\nC. P(0, 2500) = 10(0) + 12(2500) = $30,000\nD. P(0, 4000) is not feasible because it exceeds the production capacity constraint.\nE. P(2400, 2000) = 10(2400) + 12(2000) = $48,000\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at point B, where 2000 units of Lamp A and 2500 units of Lamp B are produced, resulting in a profit of $50,000 per month."
