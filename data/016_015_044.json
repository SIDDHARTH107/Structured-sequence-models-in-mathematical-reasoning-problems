In general, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (number of segments) × (length of one segment)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n, the number of segments is given by:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^n\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 4, the number of segments is:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^4 = 256\n\nGiven that one line segment has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4 is:\n\nLength = 256 × 1 = 256 units"
