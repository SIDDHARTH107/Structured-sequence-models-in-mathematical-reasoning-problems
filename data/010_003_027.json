Prove that Y is dense in X. \n\nHint: Use the property of Hausdorff spaces that for any two distinct points x, y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V containing x and y respectively.",
    "message_2": "To prove that Y is dense in X, we need to show that every open set in X intersects Y. In other words, for every open set U in X, there exists a point y in Y such that y is in U.\n\nLet U be an arbitrary open set in X. Since the closure of Y is equal to X, we know that every point in X is either in Y or a limit point of Y. \n\nNow, let x be an arbitrary point in U. If x is in Y, then we are done, as we have found a point in Y that is also in U. If x is not in Y, then x must be a limit point of Y. This means that every open neighborhood of x intersects Y. \n\nSince X is Hausdorff, for any two distinct points x, y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U_x and V_y containing x and y respectively. In particular, there exists an open set U_x containing x such that U_x is a subset of U. Since x is a limit point of Y, there exists a point y in Y such that y is in U_x. Since U_x is a subset of U, y is also in U.\n\nThus, for every open set U in X, we have found a point y in Y such that y is in U. This proves that Y is dense in X."
