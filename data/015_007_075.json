    "message_2": "To find the first three values of 𝑥𝑛, we will use the given equation and the initial values of 𝑟 and 𝑥₀:\n\n𝑥₀ = 0.5\n𝑟 = 3.5\n\nNow, we will calculate 𝑥₁, 𝑥₂, and 𝑥₃:\n\n1. 𝑥₁ = 𝑟(1 − 𝑥₀)𝑥₀\n𝑥₁ = 3.5(1 - 0.5)(0.5)\n𝑥₁ = 3.5(0.5)(0.5)\n𝑥₁ = 0.875\n\n2. 𝑥₂ = 𝑟(1 − 𝑥₁)𝑥₁\n𝑥₂ = 3.5(1 - 0.875)(0.875)\n𝑥₂ = 3.5(0.125)(0.875)\n𝑥₂ = 0.3828125\n\n3. 𝑥₃ = 𝑟(1 − 𝑥₂)𝑥₂\n𝑥₃ = 3.5(1 - 0.3828125)(0.3828125)\n𝑥₃ = 3.5(0.6171875)(0.3828125)\n𝑥₃ ≈ 0.827102\n\nSo, the first three values of 𝑥𝑛 are:\n\n𝑥₁ = 0.875\n𝑥₂ ≈ 0.3828125\n𝑥₃ ≈ 0.827102\n\nTo determine whether the map is converging or diverging to a fixed point, we can analyze the behavior of the sequence. If the values of 𝑥𝑛 are getting closer to a single value, then the map is converging. If the values are getting further apart or oscillating without settling down, then the map is diverging.\n\nIn this case, the values of 𝑥𝑛 are oscillating and not getting closer to a single value. Therefore, the map is diverging and not converging to a fixed point."
