    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 60 is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 60. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow p-subgroups for p = 2, 3, and 5. Let P_2, P_3, and P_5 be these subgroups, with orders 4, 3, and 5, respectively. Since they are unique, they are normal in G. The product P_2 * P_3 * P_5 has order 60, so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5. Since P_2, P_3, and P_5 are cyclic (being of prime order), G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 6 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let H be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Then, the order of the product P_3 * H is 15. Since P_3 is normal in G, the product is a normal subgroup of G. Now, consider the quotient group G / (P_3 * H). This group has order 4, so it is either isomorphic to C4 or C2 × C2. \n\nIf G / (P_3 * H) is isomorphic to C4, then G has a normal subgroup K of order 4. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_3 × K × H, which is a non-abelian group of order 60.\n\nIf G / (P_3 * H) is isomorphic to C2 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup K of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_3 × K × H, which is the alternating group A5 × C2.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 or 15 and n_3 = 10\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow p-subgroups for p = 2 and 3. By considering the action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, we can show that G has a normal subgroup of order 5 or 6. In either case, G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 60 is isomorphic to one of the following: a) cyclic group C60, b) alternating group A5 × C2, or c) one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. The group isomorphism that proves the result is given by the direct product decomposition of G in each case."
