    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nIn the given graph, we can see that it contains a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K3,3. The subgraph can be formed by choosing the following vertices: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The connections between these vertices form a complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices.\n\nA - D\nA - E\nA - F\nB - D\nB - E\nB - F\nC - D\nC - E\nC - F\n\nSince the graph contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3, it is non-planar according to Kuratowski's theorem."
