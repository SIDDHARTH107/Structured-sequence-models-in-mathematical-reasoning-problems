    "message_2": "To show that π1(X, x0) is abelian, we need to show that for any two loops α and β in X based at x0, their product α * β is equal to β * α, i.e., α * β = β * α.\n\nSince p is a covering map, we know that p_*: π1(X, x0) → π1(Y, y0) is a homomorphism. Let's consider the images of α and β under p, which are loops in Y based at y0:\n\np(α) = α'\np(β) = β'\n\nSince π1(Y, y0) is abelian, we have:\n\nα' * β' = β' * α'\n\nNow, let's lift these loops back to X using the covering map p. Since p is a covering map, there exist unique lifts of α' and β' to loops α_1 and β_1 in X based at x0 such that:\n\np(α_1) = α'\np(β_1) = β'\n\nNow, let's consider the products of these loops in X:\n\nα * β = α_1 * β_1\nβ * α = β_1 * α_1\n\nApplying the covering map p to both sides of these equations, we get:\n\np(α * β) = p(α_1 * β_1)\np(β * α) = p(β_1 * α_1)\n\nUsing the fact that p_* is a homomorphism, we can rewrite these equations as:\n\np(α) * p(β) = p(α_1) * p(β_1)\np(β) * p(α) = p(β_1) * p(α_1)\n\nSubstituting α' and β' for p(α) and p(β), we get:\n\nα' * β' = α' * β'\nβ' * α' = β' * α'\n\nSince π1(Y, y0) is abelian, we have α' * β' = β' * α'. Therefore, we have:\n\nα' * β' = β' * α'\n\nLifting back to X, we get:\n\nα_1 * β_1 = β_1 * α_1\n\nSince α_1 and β_1 are unique lifts of α' and β', we have:\n\nα * β = α_1 * β_1 = β_1 * α_1 = β * α\n\nThus, π1(X, x0) is abelian."
