    "message_2": "The fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFractal Dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4) and the scale is reduced by a factor of 3 (S = 3).\n\nSo, the fractal dimension (D) can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD ≈ 1.2619\n\nThe fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve when its scale is reduced by a factor of 3 is approximately 1.2619."
