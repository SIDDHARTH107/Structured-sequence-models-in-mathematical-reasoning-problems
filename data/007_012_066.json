If n = 1, then (n-1)! + 1 = 0! + 1 = 1. Since 1 is divisible by 1, n = 1 satisfies the condition.\n\nHowever, n = 1 is trivial, so let's find the next smallest positive integer.\n\n2. If n = 2, then (n-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 2. Since 2 is divisible by 2, n = 2 satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the smallest non-trivial positive integer n such that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n is n = 2."
