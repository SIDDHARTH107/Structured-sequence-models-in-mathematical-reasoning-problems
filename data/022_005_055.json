    "message_2": "To find the residue of the given function at z = -1 + i, we first need to check if z = -1 + i is a pole of the function and find its order.\n\nLet's factor the denominator:\n\n(z^2 + 2z + 2)^2 = [(z + 1)^2 + 1]^2\n\nNow, let's check if z = -1 + i is a root of the denominator:\n\n((-1 + i) + 1)^2 + 1 = (i)^2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0\n\nSo, z = -1 + i is a root of the denominator. Since it's a double root, it's a pole of order 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue using the formula for a pole of order 2:\n\nRes(f, -1 + i) = lim (z -> -1 + i) [(z - (-1 + i))^2 * f(z)]\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\nRes(f, -1 + i) = lim (z -> -1 + i) [(z + 1 - i)^2 * ((z^5 - 1)/((z + 1)^2 + 1)^2)]\n\nNow, let's substitute z = -1 + i in the numerator:\n\n((-1 + i)^5 - 1) = (i^5 - 1) = (i - 1)\n\nNow, let's substitute z = -1 + i in the denominator:\n\n[((-1 + i) + 1)^2 + 1]^2 = (i^2 + 1)^2 = 0^2 = 0\n\nSince the denominator is 0, we need to use L'Hopital's rule to find the limit. We will differentiate the numerator and denominator with respect to z twice and then evaluate the limit:\n\nNumerator: d^2/dz^2 (z^5 - 1) = d^2/dz^2 (z^5) = 20z^3\nDenominator: d^2/dz^2 ((z + 1 - i)^2) = 2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limit:\n\nRes(f, -1 + i) = lim (z -> -1 + i) [(20z^3)/2] = 10((-1 + i)^3) = 10(-2i) = -20i\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at z = -1 + i is -20i."
