Determine the Hopf map of the manifold, i.e construct a smooth map h:M→ S^2 such that h restricted to M\\{p} coincides with f.",
    "message_2": "To construct the Hopf map h: M → S^2 such that h restricted to M\\{p} coincides with f, we first need to extend the smooth map f: M\\{p} → S^2 to the entire manifold M, including the point p.\n\nSince M is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere, we can represent M as a union of two solid hemispheres, say M = U ∪ V, where U and V are homeomorphic to a 3-dimensional closed ball, and their intersection U ∩ V is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere. Let p ∈ U. We can define a smooth map g: V → S^2 such that g restricted to U ∩ V coincides with f restricted to U ∩ V. This can be done by using a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover {U, V} of M.\n\nNow, we can define the Hopf map h: M → S^2 as follows:\n\nh(x) = { f(x) if x ∈ M\\{p}\n          g(x) if x ∈ V\n\nSince f and g coincide on U ∩ V, the map h is well-defined and smooth on M. Moreover, h restricted to M\\{p} coincides with f, as required.\n\nThe Hopf map h: M → S^2 is a smooth map that extends the given map f: M\\{p} → S^2 to the entire manifold M, including the point p, and satisfies the required properties."
