    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-2, 2], we first need to determine if we are working with a Fourier sine series, a Fourier cosine series, or a full Fourier series. Since the function f(x) = |x| is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis), we will use the Fourier cosine series.\n\nThe Fourier cosine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0)/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, a_0 is the constant term, and a_n are the Fourier coefficients. In this case, L = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0)] dx from -L to L\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[|x|] dx from -2 to 2\n\nSplit the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [∫[-x] dx from -2 to 0 + ∫[x] dx from 0 to 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(x^2/2)|(-2 to 0) + (x^2/2)|(0 to 2)]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(0 - 4) + (4 - 0)]\na_0 = (1/2) * 4 = 2\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[|x| * cos(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 2\n\nAgain, split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [∫[-x * cos(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 0 + ∫[x * cos(nπx/2)] dx from 0 to 2]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we will use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = cos(nπx/2) dx\nThen du = dx and v = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[-x * cos(nπx/2)] dx = -x * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) - ∫[-(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)] dx\n∫[x * cos(nπx/2)] dx = x * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) - ∫[(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)] dx\n\nNow, we can plug these results back into the expression for a_n:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [-x * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)|(-2 to 0) - ∫[-(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 0\n               + x * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)|(0 to 2) - ∫[(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)] dx from 0 to 2]\n\na_n = (1/2) * [-4/nπ * sin(-nπ) + 4/nπ * sin(nπ) - (2/nπ) * ∫[sin(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 2]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the first two terms become 0:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [-(2/nπ) * ∫[sin(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 2]\n\nNow, integrate sin(nπx/2):\n\na_n = (1/2) * [-(2/nπ) * (-4/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)|(-2 to 2)]\na_n = (4/n^2π^2) * [cos(nπx/2)|(-2 to 2)]\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\na_n = (4/n^2π^2) * [cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ)]\n\nSince cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ) for all integer values of n:\n\na_n = (4/n^2π^2) * [cos(nπ) - cos(nπ)] = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients a_n are all 0 for n ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier cosine series for f(x) = |x| on the interval [-2, 2] is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 = 2/2 = 1"
