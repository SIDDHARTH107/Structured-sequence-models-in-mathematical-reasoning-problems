    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's Law is represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field (B) is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop with a radius equal to the distance from the wire (2 cm) as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field is tangent to the loop at every point, so the dot product B • dl simplifies to B * dl.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm (0.02 m) from the wire:\n\n∮ B * dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSince the magnetic field is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nThe line integral of dl around the circular loop is equal to the circumference of the loop:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. The current enclosed by the loop is 4 A, and the distance from the wire (r) is 0.02 m.\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.04 m)\n\nB = 4π × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the wire is approximately 4π × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
