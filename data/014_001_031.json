    "message_2": "First, we need to compute n and φ(n):\n\nn = p * q = 17 * 11 = 187\n\nφ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (17-1) * (11-1) = 16 * 10 = 160\n\nNow, we need to choose a public key e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1. Let's choose e = 3 (which is a common choice for e in RSA).\n\nTo find the private key d, we need to compute the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)). In other words, we need to find a number d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find that d = 107.\n\nNow we have the public key (e, n) = (3, 187) and the private key (d, n) = (107, 187).\n\nTo encrypt the message \"7\", we compute the ciphertext c as follows:\n\nc = m^e % n = 7^3 % 187 = 343 % 187 = 156\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, we compute the original message m as follows:\n\nm = c^d % n = 156^107 % 187 = 7\n\nSo the encrypted message is \"156\", and after decryption, we get back the original message \"7\"."
