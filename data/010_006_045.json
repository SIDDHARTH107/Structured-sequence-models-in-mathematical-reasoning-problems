    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the space obtained by gluing two solid tori along their boundary circles, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Let X be the space obtained by gluing two solid tori A and B along their boundary circles. Let C be the intersection of A and B, which is a circle.\n\nThe fundamental group of a torus is the free product of two copies of the integers, i.e., π₁(T²) = ℤ × ℤ. Since a solid torus is a torus with a disk removed, its fundamental group is the same as that of a torus with a point removed, which is the free group on two generators, i.e., π₁(A) = π₁(B) = F(a, b) where a and b are the generators.\n\nThe intersection C is a circle, and its fundamental group is the integers, i.e., π₁(C) = ℤ. We can choose a generator c of π₁(C) such that c is homotopic to a in A and c is homotopic to b in B.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that the fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, with the fundamental group of C amalgamated, i.e.,\n\nπ₁(X) = π₁(A) * π₁(C) π₁(B) = F(a, b) * ℤ F(a, b).\n\nSince c is homotopic to a in A and c is homotopic to b in B, we can identify a and b in the free product, i.e.,\n\nπ₁(X) = F(a, b) / (a = b).\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the resulting space X is the free group on one generator, i.e.,\n\nπ₁(X) = ℤ."
