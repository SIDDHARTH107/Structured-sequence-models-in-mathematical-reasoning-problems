The initial conditions are x(0) = 0.2 m and dx/dt(0) = 0. \n\nWhat is the equation of motion for this system? What is the natural frequency of the system? What is the amplitude of the oscillation? How long does it take for the amplitude to decrease to half its initial value?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for this system, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the given differential equation:\n\nm*r^2 + b*r + k = 0\n\nwhere r is the characteristic root. Plugging in the given values:\n\n0.5*r^2 + 0.25*r + 25 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nr = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a\n\nr = (-0.25 ± sqrt(0.25^2 - 4*0.5*25)) / (2*0.5)\n\nr = (-0.25 ± sqrt(-49.9375)) / 1\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\nr = -0.25 ± j*sqrt(49.9375)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the given differential equation as:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.25*t) * (A*cos(ω*t) + B*sin(ω*t))\n\nwhere ω = sqrt(49.9375) and A and B are constants to be determined using the initial conditions.\n\nUsing the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 0.2 = e^(0) * (A*cos(0) + B*sin(0))\n0.2 = A\n\ndx/dt(t) = -0.25*e^(-0.25*t) * (A*cos(ω*t) + B*sin(ω*t)) + e^(-0.25*t) * (-A*ω*sin(ω*t) + B*ω*cos(ω*t))\n\ndx/dt(0) = 0 = -0.25*(0.2) + B*ω\nB = 0.25*0.2/ω\n\nNow we have the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.25*t) * (0.2*cos(ω*t) + (0.25*0.2/ω)*sin(ω*t))\n\nThe natural frequency of the system is ω = sqrt(49.9375) rad/s.\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation can be found using the formula:\n\nAmplitude = sqrt(A^2 + B^2)\nAmplitude = sqrt((0.2)^2 + (0.25*0.2/ω)^2)\n\nTo find the time it takes for the amplitude to decrease to half its initial value, we can use the formula:\n\nAmplitude(t) = e^(-0.25*t) * sqrt(A^2 + B^2)\n\n0.5 * Amplitude(0) = e^(-0.25*t) * Amplitude(0)\n\n0.5 = e^(-0.25*t)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.5) = -0.25*t\n\nt = ln(0.5) / (-0.25)\n\nt ≈ 2.7726 s\n\nSo, it takes approximately 2.7726 seconds for the amplitude to decrease to half its initial value."
