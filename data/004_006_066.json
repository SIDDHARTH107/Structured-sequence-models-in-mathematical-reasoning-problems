    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5, we need to find the points where the derivative of the function is equal to 0 or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0. To do this, we can set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 1 and x = 3\n\nSince both of these values are within the interval [0, 5], the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5 has critical points at x = 1 and x = 3."
