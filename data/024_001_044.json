    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the vector equation r(t).\n\nGiven r(t) = (2t, 3t^2, t^3), let's find the first derivative, r'(t):\n\nr'(t) = (d(2t)/dt, d(3t^2)/dt, d(t^3)/dt) = (2, 6t, 3t^2).\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, r''(t):\n\nr''(t) = (d(2)/dt, d(6t)/dt, d(3t^2)/dt) = (0, 6, 6t).\n\nNow, we can find the curvature, κ(t), using the formula:\n\nκ(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3,\n\nwhere x denotes the cross product.\n\nFirst, let's find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t) at t=2:\n\nr'(2) = (2, 12, 12),\nr''(2) = (0, 6, 12).\n\nr'(2) x r''(2) = (144, -24, 12).\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||r'(2) x r''(2)|| = √(144^2 + (-24)^2 + 12^2) = √(20736 + 576 + 144) = √(21456) = 146.48.\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of r'(2):\n\n||r'(2)|| = √(2^2 + 12^2 + 12^2) = √(4 + 144 + 144) = √(292) = 17.08.\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nκ(2) = 146.48 / (17.08)^3 = 146.48 / 4985.97 ≈ 0.0294.\n\nTo find the torsion, τ(t), we use the formula:\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2,\n\nwhere • denotes the dot product.\n\nFirst, let's find the third derivative, r'''(t):\n\nr'''(t) = (d(0)/dt, d(6)/dt, d(6t)/dt) = (0, 0, 6).\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of (r'(t) x r''(t)) and r'''(t) at t=2:\n\n(r'(2) x r''(2)) • r'''(2) = (144, -24, 12) • (0, 0, 6) = 0 + 0 + 72 = 72.\n\nFinally, let's find the torsion:\n\nτ(2) = 72 / (||r'(2) x r''(2)||^2) = 72 / (146.48^2) = 72 / 21445.11 ≈ 0.0034.\n\nSo, the curvature of the curve at t=2 is approximately 0.0294, and the torsion is approximately 0.0034."
