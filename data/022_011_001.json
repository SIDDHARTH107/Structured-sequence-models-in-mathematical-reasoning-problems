    "message_1": "Consider the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 2z + 1)/(z^2 + 1). Find all the zeros and poles of this function, and determine their orders.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 2z + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it may not be possible to find a simple algebraic expression for its roots. However, we can use numerical methods or software to approximate the roots. Using a numerical solver, we find that the zeros of f(z) are approximately:\n\nz1 ≈ 0.3517 - 1.1143i\nz2 ≈ 0.3517 + 1.1143i\nz3 ≈ -1.7034\n\nSo, the zeros of f(z) are z1, z2, and z3, and their orders are all 1 since they are simple roots of the cubic equation.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function f(z). The poles are the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1:\n\nz = (± √(-4)) / 2\nz = ± √(-1)\n\nSo, the poles of f(z) are:\n\nz4 = i\nz5 = -i\n\nThe orders of the poles are also 1 since they are simple roots of the quadratic equation.\n\nIn summary, the zeros of the function f(z) are z1 ≈ 0.3517 - 1.1143i, z2 ≈ 0.3517 + 1.1143i, and z3 ≈ -1.7034, all with order 1. The poles of the function f(z) are z4 = i and z5 = -i, also with order 1."
