    "message_2": "The logistic map is a mathematical model for population growth and is defined by the following equation:\n\nx_n+1 = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the population size at iteration n, r is the parameter (in this case, 3.5), and x_n+1 is the population size at iteration n+1.\n\nGiven the initial population size x_0 = 0.4, we will calculate the population size after 10 iterations (x_10).\n\nWe will use a loop to calculate the population size at each iteration:\n\nx = 0.4\nr = 3.5\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nAfter running this loop, the value of x will be the population size after 10 iterations."
