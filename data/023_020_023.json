    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (1/x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSince the function f(x) = 1/x is an odd function and cos(n * x) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (1/x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nThis integral is not trivial to solve directly. Instead, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 1/x and dv = sin(n * x) dx. Then, du = -1/x^2 dx and v = -cos(n * x)/n.\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫(1/x) * sin(n * x) dx = - (1/x) * cos(n * x)/n - ∫(-cos(n * x)/n) * (-1/x^2) dx\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [- (1/x) * cos(n * x)/n |(-π, π) - ∫[-π, π] (cos(n * x)/n) * (1/x^2) dx]\n\nThe first term vanishes because cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and cos(n * (-π)) = (-1)^n. So, we are left with the second term:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (cos(n * x)/n) * (1/x^2) dx\n\nThis integral is still not trivial to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the function is odd and rewrite the integral as:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] (cos(n * x)/n) * (1/x^2) dx\n\nNow, we have the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since a_n = 0 for all n, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ(0 * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nf(x) = Σ(2/π) * (1/n) * (1/x^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = 1/x on the interval [-π, π]."
