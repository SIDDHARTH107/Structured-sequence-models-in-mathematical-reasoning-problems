    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider two cases: G has an element of order 4, or G does not have an element of order 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element of G with order 4. Then, the powers of a form a cyclic subgroup of G: {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Since this subgroup has 4 elements and G has order 4, this subgroup must be equal to G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 4, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 4.\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. We already ruled out the case where G has an element of order 4. The identity element e has order 1, so there must be elements of order 2 in G. Let a and b be two distinct elements of order 2 in G. Then, G = {e, a, b, c} for some element c. Since a and b have order 2, we have a^2 = e and b^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. If ab = e, then a = b^(-1) = b, which is a contradiction since a and b are distinct. If ab = a, then b = e, which is a contradiction since b is not the identity element. If ab = b, then a = e, which is a contradiction since a is not the identity element. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that ab = c.\n\nNow, we have the following relations in G: a^2 = e, b^2 = e, and ab = c. We can compute (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2 = e * e = e, so c^2 = e. Thus, G has the following multiplication table:\n\n  | e  a  b  c\n--+-----------\ne | e  a  b  c\na | a  e  c  b\nb | b  c  e  a\nc | c  b  a  e\n\nThis multiplication table defines the Klein four-group V4, so G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 4 must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4. Therefore, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 4: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4."
