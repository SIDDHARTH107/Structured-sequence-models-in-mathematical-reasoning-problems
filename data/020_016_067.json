    "message_2": "To determine the maximum area of the remaining metal plate after the circular hole has been cut out, we first need to calculate the area of the metal plate and the area of the circular hole.\n\nThe area of the metal plate can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle: \nArea = width × height\nArea = 100 cm × 50 cm\nArea = 5000 cm²\n\nNext, we need to calculate the area of the circular hole. The formula for the area of a circle is:\nArea = π × (diameter/2)²\nArea = π × (20 cm / 2)²\nArea = π × 10 cm²\nArea ≈ 314.16 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the maximum area of the remaining metal plate by subtracting the area of the circular hole from the area of the metal plate:\nRemaining area = metal plate area - circular hole area\nRemaining area = 5000 cm² - 314.16 cm²\nRemaining area ≈ 4685.84 cm²\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of the remaining metal plate after the circular hole has been cut out is approximately 4685.84 cm²."
