    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as AΔB. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nAΔB = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nA ∩ B = {7}\n\nAΔB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (AΔB) with the set {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n(AΔB) ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. We need to prove that:\n\nAΔ(B ∩ C) = (AΔB) ∩ (AΔC)\n\nLet's use the definition of symmetric difference:\n\nAΔ(B ∩ C) = (A - (B ∩ C)) ∪ ((B ∩ C) - A)\n\nNow let's distribute the intersection over the union:\n\nAΔ(B ∩ C) = (A - B) ∪ (A - C) ∪ ((B ∩ C) - A)\n\nNow let's rewrite the expression using the definition of symmetric difference again:\n\n(AΔB) ∩ (AΔC) = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) ∩ (A - C) ∪ (C - A)\n\nNow let's distribute the intersection over the union:\n\n(AΔB) ∩ (AΔC) = ((A - B) ∩ (A - C)) ∪ ((A - B) ∩ (C - A)) ∪ ((B - A) ∩ (A - C)) ∪ ((B - A) ∩ (C - A))\n\nNow let's use the distributive property of sets:\n\n(AΔB) ∩ (AΔC) = (A - B) ∪ (A - C) ∪ ((B ∩ C) - A)\n\nComparing the two expressions, we can see that they are equal:\n\nAΔ(B ∩ C) = (AΔB) ∩ (AΔC)\n\nThus, the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection."
