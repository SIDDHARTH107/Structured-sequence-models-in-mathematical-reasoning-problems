However, due to various interruptions, the rate at which the machine actually produces units varies from hour to hour. Specifically, during the first hour, the machine produces 18 units; during the second hour, it produces 21 units; during the third hour, it produces 19 units; and during the fourth hour, it produces 23 units. Assuming this trend continues, what is the optimal rate at which the machine should produce units in order to maximize production over an 8-hour workday?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal rate at which the machine should produce units, we first need to determine the pattern in the given production rates. The production rates for the first four hours are:\n\nHour 1: 18 units\nHour 2: 21 units\nHour 3: 19 units\nHour 4: 23 units\n\nWe can observe that the production rates are alternating between being 2 units below and 1 unit above the machine's standard rate of 20 units per hour. If this trend continues, the production rates for the next four hours would be:\n\nHour 5: 18 units (20 - 2)\nHour 6: 21 units (20 + 1)\nHour 7: 19 units (20 - 1)\nHour 8: 23 units (20 + 3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the total production for the 8-hour workday:\n\nTotal production = (18 + 21 + 19 + 23 + 18 + 21 + 19 + 23) units\nTotal production = 162 units\n\nTo find the optimal rate, we divide the total production by the number of hours:\n\nOptimal rate = Total production / 8 hours\nOptimal rate = 162 units / 8 hours\nOptimal rate = 20.25 units per hour\n\nSo, the optimal rate at which the machine should produce units to maximize production over an 8-hour workday is 20.25 units per hour."
