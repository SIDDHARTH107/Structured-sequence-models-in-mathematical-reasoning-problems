    "message_1": "A farmer has 200 feet of fencing material to make a rectangular pen to enclose some animals. What is the largest area he can enclose and what are the dimensions of the pen? (Assume no fencing material is needed along the edge containing the barn.)",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular pen be x feet and the width be y feet. Since the farmer has 200 feet of fencing material, the perimeter of the pen (excluding the barn side) can be represented as:\n\nx + 2y = 200\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for x:\n\nx = 200 - 2y\n\nNow, the area of the rectangular pen can be represented as:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nSubstitute the expression for x from the perimeter equation:\n\nArea = (200 - 2y) * y\nArea = 200y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to y and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dy = 200 - 4y = 0\n\nSolve for y:\n\n4y = 200\ny = 50\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 200 - 2(50)\nx = 200 - 100\nx = 100\n\nSo, the dimensions of the pen that will give the largest area are 100 feet in length and 50 feet in width. The largest area that can be enclosed is:\n\nArea = 100 * 50 = 5000 square feet."
