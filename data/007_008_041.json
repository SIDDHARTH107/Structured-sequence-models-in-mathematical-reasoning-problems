    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nGiven p = 7 (which is a prime number) and a = 3, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 3^7 is divided by 7. Since 3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7), the remainder is 3."
