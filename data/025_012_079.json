    "message_2": "To find the number of rational points on the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 7 over the field of rational numbers Q, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem. However, it is important to note that finding the exact number of rational points on an elliptic curve can be a difficult task and may require advanced computational methods and algorithms.\n\nThe Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. This means that there is a finite set of points (called a basis) such that every rational point on the curve can be obtained by adding or subtracting these basis points.\n\nOne way to find the number of rational points is to use the L-function associated with the elliptic curve and compute its order of vanishing at s=1, which is called the analytic rank. This can give us information about the rank of the Mordell-Weil group, which is related to the number of independent generators of the group.\n\nHowever, finding the exact number of rational points on an elliptic curve is generally a difficult problem and may require the use of specialized software and algorithms, such as the method of descent or the use of elliptic curve factorization methods.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible to find the number of rational points on the given elliptic curve, doing so requires advanced mathematical techniques and computational methods that are beyond the scope of a simple answer."
