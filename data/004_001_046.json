    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² - 4x + 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n, where n is a constant, is nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x² - 4x + 5)/dx = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) = 3x² - 4x + 5 at x = 2 is 8."
