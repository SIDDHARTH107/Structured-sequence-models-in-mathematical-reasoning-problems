    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 2, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 2, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\n1. For the term 3x^2, n = 2. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\n   (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2. For the term 4x, n = 1. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\n   (4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (4x^2)/2 = 2x^2\n\n3. For the constant term -2, we can treat it as -2x^0, with n = 0. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\n   (-2x^(0+1))/(0+1) = (-2x^1)/1 = -2x\n\nNow, we can combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 2x + C"
