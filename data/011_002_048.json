    "message_2": "To find the number of combinations possible for choosing a committee of 3 students from a group of 7 students, we can use the binomial coefficient formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations, n is the total number of students, and k is the number of students to be chosen for the committee.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and k = 3. So, we have:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 different ways to choose a committee of 3 students from a group of 7 students."
