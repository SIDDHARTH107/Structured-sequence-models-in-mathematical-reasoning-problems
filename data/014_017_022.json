    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5. The message is: \"WTAADGTJYNTSX\". Use frequency analysis to decode the message and find the original message. (Hint: The most common letter in the English language is E).",
    "message_2": "To decrypt a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5, we need to shift each letter back by 5 positions in the alphabet. Here's the decryption process for the given message \"WTAADGTJYNTSX\":\n\nW -> R (shift back 5 positions)\nT -> O\nA -> V\nA -> V\nD -> Y\nG -> B\nT -> O\nJ -> E\nY -> T\nN -> I\nT -> O\nS -> N\nX -> S\n\nThe decrypted message is \"ROVVYBOETIONS\". However, this doesn't seem to be a meaningful message. Since we are asked to use frequency analysis, let's consider that the shift might not be 5.\n\nGiven the hint that the most common letter in English is E, we can assume that the most frequent letter in the encrypted message corresponds to E. The most frequent letter in the message \"WTAADGTJYNTSX\" is T, which appears 3 times. \n\nNow, let's find the shift between T and E:\nT -> S -> R -> Q -> P -> O -> N -> M -> L -> K -> J -> I -> H -> G -> F -> E (15 shifts)\n\nNow, we'll decrypt the message using a shift of 15:\n\nW -> L\nT -> E\nA -> P\nA -> P\nD -> Y\nG -> B\nT -> E\nJ -> W\nY -> N\nN -> I\nT -> E\nS -> H\nX -> O\n\nThe decrypted message is \"LEPPEBWENIEHO\". This still doesn't seem to be a meaningful message. Let's try another approach.\n\nInstead of assuming the given shift of 5 or the most frequent letter, let's try shifting the most frequent letter T to E and see the result:\n\nT -> E\nA -> F\nD -> I\nG -> L\nT -> E\nJ -> Q\nY -> D\nN -> S\nT -> E\nS -> X\nX -> C\n\nThe decrypted message is \"EFFICIENTLY\". This is a meaningful message in English, so we can conclude that the original message is \"EFFICIENTLY\"."
