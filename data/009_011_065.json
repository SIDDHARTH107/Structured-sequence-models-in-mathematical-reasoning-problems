The number of infected people is increasing at a rate proportional to the product of the number of infected people and the number of susceptible people. Initially, there were 100 infected people, and the rate at which the disease spreads is estimated to be 0.1%. Find the number of infected people after 10 days.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, which is a simple mathematical model used to describe the spread of a disease in a population. In this case, we are only concerned with the Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) populations, as we are not given any information about recovery rates.\n\nLet S(t) be the number of susceptible people at time t, I(t) be the number of infected people at time t, and N be the total population. We are given that the rate of infection is proportional to the product of the number of susceptible and infected people, and the proportionality constant is 0.1% or 0.001.\n\nThe differential equation that describes this situation is:\n\ndI/dt = k * S * I\n\nwhere k is the proportionality constant (0.001 in this case).\n\nWe also know that S(t) + I(t) = N, where N = 10,000. Initially, S(0) = 10,000 - 100 = 9,900 and I(0) = 100.\n\nWe can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\ndI/dt = 0.001 * (10,000 - I) * I\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\n(1/I * (10,000 - I)) dI = 0.001 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/I * (10,000 - I)) dI = ∫0.001 dt\n\nLet's introduce a new variable u = 10,000 - I, so du = -dI. The integral becomes:\n\n-∫(1/u * (u)) du = 0.001 ∫ dt\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n-ln(u) = 0.001t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition I(0) = 100:\n\n-ln(9900) = 0.001(0) + C\n\nC = -ln(9900)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n-ln(u) = 0.001t - ln(9900)\n\nTo find the number of infected people after 10 days, we can plug in t = 10:\n\n-ln(u) = 0.001(10) - ln(9900)\n\n-ln(u) = -ln(9900) + ln(10)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides:\n\nu = 9900/10\n\nu = 990\n\nSince u = 10,000 - I, we can find the number of infected people after 10 days:\n\nI = 10,000 - 990 = 9,010\n\nSo, after 10 days, there will be 9,010 infected people in the community."
