    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (6x^2 - 3x + 2) / (2x + 1) using the quotient rule, we'll first identify the numerator function as u(x) = 6x^2 - 3x + 2 and the denominator function as v(x) = 2x + 1.\n\nThe quotient rule states that if f(x) = u(x) / v(x), then the derivative f'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(6x^2 - 3x + 2)/dx = 12x - 3\nv'(x) = d(2x + 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / (v(x))^2\nf'(x) = ((12x - 3)(2x + 1) - (6x^2 - 3x + 2)(2)) / (2x + 1)^2\n\nNow, we'll simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (24x^2 + 12x - 6x - 3 - 12x^2 + 6x - 4) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\nf'(x) = (24x^2 - 12x^2 + 12x - 6x + 6x - 3 - 4) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\nf'(x) = (12x^2 + 2x - 7) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (6x^2 - 3x + 2) / (2x + 1) is f'(x) = (12x^2 + 2x - 7) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)."
