    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval x = 0 to x = 2, we need to first find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, set y = x^2 equal to y = 2x - 3:\n\nx^2 = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 12)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 12) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that the two curves do not intersect between x = 0 and x = 2. Therefore, we can find the area enclosed between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval x = 0 to x = 2:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 3 - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow, integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (1/3)x^3] from 0 to 2\n\nEvaluate the definite integral:\n\nArea = (2^2 - (1/3)(2^3)) - (0^2 - (1/3)(0^3))\nArea = (4 - (8/3)) - (0)\nArea = (12 - 8) / 3\nArea = 4 / 3\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval x = 0 to x = 2 is 4/3 square units."
