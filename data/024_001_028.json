    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve given by the vector function r(t) = <2t, 3t^2, t^3> at t = 1, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of r(t) with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivative (tangent vector):\nr'(t) = <2, 6t, 3t^2>\n\nSecond derivative (normal vector):\nr''(t) = <0, 6, 6t>\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude of the first and second derivatives at t = 1.\n\n|r'(1)| = |<2, 6, 3>| = √(2^2 + 6^2 + 3^2) = √(49) = 7\n\n|r''(1)| = |<0, 6, 6>| = √(0^2 + 6^2 + 6^2) = √(72) = 6√2\n\nThe curvature (k) is given by the formula:\n\nk = |r'(t) × r''(t)| / |r'(t)|^3\n\nAt t = 1, we have:\n\nk = |<2, 6, 3> × <0, 6, 6>| / |<2, 6, 3>|^3\n\nCross product of r'(1) and r''(1):\n\n<2, 6, 3> × <0, 6, 6> = <-18, -12, 12>\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk = |<-18, -12, 12>| / (7^3)\nk = √((-18)^2 + (-12)^2 + 12^2) / 343\nk = √(684) / 343\nk ≈ 1.6174\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ). The formula for torsion is:\n\nτ = (r'(t) × r''(t) • r'''(t)) / |r'(t) × r''(t)|^2\n\nFirst, we need to find the third derivative of r(t):\n\nr'''(t) = <0, 0, 6>\n\nAt t = 1, we have:\n\nτ = (<-18, -12, 12> • <0, 0, 6>) / |<-18, -12, 12>|^2\nτ = (0 + 0 + 72) / (684)\nτ = 72 / 684\nτ = 1/9\n\nSo, the curvature at t = 1 is approximately 1.6174, and the torsion is 1/9."
