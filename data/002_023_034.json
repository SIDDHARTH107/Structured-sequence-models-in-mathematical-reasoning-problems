    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 7 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (7 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 49 cm^2\nSurface Area = 196 * π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 196 * 3.14159 cm^2\nSurface Area ≈ 615.752 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 7 cm is approximately 615.752 cm^2."
