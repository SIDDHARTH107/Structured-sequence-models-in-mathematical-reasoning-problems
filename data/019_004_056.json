    "message_2": "To represent integers within the range of -127 to 128, we need to find the minimum number of binary bits required to represent these 256 distinct values (from -127 to 128, inclusive).\n\nUsing the formula for the number of distinct values that can be represented by n binary bits:\n\nDistinct values = 2^n\n\nWe need to find the smallest n such that 2^n >= 256.\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nSo, the minimum number of binary bits required to represent all integers within the range of -127 to 128 using a temporal logic system is 8 bits."
