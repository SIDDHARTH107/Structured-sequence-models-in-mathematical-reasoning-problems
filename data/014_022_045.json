    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create a 5x5 Playfair square using the key.\n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet, excluding any letters already used in the key. The letter 'J' is usually combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher.\n\nThe Playfair square with the key \"MATHS\" looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, let's encrypt the message \"HELLO\":\n\n1. Break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. In this case, we have \"HE\" and \"LX\" (since \"LL\" has the same letter, we insert an 'X' between them) and \"LO\".\n2. For each digraph, find the corresponding letters in the Playfair square and follow these rules:\n   a. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed).\n   b. If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed).\n   c. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nLet's apply these rules to our digraphs:\n\n- \"HE\": H (row 1, col 4) and E (row 2, col 5) form a rectangle. So, H is replaced by S (row 1, col 5) and E is replaced by F (row 2, col 4). The new digraph is \"SF\".\n- \"LX\": L (row 3, col 4) and X (row 5, col 3) form a rectangle. So, L is replaced by Y (row 3, col 3) and X is replaced by N (row 5, col 4). The new digraph is \"YN\".\n- \"LO\": L (row 3, col 4) and O (row 4, col 1) form a rectangle. So, L is replaced by K (row 3, col 1) and O is replaced by G (row 4, col 4). The new digraph is \"KG\".\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"SFYNKG\"."
