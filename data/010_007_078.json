    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X based at $x_0$, we can use the Van Kampen theorem. First, let's cover X with two open sets U and V such that U contains the upper half of the circle and V contains the lower half of the circle, with both U and V containing the identified antipodal points.\n\nThe intersection of U and V is path-connected and simply connected, so the Van Kampen theorem applies. The fundamental group of U and V is trivial, as they are both contractible to a point. The fundamental group of their intersection is also trivial.\n\nAccording to the Van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the fundamental group of their intersection. Since the fundamental groups of U, V, and their intersection are all trivial, the fundamental group of X is the free product of two trivial groups, which is the trivial group.\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect. The space X is actually homeomorphic to the real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$. To see this, consider the quotient map $q: S^1 \\to X$ that identifies antipodal points. The space X can be obtained by taking the unit disk $D^2$ and identifying antipodal points on its boundary. This is the same as the construction of the real projective plane.\n\nThe fundamental group of the real projective plane is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the cyclic group of order 2. Therefore, the fundamental group of X based at $x_0$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$."
