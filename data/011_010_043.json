    "message_1": "A bookstore has 5 different books on mathematics and a customer wants to buy 2 of them. How many different ways are there for the customer to select 2 books? Use Catalan numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Catalan numbers are not applicable to this problem, as they are used to count certain combinatorial structures, such as the number of non-crossing partitions or the number of binary trees with a certain number of nodes.\n\nInstead, we can solve this problem using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 books out of 5 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 5 books), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 books), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, in this case, we have:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n= 5! / (2!3!)\n= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n= (5 × 4) / (2 × 1)\n= 10\n\nThus, there are 10 different ways for the customer to select 2 books out of the 5 available."
