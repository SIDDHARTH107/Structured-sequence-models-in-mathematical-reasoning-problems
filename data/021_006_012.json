Write a Python code to implement the finite element method and solve the heat equation for the specific case where $k=1$, $f(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$, $L=1$, $T=0.1$, and $N=100$. Then plot the solution for different values of $t$ in the range $0\\leq t\\leq T$ and discuss the results.",
    "message_2": "First, let's import the necessary libraries and define the given parameters:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nk = 1\nf = lambda x: np.sin(2 * np.pi * x)\nL = 1\nT = 0.1\nN = 100\n```\n\nNext, we'll define a function to implement the finite element method for the heat equation:\n\n```python\ndef finite_element_heat_eq(k, f, L, T, N):\n    dx = L / N\n    dt = T / N\n    x = np.linspace(0, L, N+1)\n    u = np.zeros((N+1, N+1))\n    u[:, 0] = f(x)\n\n    for t in range(N):\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            u[i, t+1] = u[i, t] + k * dt / dx**2 * (u[i-1, t] - 2 * u[i, t] + u[i+1, t])\n\n    return x, u\n```\n\nNow, let's use this function to solve the heat equation and plot the solution for different values of `t`:\n\n```python\nx, u = finite_element_heat_eq(k, f, L, T, N)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nfor t in range(0, N+1, N//10):\n    plt.plot(x, u[:, t], label=f't = {t/N*T:.2f}')\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('u(x, t)')\nplt.title('Solution of the Heat Equation using Finite Element Method')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe resulting plot shows the solution of the heat equation at different time instances. As time progresses, the initial sinusoidal temperature distribution dissipates, eventually approaching a uniform temperature distribution. This is consistent with the physical behavior of heat diffusion, where temperature differences tend to equalize over time."
