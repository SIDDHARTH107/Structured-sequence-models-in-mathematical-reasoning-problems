    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm and a height of 4 cm. Find its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × length × width × height\n\nGiven the dimensions of the pyramid are:\nLength = 10 cm\nWidth = 6 cm\nHeight = 4 cm\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 240 cubic cm\n\nVolume = 80 cubic cm\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
