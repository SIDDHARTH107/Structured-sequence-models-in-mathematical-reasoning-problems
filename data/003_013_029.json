    "message_2": "To find the maximum distance of the top of the pole from its original position due to wind gusts, we can use trigonometry. Since the wind is blowing horizontally and makes an angle of 30 degrees with the ground, we can form a right triangle with the flagpole as one side, the ground as the base, and the maximum distance of the top of the pole from its original position as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the maximum distance of the top of the pole from its original position as D, and the horizontal distance from the base of the pole to the point where the top of the pole is at its maximum distance as X.\n\nWe can use the sine function to relate the angle, the length of the flagpole, and the maximum distance:\n\nsin(30°) = (15 m) / D\n\nTo solve for D, we can use the fact that sin(30°) = 0.5:\n\n0.5 = (15 m) / D\n\nNow, we can solve for D:\n\nD = (15 m) / 0.5\nD = 30 m\n\nSo, the maximum distance of the top of the pole from its original position due to wind gusts is 30 meters."
