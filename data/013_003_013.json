    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, Player 1 proposes a way to split a sum of money with Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the proposal, the money is split as suggested, but if he rejects the proposal, both players receive nothing. If the sum of money at stake is $100, what is the minimum amount Player 1 should offer to Player 2 in order to avoid rejection assuming that Player 2 is a rational player?",
    "message_2": "Assuming that Player 2 is a rational player, they would prefer to receive any amount of money over receiving nothing. Therefore, the minimum amount Player 1 should offer to Player 2 in order to avoid rejection is $1. This would leave Player 1 with $99, and since Player 2 would receive something rather than nothing, they would accept the offer."
