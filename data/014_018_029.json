    "message_2": "A substitution cipher with 26 letters of the alphabet, where no letter is repeated in the encryption key, is essentially a permutation of the 26 letters. To find the number of possible ways to encrypt a message using this cipher, we need to calculate the number of permutations of the 26 letters.\n\nA permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n objects is given by the formula:\n\nn! (n factorial) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1\n\nIn this case, n = 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet). So, the number of possible ways to encrypt a message using this substitution cipher is:\n\n26! = 26 * 25 * 24 * ... * 1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000"
