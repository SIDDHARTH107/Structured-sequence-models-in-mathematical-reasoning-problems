Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups: \n\nFor a group of order 2^3 * 3^1, we have the following possibilities:\n- (2^3) * (3^1) = Z_8 * Z_3\n- (2^2) * (2^1) * (3^1) = Z_4 * Z_2 * Z_3\n- (2^1) * (2^1) * (2^1) * (3^1) = Z_2 * Z_2 * Z_2 * Z_3\n\nSo, there are 3 possible abelian groups.\n\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups:\n\nFor a group of order 24, we can have the following non-abelian groups:\n- S_4 (symmetric group on 4 elements)\n- A_4 (alternating group on 4 elements)\n- D_12 (dihedral group of order 12, which is a semi-direct product of Z_2 and Z_6)\n\nSo, there are 3 possible non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, there are 3 abelian groups + 3 non-abelian groups = 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
