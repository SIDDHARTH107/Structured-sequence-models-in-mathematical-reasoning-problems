    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the real projective plane, we can use a triangulation of the surface. A common triangulation of the real projective plane is the hemi-octahedron, which is formed by gluing together opposite faces of an octahedron.\n\nAn octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces. Since we are gluing together opposite faces, the hemi-octahedron will have half the number of faces, which is 4 faces. The number of vertices and edges remains the same.\n\nNow we can calculate the Euler characteristic using the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic = vertices - edges + faces\n\nEuler characteristic = 6 - 12 + 4\n\nEuler characteristic = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ is -2."
