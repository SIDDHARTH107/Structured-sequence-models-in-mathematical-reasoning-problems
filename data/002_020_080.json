    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii.\n\n1. Length of the arc:\nThe length of the arc (s) can be found using the formula: s = rθ, where r is the radius and θ is the central angle in radians.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the central angle from degrees to radians:\n45 degrees * (π/180) = 45π/180 = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can find the length of the arc:\ns = rθ = 10 * (π/4) = (10π)/4 = 5π/2 cm\n\n2. Length of the two radii:\nSince the radius is given as 10 cm, the combined length of the two radii is 2 * 10 = 20 cm.\n\n3. Perimeter of the sector:\nThe perimeter of the sector is the sum of the arc length and the two radii:\nPerimeter = s + 2r = (5π/2) + 20\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (5π/2) + 20 cm."
