They collect data for the temperature (in degrees Celsius) and the number of cars rented for 10 days. The data is shown below:\n\nTemperature: 28 29 32 26 30 31 29 27 25 33\n\nNumber of cars rented: 75 77 84 67 80 82 78 70 64 87\n\nUsing simple linear regression analysis, find the equation of the line that best represents the relationship between temperature and the number of cars rented. What is the predicted number of cars rented when the temperature is 35 degrees Celsius?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that best represents the relationship between temperature and the number of cars rented using simple linear regression analysis, we first need to calculate the mean of the temperatures (x) and the mean of the number of cars rented (y).\n\nTemperature (x): 28 29 32 26 30 31 29 27 25 33\nNumber of cars rented (y): 75 77 84 67 80 82 78 70 64 87\n\nMean of x (mean_x) = (28 + 29 + 32 + 26 + 30 + 31 + 29 + 27 + 25 + 33) / 10 = 290 / 10 = 29\nMean of y (mean_y) = (75 + 77 + 84 + 67 + 80 + 82 + 78 + 70 + 64 + 87) / 10 = 764 / 10 = 76.4\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the line using the following formulas:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - mean_x) * (yi - mean_y)] / Σ[(xi - mean_x)^2]\na = mean_y - b * mean_x\n\nCalculating b:\n\nΣ[(xi - mean_x) * (yi - mean_y)] = (28-29)(75-76.4) + (29-29)(77-76.4) + (32-29)(84-76.4) + (26-29)(67-76.4) + (30-29)(80-76.4) + (31-29)(82-76.4) + (29-29)(78-76.4) + (27-29)(70-76.4) + (25-29)(64-76.4) + (33-29)(87-76.4) = -1.4 + 0 + 22.8 - 10.2 + 3.6 + 5.6 + 0 - 4.8 - 14.6 + 39.6 = 40.6\n\nΣ[(xi - mean_x)^2] = (28-29)^2 + (29-29)^2 + (32-29)^2 + (26-29)^2 + (30-29)^2 + (31-29)^2 + (29-29)^2 + (27-29)^2 + (25-29)^2 + (33-29)^2 = 1 + 0 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 + 16 = 60\n\nb = 40.6 / 60 = 0.6767\n\nCalculating a:\n\na = mean_y - b * mean_x = 76.4 - 0.6767 * 29 = 76.4 - 19.6253 = 56.7747\n\nSo, the equation of the line is:\n\ny = 0.6767x + 56.7747\n\nNow, we can predict the number of cars rented when the temperature is 35 degrees Celsius:\n\ny = 0.6767 * 35 + 56.7747 = 23.6845 + 56.7747 = 80.4592\n\nThe predicted number of cars rented when the temperature is 35 degrees Celsius is approximately 80."
