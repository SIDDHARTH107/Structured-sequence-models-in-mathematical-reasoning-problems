    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The given system of linear equations can be represented as the following augmented matrix:\n\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 1 -3  2 | -2 |\n| 2  1 -4 |  1 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner.\n\n| 1 -3  2 | -2 |\n| 3  2 -1 |  5 |\n| 2  1 -4 |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 3 and 2 in the first column below the 1.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 3 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 2 * Row 1\n\n| 1 -3  2 | -2 |\n| 0 11 -5 | 11 |\n| 0  7 -8 |  5 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 11 to get a 1 in the second row and second column.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 / 11\n\n| 1 -3  2 | -2 |\n| 0  1 -5/11 | 1 |\n| 0  7 -8 |  5 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 7 in the second column below the 1.\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 7 * Row 2\n\n| 1 -3  2 | -2 |\n| 0  1 -5/11 | 1 |\n| 0  0  1/11 |  2 |\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nz = 1/11 * 2 = 2/11\n\ny = 1 - (-5/11) * z = 1 - (-5/11) * (2/11) = 1 + 10/121 = (121 + 10) / 121 = 131/121\n\nx = -2 - (-3) * y + 2 * z = -2 + 3 * (131/121) + 2 * (2/11) = (-242 + 393 + 44) / 121 = 195/121\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 195/121\ny = 131/121\nz = 2/11"
