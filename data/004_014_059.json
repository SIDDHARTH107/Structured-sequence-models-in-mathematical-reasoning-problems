    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the water level is rising, we can use the related rates method. First, let's find the volume of the conical tank at any given time.\n\nThe volume V of a cone is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base and h is the height.\n\nSince the dimensions of the tank are fixed, we can find the relationship between the radius and height of the water-filled portion of the tank. Let r_w and h_w represent the radius and height of the water-filled portion, respectively.\n\nUsing similar triangles, we have:\n\nr_w / h_w = 4 / 10\n\nr_w = (2/5)h_w\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the water-filled portion of the tank:\n\nV_w = (1/3)π(r_w)^2h_w\n\nSubstitute r_w with the expression we found earlier:\n\nV_w = (1/3)π((2/5)h_w)^2h_w\n\nV_w = (1/3)π(4/25)h_w^2h_w\n\nV_w = (4/75)πh_w^3\n\nNow, we are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of 3 cubic meters per minute, which means dV_w/dt = 3 m³/min. We want to find the rate at which the water level is rising, which is dh_w/dt, when the water is 6 meters deep (h_w = 6).\n\nDifferentiate V_w with respect to time t:\n\ndV_w/dt = (4/75)π(3h_w^2)(dh_w/dt)\n\nSubstitute dV_w/dt = 3 and h_w = 6:\n\n3 = (4/75)π(3(6)^2)(dh_w/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dh_w/dt:\n\n3 = (4/75)π(108)(dh_w/dt)\n\n3 = (432/75)π(dh_w/dt)\n\nTo isolate dh_w/dt, divide both sides by (432/75)π:\n\ndh_w/dt = 3 / ((432/75)π)\n\ndh_w/dt ≈ 0.0546 m/min\n\nSo, the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 6 meters deep is approximately 0.0546 meters per minute."
