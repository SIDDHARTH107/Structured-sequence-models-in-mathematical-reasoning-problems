After collecting the data for a week, the coffee shop manager wants to calculate the average wait time of customers. If the wait times of 10 randomly selected customers are as follows: 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 1, what is the average wait time (in minutes) of these customers?",
    "message_2": "To find the average wait time, we need to add up all the wait times and then divide by the number of customers. \n\nThe sum of the wait times is: 3 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 5 + 1 = 38 minutes\n\nThere are 10 customers, so the average wait time is:\n\n38 minutes / 10 customers = 3.8 minutes\n\nThe average wait time for these customers is 3.8 minutes."
