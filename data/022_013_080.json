    "message_2": "To find the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the given function, we first need to express the function in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + iy$ and $\\bar{z} = x - iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = (x + iy)^2 + (x - iy)$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = (x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy) + (x - iy)$$\n\nNow, let $u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + x$ and $v(x, y) = 2xy - y$. Then, $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$, and we can find the Cauchy-Riemann equations by taking partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2x + 1$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -2y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 2x - 1$$\n\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$$\n\nSubstituting the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$2x + 1 = 2x - 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -2y = -2y$$\n\nThe second equation is always true, but the first equation is not true for all $x$. Therefore, the given function $f(z) = z^2 + \\bar{z}$ does not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and it is not holomorphic (analytic) in the complex plane."
