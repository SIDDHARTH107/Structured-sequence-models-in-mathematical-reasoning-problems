    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of G, we first need to know the structure of the graph G. Since there are multiple graphs with 6 vertices and 8 edges, we cannot uniquely determine the automorphism group without more information about the graph.\n\nHowever, we can discuss some possibilities:\n\n1. If G is a complete graph with 6 vertices (K6), then the automorphism group would be the symmetric group S6, which has 6! = 720 elements. However, K6 has 15 edges, not 8, so this case is not applicable.\n\n2. If G is a cycle graph with 6 vertices (C6), then the automorphism group would be the dihedral group D12, which has 12 elements. However, C6 has 6 edges, not 8, so this case is not applicable either.\n\n3. If G is a tree with 6 vertices, then it would have 5 edges, not 8, so this case is not applicable.\n\n4. If G is a bipartite graph with partitions of size 3 (K3,3), then the automorphism group would be S3 × S3, which has 3! × 3! = 36 elements. However, K3,3 has 9 edges, not 8, so this case is not applicable.\n\n5. If G is a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges, it could be a combination of smaller graphs or a unique structure. In this case, we would need more information about the graph to determine the automorphism group.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the structure of the graph G, we cannot uniquely determine the automorphism group."
