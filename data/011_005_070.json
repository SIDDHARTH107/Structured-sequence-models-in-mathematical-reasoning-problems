    "message_1": "Suppose a committee of 5 people must be selected from a group of 12 mathematicians consisting of 5 women and 7 men. How many different committees can be formed if the committee must have at least 2 women?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We will consider two cases: when the committee has exactly 2 women and when the committee has 3 women.\n\nCase 1: The committee has exactly 2 women.\nWe have 5 women to choose from, and we need to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 5! / (2!3!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)(3*2*1)) = 10\n\nNow, we need to choose 3 men from the group of 7 men. Using the combination formula again:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)(4*3*2*1)) = 35\n\nSo, the number of ways to form a committee with exactly 2 women and 3 men is 10 * 35 = 350.\n\nCase 2: The committee has 3 women.\nWe have 5 women to choose from, and we need to choose 3 of them. Using the combination formula:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)(2*1)) = 10\n\nNow, we need to choose 2 men from the group of 7 men. Using the combination formula again:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)(5*4*3*2*1)) = 21\n\nSo, the number of ways to form a committee with 3 women and 2 men is 10 * 21 = 210.\n\nAdding the results from both cases, we get the total number of ways to form a committee with at least 2 women:\n\n350 (case 1) + 210 (case 2) = 560\n\nTherefore, there are 560 different committees that can be formed with at least 2 women."
