    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula for the fractal dimension:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the four smaller squares in the corners and the one in the center). The scaling factor is 3, as each side of the larger square is divided into three equal parts.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nSo, the dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the size of each square is 1 unit and the pattern is repeated indefinitely in a self-similar manner is approximately 1.465."
