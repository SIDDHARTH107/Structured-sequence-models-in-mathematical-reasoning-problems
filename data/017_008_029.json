We will also explain why other groups of order 8 cannot be isomorphic to any of these.\n\n1. Isomorphisms between G and C8:\n\nC8 is a cyclic group of order 8, generated by a single element, say a, such that a^8 = e (identity element). If G is isomorphic to C8, then G must also be a cyclic group of order 8. In this case, there exists an element g in G such that g^8 = e, and the isomorphism φ: G → C8 can be defined as φ(g^k) = a^k for all k = 0, 1, ..., 7. This is the only possible isomorphism between G and C8.\n\n2. Isomorphisms between G and Q8:\n\nQ8 is the quaternion group, with elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} and the following multiplication rules: i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. If G is isomorphic to Q8, then G must have the same structure as Q8. In this case, G has three elements, say x, y, and z, such that x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = xyz = -e, where e is the identity element in G. The isomorphism φ: G → Q8 can be defined as φ(e) = 1, φ(x) = i, φ(y) = j, φ(z) = k, φ(-x) = -i, φ(-y) = -j, φ(-z) = -k. This is the only possible isomorphism between G and Q8.\n\n3. Isomorphisms between G and D4:\n\nD4 is the dihedral group of order 8, which can be represented as the group of symmetries of a square. It has elements {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r is a rotation by 90 degrees and s is a reflection. If G is isomorphic to D4, then G must have the same structure as D4. In this case, G has two elements, say a and b, such that a^4 = e, b^2 = e, and ba = a^(-1)b. The isomorphism φ: G → D4 can be defined as φ(e) = e, φ(a) = r, φ(a^2) = r^2, φ(a^3) = r^3, φ(b) = s, φ(ab) = sr, φ(a^2b) = sr^2, φ(a^3b) = sr^3. This is the only possible isomorphism between G and D4.\n\nNow, we will explain why other groups of order 8 cannot be isomorphic to any of these:\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, any group of order 8 must have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. This means that any group of order 8 must be either a cyclic group, a dihedral group, or a generalized quaternion group (like Q8). Since we have already considered all possible isomorphisms between G and these three types of groups, there cannot be any other groups of order 8 that are isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4."
