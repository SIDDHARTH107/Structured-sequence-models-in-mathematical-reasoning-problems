    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection associated with the distribution ker(A), we first need to find a local frame for the distribution. The kernel of A is given by the set of vectors v such that A(v) = 0. In local coordinates, we can write A as:\n\nA = (1 + x) ∂/∂z + y^2 ∂/∂x\n\nNow, let v = a ∂/∂x + b ∂/∂y + c ∂/∂z be a vector in the kernel of A. Then, we have:\n\nA(v) = (1 + x) c + y^2 a = 0\n\nWe want to find a basis for the space of solutions (a, b, c) to this equation. We can solve for c in terms of a:\n\nc = -y^2 a / (1 + x)\n\nNow, let's choose a = 1 and b = 0:\n\nv1 = ∂/∂x - y^2/(1 + x) ∂/∂z\n\nNext, we can choose a = 0 and b = 1:\n\nv2 = ∂/∂y\n\nNow, we have a local frame {v1, v2} for the distribution ker(A). To compute the Cartan connection, we need to find the dual coframe {θ^1, θ^2} such that:\n\nθ^i(vj) = δ^i_j\n\nWe can start by taking the exterior derivative of A:\n\ndA = d((1 + x)dz + y^2dx) = (∂(1 + x)/∂y dy ∧ dz) + (∂(y^2)/∂x dx ∧ dy) = dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, let's define θ^1 = A and θ^2 = α dy + β dz for some functions α and β. We want to find α and β such that:\n\nθ^1(v1) = 1, θ^1(v2) = 0, θ^2(v1) = 0, θ^2(v2) = 1\n\nWe already know that θ^1(v1) = 0 and θ^1(v2) = 1. Now, we need to find α and β such that:\n\nθ^2(v1) = α dy(v1) + β dz(v1) = 0\nθ^2(v2) = α dy(v2) + β dz(v2) = 1\n\nSince v1 = ∂/∂x - y^2/(1 + x) ∂/∂z and v2 = ∂/∂y, we have:\n\n0 = α dy(∂/∂x) + β dz(-y^2/(1 + x) ∂/∂z) = -β y^2/(1 + x)\n1 = α dy(∂/∂y) = α\n\nThus, α = 1 and β = 0. So, we have:\n\nθ^2 = dy\n\nNow, we have the dual coframe {θ^1, θ^2} = {A, dy}. The Cartan connection is given by the matrix ω^i_j of 1-forms such that:\n\ndθ^i = -ω^i_j ∧ θ^j\n\nWe already computed dA = dy ∧ dz. Since θ^1 = A and θ^2 = dy, we have:\n\ndθ^1 = dA = dy ∧ dz\ndθ^2 = d(dy) = 0\n\nThus, the Cartan connection is given by the matrix:\n\nω^i_j = ( 0   dz )\n              ( 0   0  )\n\nSo, the Cartan connection associated with the distribution ker(A) is given by ω^i_j with ω^1_1 = 0, ω^1_2 = dz, ω^2_1 = 0, and ω^2_2 = 0."
