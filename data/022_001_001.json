    "message_2": "To analytically continue the function f(z) = log(z) from the domain Re(z) > 0 to the domain Re(z) < 0, we need to find a function that agrees with f(z) on the intersection of these domains and is analytic in the left half-plane.\n\nRecall that the complex logarithm function can be defined as:\n\nlog(z) = ln|z| + i*Arg(z),\n\nwhere ln|z| is the natural logarithm of the magnitude of z, and Arg(z) is the principal argument of z, which is in the range (-π, π].\n\nNow, consider the function g(z) = ln|z| + i*(Arg(z) + 2π) for Re(z) < 0. This function agrees with f(z) = log(z) on the intersection of the domains Re(z) > 0 and Re(z) < 0, which is the imaginary axis (Re(z) = 0) excluding the origin (z = 0).\n\nThe function g(z) is analytic in the left half-plane since the natural logarithm of the magnitude of z is analytic everywhere except at z = 0, and the argument function is analytic in the left half-plane.\n\nThus, the function f(z) = log(z) can be analytically continued to the left half of the complex plane using the function g(z) = ln|z| + i*(Arg(z) + 2π) for Re(z) < 0."
