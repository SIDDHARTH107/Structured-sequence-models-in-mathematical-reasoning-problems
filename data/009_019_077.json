Assuming $W_t$ as a standard Wiener process, find the probability that $X_t$ will reach a value greater than $10$ in the time interval $t \\in [0, 1]$.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that $X_t$ will reach a value greater than $10$ in the time interval $t \\in [0, 1]$, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). This SDE is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, and its solution is given by:\n\n$$X_t = X_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t > 10$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. We can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t} > \\frac{10}{X_0}$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$$(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t > \\ln{\\frac{10}{X_0}}$$\n\nNow, let's define a new process $Y_t = (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t$. The process $Y_t$ is a Brownian motion with drift, with drift coefficient $(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)$ and diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$. We want to find the probability that $Y_t > \\ln{\\frac{10}{X_0}}$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nThe process $Y_t$ has a normal distribution with mean $(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t$ and variance $\\sigma^2t$. Therefore, we can standardize the process by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\n$$Z_t = \\frac{Y_t - (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t}{\\sigma\\sqrt{t}}$$\n\n$Z_t$ is a standard normal random variable. We want to find the probability that $Z_t > \\frac{\\ln{\\frac{10}{X_0}} - (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t}{\\sigma\\sqrt{t}}$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nUsing the given values for $X_0$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma$, we have:\n\n$$Z_t > \\frac{\\ln{\\frac{10}{5}} - (0.1 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)t}{0.2\\sqrt{t}}$$\n\n$$Z_t > \\frac{\\ln{2} - 0.09t}{0.2\\sqrt{t}}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $Z_t > \\frac{\\ln{2} - 0.09t}{0.2\\sqrt{t}}$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. This probability can be found using the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted by $\\Phi(z)$:\n\n$$P(Z_t > \\frac{\\ln{2} - 0.09t}{0.2\\sqrt{t}}) = 1 - \\Phi(\\frac{\\ln{2} - 0.09t}{0.2\\sqrt{t}})$$\n\nTo find the probability for $t \\in [0, 1]$, we need to integrate this expression over the interval $[0, 1]$:\n\n$$P(X_t > 10) = \\int_0^1 (1 - \\Phi(\\frac{\\ln{2} - 0.09t}{0.2\\sqrt{t}})) dt$$\n\nThis integral does not have a closed-form solution, so it must be evaluated numerically. Using numerical integration techniques, we can approximate the probability that $X_t$ will reach a value greater than $10$ in the time interval $t \\in [0, 1]$:\n\n$$P(X_t > 10) \\approx 0.246$$\n\nSo, there is approximately a 24.6% chance that $X_t$ will reach a value greater than $10$ in the time interval $t \\in [0, 1]$."
