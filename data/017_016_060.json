    "message_2": "Let Z(G) be the center of G, and let |Z(G)| = 3. Since the order of G is 27, we know that G is a p-group, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 3). By the class equation, we have:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over one representative x from each conjugacy class outside of Z(G), and C(x) is the centralizer of x in G.\n\nSince |G| = 27 and |Z(G)| = 3, we have:\n\n27 = 3 + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nNow, we know that [G:C(x)] divides |G| for each x, and since |G| = 3^3, the possible values for [G:C(x)] are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, [G:C(x)] = 1 implies that x is in the center, which is not possible since we are considering elements outside of Z(G). Therefore, the possible values for [G:C(x)] are 3, 9, and 27.\n\nIf [G:C(x)] = 27 for some x, then C(x) = G, which implies that x is in the center, which is a contradiction. So, the only possible values for [G:C(x)] are 3 and 9.\n\nLet's consider the case where [G:C(x)] = 3 for all x outside of Z(G). In this case, the class equation becomes:\n\n27 = 3 + 3k\n\nwhere k is the number of conjugacy classes outside of Z(G). This equation implies that k = 8, which is not divisible by 3. However, the number of conjugacy classes must divide the order of the group, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be at least one x with [G:C(x)] = 9.\n\nLet x be an element in G with [G:C(x)] = 9. Then, |C(x)| = |G| / [G:C(x)] = 27 / 9 = 3. Since |C(x)| = 3, C(x) is a subgroup of G with order 3. Moreover, since x is not in the center, C(x) is not equal to Z(G). Thus, we have found two distinct subgroups of G with order 3: Z(G) and C(x).\n\nNow, let G' be the non-abelian group of order 27, which is the semidirect product of Z_3 and Z_9 (Z_n denotes the cyclic group of order n). We know that G' has a center of order 3 and an element x' with a centralizer of order 3. We can define a function f: G -> G' such that f(Z(G)) = Z(G') and f(C(x)) = C(x'). Since f preserves the group structure, it is an isomorphism between G and G'. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
