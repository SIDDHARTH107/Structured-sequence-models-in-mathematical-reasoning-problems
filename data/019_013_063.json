    "message_2": "In second-order logic, second-order variables can quantify over relations or functions. In this case, we have three binary relations and two individuals. \n\nLet's first consider the binary relations. Since there are three binary relations, we can have 2^3 = 8 different combinations of these relations. However, one of these combinations is the empty set, which is not considered a second-order variable. So, we have 8 - 1 = 7 distinct second-order variables for the binary relations.\n\nNow, let's consider the individuals. Since there are two individuals, we can have 2^2 = 4 different combinations of these individuals. However, one of these combinations is the empty set, which is not considered a second-order variable. So, we have 4 - 1 = 3 distinct second-order variables for the individuals.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct second-order variables that can be used in a formula in second-order logic with three binary relations and two individuals is 7 (from binary relations) + 3 (from individuals) = 10."
