    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is an integer that is congruent to a perfect square modulo a prime number p. In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo p if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod p).\n\nGiven the prime number p = 5, we will find all the quadratic residues modulo 5.\n\nWe can check all the integers from 0 to p-1, and calculate their squares modulo p:\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues modulo 5 are {0, 1, 4}."
