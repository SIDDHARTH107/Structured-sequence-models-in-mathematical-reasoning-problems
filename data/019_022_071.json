    "message_1": "A company is trying to decide whether to invest in a new manufacturing plant. If they invest, there is a 70% chance the plant will be profitable and a 30% chance it will not be profitable. If they do not invest, there is a 40% chance they will miss out on potential profits and a 60% chance they will avoid a potential loss. If the potential profit is $500,000 and the potential loss is $350,000, what is the expected value of the investment decision?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the investment decision, we need to consider both scenarios: investing and not investing.\n\n1. If they invest:\n- There is a 70% chance of making a profit of $500,000, so the expected value of profit is 0.7 * $500,000 = $350,000.\n- There is a 30% chance of losing $350,000, so the expected value of loss is 0.3 * $350,000 = $105,000.\n- The expected value of investing is the expected profit minus the expected loss: $350,000 - $105,000 = $245,000.\n\n2. If they do not invest:\n- There is a 40% chance of missing out on potential profits of $500,000, so the expected value of missed profit is 0.4 * $500,000 = $200,000.\n- There is a 60% chance of avoiding a potential loss of $350,000, so the expected value of avoided loss is 0.6 * $350,000 = $210,000.\n- The expected value of not investing is the expected value of avoided loss minus the expected value of missed profit: $210,000 - $200,000 = $10,000.\n\nComparing the expected values of both scenarios, the expected value of investing ($245,000) is greater than the expected value of not investing ($10,000). Therefore, the company should invest in the new manufacturing plant."
