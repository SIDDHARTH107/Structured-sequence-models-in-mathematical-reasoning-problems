    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base area of 36 square cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\n\nGiven that the base area is 36 square cm and the height is 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 36 × 10\n\nVolume = 12 × 10\n\nVolume = 120 cubic cm\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 120 cubic centimeters."
