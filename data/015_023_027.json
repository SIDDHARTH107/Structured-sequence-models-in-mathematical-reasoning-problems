    "message_2": "The Chirikov-Taylor map, also known as the standard map, is a 2D area-preserving map defined by the following equations:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n + y_{n+1} (mod 1)\ny_{n+1} = y_n + K * sin(2 * pi * x_n) (mod 1)\n\nwhere x_n and y_n are the coordinates of the phase space, and K is the parameter that controls the degree of chaos in the system.\n\nFor K=0.5, the system exhibits a mix of regular and chaotic behavior. To determine the percentage of initial conditions that lead to chaotic behavior, one would need to perform a numerical analysis, such as computing the Lyapunov exponent for a large number of initial conditions and checking if it is positive (indicating chaos).\n\nHowever, providing an exact percentage accurate to two decimal places is not feasible due to the complexity of the map and the dependence on initial conditions. The percentage of initial conditions leading to chaotic behavior can vary depending on the specific region of the phase space being considered."
