    "message_2": "To find the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Let's find the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups (order 8), by Sylow's third theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups (order 9), by Sylow's third theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: There is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup. In this case, G is the direct product of these subgroups, and G is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_9 ≅ Z_72, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: There is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and four 3-Sylow subgroups. The unique 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, and G has a semidirect product structure. There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9 and Z_4 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_9).\n\n3. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1: There are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup. The unique 3-Sylow subgroup is normal, and G has a semidirect product structure. There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9 and (Z_4 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_9.\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4: There are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, there is no normal Sylow subgroup, and G is a non-abelian simple group. However, there is no simple group of order 72, so this case is not possible.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72: Z_72, Z_8 ⋊ Z_9, Z_4 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_9), Z_8 ⋊ Z_9, and (Z_4 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_9. Out of these, 4 are non-abelian: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9, Z_4 × (Z_2 ⋊ Z_9), Z_8 ⋊ Z_9, and (Z_4 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_9. Thus, G can be isomorphic to any of these 4 non-abelian groups of order 72."
