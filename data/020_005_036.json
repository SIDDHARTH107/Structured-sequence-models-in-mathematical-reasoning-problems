    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to determine the optimal amount of two products, product X and product Y, to produce in order to maximize profit. The company has two machines, machine 1 and machine 2, with limited capacity. The production time for each product and machine is shown below:\n\n|            | Machine 1 | Machine 2 |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product X  |    4      |     3     |\n| Product Y  |    2      |     5     |\n\nThe company has 60 hours of production time available for machine 1 and 50 hours of production time available for machine 2. The profit for each unit of product X is $10 and for product Y is $8. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe constraints for the production time on each machine can be represented as linear inequalities:\n\nMachine 1: 4x + 2y ≤ 60\nMachine 2: 3x + 5y ≤ 50\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints as equalities to find the boundary lines:\n\nMachine 1: y = (60 - 4x) / 2\nMachine 2: y = (50 - 3x) / 5\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of these lines with the axes:\n\nFor Machine 1:\nx = 0 => y = (60 - 4*0) / 2 = 30\ny = 0 => x = (60 - 2*0) / 4 = 15\n\nFor Machine 2:\nx = 0 => y = (50 - 3*0) / 5 = 10\ny = 0 => x = (50 - 5*0) / 3 ≈ 16.67\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection point of the two lines:\n\n4x + 2y = 60\n3x + 5y = 50\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nx = 10\ny = 5\n\nSo, the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 10), (0, 30), (10, 5), and (15, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. (0, 10): Profit = 10*0 + 8*10 = 80\n2. (0, 30): Profit = 10*0 + 8*30 = 240\n3. (10, 5): Profit = 10*10 + 8*5 = 140\n4. (15, 0): Profit = 10*15 + 8*0 = 150\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 30), with a profit of $240. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product X and 30 units of product Y to maximize profit."
