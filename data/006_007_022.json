    "message_1": "Suppose the daily percentage change in the price of a certain stock is normally distributed with a mean of 0.5% and a standard deviation of 1.5%. What is the probability that the price of the stock will increase by at least 2% in a day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value we are interested in (2% increase) and then use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we are interested in (2% increase), μ is the mean (0.5%), and σ is the standard deviation (1.5%).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the percentages to decimals:\n\nX = 0.02\nμ = 0.005\nσ = 0.015\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (0.02 - 0.005) / 0.015\nz ≈ 1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use a standard normal distribution table to find the probability. Looking up a z-score of 1 in the table, we find that the probability of a value being less than 1 standard deviation above the mean is approximately 0.8413. Since we want the probability of the stock price increasing by at least 2%, we need to find the probability of the value being greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean. To do this, we subtract the probability we found from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 2%) = 1 - P(X < 2%)\nP(X ≥ 2%) = 1 - 0.8413\nP(X ≥ 2%) ≈ 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability that the price of the stock will increase by at least 2% in a day is approximately 15.87%."
