    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, for non-planar graphs, we can use the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15). Let's check if the graph is planar by using the inequality:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph might be planar. However, we need to check if it satisfies Euler's formula. Since we don't know the number of faces (F), we can rewrite Euler's formula as:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 10 + 15\nF = 7\n\nNow, let's check if the graph satisfies the condition for planar graphs, which is that each face must be bounded by at least 3 edges:\n\n3F ≤ 2E\n3 * 7 ≤ 2 * 15\n21 ≤ 30\n\nThe condition holds, so the graph is planar. Therefore, the genus of the graph is 0."
