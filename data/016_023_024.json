    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 3 (since each square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and 5 of them are filled).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497. Note that this value is independent of the number of iterations, as the fractal's dimension remains the same at every level of iteration."
