    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network of 50 computers, we can use the complementary probability concept. The complementary probability is the probability of an event not occurring, which in this case is the probability of a computer not being infected with ransomware.\n\nThe probability of a computer not being infected with ransomware is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of none of the 50 computers being infected with ransomware. Since the computers are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\nP(None of the 50 computers being infected) = 0.95^50 ≈ 0.129\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of at least one computer being infected with ransomware:\n\nP(At least one computer being infected) = 1 - P(None of the 50 computers being infected) = 1 - 0.129 ≈ 0.871\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a network of 50 computers, given that the probability of any one computer being infected with ransomware is 0.05, is approximately 0.871 or 87.1%."
