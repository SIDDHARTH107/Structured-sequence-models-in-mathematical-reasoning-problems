    "message_2": "To compute the sectional curvature, we need to find the Gaussian curvature and the shape operator. Let's start by finding the Gaussian curvature.\n\nThe given surface is defined by the equation F(x, y, z) = x^2 - 2y^2 - z = 0. We need to compute the first and second fundamental forms to find the Gaussian curvature.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of F:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z) = (2x, -4y, -1)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 0), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(1, 1, 0) = (2, -4, -1)\n\nNow, we find the tangent plane at the point (1, 1, 0). The tangent plane is given by the equation:\n\n2(x - 1) - 4(y - 1) - (z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x - 4y - z = -1\n\nNow, we parameterize the surface around the point (1, 1, 0). Let u = x - 1 and v = y - 1. Then, x = u + 1 and y = v + 1. Substituting these into the equation of the tangent plane, we get:\n\n2(u + 1) - 4(v + 1) - z = -1\n\nSolving for z, we get:\n\nz = 2u - 4v + 1\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form. We need the partial derivatives of the parameterization:\n\n∂r/∂u = (1, 0, 2)\n∂r/∂v = (0, 1, -4)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [ (∂r/∂u)·(∂r/∂u)   (∂r/∂u)·(∂r/∂v) ]\n      [ (∂r/∂u)·(∂r/∂v)   (∂r/∂v)·(∂r/∂v) ]\n\nI = [ 5  8 ]\n      [ 8 17 ]\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form. We need the second partial derivatives of the parameterization:\n\n∂²r/∂u² = (0, 0, 0)\n∂²r/∂u∂v = (0, 0, 0)\n∂²r/∂v² = (0, 0, 0)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [ (∂²r/∂u²)·N   (∂²r/∂u∂v)·N ]\n        [ (∂²r/∂u∂v)·N   (∂²r/∂v²)·N ]\n\nSince all second partial derivatives are zero, the second fundamental form is the zero matrix:\n\nII = [ 0  0 ]\n        [ 0  0 ]\n\nNow, we compute the Gaussian curvature K. K is given by the determinant of the shape operator, which is the product of the inverse of the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form:\n\nK = det( I^(-1) * II )\n\nSince the second fundamental form is the zero matrix, the Gaussian curvature K is zero.\n\nNow, we compute the shape operator. Since the Gaussian curvature is zero, the shape operator is also the zero matrix.\n\nFinally, we compute the sectional curvature in the direction of the vectors v and w. The sectional curvature is given by the formula:\n\nS(v, w) = (v·(Shape operator * w)) / (v·v * w·w - (v·w)^2)\n\nSince the shape operator is the zero matrix, the numerator is zero. Therefore, the sectional curvature is zero in the direction of the vectors v and w at the point (1, 1, 0)."
