    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 20 years. If the initial mass of the substance is 200 grams, find the mass remaining after 80 years.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass remaining after 80 years, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 200 grams, the half-life is 20 years, and the time elapsed is 80 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^(80 / 20)\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal mass = 200 * (1/16)\n\nFinal mass = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 80 years, there will be 12.5 grams of the radioactive substance remaining."
