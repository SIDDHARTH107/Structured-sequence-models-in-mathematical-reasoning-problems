    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will first find the probability of having 0 or 1 burglary in a week, and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of having at least 2 burglaries.\n\nLet's first find the probability of having 0 burglaries in a week. The probability of no burglary on any given day is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. Since there are 7 days in a week, the probability of having 0 burglaries in a week is (0.9)^7.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of having exactly 1 burglary in a week. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (days in a week), k is the number of successes (burglaries), p is the probability of success (0.1), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFor our problem, n = 7, k = 1, and p = 0.1. So, we have:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(7, 1) * (0.1)^1 * (0.9)^6\n\nC(7, 1) = 7 (since there are 7 ways to choose 1 day out of 7)\n\nP(X = 1) = 7 * (0.1) * (0.9)^6\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2 burglaries) = 1 - P(0 burglaries) - P(1 burglary)\n\nP(at least 2 burglaries) = 1 - (0.9)^7 - [7 * (0.1) * (0.9)^6]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.9)^7 ≈ 0.4783\n7 * (0.1) * (0.9)^6 ≈ 0.3832\n\nP(at least 2 burglaries) = 1 - 0.4783 - 0.3832 ≈ 1 - 0.8615 ≈ 0.1385\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 2 burglaries in that neighborhood in a week is approximately 0.1385 or 13.85%."
