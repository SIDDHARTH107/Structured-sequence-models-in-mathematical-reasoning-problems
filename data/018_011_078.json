The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of the intersection (A ∩ B) and set C. The Cartesian product of two sets is a set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nC = {6, 7}\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C is {(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7)}."
