    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible flow from node S to node T, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initialize flow in all edges to 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path from S to T in the residual graph.\n3. Update the residual capacities of the edges and reverse edges along the augmenting path.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Initial flow: All edges have 0 flow.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n\n   Path: S -> A -> D -> T\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(10, 10, 20) = 10\n\n3. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   S -> A: 10 - 10 = 0\n   A -> D: 10 - 10 = 0\n   D -> T: 20 - 10 = 10\n\n4. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Path: S -> B -> D -> T\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(5, 9, 10) = 5\n\n5. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   S -> B: 5 - 5 = 0\n   B -> D: 9 - 5 = 4\n   D -> T: 10 - 5 = 5\n\n6. Find another augmenting path:\n\n   Path: S -> C -> B -> D -> T\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(10, 10, 4, 5) = 4\n\n7. Update the residual capacities:\n\n   S -> C: 10 - 4 = 6\n   C -> B: 10 - 4 = 6\n   B -> D: 4 - 4 = 0\n   D -> T: 5 - 4 = 1\n\n8. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum possible flow from node S to node T is the sum of the flows along the paths we found: 10 + 5 + 4 = 19."
