    "message_2": "To prove that the union of A and B is a superset of both A and B, we need to show that every element in A and B is also an element in the union of A and B.\n\nThe union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}.\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A and B is also in A ∪ B:\n\nFor set A:\n- 2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor set B:\n- 3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 9 ∈ B and 9 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element in A and B is also in A ∪ B, we can conclude that the union of A and B is a superset of both A and B."
