    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we first rewrite the given differential equation as a system of first-order differential equations. Let $y_1(x) = y(x)$ and $y_2(x) = y'(x)$. Then, we have the following system:\n\n$$y_1'(x) = y_2(x)$$\n$$y_2'(x) = -(x^2 + 1)y_1(x)$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite this system as a complex differential equation by introducing a complex variable $z = x + iy$. We have:\n\n$$y_1'(z) = y_2(z)$$\n$$y_2'(z) = -(z^2 + 1)y_1(z)$$\n\nNext, we look for a solution of the form $y_1(z) = e^{f(z)}$, where $f(z)$ is a complex function. Then, we have:\n\n$$y_2(z) = f'(z)e^{f(z)}$$\n$$f''(z)e^{f(z)} = -(z^2 + 1)e^{f(z)}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $e^{f(z)}$, we get:\n\n$$f''(z) = -(z^2 + 1)$$\n\nNow, we can solve this complex differential equation for $f(z)$ using the method of variation of parameters. Let $f(z) = g(z) + h(z)$, where $g(z)$ is a particular solution and $h(z)$ is a homogeneous solution. We can guess a particular solution of the form $g(z) = -\\frac{1}{3}z^3$. Then, we have:\n\n$$g''(z) = -2z$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $f''(z)$, we get:\n\n$$h''(z) = -z^2 - 1 + 2z$$\n\nNow, we can solve this homogeneous equation using the method of undetermined coefficients. Let $h(z) = Az^2 + Bz + C$. Then, we have:\n\n$$h''(z) = 2A$$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get:\n\n$$2A = -1$$\n$$A = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$h(z) = -\\frac{1}{2}z^2 + Bz + C$$\n\nNow, we can find the general solution for $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = g(z) + h(z) = -\\frac{1}{3}z^3 - \\frac{1}{2}z^2 + Bz + C$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $y_1(z)$, we get:\n\n$$y_1(z) = e^{-\\frac{1}{3}z^3 - \\frac{1}{2}z^2 + Bz + C}$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. At $x = 0$, we have $z = 0$ and $y_1(0) = y(0) = 1$. Thus, we get:\n\n$$1 = e^C$$\n\nSo, $C = 0$. Now, we apply the second boundary condition, $y'(0) = 0$. We have:\n\n$$y_2(0) = f'(0)e^{f(0)} = (B)e^0 = 0$$\n\nThus, $B = 0$. Now, we have the solution:\n\n$$y_1(z) = e^{-\\frac{1}{3}z^3 - \\frac{1}{2}z^2}$$\n\nFinally, we want to find the solution at $x = \\pi/2$. We have:\n\n$$y(\\pi/2) = y_1(\\pi/2 + i0) = e^{-\\frac{1}{3}(\\pi/2)^3 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\pi/2)^2} \\approx 0.0076$$\n\nSo, the solution to the boundary value problem at $x = \\pi/2$ is approximately $0.0076$."
