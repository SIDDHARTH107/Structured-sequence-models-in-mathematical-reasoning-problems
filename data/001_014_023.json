    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √(32) ÷ √(8), we can first simplify the square roots individually:\n\n√(32) = √(2^5) = 2^(5/2)\n√(8) = √(2^3) = 2^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n2^(5/2) ÷ 2^(3/2)\n\nTo divide two numbers with the same base and different exponents, we subtract the exponents:\n\n2^(5/2 - 3/2) = 2^(2/2)\n\n2^(2/2) = 2^1\n\nSo, the simplified form of the expression is:\n\n2"
