    "message_2": "To calculate the sectional curvature, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the given point. The Gaussian curvature K can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nwhere E, F, G, L, M, and N are coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nFirst, let's find the gradient of the function f(x, y, z):\n\n∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt the point (1/√2, 1/√2, 0), the gradient is:\n\n∇f = (1, 1, 0)\n\nNow, let's find the tangent plane to the surface at this point. The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\n∇f • (x - x₀, y - y₀, z - z₀) = 0\n\nPlugging in the point (1/√2, 1/√2, 0) and the gradient, we get:\n\n1(x - 1/√2) + 1(y - 1/√2) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, G):\n\nE = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂x> = 1\nF = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂y> = 0\nG = <∂r/∂y, ∂r/∂y> = 1\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficients of the second fundamental form (L, M, N). To do this, we first need to find the unit normal vector N at the given point:\n\nN = ∇f / ||∇f|| = (1, 1, 0) / √2 = (1/√2, 1/√2, 0)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients L, M, and N:\n\nL = N • ∂²r/∂x² = 1/2\nM = N • ∂²r/∂x∂y = 0\nN = N • ∂²r/∂y² = 1/2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (1/2 * 1/2 - 0^2) / (1 * 1 - 0^2) = 1/4\n\nNow, we can find the sectional curvature along the plane spanned by the tangent vectors ∂/∂x and ∂/∂y. Since the tangent vectors are orthonormal, the sectional curvature is equal to the Gaussian curvature:\n\nSectional curvature = K = 1/4"
