    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\sqrt{2x+1} + 3 = 7$, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nSubtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n$\\sqrt{2x+1} = 4$\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n$(\\sqrt{2x+1})^2 = 4^2$\n$2x+1 = 16$\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n$2x = 15$\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nSo, the solution to the equation $\\sqrt{2x+1} + 3 = 7$ is $x = \\frac{15}{2}$."
