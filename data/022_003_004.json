    "message_2": "To compute the integral using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to check if the function is analytic inside and on the contour C. The function is analytic everywhere except at the point z = 1, which is inside the contour C.\n\nNow, we can use Cauchy's integral formula to compute the integral. Cauchy's integral formula states that for a function f(z) analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and a point a inside C:\n\n$$f^{(n)}(a) = \\frac{n!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^{n+1}} dz$$\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z+1}{(z-1)^3}$$\n\nWe want to find the integral of this function around the contour C, so we need to find the coefficient of the term $(z-1)^{-2}$ in the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around the point z = 1. To do this, we can differentiate f(z) once with respect to z and then evaluate the result at z = 1:\n\n$$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(\\frac{z+1}{(z-1)^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(z-1)^3} - \\frac{3(z+1)}{(z-1)^4}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(1):\n\n$$f'(1) = \\frac{1}{(1-1)^3} - \\frac{3(1+1)}{(1-1)^4} = -3$$\n\nNow, we can use Cauchy's integral formula to compute the integral:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{z+1}{(z-1)^3} dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot f'(1) = 2\\pi i \\cdot (-3) = -6\\pi i$$\n\nSo, the integral of the function around the contour C is:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\frac{z+1}{(z-1)^3} dz = -6\\pi i$$"
