Show that for any $x\\in X$, $F_x$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",
    "message_2": "Since $\\xi$ is isomorphic to the trivial bundle $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a vector bundle isomorphism $\\Phi: E \\rightarrow X \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that $\\Phi$ is a homeomorphism and it restricts to linear isomorphisms on each fiber, i.e., for each $x \\in X$, $\\Phi|_{F_x}: F_x \\rightarrow \\{x\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a linear isomorphism.\n\nNow, let's consider the fiber $F_x$ of $\\xi$ over $x \\in X$. We want to show that $F_x$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $\\Phi|_{F_x}$ is a linear isomorphism, it is also a homotopy equivalence. Thus, we have a homotopy equivalence between $F_x$ and $\\{x\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nNow, we need to show that $\\{x\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This is straightforward, as we can define a homotopy equivalence $H: \\{x\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ by $H(x, v) = v$. The inverse of this map is given by $H^{-1}(v) = (x, v)$. It is clear that both $H$ and $H^{-1}$ are continuous, and their compositions are the identity maps on $\\{x\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that for any $x \\in X$, the fiber $F_x$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This implies that the fiber homotopy type of $\\xi$ is the same as the fiber homotopy type of $\\mathbb{R}^n$."
