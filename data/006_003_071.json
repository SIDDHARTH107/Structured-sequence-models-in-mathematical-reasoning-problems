    "message_2": "To find the probability of drawing a queen from a deck of 52 cards, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 (since there are 4 queens) and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (since there are 52 cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a queen is:\n\nProbability = 4/52\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\nProbability = (4/4) / (52/4)\nProbability = 1/13\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a queen from a deck of 52 cards is 1/13 or approximately 0.0769 (rounded to four decimal places)."
