    "message_1": "In a region, the probability of a tornado occurring in a year is 0.02. Find the probability of a tornado not occurring in that region in 5 years.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a tornado not occurring in a year, we subtract the probability of a tornado occurring from 1:\n\nP(tornado not occurring in a year) = 1 - P(tornado occurring in a year)\nP(tornado not occurring in a year) = 1 - 0.02\nP(tornado not occurring in a year) = 0.98\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of a tornado not occurring in the region for 5 consecutive years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\nP(tornado not occurring in 5 years) = P(tornado not occurring in a year)^5\nP(tornado not occurring in 5 years) = (0.98)^5\nP(tornado not occurring in 5 years) â‰ˆ 0.90392\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado not occurring in that region in 5 years is approximately 0.90392 or 90.392%."
