    "message_1": "A manufacturer of t-shirts has 6 available colors and 4 available designs. In how many ways can they make a batch of 3 t-shirts such that each t-shirt has a different color and design combination?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the counting principle. For the first t-shirt, there are 6 color options and 4 design options, so there are 6 * 4 = 24 possible combinations.\n\nFor the second t-shirt, there are 5 remaining color options (since we want a different color) and 3 remaining design options (since we want a different design). So, there are 5 * 3 = 15 possible combinations for the second t-shirt.\n\nFor the third t-shirt, there are 4 remaining color options and 2 remaining design options. So, there are 4 * 2 = 8 possible combinations for the third t-shirt.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of combinations for each t-shirt to find the total number of ways to make a batch of 3 t-shirts with different color and design combinations: 24 * 15 * 8 = 2880 ways."
