    "message_2": "The number of distinct types of two-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that can be constructed using a finite-dimensional unitary modular tensor category as the input data is given by the number of distinct equivalence classes of such categories.\n\nA modular tensor category is a monoidal category with additional structures, such as a braiding, a twist, and a non-degenerate S-matrix. The classification of modular tensor categories is a difficult problem, and it is not yet completely solved. However, some partial results are known.\n\nFor example, it is known that any unitary modular tensor category can be realized as the representation category of a quantum group at a root of unity, or as the category of modules over a certain vertex operator algebra. The classification of these objects is also a difficult problem, but some results are known in specific cases.\n\nIn general, the number of distinct types of two-dimensional TQFTs that can be constructed using a finite-dimensional unitary modular tensor category as the input data depends on the specific properties of the category, and it is not possible to give a single number that applies to all cases. However, it is worth noting that the study of TQFTs and modular tensor categories has led to many interesting connections between mathematics and physics, and it is an active area of research."
