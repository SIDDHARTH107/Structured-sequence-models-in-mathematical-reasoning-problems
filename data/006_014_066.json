    "message_1": "A certain type of technological failure occurs in a system with a probability of 0.03. If the system is used 200 times, what is the probability that the failure will occur at least once?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of the failure occurring at least once is the probability of the failure not occurring at all in the 200 uses.\n\nThe probability of the failure not occurring in a single use is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nThe probability of the failure not occurring in all 200 uses is (0.97)^200.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of the failure occurring at least once by subtracting the complementary probability from 1:\n\nP(failure at least once) = 1 - P(failure not occurring in all 200 uses) = 1 - (0.97)^200 â‰ˆ 0.9956\n\nSo, the probability of the failure occurring at least once in 200 uses is approximately 0.9956 or 99.56%."
