Solve this problem using the theory of stochastic differential equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The SDE for geometric Brownian motion is well-known and has the following closed-form solution:\n\nS(t) = S(0) * exp((µ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that S(t) > 120 at time t = 3. To do this, we will standardize the process by taking the logarithm of S(t) and then subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. Let X(t) = ln(S(t)):\n\nX(t) = ln(S(0)) + (µ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t)\n\nWe know that W(t) is a standard Brownian motion, so W(t) ~ N(0, t). Thus, X(t) is normally distributed with mean:\n\nE[X(t)] = ln(S(0)) + (µ - (σ^2)/2) * t\n\nand variance:\n\nVar[X(t)] = σ^2 * t\n\nNow, let's plug in the values for µ, σ, S(0), and t:\n\nE[X(3)] = ln(100) + (0.12 - (0.4^2)/2) * 3 = 4.60517 + (0.12 - 0.08) * 3 = 4.60517 + 0.12 = 4.72517\n\nVar[X(3)] = (0.4^2) * 3 = 0.48\n\nStandard deviation:\n\nSD[X(3)] = sqrt(0.48) ≈ 0.69282\n\nNow, we standardize X(3) by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation:\n\nZ = (X(3) - E[X(3)]) / SD[X(3)]\n\nWe want to find the probability that S(3) > 120, which is equivalent to finding the probability that X(3) > ln(120):\n\nP(S(3) > 120) = P(X(3) > ln(120)) = P(Z > (ln(120) - E[X(3)]) / SD[X(3)])\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(Z > (ln(120) - 4.72517) / 0.69282) ≈ P(Z > 0.643)\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability:\n\nP(Z > 0.643) ≈ 1 - P(Z < 0.643) ≈ 1 - 0.73994 ≈ 0.26006\n\nTherefore, the probability that S(t) > 120 at time t = 3 is approximately 0.26006 or 26.006%."
