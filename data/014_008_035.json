    "message_1": "Suppose we have a block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks and uses a 128-bit key. If we use the cipher to encrypt a 1 GB file in CBC mode, how many blocks will the file be divided into, and how many times will the 128-bit key be used?",
    "message_2": "First, let's determine the number of blocks the 1 GB file will be divided into. Since the block cipher operates on 64-bit blocks, we need to convert the file size to bits and then divide by the block size.\n\n1 GB = 1 * 1024 MB = 1024 * 1024 KB = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes\n1 byte = 8 bits\nSo, 1 GB = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 8 bits\n\nNow, we'll divide the total number of bits by the block size (64 bits):\n\nNumber of blocks = (1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 8) / 64\nNumber of blocks = 1024 * 1024 * 128\n\nIn CBC mode, each block is encrypted using the 128-bit key. So, the key will be used as many times as there are blocks:\n\nNumber of times the 128-bit key is used = 1024 * 1024 * 128\n\nSo, the 1 GB file will be divided into 1024 * 1024 * 128 blocks, and the 128-bit key will be used 1024 * 1024 * 128 times."
