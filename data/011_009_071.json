    "message_1": "An ice cream shop offers 10 different flavors of ice cream. A customer wants to order 6 different ice cream cones, one for each member of their family. However, they want to make sure that no two cones have the same combination of ice cream flavors. How many different combinations of 6 cones can the customer order? (Hint: Use Bell numbers to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of Bell numbers. Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition the 10 ice cream flavors into 6 non-empty subsets, where each subset represents a combination of flavors for a cone.\n\nThe Bell number B(n) can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = sum of S(n, k) for k = 1 to n, where S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind, S(n, k), counts the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. It can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe want to compute B(10) - the Bell number for a set of size 10. To do this, we first compute the Stirling numbers S(10, k) for k = 1 to 10:\n\nS(10, 1) = 1 (there's only one way to partition a set into a single subset)\nS(10, 2) = 511\nS(10, 3) = 9330\nS(10, 4) = 34105\nS(10, 5) = 42525\nS(10, 6) = 22827\nS(10, 7) = 5880\nS(10, 8) = 750\nS(10, 9) = 45\nS(10, 10) = 1 (there's only one way to partition a set into 10 single-element subsets)\n\nNow, we can compute B(10) as the sum of these Stirling numbers:\n\nB(10) = 1 + 511 + 9330 + 34105 + 42525 + 22827 + 5880 + 750 + 45 + 1 = 115975\n\nHowever, we are interested in the number of ways to partition the 10 ice cream flavors into exactly 6 non-empty subsets (i.e., 6 cones with different combinations of flavors). This corresponds to the Stirling number S(10, 6):\n\nS(10, 6) = 22827\n\nSo, there are 22,827 different combinations of 6 cones that the customer can order."
