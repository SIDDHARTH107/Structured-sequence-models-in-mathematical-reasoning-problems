    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are not independent, and the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the others. Let's solve the first equation for z:\n\nz = 2x + 3y - 7\n\nNow we can write the general solution as:\n\n(x, y, 2x + 3y - 7)\n\nwhere x and y can be any real numbers."
