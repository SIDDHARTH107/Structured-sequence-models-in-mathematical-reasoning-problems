    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (a_n) = {1/n} converges in A or not, we need to find a limit point in A, if it exists.\n\nA sequence (a_n) converges to a limit point L in a topological space if for every open neighborhood U of L, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, a_n is in U.\n\nIn our case, A = [0,1) is a subspace of R with the subspace topology. The sequence (a_n) = {1/n} is a sequence of elements in A, since 1/n is in the interval [0,1) for all n ∈ N.\n\nNow, let's consider the limit of the sequence as n approaches infinity:\n\nlim (n→∞) (1/n) = 0\n\nThe limit of the sequence is 0, which is an element of A. Now, we need to check if the sequence converges to 0 in the subspace topology of A.\n\nLet U be an open neighborhood of 0 in A. Since A has the subspace topology, there exists an open interval (a, b) in R such that U = A ∩ (a, b). Note that 0 is in U, so a < 0 < b.\n\nNow, let ε = b. For any given ε > 0, we can find a natural number N such that 1/N < ε by the Archimedean property. Therefore, for all n > N, we have:\n\n0 < 1/n < b\n\nThis means that for all n > N, a_n = 1/n is in the open interval (a, b), and thus in the open neighborhood U of 0. This satisfies the definition of convergence in a topological space.\n\nHence, the sequence (a_n) = {1/n} converges to 0 in the subspace A = [0,1) with the subspace topology."
