    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a natural number p greater than 1, p is a prime number if and only if (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p).\n\nThe least positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 2. \n\nWhen p = 2, (p-1)! = 1! = 1, and 1 ≡ -1 (mod 2). Therefore, 2 is the least positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies Wilson's theorem."
