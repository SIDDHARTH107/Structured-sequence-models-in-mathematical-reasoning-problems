    "message_1": "A substitution cipher is created using a permutation of the 26 letters of the alphabet. If a particular plaintext message has 500 characters, how many possible ways are there to encode it using substitution ciphers?",
    "message_2": "There are 26! (26 factorial) ways to create a substitution cipher since each letter can be replaced by any of the remaining 25 letters, then the next by any of the remaining 24, and so on. So, there are 26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 possible substitution ciphers.\n\nFor a plaintext message with 500 characters, the number of possible ways to encode it using substitution ciphers is the same as the number of possible substitution ciphers, since each cipher would produce a unique encoded message.\n\nTherefore, there are 26! ways to encode the 500-character plaintext message using substitution ciphers."
