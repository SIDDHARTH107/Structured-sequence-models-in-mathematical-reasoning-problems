    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(4,4) is the smallest integer N such that any graph with N vertices will contain either a clique of size 4 (a complete subgraph with 4 vertices) or an independent set of size 4 (a set of 4 vertices with no edges between them). \n\nThe exact value of R(4,4) is 18. This means that in any graph with 18 vertices, there will always be either a clique of size 4 or an independent set of size 4."
