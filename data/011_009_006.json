    "message_2": "To divide a set of 6 distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the concept of partitioning. The Bell number, denoted by B(n), represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nThe Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle, which is constructed as follows:\n\n1. The first row contains only one element, B(0) = 1.\n2. The first element of each row (starting from the second row) is the last element of the previous row.\n3. Each subsequent element in a row is the sum of the element above it and the element to the left of the element above it.\n\nThe first few rows of the Bell triangle are:\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n...\n\nThe Bell number for a set of 6 distinct elements is B(6), which is the last element in the 7th row of the Bell triangle. To find B(6), we can continue constructing the Bell triangle:\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n15 20 27 37 52\n52 67 87 114 163 232\n\nThe last element in the 7th row is 232. Therefore, there are 232 ways to divide a set of 6 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
