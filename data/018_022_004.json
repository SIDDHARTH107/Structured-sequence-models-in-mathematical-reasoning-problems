    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B, which is the symmetric difference between sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {3, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product (A △ B) x C.\n\n(A △ B) x C = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find B △ A. Note that the symmetric difference is commutative, which means A △ B = B △ A.\n\nB △ A = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product (B △ A) x C.\n\n(B △ A) x C = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2)}\n\nComparing the results of (A △ B) x C and (B △ A) x C, we can see that they are equal:\n\n(A △ B) x C = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2)}\n(B △ A) x C = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2)}\n\nThis is because the symmetric difference is commutative (A △ B = B △ A), and the Cartesian product is distributive. Therefore, (A △ B) x C = (B △ A) x C."
