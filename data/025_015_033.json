    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $(-1,1,2)$, we first need to find the gradient of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $(-1,1,2)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(-1,1) = 2(-1) = -2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(-1,1) = 2(1) = 2$$\n\nThe gradient of the function at the point $(-1,1,2)$ is given by the vector $\\nabla f(-1,1) = \\langle -2, 2 \\rangle$. The tangent plane to the surface at this point has the normal vector given by the gradient, so the normal vector is $\\langle -2, 2, -1 \\rangle$ (the last component is -1 because the surface is defined by $z = f(x,y)$).\n\nNow, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane:\n\n$$A(x-x_0) + B(y-y_0) + C(z-z_0) = 0$$\n\nwhere $(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (-1,1,2)$ is the point on the plane and $(A, B, C) = (-2, 2, -1)$ is the normal vector. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n$$-2(x+1) + 2(y-1) - (z-2) = 0$$\n\nSimplifying, we obtain the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n$$-2x - 2 + 2y - 2 - z + 2 = 0$$\n$$-2x + 2y - z = 0$$"
