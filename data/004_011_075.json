    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 3 feet per second. At the moment when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, it is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 4 feet per second. If the ladder is 10 feet long, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall at this moment? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so we have the following relationship by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that when x = 6 feet, dx/dt = 4 feet per second. We need to find dy/dt when x = 6 feet. First, we need to find the value of y when x = 6 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(4) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n48 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -48\ndy/dt = -48 / 16\ndy/dt = -3\n\nSo, at the moment when the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 3 feet per second."
