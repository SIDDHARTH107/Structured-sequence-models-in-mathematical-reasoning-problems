    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 1 cm away from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop with a radius of 1 cm (since we want to find the magnetic field strength 1 cm away from the wire) as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field (B) is constant along this circular path, and the differential length element (dl) is tangential to the circle. Therefore, the dot product B • dl = B * dl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's Law for our chosen circular path:\n\n∮ B * dl = B * ∮ dl = B * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nHere, r is the radius of the circular path, which is 1 cm or 0.01 m.\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nSince the wire carries a current of 4 A, the enclosed current (I_enclosed) is 4 A.\n\nNow we can solve for the magnetic field strength (B):\n\nB * (2 * π * 0.01 m) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 4 A\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 0.01 m)\n\nB ≈ 2 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength 1 cm away from the wire is approximately 2 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
