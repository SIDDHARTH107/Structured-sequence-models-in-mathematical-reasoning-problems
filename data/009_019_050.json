    "message_1": "Consider the following stochastic differential equation:\n\n$dX_t = (X_t + 2)dt + 3dW_t,$ \n\nwith $X_0 = 1,$ and $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion. \n\nWhat is the probability that $X_{1.5} > 2$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this stochastic differential equation (SDE), we first need to find the solution for $X_t$. This SDE is a linear SDE with drift term $(X_t + 2)$ and diffusion term $3$. We can rewrite the SDE as:\n\n$dX_t - (X_t + 2)dt = 3dW_t.$\n\nNow, we apply the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is given by $e^{-\\int dt} = e^{-t}$. Multiply both sides of the SDE by the integrating factor:\n\n$e^{-t}dX_t - e^{-t}(X_t + 2)dt = 3e^{-t}dW_t.$\n\nThe left-hand side is the differential of the product $e^{-t}X_t$:\n\n$d(e^{-t}X_t) = 3e^{-t}dW_t.$\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $t$:\n\n$\\int_0^t d(e^{-s}X_s) = \\int_0^t 3e^{-s}dW_s.$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$e^{-t}X_t - e^0X_0 = 3\\int_0^t e^{-s}dW_s.$\n\nSince $X_0 = 1$, we have:\n\n$e^{-t}X_t - 1 = 3\\int_0^t e^{-s}dW_s.$\n\nNow, solve for $X_t$:\n\n$X_t = e^t(e^{-t}X_t - 1) = e^t(1 + 3\\int_0^t e^{-s}dW_s).$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_{1.5} > 2$. Since $X_t$ is a random variable, we can find its mean and variance. The mean of $X_t$ is given by:\n\n$E[X_t] = e^t(1 + 3E[\\int_0^t e^{-s}dW_s]) = e^t,$\n\nsince the expected value of the stochastic integral is zero. The variance of $X_t$ is given by:\n\n$Var[X_t] = E[(X_t - E[X_t])^2] = E[((3\\int_0^t e^{-s}dW_s))^2].$\n\nUsing Ito's isometry, we have:\n\n$Var[X_t] = 3^2\\int_0^t e^{-2s}ds = 9\\frac{1 - e^{-2t}}{2}.$\n\nAt $t = 1.5$, we have:\n\n$E[X_{1.5}] = e^{1.5},$\n\n$Var[X_{1.5}] = 9\\frac{1 - e^{-3}}{2}.$\n\nNow, we can standardize the random variable $X_{1.5}$:\n\n$Z = \\frac{X_{1.5} - E[X_{1.5}]}{\\sqrt{Var[X_{1.5}]}}.$\n\nWe want to find the probability $P(X_{1.5} > 2)$, which is equivalent to finding $P(Z > \\frac{2 - E[X_{1.5}]}{\\sqrt{Var[X_{1.5}]}})$. Using the values we found for the mean and variance, we have:\n\n$P(Z > \\frac{2 - e^{1.5}}{\\sqrt{9\\frac{1 - e^{-3}}{2}}}).$\n\nThis probability can be found using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator."
