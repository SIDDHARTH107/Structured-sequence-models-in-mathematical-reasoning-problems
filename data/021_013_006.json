    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem for a student to solve using simulated annealing method:\n\nA manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, using two machines, M1 and M2. The company wants to optimize production to maximize profit. A unit of product A sells for $10 and requires 1 hour of production time on machine M1 and 2 hours of production time on machine M2. A unit of product B sells for $15 and requires 2 hours of production time on machine M1 and 1 hour of production time on machine M2. The company has 80 hours of available production time on machine M1 and 100 hours of available production time on machine M2. Using simulated annealing method, what is the maximum profit that the company can make?\n\nNote: The profit is calculated by subtracting the total production cost from the total revenue. The production cost is calculated by multiplying the production time of each product by the hourly production cost of the respective machine. The hourly production cost of machine M1 is $5 and the hourly production cost of machine M2 is $7.",
    "message_2": "Let's first define the variables and constraints:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x * 1 hour + y * 2 hours <= 80 hours (Machine M1 constraint)\n2. x * 2 hours + y * 1 hour <= 100 hours (Machine M2 constraint)\n3. x >= 0 and y >= 0 (Non-negative production quantities)\n\nObjective function (profit):\nRevenue: 10x + 15y\nCost: (x * 1 hour * $5) + (y * 2 hours * $5) + (x * 2 hours * $7) + (y * 1 hour * $7)\nSimplifying the cost: 5x + 10y + 14x + 7y = 19x + 17y\nProfit: (10x + 15y) - (19x + 17y) = -9x - 2y\n\nNow, we will use the simulated annealing method to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Initialize the solution: Start with a random solution (x, y) within the constraints.\n2. Set an initial temperature T and a cooling rate α.\n3. Repeat until the temperature is low enough:\n   a. Generate a random neighboring solution (x', y') within the constraints.\n   b. Calculate the change in profit ΔP = profit(x', y') - profit(x, y).\n   c. If ΔP > 0, accept the new solution (x', y').\n   d. If ΔP <= 0, accept the new solution with probability exp(ΔP / T).\n   e. Update the temperature T = α * T.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit. The maximum profit can then be calculated using the objective function: -9x - 2y."
