    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $y^2 - x^3 = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0 \\Rightarrow -3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo, the only point where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero is $(0, 0)$. However, we need to check if this point is actually a singular point of the algebraic variety. A point is singular if the rank of the Jacobian matrix at that point is less than the dimension of the variety.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of $f(x, y)$ is:\n\n$J(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} -3x^2 & 2y \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAt the point $(0, 0)$, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\n$J(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe rank of this matrix is 0, which is less than the dimension of the variety (which is 1, since it's a curve in the real plane). Therefore, the point $(0, 0)$ is a singular point of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $y^2 - x^3 = 0$."
