    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we need to analyze the properties of the given groups and compare them with the properties of a group of order 10.\n\n1. Cyclic group C10: A cyclic group of order 10 is generated by a single element, say g, and its elements are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^9}. Since the order of the group is 10, which is the product of two distinct prime numbers (2 and 5), it is possible that G is isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5: The dihedral group D5 has order 2 * 5 = 10, which is the same as the order of G. D5 consists of the symmetries of a regular pentagon, including rotations and reflections. It has a cyclic subgroup of order 5 (generated by a rotation) and another subgroup of order 2 (generated by a reflection). Since the order of G is 10, it is also possible that G is isomorphic to D5.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10: A non-abelian group is a group that does not satisfy the commutative property, i.e., there exist elements a and b in the group such that ab â‰  ba. The dihedral group D5 is an example of a non-abelian group of order 10. However, we have already considered D5 as a separate option, so this option is redundant.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G of order 10 can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. Without more information about the properties of G, we cannot determine which one it is isomorphic to."
