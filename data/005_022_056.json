    "message_1": "A company claims that the average hourly salary of their employees is $25 with a standard deviation of $2.50. A math student collects a random sample of 25 employees and finds that the average hourly salary is $24.50. \n\nUsing robust statistics, can the student reject the company's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the student can reject the company's claim at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a hypothesis test using the z-test statistic.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average hourly salary is $25 (µ = 25).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average hourly salary is not $25 (µ ≠ 25).\n\nGiven information:\nSample mean (x̄) = $24.50\nPopulation mean (µ) = $25\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = $2.50\nSample size (n) = 25\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\nSE = σ / √n = $2.50 / √25 = $0.50\n\nNext, we calculate the z-test statistic:\nz = (x̄ - µ) / SE = ($24.50 - $25) / $0.50 = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance. The critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance is ±1.96.\n\nSince the calculated z-test statistic (-1) falls within the range of the critical z-values (-1.96 and 1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the average hourly salary of their employees is $25 at a 5% level of significance."
