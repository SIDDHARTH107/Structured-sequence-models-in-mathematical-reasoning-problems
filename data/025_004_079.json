    "message_2": "A smooth cubic surface X in projective 3-space over the complex numbers can be defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in four variables. The problem of determining the number of lines in X up to projective equivalence is a classical problem in algebraic geometry.\n\nThe number of lines on a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space over the complex numbers is 27. This result was first proven by Arthur Cayley and George Salmon in the 19th century.\n\nThe proof of this result relies on the study of the geometry of the cubic surface and the properties of its associated linear system. One way to approach the problem is by considering the intersection of X with a general hyperplane H. This intersection is a plane cubic curve C, and lines on X correspond to the flexes (points of inflection) of C. By counting the number of flexes on a general plane cubic curve, we can determine the number of lines on X.\n\nA general plane cubic curve has 9 flexes (by the Pl√ºcker formula), and each line on X corresponds to 3 flexes on C (since a line intersects a general hyperplane in 3 points). Therefore, there are 9/3 = 3 lines on X that intersect H. Since there are 9 possible choices for H (as H varies among the hyperplanes in the dual projective 3-space), the total number of lines on X is 3 * 9 = 27."
