Determine the symmetries of M under the action of the group of rotations in the plane, i.e., determine all pairs of angles α, β such that the transformation\n\n(x', y') = (cos(α)x - sin(α)y, sin(α)x + cos(α)y)\n\nfollowed by\n\n(x'', y'') = (cos(β)x' - sin(β)y', sin(β)x' + cos(β)y')\n\nleaves M invariant.",
    "message_2": "To find the symmetries of the manifold M under the action of the group of rotations in the plane, we need to find all pairs of angles α and β such that the transformation leaves M invariant. In other words, we need to find α and β such that after applying both transformations, we end up with the same point on the manifold M.\n\nLet's first apply the transformation (x', y'):\n\nx' = cos(α)x - sin(α)y\ny' = sin(α)x + cos(α)y\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation (x'', y''):\n\nx'' = cos(β)x' - sin(β)y'\ny'' = sin(β)x' + cos(β)y'\n\nSubstituting x' and y' into the equations for x'' and y'':\n\nx'' = cos(β)(cos(α)x - sin(α)y) - sin(β)(sin(α)x + cos(α)y)\ny'' = sin(β)(cos(α)x - sin(α)y) + cos(β)(sin(α)x + cos(α)y)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equations:\n\nx'' = (cos(α)cos(β) + sin(α)sin(β))x - (cos(α)sin(β) - sin(α)cos(β))y\ny'' = (sin(α)cos(β) - cos(α)sin(β))x + (sin(α)sin(β) + cos(α)cos(β))y\n\nUsing the trigonometric identities cos(α ± β) = cos(α)cos(β) ∓ sin(α)sin(β) and sin(α ± β) = sin(α)cos(β) ± cos(α)sin(β), we can rewrite the equations as:\n\nx'' = cos(α + β)x - sin(α + β)y\ny'' = sin(α + β)x + cos(α + β)y\n\nFor the transformation to leave M invariant, we must have:\n\nx = x''\ny = y''\n\nSo, we need to find α and β such that:\n\nx = cos(α + β)x - sin(α + β)y\ny = sin(α + β)x + cos(α + β)y\n\nThis system of equations is satisfied if either:\n\n1. α + β = 0 (mod 2π)\n2. α + β = π (mod 2π)\n\nIn the first case, α = -β (mod 2π), which means that the second rotation is the inverse of the first rotation. In the second case, α = π - β (mod 2π), which means that the second rotation is the reflection of the first rotation.\n\nSo, the pairs of angles (α, β) that leave the manifold M invariant are:\n\n(α, -α + 2πn) and (α, π - α + 2πn)\n\nwhere n is an integer."
