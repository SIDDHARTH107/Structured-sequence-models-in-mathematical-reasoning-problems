    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a Rail Fence cipher with 3 levels, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the letters in each row from left to right to get the encrypted message:\n\nHORELWLDLO\n\nSo, the Rail Fence cipher encryption of \"HELLO WORLD\" with 3 levels is \"HORELWLDLO\"."
