    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, there are 20 houses. The probability of a burglary occurring in one of those houses is 0.15. \n\nWhat is the probability of at least 3 houses experiencing a burglary?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 3 houses experiencing a burglary, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of 0, 1, or 2 houses experiencing a burglary. Then, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 3 houses experiencing a burglary.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of houses (20), k is the number of houses experiencing a burglary, p is the probability of a burglary occurring in one house (0.15), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 houses experiencing a burglary:\n\nP(X = 0) = (20C0) * (0.15^0) * (1-0.15)^(20-0)\nP(X = 1) = (20C1) * (0.15^1) * (1-0.15)^(20-1)\nP(X = 2) = (20C2) * (0.15^2) * (1-0.15)^(20-2)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.3585\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.3757\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.2067\n\nNow, let's find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) ≈ 0.3585 + 0.3757 + 0.2067 ≈ 0.9409\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of at least 3 houses experiencing a burglary:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) ≈ 1 - 0.9409 ≈ 0.0591\n\nSo, the probability of at least 3 houses experiencing a burglary is approximately 0.0591 or 5.91%."
