If a new student has grades of 90 in math, 85 in English, and 75 in history, which class should the student be enrolled in based on the discriminant analysis?",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we need to calculate the discriminant score for each class and then compare the scores to determine which class the new student should be enrolled in. The discriminant score is calculated using the following formula:\n\nDiscriminant Score = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the student's average grade, μ is the class average, and σ is the standard deviation of the class.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average grade for the new student:\n\nAverage Grade = (90 + 85 + 75) / 3 = 250 / 3 ≈ 83.33\n\nNow, let's calculate the discriminant scores for each class:\n\nClass 1:\nDiscriminant Score = (83.33 - 80) / 10 = 3.33 / 10 = 0.333\n\nClass 2:\nDiscriminant Score = (83.33 - 70) / 15 = 13.33 / 15 ≈ 0.889\n\nSince the discriminant score for Class 2 (0.889) is higher than the discriminant score for Class 1 (0.333), the new student should be enrolled in Class 2 based on the discriminant analysis."
