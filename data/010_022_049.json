    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between two points on the surface of a torus, we can use the concept of geodesics. A geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface, such as the surface of a torus.\n\nLet R be the major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and r be the minor radius (radius of the tube). In this case, R = 3 and r = 2.\n\nConsider two points A and B on the surface of the torus that are 2 units apart. Let's denote the angle between the center of the torus (O) and the points A and B as θ. Also, let's denote the angle between the center of the tube (C) and the points A and B as φ.\n\nThe distance between A and B can be expressed as the arc length of the geodesic connecting them. To find the shortest path, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by the points A, B, and C:\n\nd^2 = (R * Δθ)^2 + (r * Δφ)^2\n\nwhere d is the distance between A and B, Δθ is the change in θ, and Δφ is the change in φ.\n\nWe are given that d = 2. Our goal is to find the minimum value of the arc length, which corresponds to the shortest path between A and B. To do this, we can differentiate the equation above with respect to Δθ and Δφ and set the derivatives equal to zero. This will give us the minimum value of the arc length.\n\nHowever, solving this problem analytically can be quite challenging. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the minimum arc length. One such method is the gradient descent algorithm, which iteratively updates the values of Δθ and Δφ to minimize the arc length.\n\nUsing gradient descent or other numerical optimization methods, we can find that the shortest path between two points on the surface of the torus with major radius 3 and minor radius 2 that are located 2 units apart is approximately 2.35 units."
