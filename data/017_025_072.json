    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 120 and use the formula for the number of groups of a given order.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(k-1) * (p^k - 1)) / k\n\nwhere n(G) is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order G, p is a prime number, and k is the highest power of p that divides G.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, we have k = 3, so we have:\n\nn(2^3) = (2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1)) / 3 = (4 * 7) / 3 = 28 / 3\n\nFor the prime factor 3, we have k = 1, so we have:\n\nn(3^1) = (3^(1-1) * (3^1 - 1)) / 1 = (1 * 2) / 1 = 2\n\nFor the prime factor 5, we have k = 1, so we have:\n\nn(5^1) = (5^(1-1) * (5^1 - 1)) / 1 = (1 * 4) / 1 = 4\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order G, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = n(2^3) * n(3^1) * n(5^1) = (28/3) * 2 * 4 = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
