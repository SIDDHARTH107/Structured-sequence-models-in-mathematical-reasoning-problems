    "message_1": "In how many ways can you arrange a sequence of 6 parentheses such that they are balanced (i.e., every open parenthesis has a corresponding close parenthesis) according to the Catalan numbers formula?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to arrange a balanced sequence of 6 parentheses, we can use the Catalan numbers formula. The formula for the nth Catalan number is:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nIn this case, since there are 6 parentheses, we have 3 pairs of parentheses, so n = 3. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nC(3) = (1/(3+1)) * (2*3! / (3! * 3!))\nC(3) = (1/4) * (6! / (3! * 3!))\nC(3) = (1/4) * (720 / (6 * 6))\nC(3) = (1/4) * (720 / 36)\nC(3) = (1/4) * 20\nC(3) = 5\n\nSo there are 5 ways to arrange a balanced sequence of 6 parentheses."
