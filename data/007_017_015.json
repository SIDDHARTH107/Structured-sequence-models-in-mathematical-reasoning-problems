    "message_2": "Twin primes are pairs of primes that have a difference of 2. To find the smallest twin primes larger than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if their neighbors (either +2 or -2) are also prime.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 100 is 101. Its neighbor, 101 + 2 = 103, is also a prime number. Therefore, the smallest twin primes larger than 100 are 101 and 103."
