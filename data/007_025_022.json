    "message_1": "Consider two users, Alice and Bob, who want to exchange a secret key over an insecure channel. They agree on a prime number p=11 and a primitive root g=2. Alice chooses a secret integer a=3 and calculates A=2^3 (mod 11). Bob chooses a secret integer b=5 and calculates B=2^5 (mod 11). What is the shared secret key that they can use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B:\n\nA = 2^3 (mod 11) = 8 (mod 11) = 8\nB = 2^5 (mod 11) = 32 (mod 11) = 10\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using the following formulas:\n\nShared secret key for Alice = B^a (mod p) = 10^3 (mod 11)\nShared secret key for Bob = A^b (mod p) = 8^5 (mod 11)\n\nBoth of these calculations should result in the same shared secret key. Let's calculate them:\n\nShared secret key for Alice = 10^3 (mod 11) = 1000 (mod 11) = 10\nShared secret key for Bob = 8^5 (mod 11) = 32768 (mod 11) = 10\n\nSo, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for their communication is 10."
