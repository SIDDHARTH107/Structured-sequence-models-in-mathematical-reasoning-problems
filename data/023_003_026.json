    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume a general solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients $A_n$. To do this, we will plug the general solution into the given partial differential equation and boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, let's find the second derivative of $u(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} -n^2 A_n \\sin(nx)$$\n\nNow, plug the general solution and its second derivative into the partial differential equation:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} -n^2 A_n \\sin(nx) - 4\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx) = 0$$\n\nThis equation must hold for all $x$. Therefore, the coefficients of the sine terms must be equal:\n\n$$-n^2 A_n - 4A_n = 0$$\n\nSolve for $A_n$:\n\n$$A_n(n^2 + 4) = 0$$\n\nSince $n \\neq 0$, we have:\n\n$$A_n = 0$$\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\n$$u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 0 \\sin(nx) = 0$$\n\nThis solution satisfies the given boundary conditions:\n\n$$u(0) = 0$$\n$$u(\\pi) = 0$$\n\nSo, the general solution to the given partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions is:\n\n$$u(x) = 0$$"
