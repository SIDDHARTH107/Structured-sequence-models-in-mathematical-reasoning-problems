    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation: \n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is the temperature distribution in a rectangular plate, k is the thermal diffusivity and x, y are the spatial coordinates. \n\nSuppose the plate measures 5cm × 10cm and has fixed temperature boundary conditions along the edges given by u(0,y,t) = u(5,y,t) = 0 and u(x,0,t) = u(x,10,t) = 0. The initial temperature distribution on the plate is u(x,y,0) = 100 - 4x - 10y (in Celsius). \n\nIf k = 0.1 cm²/s, what is the temperature distribution on the plate after 10 seconds have passed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the partial differential equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by kXYT, we get:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = (X''(x) / X(x)) + (Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we call -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -μ\nY''(y) / Y(y) = -(λ + μ)\n\nNow we have three ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) T'(t) = -kλT(t)\n2) X''(x) = -μX(x)\n3) Y''(y) = -(λ + μ)Y(y)\n\nSolving equation (2) with boundary conditions X(0) = X(5) = 0, we get:\n\nX(x) = C1*sin(√μx)\n\nSolving equation (3) with boundary conditions Y(0) = Y(10) = 0, we get:\n\nY(y) = C2*sin(√(λ + μ)y)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑[A_mn * sin(√μ_m * x) * sin(√(λ_mn + μ_m) * y) * e^(-kλ_mn*t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_mn, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = 100 - 4x - 10y:\n\n100 - 4x - 10y = ∑∑[A_mn * sin(√μ_m * x) * sin(√(λ_mn + μ_m) * y)]\n\nWe can find the coefficients A_mn by using Fourier sine series. However, calculating the coefficients and summing the series is quite complex and not practical to do by hand. Instead, we can use numerical methods or specialized software to find the temperature distribution after 10 seconds."
