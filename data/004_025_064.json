    "message_1": "A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 50 m/s from a height of 2 meters above the ground. Using calculus, determine the maximum height the ball reaches and the time it takes to reach that height. (Assume acceleration due to gravity as -9.81 m/s^2)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the position function of the ball with respect to time. We know the initial velocity (v0) is 50 m/s and the acceleration due to gravity (a) is -9.81 m/s^2. \n\nFirst, we find the velocity function by integrating the acceleration function:\n\na(t) = -9.81 m/s^2\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-9.81) dt = -9.81t + C1\n\nTo find the constant C1, we use the initial velocity:\n\nv(0) = 50 m/s = -9.81(0) + C1\nC1 = 50 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -9.81t + 50\n\nNext, we find the position function by integrating the velocity function:\n\ns(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-9.81t + 50) dt = -4.905t^2 + 50t + C2\n\nTo find the constant C2, we use the initial height:\n\ns(0) = 2 m = -4.905(0)^2 + 50(0) + C2\nC2 = 2 m\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -4.905t^2 + 50t + 2\n\nTo find the maximum height, we need to find when the velocity is 0 (when the ball stops going up and starts falling down). We set v(t) to 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = -9.81t + 50\nt = 50 / 9.81\nt ≈ 5.099 seconds\n\nNow, we plug this value of t into the position function to find the maximum height:\n\ns(5.099) = -4.905(5.099)^2 + 50(5.099) + 2\ns(5.099) ≈ 127.85 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height the ball reaches is approximately 127.85 meters, and it takes about 5.099 seconds to reach that height."
