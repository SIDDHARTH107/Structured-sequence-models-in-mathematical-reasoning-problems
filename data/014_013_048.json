    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix, we first need to convert the letters into their corresponding numerical values using the standard mapping (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n\nH -> 7\nE -> 4\nL -> 11\nL -> 11\nO -> 14\n\nNow, we need to arrange these values into a matrix. Since the key matrix is 2x2, we will arrange the message into a 2xN matrix, where N is half the length of the message (rounded up if necessary). In this case, N=3.\n\n    [  7  11  14 ]\n    [  4  11  -1 ]\n\nNote that we have added a -1 to the last position since the message length is odd. This value will be ignored when decrypting the message.\n\nNext, we multiply the key matrix by the message matrix:\n\n    [ 5  8 ] [  7  11  14 ]   [ (5*7 + 8*4)  (5*11 + 8*11)  (5*14 + 8*(-1)) ]\n    [17 3 ] [  4  11  -1 ] = [ (17*7 + 3*4) (17*11 + 3*11) (17*14 + 3*(-1)) ]\n\nCalculating the values:\n\n    [ 56  99  66 ]\n    [ 123 204 233 ]\n\nNow, we need to take the result modulo 26 to get the encrypted message:\n\n    [ 4  21  14 ]\n    [ 21 0  7 ]\n\nFinally, we convert these values back into letters:\n\n4 -> E\n21 -> V\n14 -> O\n21 -> V\n0 -> A\n7 -> H\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"EVOVAH\". Note that the last letter 'H' is not part of the original message and can be ignored when decrypting. The final encrypted message is \"EVOVA\"."
