    "message_2": "The correlation coefficient (r) between two variables X and Y can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = Cov(X, Y) / (SD(X) * SD(Y))\n\nwhere Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between X and Y, SD(X) is the standard deviation of X, and SD(Y) is the standard deviation of Y.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\nCov(X, Y) = -30\nSD(X) = 5\nSD(Y) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = (-30) / (5 * 10)\n\nr = -30 / 50\n\nr = -0.6\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the two variables X and Y is -0.6."
