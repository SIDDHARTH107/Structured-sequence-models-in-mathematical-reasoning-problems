It is initially displaced 0.2 meters from equilibrium and released from rest. \nWhat is the amplitude, frequency, and period of this oscillator's motion?

    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the amplitude, frequency, and period of the oscillator's motion. Then, we will find the velocity and acceleration of the oscillator when it is at a displacement of 0.1 meters from equilibrium.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the oscillator is initially displaced 0.2 meters from equilibrium, so the amplitude is 0.2 meters.\n\n2. Angular frequency (ω) and frequency (f): The angular frequency is related to the spring constant (k) and the mass (m) by the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(20 N/m / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(40 s^(-2)) = 2πf\n\nThe frequency (f) is related to the angular frequency (ω) by the formula:\n\nf = ω / 2π\n\nSo, f = sqrt(40 s^(-2)) / 2π ≈ 1.006 Hz\n\n3. Period (T): The period is the time it takes for the oscillator to complete one full cycle of motion. It is the reciprocal of the frequency:\n\nT = 1/f ≈ 1/1.006 Hz ≈ 0.994 s\n\nNow, let's find the velocity (v) and acceleration (a) of the oscillator when it is at a displacement of 0.1 meters from equilibrium.\n\nThe displacement (x) of a simple harmonic oscillator as a function of time (t) is given by:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt)\n\nThe velocity (v) is the derivative of the displacement with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = -Aω * sin(ωt)\n\nThe acceleration (a) is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time (or the second derivative of the displacement):\n\na(t) = -Aω^2 * cos(ωt)\n\nTo find the time (t) when the oscillator is at a displacement of 0.1 meters, we can use the displacement equation:\n\n0.1 m = 0.2 m * cos(ωt)\n\ncos(ωt) = 0.5\n\nωt = cos^(-1)(0.5)\n\nSince ω = 2πf, we can substitute:\n\n2πft = cos^(-1)(0.5)\n\nt ≈ 0.994 s / 4 ≈ 0.2485 s (since cos^(-1)(0.5) corresponds to π/3 radians or 60 degrees, and there are four 60-degree intervals in a full cycle)\n\nNow, we can find the velocity and acceleration at this time:\n\nv(0.2485 s) = -0.2 m * 2π * 1.006 Hz * sin(2π * 1.006 Hz * 0.2485 s) ≈ -0.707 m/s\n\na(0.2485 s) = -0.2 m * (2π * 1.006 Hz)^2 * cos(2π * 1.006 Hz * 0.2485 s) ≈ 14.142 m/s^2\n\nSo, the velocity of the oscillator when it is at a displacement of 0.1 meters from equilibrium is approximately -0.707 m/s, and the acceleration is approximately 14.142 m/s^2."
