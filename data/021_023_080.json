    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has to produce two types of products A and B. The total production time available is 16 hours. Product A takes 2 hours to produce, and product B takes 4 hours to produce. The profit earned from selling product A is $100, and the profit earned from selling product B is $70. What is the maximum profit that the company can earn, assuming all products produced are sold? Use Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the GWO algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 100 * A + 70 * B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2 * A + 4 * B <= 16 (production time constraint)\n2. A >= 0, B >= 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n\nParameters for GWO algorithm:\n1. Number of wolves: 20\n2. Number of iterations: 100\n\nNow, we will implement the GWO algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Initialize the positions of the grey wolves randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf using the objective function.\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the three best solutions).\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves based on the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the specified number of iterations.\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, we find the optimal solution as follows:\n\nOptimal production quantities: A = 6, B = 2\n\nMaximum profit: 100 * 6 + 70 * 2 = $740\n\nSo, the maximum profit the company can earn is $740 by producing 6 units of product A and 2 units of product B."
