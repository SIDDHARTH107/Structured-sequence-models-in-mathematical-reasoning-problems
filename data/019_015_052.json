    "message_2": "In Type theory, the types of the variables are as follows:\n\n1. x is an integer, so its type is Integer.\n2. y is a real number, so its type is Real.\n3. z is a complex number, so its type is Complex.\n\nNow, let's order them from the narrowest to the widest:\n\n1. Integer (x) - This is the narrowest type, as integers are whole numbers and a subset of real numbers.\n2. Real (y) - Real numbers include integers as well as decimal numbers (fractions), making it a wider type than integers.\n3. Complex (z) - Complex numbers include real numbers and imaginary numbers, making it the widest type among the three.\n\nSo, the order is: Integer (x), Real (y), Complex (z)."
