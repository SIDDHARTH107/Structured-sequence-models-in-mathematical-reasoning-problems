    "message_1": "A spotlight is mounted on the ground, and it's shining on the wall 10 meters away. The angle between the ground and the spotlight is 30 degrees. What is the maximum height of the spot of light on the wall?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height of the spot of light on the wall, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 30 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the spotlight and the wall (10 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the spot of light on the wall (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 10\n\nTo find the tangent of 30 degrees, you can use a calculator or remember the common trigonometric value:\n\ntan(30°) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\n0.577 = height / 10\n\nheight = 10 * 0.577\nheight ≈ 5.77 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height of the spot of light on the wall is approximately 5.77 meters."
