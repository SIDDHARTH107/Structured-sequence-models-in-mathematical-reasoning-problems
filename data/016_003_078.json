    "message_2": "The maximum number of iterations required to confirm that a given complex number does not belong to the Mandelbrot set, with an escape radius of 2 and a maximum allowed iterations of 100, is 100 iterations. \n\nIf a complex number has not escaped the radius of 2 after 100 iterations, it is considered to be within the Mandelbrot set. However, if it escapes the radius before reaching 100 iterations, it can be confirmed that it does not belong to the Mandelbrot set at the iteration it escapes."
