What is the shortest possible route that he can take if the distances between the cities are as follows:\n\n- City 1 to City 2: 10 km\n- City 1 to City 3: 15 km\n- City 1 to City 4: 20 km\n- City 1 to City 5: 25 km\n- City 1 to City 6: 30 km\n- City 2 to City 3: 35 km\n- City 2 to City 4: 40 km\n- City 2 to City 5: 45 km\n- City 2 to City 6: 50 km\n- City 3 to City 4: 55 km\n- City 3 to City 5: 60 km\n- City 3 to City 6: 65 km\n- City 4 to City 5: 70 km\n- City 4 to City 6: 75 km\n- City 5 to City 6: 80 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance that the salesman can travel if he visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate their total distances. Since there are 6 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is equal to 120 routes.
