We will find the augmenting paths and their bottleneck capacities, and then add the bottleneck capacities to get the maximum flow.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from Node 1 to Node 4:\n   Path: 1 -> 2 -> 4\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(6, 7) = 6\n\n2. Update the residual capacities:\n   - Node 1 to Node 2: 0 (6 - 6)\n   - Node 2 to Node 4: 1 (7 - 6)\n\n3. Find another augmenting path from Node 1 to Node 4:\n   Path: 1 -> 3 -> 4\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(7, 9) = 7\n\n4. Update the residual capacities:\n   - Node 1 to Node 3: 0 (7 - 7)\n   - Node 3 to Node 4: 2 (9 - 7)\n\n5. Find another augmenting path from Node 1 to Node 4:\n   Path: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\n   Bottleneck capacity: min(0, 8, 2) = 0\n\nSince the bottleneck capacity is 0, we cannot find any more augmenting paths.\n\nThe maximum flow from Node 1 to Node 4 is the sum of the bottleneck capacities: 6 + 7 = 13."
