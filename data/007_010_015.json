    "message_2": "Let the number be x. According to the problem, we have the following two congruences:\n\n1. x ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. x ≡ 2 (mod 9)\n\nTo solve these congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first find the product of the moduli, which is M = 5 * 9 = 45.\n\nNext, we compute the modular inverses. Let M1 = M/5 = 9 and M2 = M/9 = 5. We need to find the modular inverses of M1 and M2 with respect to 5 and 9, respectively.\n\nWe need to find integers y1 and y2 such that:\n\n1. M1 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. M2 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nFor the first congruence, we have 9 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 5). By trying different values of y1, we find that y1 = 2 satisfies the congruence since 9 * 2 = 18 ≡ 1 (mod 5).\n\nFor the second congruence, we have 5 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 9). By trying different values of y2, we find that y2 = 2 satisfies the congruence since 5 * 2 = 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9).\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the original congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem formula:\n\nx ≡ a1 * M1 * y1 + a2 * M2 * y2 (mod M)\n\nwhere a1 and a2 are the remainders from the original congruences (1 and 2, respectively).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx ≡ 1 * 9 * 2 + 2 * 5 * 2 (mod 45)\nx ≡ 18 + 20 (mod 45)\nx ≡ 38 (mod 45)\n\nSo, the minimum possible value of the number x is 38."
