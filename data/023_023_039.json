    "message_1": "A network's power output can be modeled by the function y(t) = 5sin(6t) + 4sin(8t) + 3sin(10t) where t is the time in seconds. Using Fourier analysis, find the frequency and amplitude of the power output for the network.",
    "message_2": "The given function y(t) is already in the form of a Fourier series, which is a sum of sine and/or cosine functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. In this case, the function is a sum of sine functions with different frequencies and amplitudes:\n\ny(t) = 5sin(6t) + 4sin(8t) + 3sin(10t)\n\nTo find the frequencies and amplitudes of the power output for the network, we can simply identify the coefficients and frequencies in each term of the function:\n\n1. The first term, 5sin(6t), has an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 6 rad/s.\n2. The second term, 4sin(8t), has an amplitude of 4 and a frequency of 8 rad/s.\n3. The third term, 3sin(10t), has an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of 10 rad/s.\n\nSo, the power output of the network has three frequency components with the following amplitudes and frequencies:\n\n1. Amplitude: 5, Frequency: 6 rad/s\n2. Amplitude: 4, Frequency: 8 rad/s\n3. Amplitude: 3, Frequency: 10 rad/s"
