    "message_1": "Let's consider a universe where the only elements are even numbers less than 10. Let set A be the set of even numbers less than 4. What is the union of set A and its complement? Is it equal to the universal set?",
    "message_2": "In this universe, the universal set U consists of even numbers less than 10, which are {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Set A consists of even numbers less than 4, which are {0, 2}. The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. So, A' = {4, 6, 8}.\n\nThe union of set A and its complement A' is the set of all elements that are in either set A or set A'. In this case, A ∪ A' = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. \n\nSince A ∪ A' contains all elements in the universal set U, the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set."
