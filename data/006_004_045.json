    "message_1": "A carnival game charges $2 dollars to play. The probability of winning is 1 in 9. If you win, you receive a prize worth $20. Find the expected value of playing the game.",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of playing the game, we need to consider both the probability of winning and the probability of losing.\n\nProbability of winning: 1/9\nIf you win, you receive a prize worth $20, so the value of winning is $20.\n\nProbability of losing: 8/9\nIf you lose, you don't receive any prize, and you have paid $2 to play, so the value of losing is -$2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its value and summing them up:\n\nExpected value = (Probability of winning × Value of winning) + (Probability of losing × Value of losing)\nExpected value = (1/9 × $20) + (8/9 × -$2)\n\nExpected value = ($20/9) + (-$16/9)\n\nExpected value = $4/9 ≈ $0.44\n\nSo, the expected value of playing the game is approximately $0.44."
