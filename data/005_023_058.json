    "message_1": "In a dataset of 50 scores, the mean is 75 and the standard deviation is 5. Determine whether the score of 90 is an outlier or not using the z-score method with a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the score of 90 is an outlier using the z-score method, we first need to calculate the z-score for the given score. The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the data point (score), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven the mean (μ) = 75 and the standard deviation (σ) = 5, we can calculate the z-score for the score of 90:\n\nz = (90 - 75) / 5\nz = 15 / 5\nz = 3\n\nNow, we need to compare the z-score to the critical z-value for a significance level of 0.05. Since we are looking for outliers on both ends of the distribution, we will use a two-tailed test. The critical z-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 is ±1.96.\n\nSince the z-score of 3 is greater than the critical z-value of 1.96, we can conclude that the score of 90 is an outlier at the 0.05 significance level."
