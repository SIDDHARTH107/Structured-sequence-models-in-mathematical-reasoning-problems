    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product defect occurring is 0.15. If a batch of 200 products are produced, what is the expected number of products with defects in the batch?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of products with defects in the batch, we can multiply the probability of a defect occurring by the total number of products in the batch:\n\nExpected number of defective products = Probability of defect * Total number of products\n\nExpected number of defective products = 0.15 * 200\n\nExpected number of defective products = 30\n\nSo, the expected number of products with defects in the batch is 30."
