    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the diver reaches, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the function h(t) = -5t^2 + 10t. The vertex of a parabola in the form of f(t) = at^2 + bt + c is given by the formula:\n\nt_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -5 and b = 10, so:\n\nt_vertex = -10 / (2 * -5) = -10 / -10 = 1\n\nThe time at which the diver reaches the maximum height is 1 second. Now, we can find the maximum height by plugging this value of t into the function:\n\nh(1) = -5(1)^2 + 10(1) = -5 + 10 = 5\n\nSo, the maximum height the diver reaches is 5 meters.\n\nTo find the time when the diver hits the water, we need to find when h(t) = 0:\n\n0 = -5t^2 + 10t\n\nWe can factor out a -5t:\n\n0 = -5t(t - 2)\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for t: t = 0 and t = 2. Since t = 0 represents the initial time when the diver is on the platform, the time when the diver hits the water is t = 2 seconds."
