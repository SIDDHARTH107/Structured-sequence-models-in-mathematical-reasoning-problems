    "message_1": "Consider a Beauty Contest Game where there are 100 players and the prize pot is $100. Each player must guess a number from 0 to 100, and the winner is the player whose guess is closest to 2/3 of the average guess of all players. If multiple players have equally close guesses, the prize pot will be divided equally among them. If no one wins, the prize pot rolls over to the next round. What would be the optimal guess for a player in this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal guess for a player in this game, we need to consider the iterative process of players' reasoning. Let's start with the first level of reasoning:\n\n1. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average guess would be 50. In this case, a player should guess 2/3 * 50 = 33.33 to be closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\n2. However, if all players think like this and choose 33.33, the new average would be 33.33. So, a smarter player should guess 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\n3. If all players think one level deeper and choose 22.22, the new average would be 22.22. So, an even smarter player should guess 2/3 * 22.22 = 14.81.\n\nThis process can be continued, but it converges quickly. After a few iterations, the optimal guess approaches zero. In practice, not all players will think this deeply, so the optimal guess would be a small positive number, slightly above zero. However, it is impossible to determine the exact optimal guess without knowing the reasoning levels of all players in the game."
