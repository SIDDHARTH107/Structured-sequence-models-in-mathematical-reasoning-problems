    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. \n\nPerfect numbers can be found using the formula (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and (2^p - 1) are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the study of Mersenne primes.\n\nFor the 5th perfect number, we need to find the next pair of primes (p and 2^p - 1) after the first four pairs:\n\n1. p = 2, 2^p - 1 = 3\n2. p = 3, 2^p - 1 = 7\n3. p = 5, 2^p - 1 = 31\n4. p = 7, 2^p - 1 = 127\n\nThe next prime number after 7 is 11. Let's check if 2^11 - 1 is prime:\n\n2^11 - 1 = 2047\n\n2047 is not a prime number, as it can be factored into 23 * 89. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 13:\n\n2^13 - 1 = 8191\n\n8191 is a prime number. Therefore, we have our 5th pair of primes:\n\n5. p = 13, 2^p - 1 = 8191\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the 5th perfect number:\n\n(2^(13-1)) * (2^13 - 1) = 2^12 * 8191 = 4096 * 8191 = 33,550,336\n\nSo, the 5th perfect number is 33,550,336."
