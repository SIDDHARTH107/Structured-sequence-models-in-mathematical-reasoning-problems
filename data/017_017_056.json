    "message_2": "A group of order 30 has a prime factorization of 2 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. The only divisors that are congruent to 1 modulo 5 are 1 and 6.\n\nIf there is only 1 Sylow 5-subgroup, it would be normal in the group. However, it is possible that there are 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. To determine which case occurs, we need more information about the structure of the group of order 30. In general, without more information, we can say that there are either 1 or 6 subgroups of order 5 in a group of order 30."
