    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(x) = cos(π/2 - x)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into our equation:\n\ncos(π/2 - x) + cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can use the angle addition formula for cosine:\n\ncos(A + B) = cos(A)cos(B) - sin(A)sin(B)\n\nLet A = π/2 - x and B = x, then A + B = π/2:\n\ncos(π/2) = (cos(π/2 - x)cos(x) - sin(π/2 - x)sin(x))\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, we have:\n\n0 = cos(π/2 - x)cos(x) - sin(π/2 - x)sin(x)\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x) again:\n\n0 = cos(π/2 - x)(cos(x) - sin(x))\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either cos(π/2 - x) = 0 or cos(x) - sin(x) = 0.\n\nCase 1: cos(π/2 - x) = 0\n\nThis occurs when π/2 - x = π/2 or π/2 - x = 3π/2. Solving for x, we get x = 0 or x = π.\n\nCase 2: cos(x) - sin(x) = 0\n\nThis occurs when cos(x) = sin(x). We can use the identity sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x) again:\n\ncos(x) = cos(π/2 - x)\n\nThis is true when x = π/2 - x or x = π/2 + (π/2 - x). Solving for x, we get x = π/4 or x = 3π/4.\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, and π."
