    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane occurring in a particular region based on historical data, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of times the event occurred) / (Total number of trials)\n\nIn this case, the event is a hurricane occurring in the region, and the number of times it occurred is 7. The total number of trials is the number of years in the historical data, which is 50.\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring in the region is:\n\nProbability = 7 / 50 = 0.14\n\nThe probability of a hurricane occurring in the region is 0.14 or 14%."
