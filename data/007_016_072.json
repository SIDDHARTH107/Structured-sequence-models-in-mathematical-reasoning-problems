    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number.\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime is 2, but it is not a twin prime since 2 - 2 = 0 is not prime. The next Sophie Germain prime is 3, but it is also not a twin prime since 3 + 2 = 5 is not a Sophie Germain prime (2 * 5 + 1 = 11 is prime, but 5 is not a Sophie Germain prime).\n\nThe next Sophie Germain prime is 5 (since 2 * 5 + 1 = 11 is prime), and 5 is also a twin prime since 5 - 2 = 3 is prime. Therefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a twin prime is 5."
