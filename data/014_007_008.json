    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a key stream to encrypt a plaintext message. If the key stream used is generated by the XOR of the plaintext message with the binary representation of the number 127, how many bits are in the key stream if the plaintext message is 32 bits long?",
    "message_2": "The key stream is generated by XORing the plaintext message with the binary representation of the number 127. Since the plaintext message is 32 bits long, the binary representation of 127 needs to be extended to match the length of the plaintext message.\n\nThe binary representation of 127 is 01111111 (8 bits). To match the length of the 32-bit plaintext message, we can repeat the binary representation of 127 four times:\n\n01111111 01111111 01111111 01111111\n\nNow, the key stream is 32 bits long, the same length as the plaintext message. Therefore, there are 32 bits in the key stream."
