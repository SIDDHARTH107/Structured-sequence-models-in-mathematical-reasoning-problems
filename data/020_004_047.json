The time required for each product on each machine is given by the following table:\n\n|Product|Machine M1 (hours)|Machine M2 (hours)|\n|-------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|A      |3                |5                |\n|B      |4                |2                |\n\nThe company has 30 hours available on M1 and 40 hours available on M2. The profit from each unit of product A is $10 and that of B is $15. The company wants to know how many units of each product to produce to maximize their profit.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the available time on machines M1 and M2 can be written as:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 30 (M1 constraint)\n5x + 2y ≤ 40 (M2 constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the feasible region defined by the constraints and then evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 30\ny ≤ (30 - 3x) / 4\n\n5x + 2y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - 5x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of these inequalities, along with x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (40 - 5x) / 2: (0, 20)\n3. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (30 - 4y) / 3: (10, 0)\n4. Intersection of y = (30 - 3x) / 4 and y = (40 - 5x) / 2:\n\n(30 - 3x) / 4 = (40 - 5x) / 2\n60 - 6x = 80 - 10x\n4x = 20\nx = 5\n\ny = (30 - 3 * 5) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\nSo, the intersection point is (5, 3.75).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 15y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10 * 0 + 15 * 0 = $0\n2. P(0, 20) = 10 * 0 + 15 * 20 = $300\n3. P(10, 0) = 10 * 10 + 15 * 0 = $100\n4. P(5, 3.75) = 10 * 5 + 15 * 3.75 = $50 + $56.25 = $106.25\n\nThe maximum profit is $300, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 20 units of product B."
