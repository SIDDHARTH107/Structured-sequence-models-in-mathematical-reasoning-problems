    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of flips (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (6 heads in this case)\n- p is the probability of success (0.5 for heads in a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (0.5 for tails in a fair coin)\n- ! denotes the factorial function\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X=6) = (10! / (6!(10-6)!)) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^(10-6))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorials and the combinations:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, let's calculate the combinations:\n\n(10! / (6!4!)) = (3,628,800 / (720 × 24)) = 210\n\nNext, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^6) = 0.015625\n(0.5^4) = 0.0625\n\nFinally, let's plug everything into the formula:\n\nP(X=6) = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625 = 0.205078125\n\nSo, the probability of getting 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 flips of a fair coin is approximately 20.51%."
