    "message_1": "What are the six non-abelian groups of order 32, and what are their corresponding group tables?",
    "message_2": "The six non-abelian groups of order 32 are as follows:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_16\n2. Quaternion group Q_32\n3. Semi-dihedral group SD_32\n4. Generalized Quaternion group QD_32\n5. Wreath product group Z_2 wr Z_4\n6. Wreath product group Z_2 wr Z_8\n\nIt is not feasible to write out the full group tables for each of these groups here, as each table would have 32 rows and 32 columns, resulting in a total of 1024 entries per table. However, I can provide a brief description of each group and its structure.\n\n1. Dihedral group D_16:\nThis group represents the symmetries of a regular 16-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has a presentation of the form ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q_32:\nThis group is an extension of the quaternion group of order 8. It has a presentation of the form ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^2 = a^8, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n3. Semi-dihedral group SD_32:\nThis group is an extension of the dihedral group D_16. It has a presentation of the form ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^15b⟩.\n\n4. Generalized Quaternion group QD_32:\nThis group is a generalization of the quaternion group Q_32. It has a presentation of the form ⟨a, b | a^32 = b^4 = 1, b^2 = a^16, ba = a^(-1)b⟩.\n\n5. Wreath product group Z_2 wr Z_4:\nThis group is the wreath product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the cyclic group of order 4. It can be represented as a semi-direct product of Z_2^4 and Z_4, where Z_4 acts on Z_2^4 by cyclically permuting its factors.\n\n6. Wreath product group Z_2 wr Z_8:\nThis group is the wreath product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the cyclic group of order 8. It can be represented as a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 and Z_8, where Z_8 acts on Z_2^3 by cyclically permuting its factors.\n\nFor more information on these groups and their properties, you can refer to textbooks on group theory or online resources such as the GroupProps wiki (https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)."
