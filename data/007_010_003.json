    "message_1": "Suppose Alice has three boxes containing 7, 9, and 11 marbles respectively. What is the smallest number of marbles that she needs to transfer among the boxes so that each box would have the same number of marbles? Use the Chinese remainder theorem to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first need to find the smallest number of marbles that can be evenly distributed among the three boxes. Let's denote the number of marbles in each box as x, y, and z. We want to find the smallest positive integer n such that:\n\nx + a = y + b = z + c = n\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the number of marbles transferred among the boxes. Since we want to minimize the number of marbles transferred, we want to minimize a + b + c.\n\nThe Chinese remainder theorem states that if we have a system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ a1 (mod m1)\nx ≡ a2 (mod m2)\n...\nx ≡ ak (mod mk)\n\nwhere m1, m2, ..., mk are pairwise coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then there exists a unique solution x modulo M, where M = m1 * m2 * ... * mk.\n\nIn our case, we have the following system of congruences:\n\nn ≡ 7 (mod 9)\nn ≡ 9 (mod 11)\nn ≡ 11 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can apply the Chinese remainder theorem to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies these congruences.\n\nFirst, we compute M = 9 * 11 * 7 = 693.\n\nNext, we compute the modular inverses:\n\nM1 = M / 9 = 77, and its modular inverse 77^(-1) ≡ 5 (mod 9)\nM2 = M / 11 = 63, and its modular inverse 63^(-1) ≡ 2 (mod 11)\nM3 = M / 7 = 99, and its modular inverse 99^(-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can compute n:\n\nn = (7 * 77 * 5 + 9 * 63 * 2 + 11 * 99 * 1) % 693\nn = (2695 + 1134 + 1089) % 693\nn = 4918 % 693\nn = 27\n\nSo the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the given congruences is 27. This means that Alice needs to transfer marbles among the boxes so that each box has 27 marbles.\n\nTo achieve this, Alice can transfer:\n\n- 20 marbles from the box with 11 marbles to the box with 7 marbles (11 -> 31, 7 -> 27)\n- 4 marbles from the box with 31 marbles to the box with 9 marbles (31 -> 27, 9 -> 13)\n\nSo the smallest number of marbles that Alice needs to transfer among the boxes is 20 + 4 = 24."
