    "message_1": "Consider a language with a single binary relation symbol $<$ and a single constant symbol $0$. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a model for this language such that $<$ is interpreted as the less-than relation over the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ and $0$ is interpreted as the number $1$. Find the truth value of the following formulas in $\\mathcal{M}$:\n\n1. $\\forall x \\exists y (x < y)$\n2. $\\exists x \\forall y (x < y)$\n3. $\\forall x (x < 0 \\rightarrow \\exists y (y < x))$",
    "message_2": "1. $\\forall x \\exists y (x < y)$\n\nIn this formula, we need to determine if for every natural number $x$, there exists a natural number $y$ such that $x < y$. Since the natural numbers have no upper bound, for every natural number $x$, we can always find a natural number $y$ that is greater than $x$. Therefore, this formula is true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n2. $\\exists x \\forall y (x < y)$\n\nThis formula asks if there exists a natural number $x$ such that for every natural number $y$, $x < y$. However, there is no such natural number $x$ that is less than every natural number $y$. Therefore, this formula is false in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n3. $\\forall x (x < 0 \\rightarrow \\exists y (y < x))$\n\nRecall that in $\\mathcal{M}$, the constant symbol $0$ is interpreted as the number $1$. So, this formula is equivalent to $\\forall x (x < 1 \\rightarrow \\exists y (y < x))$. Since the natural numbers are non-negative and $1$ is the smallest natural number, there is no natural number $x$ such that $x < 1$. Therefore, the antecedent of the implication is always false, which makes the implication true. Thus, this formula is true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nIn summary, the truth values of the given formulas in $\\mathcal{M}$ are:\n\n1. True\n2. False\n3. True"
