    "message_2": "To show whether the function f is continuous or not, we will use the definition of continuity in terms of open sets. A function f: X → Y is continuous if for every open set V in Y, the preimage f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X.\n\nSince Y has the discrete topology, every subset of Y is open. Let V be an arbitrary open set in Y. We need to show that f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X.\n\nConsider two cases:\n\nCase 1: V is empty.\nIn this case, f^(-1)(V) is also empty, which is an open set in any topology. So, f^(-1)(V) is open in X.\n\nCase 2: V is non-empty.\nSince V is a subset of Y, and Y has the discrete topology, V contains isolated points. Let y ∈ V, then there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, i.e., x^2 = y. Now, we need to find an open set U in X containing x such that f(U) ⊆ V.\n\nSince X has the topology generated by the basis {(-n, n) | n∈N}, there exists an open set U = (-n, n) containing x, where n > |x|. Note that for any u ∈ U, we have -n < u < n, and thus, 0 < u^2 < n^2. Since y = x^2 and x ∈ U, we have 0 < y < n^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(u) = u^2 for u ∈ U. Since 0 < u^2 < n^2 for all u ∈ U, f(U) is a subset of the interval (0, n^2). Since V contains all the isolated points in the interval (0, n^2), f(U) ⊆ V.\n\nThus, for every open set V in Y, the preimage f^(-1)(V) is an open set in X. Therefore, the function f: X → Y is continuous."
