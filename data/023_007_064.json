    "message_1": "Given an audio signal with a frequency range of 0Hz to 1000Hz, if the Fourier transform of the signal shows a peak amplitude of 50dB at a frequency of 250Hz, what percentage of the signal's total power is contained in the frequency range from 200Hz to 300Hz? (Assume the signal is normalized to have a total power of 1.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first convert the peak amplitude in decibels (dB) to a linear power value. Then, we can find the power contained in the frequency range from 200Hz to 300Hz and express it as a percentage of the total power.\n\n1. Convert the peak amplitude from dB to linear power value:\nPower (linear) = 10^(Amplitude(dB) / 10)\nPower (linear) = 10^(50 / 10)\nPower (linear) = 10^5\n\n2. Since we don't have the exact power distribution of the signal, we cannot directly calculate the power contained in the 200Hz to 300Hz range. However, we can make an approximation based on the given information. We know that the peak power is at 250Hz, and we can assume that the power decreases as we move away from this peak frequency. We can approximate the power in the 200Hz to 300Hz range as the average power in this range. \n\nAverage power in the 200Hz to 300Hz range ≈ (10^5) / 2\nAverage power in the 200Hz to 300Hz range ≈ 5 * 10^4\n\n3. Calculate the percentage of the total power contained in the 200Hz to 300Hz range:\nPercentage = (Average power in the 200Hz to 300Hz range / Total power) * 100\nPercentage = (5 * 10^4 / 1) * 100\nPercentage = 5 * 10^6 %\n\nHowever, this percentage value is not reasonable, as it exceeds 100%. This is because we made an approximation that may not be accurate. To get a more accurate result, we would need more information about the power distribution of the signal across the entire frequency range."
