    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B each day. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and each unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor. The factory has a limit of 900 hours of labor each day. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize its output?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the total number of units produced, which is x + y.\n\nThe labor constraint can be written as:\n3x + 2y ≤ 900\n\nWe also have the constraints:\nx ≤ 200 (since the factory can produce at most 200 units of product A)\ny ≤ 150 (since the factory can produce at most 150 units of product B)\nx ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since the number of units produced cannot be negative)\n\nNow we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y.\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the labor constraint equation to make y the subject:\ny ≤ (900 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow we can find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph. The feasible region will be a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n(0, 0), (0, 150), (200, 0), and (180, 60)\n\nNow we can evaluate the objective function (x + y) at each of these vertices to find the maximum value:\n(0, 0): 0 + 0 = 0\n(0, 150): 0 + 150 = 150\n(200, 0): 200 + 0 = 200\n(180, 60): 180 + 60 = 240\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 240, which occurs at the vertex (180, 60). Therefore, the factory should produce 180 units of product A and 60 units of product B to maximize its output."
