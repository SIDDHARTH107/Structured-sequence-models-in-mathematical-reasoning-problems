    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor the numerator:\n\n(25x^2 - 16) = (5x + 4)(5x - 4)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n((5x + 4)(5x - 4)) / (5x + 4)\n\nWe can now cancel out the common factor (5x + 4) from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(5x - 4)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n5x - 4"
