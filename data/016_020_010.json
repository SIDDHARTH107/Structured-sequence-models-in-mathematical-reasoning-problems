    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron is a fractal structure that is built by recursively removing smaller tetrahedrons from a larger one. At each stage, the number of tetrahedrons increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the first stage, there is 1 tetrahedron.\nIn the second stage, there are 4 tetrahedrons (1 * 4).\nIn the third stage, there are 16 tetrahedrons (4 * 4).\nIn the fourth stage, there are 64 tetrahedrons (16 * 4).\n\nSo, in the fourth stage of constructing the Sierpinski tetrahedron, there are 64 tetrahedrons."
