    "message_2": "The word \"MATHISFUN\" has 9 unique letters. To form a 7-letter word using these letters, we need to choose 7 letters out of the 9 available. This can be done in 9C7 ways, where \"C\" denotes the number of combinations.\n\n9C7 = 9! / (7! * (9-7)!)\n= 9! / (7! * 2!)\n= (9 * 8 * 7!)/(7! * 2)\n= (9 * 8)/2\n= 36\n\nSo, there are 36 different 7-letter words that can be formed using the letters in the word \"MATHISFUN\" with each letter appearing exactly once."
