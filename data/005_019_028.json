    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces two types of products, A and B. The production figures for the last three months showed that 70% of product A remains A in the next month, 30% changes into product B; and 80% of product B remains B in the next month, 20% changes into product A. If the plant starts with 1000 units of product A this month, how many units of each product will they have next month?",
    "message_2": "Since the plant starts with 1000 units of product A and 0 units of product B this month, we can calculate the number of units of each product for the next month using the given percentages.\n\nFor product A:\nNext month's product A = (70% of this month's product A) + (20% of this month's product B)\nNext month's product A = (0.7 * 1000) + (0.2 * 0)\nNext month's product A = 700 + 0\nNext month's product A = 700 units\n\nFor product B:\nNext month's product B = (30% of this month's product A) + (80% of this month's product B)\nNext month's product B = (0.3 * 1000) + (0.8 * 0)\nNext month's product B = 300 + 0\nNext month's product B = 300 units\n\nSo, next month, the plant will have 700 units of product A and 300 units of product B."
