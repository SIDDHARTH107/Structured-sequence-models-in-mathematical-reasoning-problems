    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2:\n\nThe antiderivative of 3x^2 is (3/3)x^(2+1) = x^3.\nThe antiderivative of 5x is (5/2)x^(1+1) = (5/2)x^2.\nThe antiderivative of -2 is -2x (since the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x).\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2 is:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + (5/2)x^2 - 2x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
