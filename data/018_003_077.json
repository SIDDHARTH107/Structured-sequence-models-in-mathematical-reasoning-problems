    "message_2": "To prove that the union of A and B is a superset of A and B individually, we need to show that every element in A and B is also an element in the union of A and B.\n\nLet C = A âˆª B, which means C contains all elements that are in A or B or both. \n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from set A. Since x is an element of A, and C contains all elements of A, x must also be an element of C. This holds true for all elements in A. Therefore, A is a subset of C.\n\nSimilarly, let's take an arbitrary element y from set B. Since y is an element of B, and C contains all elements of B, y must also be an element of C. This holds true for all elements in B. Therefore, B is a subset of C.\n\nSince A and B are both subsets of C, we can conclude that the union of A and B (C) is a superset of A and B individually."
