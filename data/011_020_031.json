    "message_1": "Here is a question for you to solve:\n\nSuppose you have a set of 8 distinct integers, {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}, and you want to find a subset of 4 integers that has the largest possible sum. How many possible subsets can you choose, and what is the sum of the integers in the largest possible subset?",
    "message_2": "To find the subset of 4 integers with the largest possible sum, you should choose the 4 largest integers in the given set. These integers are {12, 14, 16, 10}. The sum of these integers is 12 + 14 + 16 + 10 = 52.\n\nNow, let's find out how many possible subsets of these 4 integers can be chosen. Since the integers are distinct, there is only one way to choose this specific subset of 4 largest integers. Therefore, there is only 1 possible subset with the largest possible sum of 52."
