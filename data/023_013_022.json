Determine the temperature distribution along the slab using Fourier transform to solve the heat transfer problem assuming steady-state and neglecting the influence of radiation.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Fourier's Law of heat conduction, which states that the heat transfer rate (Q) is proportional to the temperature gradient and the thermal conductivity (k) of the material. In one dimension, this can be written as:\n\nQ = -k * (dT/dx)\n\nwhere Q is the heat transfer rate, k is the thermal conductivity, dT is the temperature difference, and dx is the distance along the slab.\n\nSince we are assuming steady-state conditions, the heat transfer rate (Q) is constant along the slab. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the temperature gradient:\n\ndT/dx = -Q / k\n\nWe can integrate this equation to find the temperature distribution along the slab:\n\nT(x) = -Q / k * x + C\n\nwhere T(x) is the temperature at a given position x along the slab, and C is the integration constant.\n\nWe can use the boundary conditions to find the values of Q and C. At x = 0, T(0) = 200°C, and at x = 0.01 m, T(0.01) = 100°C. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n200 = -Q / 10 * 0 + C\n100 = -Q / 10 * 0.01 + C\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find that Q = -100 W and C = 200. Therefore, the temperature distribution along the slab is given by:\n\nT(x) = 10 * x + 200\n\nThis equation describes the temperature distribution along the slab, with T(x) in °C and x in meters."
