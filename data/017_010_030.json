    "message_2": "To find the total number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 10, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. If a group has a unique Sylow p-subgroup, then it is normal.\n\nLet G be a group of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 2 and Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo the order of the respective subgroups. Thus, n_2 must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, and n_5 must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibilities are n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, both are normal in G. Let H be the Sylow 2-subgroup and K be the Sylow 5-subgroup. Then G has a normal subgroup of order 2 and a normal subgroup of order 5. Since the orders of H and K are coprime, H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of H and K, and G is isomorphic to the external direct product H × K.\n\nNow, there is only one group of order 2 (up to isomorphism), which is Z_2, the cyclic group of order 2. Similarly, there is only one group of order 5 (up to isomorphism), which is Z_5, the cyclic group of order 5. Thus, G is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_5, which is the cyclic group of order 10, Z_10.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one isomorphism class of groups of order 10, which is the cyclic group Z_10. We have shown that any group of order 10 must have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, both of which are normal, and that the group is the internal direct product of these subgroups. Since there is only one group of order 2 and one group of order 5 (up to isomorphism), there can be no other isomorphism classes of groups of order 10."
