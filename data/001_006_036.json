    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 6x + 3, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = 2 and b = -6.\n\nx_vertex = -(-6) / (2 * 2) = 6 / 4 = 3/2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x_vertex value into the equation:\n\ny_vertex = 2(3/2)^2 - 6(3/2) + 3\n\ny_vertex = 2(9/4) - 9 + 3 = 9/2 - 6 = 3/2\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (3/2, 3/2).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = 3/2\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we can set x = 0 in the equation:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 6(0) + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 3).\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (3/2, 3/2)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = 3/2\n- Y-intercept: (0, 3)"
