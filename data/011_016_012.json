    "message_1": "A teacher wants to conduct an experiment on the effects of three different fertilizers on the growth of a particular plant. The teacher has five identical pots and wants to assign each fertilizer to two pots such that each pair receives a different combination of fertilizers. How many unique arrangements are possible?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics. We have 3 different fertilizers and we want to choose 2 of them for each pair of pots. The number of unique combinations can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, fertilizers) and k is the number of items we want to choose (in this case, 2).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\nC(3, 2) = 6 / (2 * 1)\nC(3, 2) = 6 / 2\nC(3, 2) = 3\n\nThere are 3 unique arrangements possible for the teacher's experiment."
