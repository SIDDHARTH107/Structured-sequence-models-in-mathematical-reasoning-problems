    "message_2": "To find the expected number of citizens to be selected for the survey, we can multiply the total number of citizens by the probability of a citizen being selected.\n\nExpected number of citizens selected = Total number of citizens × Probability of being selected\nExpected number of citizens selected = 500,000 × 0.30\nExpected number of citizens selected = 150,000\n\nSo, we would expect 150,000 citizens to be selected for the survey."
