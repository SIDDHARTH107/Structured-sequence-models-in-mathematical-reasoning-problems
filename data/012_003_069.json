    "message_2": "An independent set of a graph is a set of nodes such that no two nodes are adjacent. To find the maximum number of nodes that can be included in an independent set, we can use a greedy algorithm.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that nodes B, C, D, and E have the highest degree (4). We can start by picking one of these nodes, say B, and then remove all its neighbors (A, C, D, and E) from the graph. This leaves us with the following graph:\n\n```python\ngraph = {\n    'F': []\n}\n```\n\nNow, we can add node F to our independent set. So, the maximum number of nodes that can be included in an independent set of this graph is 2 (B and F)."
