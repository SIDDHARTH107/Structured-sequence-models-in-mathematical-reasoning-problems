    "message_2": "The dragon curve fractal is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the dragon curve increases by a factor of 2 with each iteration.\n\nSo, after 10 iterations, the total length of the dragon curve fractal will be:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^iterations\nLength = 1 * 2^10\nLength = 1 * 1024\nLength = 1024\n\nThe total length of the dragon curve fractal after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
