    "message_1": "A company is testing three new formulas of shampoo to see which one is the most effective in reducing dandruff. They randomly select 100 participants and divide them equally into three groups. Group A uses shampoo formula 1, Group B uses shampoo formula 2, and Group C uses shampoo formula 3. After 4 weeks, they count the number of participants in each group who experienced a reduction in dandruff. Group A had 30 participants with reduced dandruff, Group B had 25 participants with reduced dandruff, and Group C had 40 participants with reduced dandruff. Determine which shampoo formula was the most effective in reducing dandruff.",
    "message_2": "To determine the most effective shampoo formula, we need to calculate the percentage of participants in each group who experienced a reduction in dandruff.\n\nGroup A: 30 participants with reduced dandruff out of 100/3 ≈ 33 participants\nPercentage of Group A with reduced dandruff = (30/33) * 100 = 90.91%\n\nGroup B: 25 participants with reduced dandruff out of 100/3 ≈ 33 participants\nPercentage of Group B with reduced dandruff = (25/33) * 100 = 75.76%\n\nGroup C: 40 participants with reduced dandruff out of 100/3 ≈ 33 participants\nPercentage of Group C with reduced dandruff = (40/33) * 100 = 121.21%\n\nBased on these percentages, shampoo formula 3 (Group C) was the most effective in reducing dandruff, with 121.21% of participants experiencing a reduction in dandruff."
