    "message_2": "To find the amplitudes and frequencies of all the sine and cosine terms in the voltage signal V(t) = 5 sin(4πt) + 3 sin(8πt) + 2 cos(12πt), we can directly read them from the given equation since it is already in the Fourier series form.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function can be represented as:\n\nV(t) = Σ [A_n * cos(nωt) + B_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere A_n and B_n are the amplitudes of the cosine and sine terms, respectively, n is the harmonic number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nComparing this with the given equation, we can identify the amplitudes and frequencies of the sine and cosine terms:\n\n1. For the first sine term: 5 sin(4πt)\n- Amplitude (B_n): 5\n- Angular frequency (ω): 4π\n- Frequency (f = ω / 2π): 2 Hz\n\n2. For the second sine term: 3 sin(8πt)\n- Amplitude (B_n): 3\n- Angular frequency (ω): 8π\n- Frequency (f = ω / 2π): 4 Hz\n\n3. For the cosine term: 2 cos(12πt)\n- Amplitude (A_n): 2\n- Angular frequency (ω): 12π\n- Frequency (f = ω / 2π): 6 Hz\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of all the sine and cosine terms in the voltage signal are:\n\n- 5 sin(4πt) with amplitude 5 and frequency 2 Hz\n- 3 sin(8πt) with amplitude 3 and frequency 4 Hz\n- 2 cos(12πt) with amplitude 2 and frequency 6 Hz"
