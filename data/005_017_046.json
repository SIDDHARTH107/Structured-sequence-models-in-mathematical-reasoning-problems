    "message_1": "A company has collected data on the sales of 5 different products over the course of 10 years. The data is represented in a 5x10 matrix. Using principal component analysis (PCA), determine the principal components and their corresponding variance. Also, calculate the percentage of total variance that is explained by the first two principal components.",
    "message_2": "To perform PCA on the given 5x10 matrix, we first need the actual data values. Since the data is not provided, I will outline the steps to perform PCA and calculate the required values.\n\n1. Standardize the data: Since PCA is affected by the scale of the variables, it is important to standardize the data before performing PCA. This can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable (column) in the matrix.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix is a square matrix that shows the covariance between each pair of variables. It can be calculated using the standardized data.\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix: Eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each principal component, and eigenvectors represent the direction of the principal components in the original feature space.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in descending order: This will give you the principal components in order of their importance (variance explained).\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of total variance explained by the first two principal components: Divide the sum of the first two eigenvalues by the sum of all eigenvalues and multiply by 100.\n\nPlease provide the actual data values in the 5x10 matrix to perform PCA and calculate the required values."
