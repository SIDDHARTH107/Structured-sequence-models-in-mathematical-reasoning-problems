    "message_2": "To prove that the Euler characteristic of X must be even, we will use the fact that the first Stiefel-Whitney class w1(E) is nonzero and the properties of the Euler characteristic.\n\nRecall that the Euler characteristic χ(X) of a topological space X is defined as the alternating sum of the ranks of its cohomology groups:\n\nχ(X) = Σ(-1)^i * rank(H^i(X))\n\nNow, let's consider the first Stiefel-Whitney class w1(E). Since E is a real vector bundle of rank 2, we know that w1(E) is an element of the first cohomology group with coefficients in Z/2Z, i.e., w1(E) ∈ H^1(X; Z/2Z).\n\nThe fact that w1(E) is nonzero implies that rank(H^1(X; Z/2Z)) ≥ 1. Now, let's consider the mod 2 reduction map:\n\nr: H^i(X; Z) → H^i(X; Z/2Z)\n\nThis map is a homomorphism and its kernel consists of the elements of H^i(X; Z) that are divisible by 2. Since w1(E) is nonzero, there exists an element in H^1(X; Z) that is not divisible by 2, which implies that H^1(X; Z) has a Z/2Z summand. In other words, there exists a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → A → H^1(X; Z) → Z/2Z → 0\n\nwhere A is a subgroup of H^1(X; Z). This implies that rank(H^1(X; Z)) is odd, since it has a Z/2Z summand.\n\nNow, let's look at the Euler characteristic χ(X). Since rank(H^1(X; Z)) is odd, we have:\n\nχ(X) = rank(H^0(X)) - rank(H^1(X)) + rank(H^2(X)) - ...\n\nSince rank(H^0(X)) is always 1 (as it corresponds to the connected components of X, and X is connected), we have:\n\nχ(X) = 1 - (odd number) + ...\n\nNow, we need to show that χ(X) is even. Notice that all the other terms in the Euler characteristic expression are either even or odd. If all the other terms are even, then χ(X) is clearly even. If there is an odd number of odd terms, then χ(X) is still even, since the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is even.\n\nThus, we have shown that if the first Stiefel-Whitney class of E is nonzero, the Euler characteristic of X must be even.\n\nTo find the Euler characteristic of X in terms of the cohomology class of w1(E), we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, and it depends only on the cohomology ring structure of X. However, without more information about the specific topological space X and the vector bundle E, it is not possible to give an explicit formula for χ(X) in terms of w1(E)."
