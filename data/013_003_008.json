    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing an ultimatum game. Player 1 is given $100 and asked to split the money with Player 2. Player 2 can either accept or reject the offer. If Player 2 accepts, both players get their share of the money as agreed. But if Player 2 rejects, both players get nothing. What is the maximum amount of money Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, Player 1 should consider the rationality of Player 2. If Player 2 is rational, they would accept any offer greater than $0, as getting something is better than getting nothing. However, if Player 2 is not purely rational and considers fairness, Player 1 should offer a more equitable split.\n\nTo ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer, Player 1 should offer an amount that is fair or close to fair. A fair split would be $50 for each player. However, if Player 1 wants to maximize their own share while still ensuring that Player 2 accepts the offer, they could offer slightly less than $50, say $49. This way, Player 1 gets $51, and Player 2 gets $49. Since the split is still close to fair, it is likely that Player 2 will accept the offer.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum amount of money Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer is $49."
