    "message_2": "Let M be a complex manifold of dimension 3, and let T(M) be its tangent bundle. The first Chern class of T(M), denoted as c_1(T(M)), is an element of the second cohomology group H^2(M, Z). The first Chern number is the integral of the first Chern class over the manifold, denoted as ∫_M c_1(T(M)).\n\nGiven that the first Chern number is 4, we have:\n\n∫_M c_1(T(M)) = 4.\n\nHowever, without more information about the manifold M, we cannot determine the explicit form of the first Chern class c_1(T(M)). The first Chern class depends on the specific complex structure of the manifold, and different complex manifolds with the same dimension can have different first Chern classes.\n\nIn summary, we know that the integral of the first Chern class over the manifold is 4, but we cannot determine the explicit form of the first Chern class without more information about the complex manifold M."
