    "message_2": "The dihedral group D6 is a group of order 12, as it consists of the symmetries of a regular hexagon, including 6 rotations and 6 reflections. The group D6 can be generated by two elements, r and s, with the following relations:\n\nr^6 = e (identity element)\ns^2 = e\nsrs = r^(-1)\n\nA group of order 12 that is isomorphic to D6 can be found by finding another group with the same structure and relations. One such group is the permutation group S_3 acting on the set of 2-element subsets of a 4-element set. This group is called the symmetric group on 4 elements, denoted as S_4.\n\nConsider the following elements in S_4:\n\nr = (1 2 3 4)\ns = (1 2)(3 4)\n\nWe can verify that these elements satisfy the same relations as the generators of D6:\n\nr^6 = (1 2 3 4)^6 = e\ns^2 = (1 2)(3 4)(1 2)(3 4) = e\nsrs = (1 2)(3 4)(1 2 3 4)(1 2)(3 4) = (4 3 2 1) = r^(-1)\n\nThus, the subgroup of S_4 generated by r and s is a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6."
