    "message_1": "In a community event, there are 200 attendees, of which 60% are females. If 25% of the attendees are under the age of 18, what is the probability that a randomly chosen attendee is a female and over 18 years old?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of females in the event. \n\n60% of 200 attendees are females:\n0.60 * 200 = 120 females\n\nNext, let's find the number of attendees who are under 18 years old.\n\n25% of 200 attendees are under 18 years old:\n0.25 * 200 = 50 attendees under 18\n\nNow, we need to find the number of females who are over 18 years old. We know that there are 120 females in total, and 50 attendees are under 18 (both males and females). \n\nLet F represent the number of females under 18, and let M represent the number of males under 18. We know that:\n\nF + M = 50 (total number of attendees under 18)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find the exact number of females under 18, we can't find the exact number of females over 18. However, we can find the probability that a randomly chosen attendee is a female and over 18 years old in terms of F.\n\nThe number of females over 18 is (120 - F), and the total number of attendees is 200. So, the probability that a randomly chosen attendee is a female and over 18 years old is:\n\nP(Female and Over 18) = (120 - F) / 200"
