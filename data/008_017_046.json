    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  0 |\n    | 0  8  2 |\n    | 0  0  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | 20  |\n    |  5  |\n\nSince the matrix A is already in upper triangular form, we can use back substitution to solve for the variables x, y, and z.\n\nStarting with the last equation:\n\n5z = 5\nz = 5 / 5\nz = 1\n\nNow, substitute the value of z into the second equation:\n\n8y + 2z = 20\n8y + 2(1) = 20\n8y + 2 = 20\n8y = 18\ny = 18 / 8\ny = 9/4\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y + 0z = 7\n2x + 3(9/4) = 7\n2x + 27/4 = 7\n2x = 7 - 27/4\n2x = (28 - 27) / 4\n2x = 1/4\nx = (1/4) / 2\nx = 1/8\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1/8\ny = 9/4\nz = 1"
