    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 4x4 Latin square, so n = 4.\n\nFor the first row, we have 4 different symbols (let's say 1, 2, 3, and 4) to choose from for the first square. After filling in the first square, we have 3 remaining symbols to choose from for the second square. Then, we have 2 remaining symbols for the third square, and finally, only 1 symbol left for the last square.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to fill in the first row without repeating any number, we multiply the number of choices for each square:\n\n4 (choices for the first square) * 3 (choices for the second square) * 2 (choices for the third square) * 1 (choice for the last square) = 24 possible ways."
