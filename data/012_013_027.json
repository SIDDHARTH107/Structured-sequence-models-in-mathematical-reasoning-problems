    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G, we need to count the number of ways to color the vertices of G using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nSince each vertex in G has a degree of 3, the graph G must be a 3-regular graph with 6 vertices. The only such graph is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3} (3 vertices in each partition).\n\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of G. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find P(G, k).\n\n1. There are k ways to color each vertex, so there are k^6 ways to color all vertices without considering the adjacency constraint.\n\n2. For each edge, there are k(k-1) ways to color its two vertices with different colors. Since there are 9 edges in K_{3,3}, there are k^6 - 9k^5 ways to color the vertices considering the adjacency constraint.\n\n3. However, we have subtracted the cases where two edges share a vertex twice. There are 6 vertices, and for each vertex, there are C(3,2) = 3 ways to choose two edges incident to it. So there are 6 * 3 = 18 such cases. For each case, there are k(k-1)(k-2) ways to color the three vertices involved. So we need to add back 18k^4.\n\n4. Finally, we need to consider the case where three edges share a vertex. This only happens in K_{3,3} when we consider the three edges incident to a single vertex. There are 6 such cases, and for each case, there are k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) ways to color the four vertices involved. So we need to subtract 6k^3.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\nP(G, k) = k^6 - 9k^5 + 18k^4 - 6k^3\n\nSo the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k^6 - 9k^5 + 18k^4 - 6k^3."
