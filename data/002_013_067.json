    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 8 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × length × width × height\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 4 cm, and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 8 × 4 × 5\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 160\n\nVolume = 160/3\n\nVolume ≈ 53.33 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 53.33 cubic centimeters."
