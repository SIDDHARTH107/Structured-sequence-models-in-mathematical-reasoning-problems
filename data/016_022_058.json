    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly applying a process to an initial tetrahedron. In each iteration, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 4. \n\nTo find the number of triangles after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = Initial triangles × (Multiplier)^(Iteration - 1)\n\nIn this case, the initial number of triangles is 1, the multiplier is 4, and the iteration is 5.\n\nNumber of triangles = 1 × 4^(5 - 1)\nNumber of triangles = 1 × 4^4\nNumber of triangles = 1 × 256\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration, the Sierpinski pyramid will have 256 triangles."
