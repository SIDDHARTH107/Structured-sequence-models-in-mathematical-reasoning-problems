At time t=0, the string is plucked to create a wave that satisfies the following initial condition: y(x,0) = 2*sin(πx/L) where L is the length of the string. Use Fourier transform to solve for the wave equation of the string at t=2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation of the string at t=2 seconds, we first need to consider the wave equation for a vibrating string with fixed ends:\n\n∂²y/∂t² = c²(∂²y/∂x²)\n\nwhere y(x,t) is the displacement of the string, c is the wave speed, and x and t are the position and time variables, respectively.\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\ny(0,t) = y(L,t) = 0\n\nThe initial condition is given as:\n\ny(x,0) = 2*sin(πx/L)\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve the wave equation. Let y(x,t) = X(x)T(t), then the wave equation becomes:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = c²X(x)T''(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)T(t), we get:\n\n(X''(x)/X(x)) = (c²T''(t)/T(t))\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nT''(t) + (λ²/c²)T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = A = 0\nX(L) = B*sin(λL) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution is trivial), we must have sin(λL) = 0. This implies that λL = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, λ = nπ/L and the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(nπx/L)\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos(λct) + D*sin(λct)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for y(x,t) as:\n\ny(x,t) = (B*sin(nπx/L))*(C*cos(nπct/L) + D*sin(nπct/L))\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition y(x,0) = 2*sin(πx/L), we set t=0 and compare:\n\n2*sin(πx/L) = B*sin(nπx/L)*C\n\nSince n=1 satisfies the initial condition, we have:\n\nB = 2\nC = 1\nn = 1\n\nThus, the solution for the wave equation of the string at t=2 seconds is:\n\ny(x,t) = 2*sin(πx/L)*cos(πct/L)\n\nPlug in the values L=10 meters, c (wave speed, which depends on the string's tension and linear mass density), and t=2 seconds to find the displacement of the string at any position x at t=2 seconds."
