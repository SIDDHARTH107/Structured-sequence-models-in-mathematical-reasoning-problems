    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question:\n\nWhat is the total number of squares in a Vicsek fractal that has been iterated to the ninth level, if the original square has a side length of 27 cm?\n\n(Note: You can assume that a Vicsek fractal is constructed by dividing a square into nine smaller squares, and then removing the center square, and repeating this process on each of the remaining smaller squares, for as many iterations as desired.)",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of squares in a Vicsek fractal iterated to the ninth level, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the ninth level, n = 9. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal squares = (8^9 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = (134217728 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = 134217727 / 7\nTotal squares = 19173953\n\nSo, there are 19,173,953 squares in a Vicsek fractal that has been iterated to the ninth level."
