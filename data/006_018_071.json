    "message_1": "A company has four departments, and the probability of financial fraud occurring in each of these departments is 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 respectively. What is the probability that financial fraud occurs in at least two departments out of the four?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., the probability that financial fraud occurs in none or only one of the departments) and then subtract it from 1.\n\nLet A, B, C, and D be the events of financial fraud occurring in the respective departments. The probabilities of no financial fraud occurring in each department are 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, and 0.8.\n\n1. Probability of no financial fraud in any department: P(A'∩B'∩C'∩D') = P(A')P(B')P(C')P(D') = 0.95 × 0.9 × 0.85 × 0.8 = 0.5781\n\n2. Probability of financial fraud in exactly one department:\n\nP(A∩B'∩C'∩D') = 0.05 × 0.9 × 0.85 × 0.8 = 0.027\nP(A'∩B∩C'∩D') = 0.95 × 0.1 × 0.85 × 0.8 = 0.054\nP(A'∩B'∩C∩D') = 0.95 × 0.9 × 0.15 × 0.8 = 0.081\nP(A'∩B'∩C'∩D) = 0.95 × 0.9 × 0.85 × 0.2 = 0.1083\n\nSum of these probabilities: 0.027 + 0.054 + 0.081 + 0.1083 = 0.2703\n\nNow, we find the probability of financial fraud occurring in at least two departments:\n\n1 - P(No financial fraud) - P(Financial fraud in exactly one department) = 1 - 0.5781 - 0.2703 = 0.1516\n\nSo, the probability that financial fraud occurs in at least two departments out of the four is 0.1516 or 15.16%."
