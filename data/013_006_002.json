    "message_1": "Suppose that two hunters go out to hunt for a stag, but each can also hunt a hare on their own. If they both hunt the stag, they can split it and each get 4 units of meat. If one hunter hunts a hare and the other hunts the stag, then they cannot split the stag and the hunter who hunted the stag only gets 2 units of meat while the other gets 1 unit of meat for hunting a hare. However, if both hunters hunt a hare, they each get 1 unit of meat. \n\nIf player 1 thinks that player 2 is more likely to hunt a hare than the stag, what is the probability that player 1 should hunt a hare instead of the stag to maximize their expected payoff? Assume that the probability of finding a hare is 0.4 for each of them, and for player 2, the probability of hunting a hare instead of the stag is 0.7.",
    "message_2": "To maximize their expected payoff, player 1 should consider the expected payoffs of both hunting a hare and hunting a stag. Let's calculate the expected payoff for each option.\n\n1. Player 1 hunts a hare:\n- If player 2 hunts a hare, player 1 gets 1 unit of meat. The probability of this happening is 0.7 (since player 2 is more likely to hunt a hare with a probability of 0.7).\n- If player 2 hunts a stag, player 1 gets 1 unit of meat. The probability of this happening is 0.3 (since player 2 has a 0.3 probability of hunting a stag).\n\nThe expected payoff for player 1 hunting a hare is (0.7 * 1) + (0.3 * 1) = 1 unit of meat.\n\n2. Player 1 hunts a stag:\n- If player 2 hunts a hare, player 1 gets 2 units of meat. The probability of this happening is 0.7.\n- If player 2 hunts a stag, player 1 gets 4 units of meat. The probability of this happening is 0.3.\n\nThe expected payoff for player 1 hunting a stag is (0.7 * 2) + (0.3 * 4) = 1.4 + 1.2 = 2.6 units of meat.\n\nSince the expected payoff for hunting a stag (2.6 units of meat) is higher than the expected payoff for hunting a hare (1 unit of meat), player 1 should hunt a stag to maximize their expected payoff. Therefore, the probability that player 1 should hunt a hare instead of the stag is 0."
