    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to distribute the -2 to both terms inside the parentheses:\n\n3x - 2(4x) - 2(5) + 7\n\nNow we can perform the multiplication:\n\n3x - 8x - 10 + 7\n\nNext, we combine like terms (the x terms and the constant terms):\n\n(3x - 8x) + (-10 + 7)\n\n-5x - 3\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n-5x - 3"
