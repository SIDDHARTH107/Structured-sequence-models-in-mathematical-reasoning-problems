The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we find the elements in either A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNext, we need to find the union of (A △ B) and B:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ B = {1, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, (A △ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}."
