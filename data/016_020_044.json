    "message_2": "After each iteration, the volume of the Sierpinski tetrahedron is reduced by a factor of 1 - (1/8) = 7/8, since each smaller tetrahedron has 1/8th of the volume of its parent tetrahedron and there are 4 smaller tetrahedra in each iteration.\n\nAfter 3 iterations, the volume of the Sierpinski tetrahedron will be:\n\nV = original volume * (7/8)^3\nV = 1 * (7/8)^3\nV = (7^3) / (8^3)\nV = 343 / 512\n\nSo, the volume of the Sierpinski tetrahedron after 3 iterations is 343/512 cubic units."
