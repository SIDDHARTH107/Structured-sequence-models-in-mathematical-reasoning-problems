    "message_2": "A singular point on an algebraic surface is a point where all partial derivatives of the surface's equation are simultaneously zero. To find the singular points of the given surface, we first compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all three partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n3z^2 - 3xy = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing each by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\nz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we have x^2 = yz. From the second equation, we have y^2 = xz. From the third equation, we have z^2 = xy.\n\nWe can see that if x = 0, then yz = 0. If y = 0, then xz = 0. If z = 0, then xy = 0. This implies that at least one of x, y, or z must be zero.\n\nCase 1: x = 0\nThen yz = 0, so either y = 0 or z = 0. If y = 0, then we have the point (0, 0, z) for any z. If z = 0, then we have the point (0, y, 0) for any y.\n\nCase 2: y = 0\nThen xz = 0, so either x = 0 or z = 0. If x = 0, then we have the point (0, 0, z) for any z. If z = 0, then we have the point (x, 0, 0) for any x.\n\nCase 3: z = 0\nThen xy = 0, so either x = 0 or y = 0. If x = 0, then we have the point (0, y, 0) for any y. If y = 0, then we have the point (x, 0, 0) for any x.\n\nThus, the singular points of the surface are all points of the form (0, y, 0), (x, 0, 0), and (0, 0, z) for any x, y, and z."
