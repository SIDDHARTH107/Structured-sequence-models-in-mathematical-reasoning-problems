    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental group of the resulting space, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected subsets A and B, then the fundamental group of X can be calculated as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the relations between the fundamental groups of A and B.\n\nLet's consider the torus with a small disk removed from its surface. We can divide this space into two open, path-connected subsets A and B, where A is the torus with a small disk removed and B is an open disk that covers the removed disk.\n\nNow, we need to find the fundamental groups of A and B. The fundamental group of B is trivial, as B is contractible. The fundamental group of A is the same as the fundamental group of the torus, which is the free product of two infinite cyclic groups: π1(A) = Z * Z, where Z is the group of integers.\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of A and B, which is an annulus. The fundamental group of an annulus is isomorphic to Z, as it is homotopy equivalent to a circle.\n\nNow we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of the resulting space is the free product of π1(A) and π1(B), modulo the normal subgroup generated by the relations between π1(A) and π1(B). Since π1(B) is trivial, the fundamental group of the resulting space is just π1(A), which is Z * Z.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the torus with a small disk removed from its surface is Z * Z."
