    "message_2": "To show that A∪B is a superset of both sets A and B, we need to demonstrate that every element in sets A and B is also an element in the union A∪B.\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B:\n\nA∪B = {2, 4, 6, 8} ∪ {3, 6, 9, 12}\n\nCombine the elements of both sets, without repeating any elements:\n\nA∪B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in sets A and B is also in A∪B:\n\nSet A:\n2 ∈ A∪B\n4 ∈ A∪B\n6 ∈ A∪B\n8 ∈ A∪B\n\nSet B:\n3 ∈ A∪B\n6 ∈ A∪B\n9 ∈ A∪B\n12 ∈ A∪B\n\nSince every element in sets A and B is also in A∪B, we can conclude that the union of sets A and B, A∪B, is a superset of both sets A and B."
