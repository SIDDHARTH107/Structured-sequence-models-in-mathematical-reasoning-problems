    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative d𝑠, we need to take the partial derivatives of the components of 𝑠 with respect to x and y and then apply the wedge product. The differential form 𝑠 is given by:\n\n𝑠 = 𝑥²𝑑𝑦 + 3𝑦𝑑𝑥\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of the components of 𝑠:\n\n∂(x²)/∂x = 2x\n∂(x²)/∂y = 0\n∂(3y)/∂x = 0\n∂(3y)/∂y = 3\n\nNow, let's apply the wedge product to find the exterior derivative d𝑠:\n\nd𝑠 = (∂(x²)/∂x) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦 + (∂(x²)/∂y) 𝑑𝑦 ∧ 𝑑𝑦 + (∂(3y)/∂x) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑥 + (∂(3y)/∂y) 𝑑𝑦 ∧ 𝑑𝑥\n\nSince 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑑𝑦 ∧ 𝑑𝑦 = 0, we have:\n\nd𝑠 = (2x) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦 + (3) 𝑑𝑦 ∧ 𝑑𝑥\n\nNow, we need to evaluate d𝑠 at the point (1/√2, 1/√2):\n\nd𝑠(1/√2, 1/√2) = (2(1/√2)) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦 + (3) 𝑑𝑦 ∧ 𝑑𝑥\n\nSince 𝑑𝑦 ∧ 𝑑𝑥 = -𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nd𝑠(1/√2, 1/√2) = (2(1/√2) - 3) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦\n\nd𝑠(1/√2, 1/√2) = (1/√2 - 3) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦\n\nSo, the exterior derivative d𝑠 at the point (1/√2, 1/√2) of the manifold 𝑀 is:\n\nd𝑠(1/√2, 1/√2) = (1/√2 - 3) 𝑑𝑥 ∧ 𝑑𝑦"
