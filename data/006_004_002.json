    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event occurring independently.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll is 1/6, since there is 1 favorable outcome (rolling a 5) out of 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll is also 1/6.\n\nSo, the probability of both events occurring is:\n\n(1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll is 1/36."
