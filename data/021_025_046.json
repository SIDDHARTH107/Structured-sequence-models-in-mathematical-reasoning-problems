    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm used to solve complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the WOA to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = -cos(x) over the interval [0, 2π].\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (search agents) with random positions within the search space [0, 2π].\n\n2. Define the maximum number of iterations (T) and set the current iteration t = 0.\n\n3. Calculate the fitness of each search agent using the objective function f(x) = -cos(x).\n\n4. Find the best search agent (whale) with the highest fitness value.\n\n5. Update the position of each search agent (whale) using the WOA equations.\n\n6. Update the fitness values of the search agents.\n\n7. If a new best search agent is found, update the best search agent.\n\n8. Increment the iteration t = t + 1.\n\n9. Repeat steps 5 to 8 until the maximum number of iterations (T) is reached.\n\n10. The best search agent's position represents the solution to the optimization problem.\n\nAfter running the Whale Optimization Algorithm for the given function f(x) = -cos(x) over the interval [0, 2π], we can find the minimum value of the function. In this case, the minimum value of the function f(x) = -cos(x) is -1, which occurs at x = π."
