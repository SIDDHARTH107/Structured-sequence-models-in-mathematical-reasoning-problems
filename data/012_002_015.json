    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of graph G, we first need to understand the concept of chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nSince G has 6 vertices and 7 edges, it is not a complete graph (a complete graph with 6 vertices would have 6 * (6-1) / 2 = 15 edges). Therefore, the chromatic number of G is less than or equal to 5 (as the chromatic number of a complete graph with n vertices is n).\n\nNow, we need to check if G has any cycles of odd length. If it does, then the chromatic number of G is at least 3, as graphs with odd cycles cannot be colored with just 2 colors.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario, where G has the maximum number of odd cycles. In this case, G could be a cycle of length 5 with an additional vertex connected to one of the vertices in the cycle. This graph would have 6 vertices and 7 edges, and its chromatic number would be 3, as it has an odd cycle.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of graph G is at most 3. Since we have already established that it is at least 3, the chromatic number of G is exactly 3."
