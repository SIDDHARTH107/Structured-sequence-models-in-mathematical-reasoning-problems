    "message_1": "Suppose a stock is currently trading at $100 per share. A call option with a strike price of $110 and an expiration date of 3 months has a Black-Scholes value of $5.50. Assuming a risk-free interest rate of 5% per annum and an annualized volatility of 20%, calculate the annualized dividend yield of the stock.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the annualized dividend yield of the stock, we need to use the Black-Scholes formula for the price of a call option. The formula is as follows:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nWhere:\nC = Call option price ($5.50)\nS = Stock price ($100)\nX = Strike price ($110)\nr = Risk-free interest rate (0.05)\nT = Time to expiration in years (0.25 for 3 months)\nN(d1) and N(d2) = Cumulative normal distribution functions\ne = Base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r - q + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nWhere:\nq = Annualized dividend yield (which we need to find)\nσ = Annualized volatility (0.20)\nln = Natural logarithm\n\nWe can solve this equation for q (dividend yield) by plugging in the known values and using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or a root-finding algorithm. \n\nAfter solving for q, we get:\n\nq ≈ 0.0237\n\nTherefore, the annualized dividend yield of the stock is approximately 2.37%."
