    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C30, D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy Sylow's first theorem, there must exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p of the order of G. Let P, Q, and R be Sylow 2-subgroup, Sylow 3-subgroup, and Sylow 5-subgroup of G, respectively. Then, the orders of P, Q, and R are 2, 3, and 5, respectively.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G (denoted by n_5) must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. The only divisor that satisfies the congruence condition is 1 (since 6 is not congruent to 1 modulo 5). Thus, n_5 = 1, which means there is only one cyclic subgroup of order 5 in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, then G has a unique element of order 30, and it is generated by this element. Since the order of G is 30, there must be a unique cyclic subgroup of order 5 in G, which we have already established.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15, then G has 15 elements of order 2 (the reflections) and 2 elements of order 15 (the rotations). In this case, there are two cyclic subgroups of order 5 in G, generated by the rotations. However, since we have shown that there is only one cyclic subgroup of order 5 in G, this case is not possible.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30, then G has a unique cyclic subgroup of order 5, as we have already established. Moreover, G must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup (since n_5 = 1). Let H be the normal Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Then, G has a semidirect product structure G = H â‹Š Q, where Q is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. This structure is non-abelian, as required.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30 or the non-abelian group of order 30, since we have found the number of cyclic subgroups of order 5 in G and eliminated the possibility of G being isomorphic to the dihedral group D15."
