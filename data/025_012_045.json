    "message_2": "Schoof's algorithm is used to compute the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field. The main idea of the algorithm is to compute the trace of Frobenius modulo small primes and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the trace of Frobenius, which allows us to compute the number of points on the curve.\n\nGiven the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 10x + 6$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$, we want to compute the number of points on the curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_{17})$.\n\nStep 1: Compute the possible values of the trace of Frobenius.\nThe Hasse's theorem states that the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field is bounded by the following inequality:\n$$q + 1 - 2\\sqrt{q} \\leq N \\leq q + 1 + 2\\sqrt{q}$$\nwhere $q = 17$ is the size of the finite field and $N$ is the number of points on the curve. In our case, we have:\n$$12 \\leq N \\leq 22$$\n\nStep 2: Compute the trace of Frobenius modulo small primes.\nWe will compute the trace of Frobenius modulo 2 and modulo 3. The trace of Frobenius is defined as $t = q + 1 - N$. In our case, we have:\n$$t \\equiv 0, 1 \\pmod{2}$$\n$$t \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3}$$\n\nStep 3: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the trace of Frobenius.\nWe have the following system of congruences:\n$$t \\equiv 0, 1 \\pmod{2}$$\n$$t \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3}$$\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find the following possible values for $t$ modulo 6:\n$$t \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 \\pmod{6}$$\n\nStep 4: Compute the number of points on the curve.\nRecall that $t = q + 1 - N$. We can compute the possible values of $N$ using the possible values of $t$:\n1. If $t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$, then $t = 0$ and $N = 18$.\n2. If $t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, then $t = 1$ and $N = 17$.\n3. If $t \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}$, then $t = 2$ and $N = 16$.\n4. If $t \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}$, then $t = 4$ and $N = 14$.\n5. If $t \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$, then $t = 5$ and $N = 13$.\n\nStep 5: Verify the number of points on the curve.\nWe can verify the number of points on the curve by checking if the curve has a point of order 2 or 3. If the curve has a point of order 2, then the number of points on the curve is even. If the curve has a point of order 3, then the number of points on the curve is divisible by 3.\n\n1. Check for a point of order 2: A point of order 2 has the form $(x, 0)$, so we need to find an $x$ such that $x^3 + 10x + 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{17}$. We can check all possible values of $x$ and find that there is no such point.\n\n2. Check for a point of order 3: A point of order 3 satisfies the equation $[3]P = \\mathcal{O}$, where $P$ is a point on the curve and $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity. We can check all possible points on the curve and find that there is no point of order 3.\n\nSince there is no point of order 2 or 3, the number of points on the curve must be odd and not divisible by 3. The only possible value of $N$ that satisfies these conditions is $N = 19$.\n\nTherefore, there are 19 points on the elliptic curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_{17})$."
