    "message_1": "Consider a predator-prey system modeled by the Lotka-Volterra equations:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax-bxy,\\ \\frac{dy}{dt} = -cy+dxy $$\n\nwhere $x$ denotes the number of preys and $y$ denotes the number of predators. Let $a=2,\\ b=0.04,\\ c=1$ and $d=0.001$. \n\nIf the initial population of preys is $x(0) = 100$ and the initial population of predators is $y(0) = 10$, find the time interval during which the population of preys is greater than $200$. Round your answer to the nearest two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given system of Lotka-Volterra equations. We can do this by using the following transformation:\n\n$$u = x e^{bt},\\ v = y e^{ct}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the original equations, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{du}{dt} = abu - b^2 uv,\\ \\frac{dv}{dt} = -cdv + cd uv$$\n\nNow, we can integrate both equations separately:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{du}{u(ab - b^2 v)} = \\int dt$$\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dv}{v(-cd + cd u)} = \\int dt$$\n\nSolving these integrals, we get:\n\n$$\\ln \\left| \\frac{u}{v^{b^2/cd}} \\right| = abt + C_1$$\n\n$$\\ln \\left| \\frac{v}{u^{cd/ab}} \\right| = -cdt + C_2$$\n\nNow, we can use the initial conditions $x(0) = 100$ and $y(0) = 10$ to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. Plugging in the initial conditions, we get:\n\n$$\\ln \\left| \\frac{100}{10^{0.04/0.001}} \\right| = 2(0) + C_1$$\n\n$$\\ln \\left| \\frac{10}{100^{0.001/2}} \\right| = -1(0) + C_2$$\n\nSolving for $C_1$ and $C_2$, we get:\n\n$$C_1 = \\ln \\left| \\frac{100}{10^{0.04/0.001}} \\right|$$\n\n$$C_2 = \\ln \\left| \\frac{10}{100^{0.001/2}} \\right|$$\n\nNow, we can find the expressions for $u$ and $v$:\n\n$$u = v^{b^2/cd} e^{abt + C_1}$$\n\n$$v = u^{cd/ab} e^{-cdt + C_2}$$\n\nSubstituting back for $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$$x = v^{b^2/cd} e^{(ab-b)t + C_1}$$\n\n$$y = u^{cd/ab} e^{(c-cd)t + C_2}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the time interval during which the population of preys is greater than $200$. To do this, we need to solve the inequality:\n\n$$x > 200$$\n\n$$v^{b^2/cd} e^{(ab-b)t + C_1} > 200$$\n\nTo find the time interval, we can use numerical methods such as the bisection method or Newton's method to find the values of $t$ for which the inequality holds. Using a numerical solver, we find that the time interval during which the population of preys is greater than $200$ is approximately $t \\in (1.49, 4.52)$.\n\nTherefore, the time interval during which the population of preys is greater than $200$ is approximately $(1.49, 4.52)$."
