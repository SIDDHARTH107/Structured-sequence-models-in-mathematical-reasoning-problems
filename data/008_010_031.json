    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  1 -1 |  5 |\n| 1 -3  2 | -6 |\n| 3  2  1 |  7 |\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n| 1 -3  2 | -6 |\n| 2  1 -1 |  5 |\n| 3  2  1 |  7 |\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and replace Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n|  1 -3  2 |  -6  |\n|  0  7 -5 |  17  |\n|  0 11 -5 |  25  |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7:\n\n|  1 -3  2 |  -6  |\n|  0  1 -5/7 | 17/7 |\n|  0 11 -5 |  25  |\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with (3 * Row 2) + Row 1 and replace Row 3 with (-11 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n|  1  0 1/7 |  1  |\n|  0  1 -5/7 | 17/7|\n|  0  0  0  |  0  |\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the first row: x + (1/7)z = 1\nFrom the second row: y - (5/7)z = 17/7\n\nSince the third row is all zeros, it does not provide any additional information.\n\nNow, we can solve for z from the first equation:\n\nz = 7(x - 1)\n\nSubstitute this value of z into the second equation:\n\ny - 5(x - 1) = 17/7\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\nx = 2\ny = 3\n\nSubstitute the values of x and y into the equation for z:\n\nz = 7(2 - 1)\nz = 7\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations are x = 2, y = 3, and z = 7."
