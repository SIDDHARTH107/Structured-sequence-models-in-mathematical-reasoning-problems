    "message_2": "The length of the Heighway dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (sqrt(2))^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration:\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2))^8\n\nLength = 1 * 2^4\n\nLength = 1 * 16\n\nLength = 16\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 16."
