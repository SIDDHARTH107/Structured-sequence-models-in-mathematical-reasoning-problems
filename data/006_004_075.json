    "message_1": "In a game of chance, a player rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling a number less than 3 or greater than 4 at least once in three rolls?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability method. We will first find the probability of not rolling a number less than 3 or greater than 4 in all three rolls, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of rolling a number less than 3 or greater than 4 at least once in three rolls.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number between 3 and 4 (inclusive) on a single roll is 2/6, since there are 2 favorable outcomes (3 and 4) out of 6 possible outcomes. \n\nThe probability of rolling a number between 3 and 4 on all three rolls is (2/6) * (2/6) * (2/6) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/27.\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability:\n\n1 - (probability of rolling a number between 3 and 4 on all three rolls) = 1 - 1/27 = 26/27.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number less than 3 or greater than 4 at least once in three rolls is 26/27."
