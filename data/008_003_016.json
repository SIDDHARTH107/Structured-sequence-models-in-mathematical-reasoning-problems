    "message_2": "To find the rank of a matrix, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nA =\n[ 2  4  6 ]\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n\nFirst, we'll subtract 1/2 of the first row from the second row to eliminate the 1 in the second row, first column.\n\nA =\n[ 2  4  6 ]\n[ 0  0  0 ]\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n\nNow, we can see that the second row is all zeros, so it is linearly dependent on the other rows. The first and third rows are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 2."
