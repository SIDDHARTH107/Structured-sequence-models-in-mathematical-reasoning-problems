    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^{-2|t|}, we first need to define the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform F(ω) of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) e^{-jωt} dt\n\nIn this case, f(t) = e^{-2|t|}. Since the function is even, i.e., f(-t) = f(t), we can simplify the integral as follows:\n\nF(ω) = 2 ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-2|t|} cos(ωt) dt\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral. To do this, we can use integration by parts. Let u = e^{-2|t|} and dv = cos(ωt) dt. Then, du = -2e^{-2|t|} dt and v = (1/ω)sin(ωt). Applying integration by parts:\n\nF(ω) = 2 [uv|_{0}^{∞} - ∫_{0}^{∞} v du]\n\nF(ω) = 2 [(1/ω)e^{-2|t|}sin(ωt)|_{0}^{∞} + (2/ω) ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-2|t|} sin(ωt) dt]\n\nThe first term in the brackets goes to zero as t goes to infinity, and the second term is zero when t = 0. So, we are left with:\n\nF(ω) = 4/ω ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-2|t|} sin(ωt) dt\n\nNow, we can use the Laplace transform table to find the integral. The Laplace transform of e^{-at}sin(bt) is given by:\n\nL{e^{-at}sin(bt)} = b/((s+a)^2 + b^2)\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and b = ω. So, the integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = 4/ω * (ω/((s+2)^2 + ω^2))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform to get back to the time domain. The inverse Laplace transform of 1/((s+a)^2 + b^2) is given by:\n\nL^{-1}{1/((s+a)^2 + b^2)} = (1/b)e^{-at}sin(bt)\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and b = ω. So, the inverse Laplace transform becomes:\n\nF(ω) = 4/ω * (1/ω)e^{-2t}sin(ωt)\n\nF(ω) = 4/(ω^2 + 4)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^{-2|t|} is F(ω) = 4/(ω^2 + 4)."
