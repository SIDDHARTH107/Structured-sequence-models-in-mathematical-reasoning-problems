Using network flow optimization, determine the minimum number of trips required to transport all the goods from Location A to Location B.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of trips required to transport all the goods from Location A to Location B, we can simply divide the total amount of goods (1000 tons) by the maximum capacity of each road (200 tons).\n\n1000 tons / 200 tons = 5 trips\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of trips required to transport all the goods from Location A to Location B is 5 trips."
