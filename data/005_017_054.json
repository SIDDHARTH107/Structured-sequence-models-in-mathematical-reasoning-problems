    "message_2": "To find the principal component, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is given as:\n\nCovariance matrix = [[1, 0.9], \n                    [0.9, 1]]\n\nLet's find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation, which is the determinant of (Covariance matrix - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\n|1-λ, 0.9  | = 0\n|0.9, 1-λ|\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(1-λ)(1-λ) - (0.9)(0.9) = 0\nλ^2 - 2λ + 1 - 0.81 = 0\nλ^2 - 2λ + 0.19 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the eigenvalues:\n\nλ = (2 ± sqrt((-2)^2 - 4(1)(0.19))) / 2(1)\nλ = (2 ± sqrt(4 - 0.76)) / 2\nλ = (2 ± sqrt(3.24)) / 2\n\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n\nλ1 = (2 + sqrt(3.24)) / 2 ≈ 1.62\nλ2 = (2 - sqrt(3.24)) / 2 ≈ 0.38\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue by solving the following equation:\n\n(Covariance matrix - λI) * eigenvector = 0\n\nFor λ1 = 1.62:\n\n|1-1.62, 0.9  | * |x1| = |0|\n|0.9, 1-1.62|   * |x2|   |0|\n\n|-0.62, 0.9 | * |x1| = |0|\n|0.9, -0.62|   * |x2|   |0|\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector:\n\neigenvector1 = [1, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 0.38:\n\n|1-0.38, 0.9  | * |x1| = |0|\n|0.9, 1-0.38|   * |x2|   |0|\n\n|0.62, 0.9 | * |x1| = |0|\n|0.9, 0.62|   * |x2|   |0|\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector:\n\neigenvector2 = [1, -1]\n\nThe principal component is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. In this case, the largest eigenvalue is λ1 = 1.62, and its corresponding eigenvector is [1, 1]. Therefore, the principal component is [1, 1]."
