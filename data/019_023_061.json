    "message_2": "The pattern in the sequence is that each number is a perfect square. The sequence is formed by squaring the consecutive positive integers:\n\n1^2 = 1\n2^2 = 4\n3^2 = 9\n4^2 = 16\n5^2 = 25\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to square the next positive integer:\n\n6^2 = 36\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 36."
