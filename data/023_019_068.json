    "message_2": "To determine the output signal y(t), we first need to find the Fourier transform of the output signal, Y(jω). According to the properties of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, the Fourier transform of the output signal is the product of the input signal's Fourier transform and the system's transfer function:\n\nY(jω) = X(jω) * H(jω)\n\nGiven X(jω) = 1/(jω + 2) and H(jω) = (3jω + 2)/(jω + 1), we can find Y(jω) by multiplying these two functions:\n\nY(jω) = (1/(jω + 2)) * ((3jω + 2)/(jω + 1))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω) to obtain the output signal y(t) in the time domain. To do this, we can use the convolution theorem, which states that the inverse Fourier transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of their inverse Fourier transforms:\n\ny(t) = F^(-1){Y(jω)} = F^(-1){X(jω)} * F^(-1){H(jω)}\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse Fourier transforms of X(jω) and H(jω):\n\nx(t) = F^(-1){1/(jω + 2)} = e^(-2t) * u(t)\nh(t) = F^(-1){(3jω + 2)/(jω + 1)} = (3 - 2e^(-t)) * u(t)\n\nNow, we can find y(t) by convolving x(t) and h(t):\n\ny(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫[e^(-2τ) * u(τ) * (3 - 2e^(-(t-τ))) * u(t-τ)] dτ\n\nThe limits of integration are from τ = 0 to τ = t, since the unit step functions u(τ) and u(t-τ) are both 0 for negative values of τ:\n\ny(t) = ∫[e^(-2τ) * (3 - 2e^(-(t-τ))) * u(t-τ)] dτ from 0 to t\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\ny(t) = ∫[3e^(-2τ) - 2e^(-t)] dτ from 0 to t\ny(t) = [-3/2 * e^(-2τ) - 2e^(-t) * τ] from 0 to t\ny(t) = [-3/2 * e^(-2t) - 2te^(-t)] - [-3/2]\n\nFinally, we have the output signal y(t):\n\ny(t) = -3/2 * e^(-2t) - 2te^(-t) + 3/2\n\nThis is the output signal y(t) for the given input signal x(t) and system transfer function H(jω)."
