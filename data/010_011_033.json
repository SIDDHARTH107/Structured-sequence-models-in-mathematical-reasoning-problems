    "message_1": "Consider a compact 2-dimensional manifold M, which is homeomorphic to a sphere. Let M have a non-empty boundary and let $f:M\\rightarrow S^1$ be a continuous function that is not null-homotopic. Prove that $f$ has at least two zeros. \n\n(Note: $S^1$ denotes the unit circle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.)",
    "message_2": "Since M is homeomorphic to a sphere, we can think of M as a sphere with a hole (i.e., a disk removed). Let's denote the boundary of this hole as $\\partial M$. Since $f:M\\rightarrow S^1$ is a continuous function that is not null-homotopic, we know that the restriction of f to the boundary, $f|_{\\partial M}:\\partial M\\rightarrow S^1$, is also not null-homotopic.\n\nNow, consider the winding number of $f|_{\\partial M}$, which is a topological invariant that counts the number of times the curve $f|_{\\partial M}$ winds around the origin in the complex plane. Since $f|_{\\partial M}$ is not null-homotopic, its winding number must be non-zero. Let's denote the winding number as $n \\neq 0$.\n\nNext, we extend the function $f$ to the whole sphere by filling in the hole with a disk. We can do this by defining a new function $g:M\\cup D\\rightarrow S^1$, where $D$ is a disk that fills the hole, such that $g|_M = f$ and $g|_D$ is a continuous extension. We can define this extension as follows:\n\n$$\ng(x) = \\begin{cases}\nf(x) & \\text{if } x \\in M \\\\\ne^{2\\pi i n \\frac{d(x)}{r}} & \\text{if } x \\in D\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nHere, $d(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the center of the disk $D$, and $r$ is the radius of the disk. This extension is continuous and maps the boundary of the disk to a circle in $S^1$ with winding number $n$.\n\nNow, consider the preimage of a point $p \\in S^1$ under the function $g$. Since $g$ is continuous, the preimage $g^{-1}(p)$ is a closed set in the sphere. Moreover, since the sphere is connected, the preimage must be non-empty. Let $x_0 \\in g^{-1}(p)$ be a point in the preimage.\n\nWe claim that there must be at least two points in the preimage $g^{-1}(p)$. Suppose, for contradiction, that there is only one point $x_0$. Then, we can find a small neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $g(U)$ is a small loop around $p$ in $S^1$. However, this would mean that the winding number of $g|_{\\partial M}$ is zero, which contradicts our assumption that it is non-zero.\n\nTherefore, there must be at least two points in the preimage $g^{-1}(p)$. Since $g$ is an extension of $f$, these points must also be in the preimage of $f$, i.e., $f^{-1}(p)$. Since $p$ is an arbitrary point in $S^1$, this implies that $f$ has at least two zeros."
