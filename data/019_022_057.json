Option B has a 40% chance of earning a profit of $80,000 and a 60% chance of earning a profit of -$10,000. Which option should the company choose based on expected value?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option the company should choose based on expected value, we need to calculate the expected value for each option.\n\nExpected Value (EV) = (Probability of Outcome 1 * Value of Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 * Value of Outcome 2)\n\nFor Option A:\nEV_A = (0.60 * $50,000) + (0.40 * $20,000)\nEV_A = ($30,000) + ($8,000)\nEV_A = $38,000\n\nFor Option B:\nEV_B = (0.40 * $80,000) + (0.60 * -$10,000)\nEV_B = ($32,000) + (-$6,000)\nEV_B = $26,000\n\nBased on the expected values, Option A has a higher expected value of $38,000 compared to Option B's expected value of $26,000. Therefore, the company should choose Option A."
