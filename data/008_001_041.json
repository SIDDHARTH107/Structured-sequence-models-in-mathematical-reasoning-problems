Write the given system of equations in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\n2. Find the inverse of matrix A.\n\n3. Multiply the inverse of matrix A with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n1. Write the given system of equations in the matrix form AX = B.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 3 -1  4 |\n    | 2  3  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  4  |\n    | -2  |\n    |  5  |\n\n2. Find the inverse of matrix A.\n\nTo find the inverse of matrix A, we will first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 1(-1 - 12) - 2(3 - 8) - 1(9 + 2)\n       = -13 - 2(-5) - 11\n       = -13 + 10 - 11\n       = -14\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, let's find the inverse.\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nFirst, we need to find the adjoint (adj) of matrix A. The adjoint of a matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.\n\nCofactor matrix of A:\n\nC11 = (-1 - 12) = -13\nC12 = -(3 - 8) = 5\nC13 = (9 + 2) = 11\n\nC21 = -(6 - 4) = -2\nC22 = -(-1 - 4) = 5\nC23 = -(6 - 2) = -4\n\nC31 = (6 - 3) = 3\nC32 = -(2 + 4) = -6\nC33 = (1 + 6) = 7\n\nNow, let's find the transpose of the cofactor matrix:\n\nadj(A) = | -13  -2  3 |\n         |  5   5 -6 |\n         | 11  -4  7 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-14) * adj(A)\n\nA^(-1) = |  13/14   1/7  -3/14 |\n         | -5/14  -5/14  3/7  |\n         | -11/14  2/7  -1/2  |\n\n3. Multiply the inverse of matrix A with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  13/14   1/7  -3/14 |  |  4  |\n    | -5/14  -5/14  3/7  |  | -2  |\n    | -11/14  2/7  -1/2  |  |  5  |\n\nX = | (13/14)*4 + (1/7)*(-2) + (-3/14)*5  |\n    | (-5/14)*4 + (-5/14)*(-2) + (3/7)*5  |\n    | (-11/14)*4 + (2/7)*(-2) + (-1/2)*5  |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = 3."
