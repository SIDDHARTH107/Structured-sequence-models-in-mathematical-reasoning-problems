    "message_2": "To determine the minimum value of k, we need to consider the properties of compact manifolds and their cohomology groups. \n\nFirst, recall that a compact manifold is a topological space that is both compact (every open cover has a finite subcover) and a manifold (locally Euclidean). \n\nNow, let's consider the cohomology groups of a compact manifold. The cohomology groups are topological invariants that measure the \"holes\" in the manifold. The k-th cohomology group, $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, counts the number of k-dimensional holes in the manifold.\n\nSince we are given that there are 10 linearly independent elements in $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, this means that there are 10 k-dimensional holes in the manifold. To minimize k, we want to find the smallest k such that this is possible.\n\nFor k = 0, the cohomology group $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ counts the number of connected components of the manifold. Since a compact manifold is connected, there is only one connected component, and thus $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ has only one linearly independent element.\n\nFor k = 1, the cohomology group $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ counts the number of 1-dimensional holes, which are essentially loops that cannot be contracted to a point. In this case, it is possible to have 10 linearly independent elements in $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. For example, consider a torus with 10 holes (a 10-holed torus). Each hole represents a non-contractible loop, and there are 10 such loops that are linearly independent. Therefore, the minimum value of k is 1."
