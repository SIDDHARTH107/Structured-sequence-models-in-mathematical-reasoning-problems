    "message_1": "A shopkeeper is planning to buy chocolates for the upcoming holiday season. He can buy three different types of chocolates, each with a different price per pound. Chocolate A costs $10 per pound, Chocolate B costs $8 per pound, and Chocolate C costs $12 per pound. The shopkeeper has a budget of $2000 to buy chocolates. He wants to buy at least 200 pounds of Chocolate A and 300 pounds of Chocolate B. Assuming that he can only buy whole pounds, what is the maximum weight in pounds of Chocolate C that he can buy to stay within his budget?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to calculate the cost of buying the minimum required amounts of Chocolate A and Chocolate B.\n\nCost of Chocolate A = 200 pounds * $10 per pound = $2000\nCost of Chocolate B = 300 pounds * $8 per pound = $2400\n\nNow, let's subtract the cost of Chocolate A and Chocolate B from the total budget to see how much money is left for Chocolate C.\n\nRemaining budget for Chocolate C = $2000 (total budget) - $2000 (cost of Chocolate A) - $2400 (cost of Chocolate B) = -$400\n\nSince the remaining budget is negative, the shopkeeper cannot buy the minimum required amounts of Chocolate A and Chocolate B and stay within his budget. Therefore, it is not possible to buy any amount of Chocolate C while meeting the minimum requirements for Chocolate A and Chocolate B and staying within the budget."
