    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the second equation for y:\n\n5x - y = 3\ny = 5x - 3\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(5x - 3) = 10\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n3x + 10x - 6 = 10\n13x = 16\nx = 16/13\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for y:\n\ny = 5(16/13) - 3\ny = 80/13 - 3\ny = 80/13 - 39/13\ny = 41/13\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 16/13 and y = 41/13."
