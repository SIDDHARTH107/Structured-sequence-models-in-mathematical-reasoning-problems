    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle with vertices A, B, and C. Let angle A be 60 degrees, angle B be 35 degrees, and angle C be the unknown angle. Let side a be opposite angle A, side b be opposite angle B, and side c be opposite angle C. We are given that side a = 10.5 meters.\n\nFirst, we need to find angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can calculate angle C as follows:\n\nC = 180 - (A + B) = 180 - (60 + 35) = 180 - 95 = 85 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the lengths of sides b and c. The law of sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In other words:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe can use this formula to find the lengths of sides b and c:\n\nb / sin(B) = a / sin(A)\nb / sin(35) = 10.5 / sin(60)\nb = (10.5 * sin(35)) / sin(60)\nb ≈ 6.32 meters\n\nc / sin(C) = a / sin(A)\nc / sin(85) = 10.5 / sin(60)\nc = (10.5 * sin(85)) / sin(60)\nc ≈ 10.87 meters\n\nSo, the lengths of the remaining two sides of the triangle are approximately 6.32 meters and 10.87 meters."
