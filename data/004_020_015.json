    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA force given by F(x) = 2x^2 - 4x - 6 N acts on an object for a distance of 4 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to integrate the force function F(x) over the distance the object moves. In this case, the distance is 4 meters, so we'll integrate from 0 to 4.\n\nThe work done (W) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = ∫(F(x) dx) from 0 to 4\n\nGiven F(x) = 2x^2 - 4x - 6, we first need to find the antiderivative of F(x):\n\n∫(F(x) dx) = ∫(2x^2 - 4x - 6 dx) = (2/3)x^3 - 2x^2 - 6x + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nW = [(2/3)(4)^3 - 2(4)^2 - 6(4)] - [(2/3)(0)^3 - 2(0)^2 - 6(0)]\nW = [(2/3)(64) - 2(16) - 24] - [0]\nW = [42.67 - 32 - 24]\nW = -13.33 J\n\nThe work done by the force over the 4-meter distance is -13.33 Joules. The negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the displacement."
