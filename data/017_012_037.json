    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 8, which we will call H. Let x be an element of order 2 in H. Since the order of H is 8, there must be at least one other element of order 2 in H, which we will call y. Now, let's consider the possibilities for the number of elements of order 2 in G.\n\n1. If G has exactly one element of order 2, then G must be a cyclic group of order 16, denoted as C16. This is because if there is only one element of order 2, it must be the unique element of order 2 in the center of G, and thus G is abelian. Since G is abelian and has an element of order 16, G must be isomorphic to C16.\n\n2. If G has exactly 5 elements of order 2, then G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D8. This is because the dihedral group D8 has 8 elements of order 2 (the reflections) and 8 elements of order 1 or 4 (the rotations). Since G has 5 elements of order 2, it must have 11 elements of order 1, 4, or 8. The only possibility for G is that it has one element of order 1 (the identity), 8 elements of order 4, and 7 elements of order 8. This is precisely the structure of the dihedral group D8.\n\n3. If G has 9 or more elements of order 2, then G must be a non-abelian group of order 16. This is because if G has 9 or more elements of order 2, then G must have 7 or fewer elements of order 1, 4, or 8. Since G has one element of order 1 (the identity), it must have 6 or fewer elements of order 4 or 8. This means that G cannot be abelian, as an abelian group of order 16 must have at least 8 elements of order 4 or 8. Thus, G must be a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, by determining the number of elements of order 2 in the group G of order 16, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16."
