    "message_1": "Suppose a family is planning a road trip of 500 miles. If the probability of encountering a flat tire on any given mile of the trip is 0.002, what is the probability that the family will experience at least one flat tire during the entire trip?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of experiencing at least one flat tire is the probability of not experiencing any flat tires during the entire trip.\n\nThe probability of not experiencing a flat tire on any given mile is 1 - 0.002 = 0.998.\n\nFor the entire 500-mile trip, the probability of not experiencing any flat tires is (0.998)^500, since the events are independent.\n\nNow, we can calculate this value:\n\n(0.998)^500 ≈ 0.367.\n\nFinally, we find the complementary probability, which is the probability of experiencing at least one flat tire:\n\n1 - 0.367 ≈ 0.633.\n\nSo, the probability that the family will experience at least one flat tire during the entire trip is approximately 0.633, or 63.3%."
