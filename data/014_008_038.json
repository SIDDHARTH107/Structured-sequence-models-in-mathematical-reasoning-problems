    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 64-bit block of plaintext that needs to be encrypted using a block cipher algorithm that works on 128-bit blocks. How many rounds of encryption will be needed to encrypt the entire 64-bit plaintext block?",
    "message_2": "If you have a 64-bit block of plaintext and you need to encrypt it using a block cipher algorithm that works on 128-bit blocks, you will need to pad the 64-bit plaintext to fit into a 128-bit block. After padding, you can encrypt the entire 128-bit block in a single round. Therefore, only one round of encryption will be needed to encrypt the entire 64-bit plaintext block."
