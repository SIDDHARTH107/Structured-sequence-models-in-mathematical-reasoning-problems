    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we first define the function f(x, y) representing the derivative y':\n\nf(x, y) = y - x^2 + 1\n\nNow, we apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.2:\n\n1. Initialize the starting point: x0 = 0, y0 = 0.5\n2. Calculate the four increments k1, k2, k3, and k4:\n   - k1 = h * f(x0, y0)\n   - k2 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2)\n   - k3 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2)\n   - k4 = h * f(x0 + h, y0 + k3)\n3. Update the values of x and y:\n   - x1 = x0 + h\n   - y1 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining steps.\n\nNow, we perform the calculations:\n\nStep 1:\nx0 = 0, y0 = 0.5\n\nStep 2:\nk1 = 0.2 * f(0, 0.5) = 0.2 * (0.5 - 0 + 1) = 0.3\nk2 = 0.2 * f(0.1, 0.65) = 0.2 * (0.65 - 0.01 + 1) = 0.2672\nk3 = 0.2 * f(0.1, 0.634) = 0.2 * (0.634 - 0.01 + 1) = 0.2648\nk4 = 0.2 * f(0.2, 0.5984) = 0.2 * (0.5984 - 0.04 + 1) = 0.23168\n\nStep 3:\nx1 = 0 + 0.2 = 0.2\ny1 = 0.5 + (0.3 + 2*0.2672 + 2*0.2648 + 0.23168) / 6 = 0.82976\n\nWe repeat the process for the remaining steps:\n\nStep 4:\nx2 = 0.4, y2 = 1.21466944\n\nStep 5:\nx3 = 0.6, y3 = 1.654338048\n\nStep 6:\nx4 = 0.8, y4 = 2.1270022784\n\nStep 7:\nx5 = 1.0, y5 = 2.61444334848\n\nSo, the approximate solution at x = 1 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.2 is y(1) â‰ˆ 2.61444334848."
