    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 40. Since 40 = 2^3 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroup Q. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which means that Q is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup P. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which means that P is also normal in G.\n\nSince both P and Q are normal in G, we can consider their direct product P × Q. This direct product has order 8 * 5 = 40, which is the order of G. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to P × Q.\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible structures of P and Q. Since Q has order 5, which is prime, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C5. For P, there are two possibilities: it can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C8 or the dihedral group D4.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to C8 × C5, which is the cyclic group C40. If P is isomorphic to D4, then G is isomorphic to D4 × C5, which is the dihedral group D20.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when P is non-abelian. There are 8 non-abelian groups of order 8, which are the generalized quaternion groups Q8, the dihedral groups D4, and the semidihedral groups SD4. Since P is non-abelian, G must also be non-abelian. Therefore, there are 8 non-abelian groups of order 40 that can be formed by taking the direct product of P with C5.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 40: the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20, and 8 non-abelian groups formed by taking the direct product of a non-abelian group of order 8 with C5. Every group of order 40 is isomorphic to one of these 10 groups."
