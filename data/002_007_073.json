    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a base of length 10 cm and 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. Find the area of the trapezoid in square cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the two bases have lengths of 10 cm and 8 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 8) * 6\nArea = (1/2) * 18 * 6\nArea = 9 * 6\nArea = 54 square cm\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 54 square cm."
