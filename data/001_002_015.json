    "message_2": "The given equation is already in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFor the equation y = 2x + 5:\n\nThe slope (m) is 2.\nThe y-intercept (b) is 5.\n\nTo graph the line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Plot the y-intercept (0, 5) on the graph.\n2. From the y-intercept point, use the slope to find the next point. Since the slope is 2, this means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. So, from the point (0, 5), move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up to find the next point (1, 7).\n3. Draw a line through the two points (0, 5) and (1, 7) and extend it in both directions.\n\nThe graph of the line y = 2x + 5 has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 5."
