    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Lagrange multipliers method. Let's denote the weights of the stocks as $w_1, w_2, w_3$. The objective function to minimize is the portfolio variance, given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{Var}(w) = w^T \\Sigma w,\n$$\n\nwhere $w = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ w_3 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The expected return constraint: $R^T w \\geq 0.1$, where $R$ is the vector of expected returns for each stock. We don't have the values of $R$, so we can't solve the problem completely. However, we can still set up the Lagrangian function and find the general solution.\n\n2. The sum of weights constraint: $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1$.\n\nNow, let's set up the Lagrangian function:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(w, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = w^T \\Sigma w - \\lambda_1 (R^T w - 0.1) - \\lambda_2 (w_1 + w_2 + w_3 - 1),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are the Lagrange multipliers.\n\nTo find the optimal weights, we need to take the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function with respect to $w_1, w_2, w_3, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ and set them equal to zero:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_i} = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\Sigma_{ij} w_j - \\lambda_1 R_i - \\lambda_2 = 0, \\quad i = 1, 2, 3,\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda_1} = R^T w - 0.1 = 0,\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda_2} = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 - 1 = 0.\n$$\n\nThese equations form a system of linear equations that can be solved to find the optimal weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$ and the Lagrange multipliers $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$. However, without the values of the expected returns $R$, we cannot find the numerical solution for the weights."
