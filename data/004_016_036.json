    "message_1": "A car travels 120 miles between two cities in 2 hours. Use the mean value theorem to determine the average speed the car has to exceed at least once during the trip.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to find the average speed of the car during the entire trip. The average speed can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total distance is 120 miles, and the total time is 2 hours. So, the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour\n\nNow, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be at least one point during the trip where the car's instantaneous speed is equal to its average speed. Therefore, the car has to exceed an average speed of 60 miles per hour at least once during the trip."
