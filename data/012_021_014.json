    "message_2": "A complete tree of height 3 has a root node, two children nodes for the root, and four children nodes for each of the two children nodes. Here's a drawing of the tree:\n\n```\n        R\n      /   \\\n     A     B\n    / \\   / \\\n   C  D  E   F\n```\n\nThe treewidth of a tree is the minimum size of the largest clique in a tree decomposition minus one. A tree decomposition is a way to represent a graph as a tree, where each node of the tree is a bag containing a subset of the vertices of the graph, and the bags satisfy certain properties.\n\nFor a tree, the treewidth is always 1. This is because we can create a tree decomposition where each bag contains two adjacent vertices, and the largest clique in this decomposition has size 2. Since the treewidth is the size of the largest clique minus one, the treewidth of a complete tree of height 3 is 1."
