    "message_1": "A math student needs to determine the number of symplectic structures that exist on a 2-torus, i.e. a surface obtained by identifying opposite edges of a square. How many distinct linearly independent closed 2-forms can be defined on a 2-torus?",
    "message_2": "A symplectic structure on a manifold is a closed, non-degenerate 2-form. In the case of a 2-torus, we are looking for closed 2-forms that are linearly independent.\n\nA 2-torus can be represented as T^2 = S^1 × S^1, where S^1 is a circle. Let's consider the standard basis of 1-forms on T^2: {dx, dy}, where x and y are the coordinates on the two S^1 factors.\n\nA 2-form on T^2 can be written as a linear combination of the wedge products of these 1-forms, i.e., α = f(x, y) dx ∧ dy, where f(x, y) is a smooth function on T^2.\n\nFor α to be closed, it must satisfy dα = 0. Since α is a 2-form on a 2-dimensional manifold, dα is automatically a 3-form, which is necessarily 0 because there are no 3-forms on a 2-dimensional manifold. Therefore, any 2-form α = f(x, y) dx ∧ dy on T^2 is closed.\n\nNow we need to determine the non-degeneracy condition. A 2-form α is non-degenerate if, for any non-zero tangent vector v, there exists another tangent vector w such that α(v, w) ≠ 0. In our case, α = f(x, y) dx ∧ dy, so α(v, w) = f(x, y) dx(v) dy(w) - f(x, y) dx(w) dy(v). For α to be non-degenerate, we require f(x, y) ≠ 0.\n\nSo, we are looking for linearly independent closed 2-forms α = f(x, y) dx ∧ dy with f(x, y) ≠ 0. Since the 2-torus is compact, any constant function f(x, y) = c with c ≠ 0 will satisfy this condition. However, any multiple of this 2-form will be linearly dependent.\n\nThus, there is only one linearly independent closed 2-form on a 2-torus, given by α = c dx ∧ dy, where c is a non-zero constant."
