    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, ϕ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). To find the value of ϕ(n) for n = 15, we can use the formula:\n\nϕ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of 15: 15 = 3 * 5. So, p1 = 3 and p2 = 5.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nϕ(15) = 15 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nϕ(15) = 15 * (2/3) * (4/5)\nϕ(15) = (15 * 2 * 4) / (3 * 5)\nϕ(15) = 120 / 15\nϕ(15) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for n = 15 is ϕ(15) = 8."
