    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface given by the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 4, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nLet x = x, y = y, and z = f(x, y) where f(x, y) = ±√(x^2 + y^2 - 4). Since we are given the point (1, 1, 2), we can choose the positive square root for f(x, y) as f(1, 1) = 2. So, we have:\n\nz = f(x, y) = √(x^2 + y^2 - 4)\n\nNow, let's find the first and second partial derivatives of f(x, y):\n\nf_x = ∂f/∂x = x / √(x^2 + y^2 - 4)\nf_y = ∂f/∂y = y / √(x^2 + y^2 - 4)\n\nf_xx = ∂²f/∂x² = (y^2 - 4) / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)^(3/2)\nf_yy = ∂²f/∂y² = (x^2 - 4) / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)^(3/2)\nf_xy = ∂²f/∂x∂y = -xy / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)^(3/2)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = 1 + (f_x)^2 = 1 + x^2 / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)\nF = f_x * f_y = xy / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)\nG = 1 + (f_y)^2 = 1 + y^2 / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = f_xx = (y^2 - 4) / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)^(3/2)\nf = f_xy = -xy / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)^(3/2)\ng = f_yy = (x^2 - 4) / (x^2 + y^2 - 4)^(3/2)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (eG - 2fF + gE) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 1 / (1 + 1 - 4) = 1 + 1 / (-2) = -1/2\nF = 1 / (-2) = -1/2\nG = 1 + 1 / (-2) = -1/2\n\ne = (1 - 4) / (-2)^(3/2) = -3 / 2√2\nf = -1 / (-2)^(3/2) = 1 / 2√2\ng = (1 - 4) / (-2)^(3/2) = -3 / 2√2\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for H, we get:\n\nH = ((-3/2√2)(-1/2) - 2(1/2√2)(-1/2) + (-3/2√2)(-1/2)) / (2((-1/2)(-1/2) - (-1/2)^2))\nH = (3/4 + 1/2 + 3/4) / (2(1/4))\nH = (2/4) / (1/2)\nH = 1\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) is 1."
