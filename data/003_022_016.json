    "message_2": "To calculate the dot product of two vectors u and v using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||v|| = √((-2)² + 1²) = √(4 + 1) = √5\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||)\n\nTo find u · v, we can use the component-wise multiplication and addition:\n\nu · v = (3 * -2) + (4 * 1) = -6 + 4 = -2\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (-2) / (5 * √5)\n\nSince we want to find the dot product using trigonometry, we can plug the values back into the formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ) = 5 * √5 * (-2) / (5 * √5) = -2\n\nSo, the dot product of u and v is -2."
