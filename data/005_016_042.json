    "message_2": "To determine whether experience level is a significant predictor of salary using discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the means and covariance matrices for each group (in this case, we have only one group). Then, we will find the discriminant function and use it to classify the salary of a new employee with 9 years of experience.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the means\nMean of Years of Experience (M1) = (3+5+2+7+8+4+1+6) / 8 = 36 / 8 = 4.5\nMean of Salary (M2) = (45+55+40+65+80+50+35+60) / 8 = 430 / 8 = 53.75\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance matrices\nFirst, we need to calculate the deviations from the mean for each variable:\n\n| Years of Experience | Deviation from M1 | Salary (thousands of dollars) | Deviation from M2 |\n|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 3 | -1.5 | 45 | -8.75 |\n| 5 | 0.5 | 55 | 1.25 |\n| 2 | -2.5 | 40 | -13.75 |\n| 7 | 2.5 | 65 | 11.25 |\n| 8 | 3.5 | 80 | 26.25 |\n| 4 | -0.5 | 50 | -3.75 |\n| 1 | -3.5 | 35 | -18.75 |\n| 6 | 1.5 | 60 | 6.25 |\n\nNow, we can calculate the covariance matrix:\n\nCovariance(Experience, Experience) = Σ[(Deviation from M1)^2] / (n-1) = (1.5^2 + 0.5^2 + 2.5^2 + 2.5^2 + 3.5^2 + 0.5^2 + 3.5^2 + 1.5^2) / 7 = 30.5 / 7 = 4.357\n\nCovariance(Experience, Salary) = Σ[(Deviation from M1) * (Deviation from M2)] / (n-1) = (-1.5 * -8.75 + 0.5 * 1.25 + -2.5 * -13.75 + 2.5 * 11.25 + 3.5 * 26.25 + -0.5 * -3.75 + -3.5 * -18.75 + 1.5 * 6.25) / 7 = 169.375 / 7 = 24.196\n\nCovariance(Salary, Experience) = Covariance(Experience, Salary) = 24.196\n\nCovariance(Salary, Salary) = Σ[(Deviation from M2)^2] / (n-1) = (8.75^2 + 1.25^2 + 13.75^2 + 11.25^2 + 26.25^2 + 3.75^2 + 18.75^2 + 6.25^2) / 7 = 1562.5 / 7 = 223.214\n\nCovariance matrix:\n| 4.357  24.196 |\n| 24.196 223.214 |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the discriminant function\nThe discriminant function is given by the formula:\nD(x) = W'x + w0\n\nWhere W is the weight vector, x is the input vector, and w0 is the bias term. The weight vector W can be calculated as the inverse of the covariance matrix multiplied by the difference in means:\n\nW = Covariance_matrix^(-1) * (M2 - M1)\n\nUsing a matrix calculator, we can find the inverse of the covariance matrix:\n\n| 4.357  24.196 |^(-1) = | 0.279 -0.030 |\n| 24.196 223.214 |        | -0.030  0.005 |\n\nNow, we can calculate the weight vector W:\n\nW = | 0.279 -0.030 | * (53.75 - 4.5) = | 0.279 -0.030 | * 49.25 = | 13.741 -1.479 |\n    | -0.030  0.005 |                   | -0.030  0.005 |            | -1.479  0.246 |\n\nW = | 12.262 |\n    | -1.233 |\n\nThe bias term w0 can be calculated as:\nw0 = -0.5 * W' * (M1 + M2)\n\nw0 = -0.5 * | 12.262 -1.233 | * | 4.5  |\n            |               |   | 53.75|\n\nw0 = -0.5 * (12.262 * 4.5 + -1.233 * 53.75) = -0.5 * (55.179 - 66.081) = 5.451\n\nNow, we have the discriminant function:\nD(x) = | 12.262 -1.233 | * x + 5.451\n\nStep 4: Classify the salary of a new employee with 9 years of experience\nTo classify the salary of a new employee with 9 years of experience, we can plug the years of experience into the discriminant function:\n\nD(9) = | 12.262 -1.233 | * | 9  |\n       |               |   | x  |\n\nD(9) = 12.262 * 9 + -1.233 * x + 5.451 = 115.859 - 1.233x\n\nTo find the salary (x), we can set D(9) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 115.859 - 1.233x\n1.233x = 115.859\nx = 115.859 / 1.233\nx ≈ 93.97\n\nSo, the salary of a new employee with 9 years of experience is approximately $93,970."
