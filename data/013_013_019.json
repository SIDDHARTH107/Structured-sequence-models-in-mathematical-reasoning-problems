    "message_1": "Consider an auction in which there are two bidders. Bidder 1 values the item at $100 and Bidder 2 values the item at $80. The auction follows a second-price sealed-bid system (also called a Vickrey auction), meaning that the highest bidder wins the item, but only pays the second-highest bid. \n\nIf Bidder 1 bids $60 and Bidder 2 bids $75, who wins the auction and what is the final price paid for the item?",
    "message_2": "In this auction, Bidder 2 has the highest bid at $75, so Bidder 2 wins the auction. However, since it's a second-price sealed-bid system, Bidder 2 only pays the second-highest bid, which is $60. So, the final price paid for the item is $60."
