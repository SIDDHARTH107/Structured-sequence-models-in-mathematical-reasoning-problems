    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n$120, $125, $130, $130, $135, $135, $140, $150, $200, $500\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3):\n\nQ1: The median of the lower half (between $120 and $135) is $130.\nQ2: The median of the entire data set (between $135 and $140) is $137.5.\nQ3: The median of the upper half (between $140 and $500) is $150.\n\nNow, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = $150 - $130 = $20\n\nTo determine if there are any outliers, we calculate the lower and upper bounds:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = $130 - 1.5 * $20 = $100\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = $150 + 1.5 * $20 = $180\n\nNow, we check if any data points fall outside these bounds:\n\n$120, $125, $130, $130, $135, $135, $140, $150, $200, $500\n\nThe daily sales of $200 and $500 are both greater than the upper bound of $180, so they are considered outliers in this data set."
