    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C48, A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}. We will analyze each case separately.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. Moreover, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3, which has order 48. Since P_2 is a group of order 16, it can be isomorphic to either C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. The only possibility that gives a group of order 48 when taking the direct product with P_3 is C16, so G is isomorphic to C48 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since n_3 = 4, the action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation is a homomorphism from G to S_4. The kernel of this homomorphism, K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P_2. Since |K| divides |P_2| = 16, we have |K| ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. \n\nIf |K| = 16, then K = P_2, which contradicts the fact that P_2 is not normal in G. If |K| = 8, then G/K is a group of order 6, which is isomorphic to either C6 or S_3. If G/K is isomorphic to C6, then G is abelian, which implies that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4. If G/K is isomorphic to S_3, then G is one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either C48, A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, depending on the structure of its Sylow subgroups and the action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation."
