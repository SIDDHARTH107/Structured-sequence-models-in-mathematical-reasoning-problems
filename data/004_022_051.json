    "message_1": "A 500 meter long fence is to be erected around a rectangular field that is bounded by a straight river. The river is to form one of the long sides of the rectangle. The available material for the fence is sufficient to make only 3 sides of the rectangle. What is the maximum area that can be enclosed with this fencing?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle parallel to the river be x meters and the width perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since the fence is only needed for 3 sides of the rectangle, we have:\n\nx + 2y = 500\n\nWe need to find the maximum area A that can be enclosed, which is given by:\n\nA = x * y\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of x from the fencing equation:\n\ny = (500 - x) / 2\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA = x * ((500 - x) / 2)\n\nA = (500x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = (500 - 2x) / 2 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 500\nx = 250\n\nNow substitute this value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (500 - 250) / 2\ny = 250 / 2\ny = 125\n\nSo the dimensions of the rectangle that give the maximum area are x = 250 meters and y = 125 meters. The maximum area that can be enclosed with this fencing is:\n\nA = x * y\nA = 250 * 125\nA = 31,250 square meters"
