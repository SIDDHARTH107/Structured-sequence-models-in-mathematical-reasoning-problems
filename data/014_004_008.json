    "message_2": "To find the point Q = 4P, we can first find 2P and then find 2(2P) = 4P.\n\nLet's find 2P first. We'll use the point doubling formula for elliptic curves:\n\nλ = (3x^2 + a) / 2y (mod p)\nx_3 = λ^2 - 2x (mod p)\ny_3 = λ(x - x_3) - y (mod p)\n\nHere, a = 11, p = 31, and P = (2, 3).\n\nλ = (3(2)^2 + 11) / 2(3) (mod 31)\nλ = (12 + 11) / 6 (mod 31)\nλ = 23 / 6 (mod 31)\nλ = 23 * 6^(-1) (mod 31)\nλ = 23 * 26 (mod 31) (since the inverse of 6 in F_31 is 26)\nλ = 598 (mod 31)\nλ = 16 (mod 31)\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of 2P:\n\nx_3 = λ^2 - 2x (mod p)\nx_3 = 16^2 - 2(2) (mod 31)\nx_3 = 256 - 4 (mod 31)\nx_3 = 252 (mod 31)\nx_3 = 2 (mod 31)\n\ny_3 = λ(x - x_3) - y (mod p)\ny_3 = 16(2 - 2) - 3 (mod 31)\ny_3 = -3 (mod 31)\ny_3 = 28 (mod 31)\n\nSo, 2P = (2, 28).\n\nNow, let's find 4P = 2(2P). We'll use the point addition formula for elliptic curves:\n\nλ = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) (mod p)\nx_3 = λ^2 - x_1 - x_2 (mod p)\ny_3 = λ(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 (mod p)\n\nHere, P = (2, 3) and 2P = (2, 28).\n\nλ = (28 - 3) / (2 - 2) (mod 31)\nSince the denominator is 0, we cannot compute the point addition. This means that 4P is the point at infinity, which is the identity element in the elliptic curve group.\n\nSo, Q = 4P = ∞ (the point at infinity)."
