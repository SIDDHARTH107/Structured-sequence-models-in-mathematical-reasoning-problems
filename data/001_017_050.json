    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 3) + log(x - 1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the product rule for logarithms, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b), we can combine the two logarithms:\n\nlog((x + 3)(x - 1)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form. Since the logarithm is base 10 by default, we have:\n\n10^2 = (x + 3)(x - 1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n100 = x^2 + 3x - x - 3\n\n100 = x^2 + 2x - 3\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. To solve for x, we can set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 103 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -103. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(-103))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-2 ± √(4 + 412)) / 2\n\nx = (-2 ± √416) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-2 + √416) / 2 ≈ 9.372\n\nx = (-2 - √416) / 2 ≈ -11.372\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If we plug in x ≈ 9.372, we get:\n\nlog(9.372 + 3) + log(9.372 - 1) ≈ 2\n\nlog(12.372) + log(8.372) ≈ 2\n\n1.092 + 0.923 ≈ 2\n\n2.015 ≈ 2\n\nThis solution is approximately correct and can be considered valid.\n\nIf we plug in x ≈ -11.372, we get:\n\nlog(-11.372 + 3) + log(-11.372 - 1)\n\nlog(-8.372) + log(-12.372)\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, this solution is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for x is:\n\nx ≈ 9.372"
