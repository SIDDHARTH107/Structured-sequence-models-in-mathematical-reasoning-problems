    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning the game, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 5 or 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a 5 or 6) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nThe probability of winning the game is:\n\nP(winning) = (number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (33.33%)."
