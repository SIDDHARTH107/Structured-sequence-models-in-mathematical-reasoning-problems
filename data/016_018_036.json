    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$D = \\frac{\\log N}{\\log (1/R)}$\n\nwhere $D$ is the Hausdorff dimension, $N$ is the number of self-similar pieces, and $R$ is the scaling factor (ratio of removed segments).\n\nIn this case, the Cantor set is formed by removing the middle third of each segment at each iteration. So, the number of self-similar pieces, $N$, is 2 (left and right segments), and the scaling factor, $R$, is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$D = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log (1/(\\frac{1}{3}))} = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 3}$\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set with the given parameters is $\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 3}$."
