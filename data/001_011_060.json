    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (3/x^2) = 1/2, we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x^2. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(2x/x^2) + (3/x^2) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n(2x + 3)/x^2 = 1/2\n\nTo get rid of the fractions, we can cross-multiply:\n\n2(2x + 3) = x^2(1)\n\n4x + 6 = x^2\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-6))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 24)) / 2\n\nx = (4 ± √40) / 2\n\nx = 2 ± √10\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = 2 + √10 and x = 2 - √10"
