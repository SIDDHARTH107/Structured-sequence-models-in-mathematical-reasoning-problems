    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1 meter and cross-section area 2 cm² is heated with a temperature of 200 °C at one end and cooled with a temperature of 20 °C at the other end. Determine the temperature distribution along the rod after 30 minutes, given that the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature distribution along the rod after 30 minutes, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, also known as the heat equation:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\nT(0, t) = 200 °C\nT(1, t) = 20 °C\n\nWe can solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. Let T(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDivide both sides by αXT:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. dT(t)/dt = -αλ²T(t)\n2. d²X(x)/dx² = -λ²X(x)\n\nSolving equation 2 with the boundary conditions X(0) = 200 and X(1) = 20, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A cos(λx) + B sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A cos(0) + B sin(0) = 200\nX(1) = A cos(λ) + B sin(λ) = 20\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we get A = 200.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the general solution as:\n\nX(x) = 200 cos(λx) + B sin(λx)\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n\n20 = 200 cos(λ) + B sin(λ)\n\nWe can solve for B:\n\nB sin(λ) = 20 - 200 cos(λ)\nB = (20 - 200 cos(λ))/sin(λ)\n\nNow we have the general solution for X(x):\n\nX(x) = 200 cos(λx) + ((20 - 200 cos(λ))/sin(λ)) sin(λx)\n\nSolving equation 1, we get the general solution for T(t):\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the temperature distribution:\n\nT(x, t) = (200 cos(λx) + ((20 - 200 cos(λ))/sin(λ)) sin(λx))Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nTo find the specific solution, we need to determine the values of λ, C, and B that satisfy the initial and boundary conditions. However, this requires more advanced mathematical techniques, such as Fourier series or eigenfunction expansions.\n\nIn summary, the temperature distribution along the rod after 30 minutes can be represented by the general solution:\n\nT(x, t) = (200 cos(λx) + ((20 - 200 cos(λ))/sin(λ)) sin(λx))Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nwith α = 0.1 cm²/s and t = 30 minutes = 1800 seconds. The specific values of λ, C, and B depend on the initial conditions and can be found using more advanced mathematical techniques."
