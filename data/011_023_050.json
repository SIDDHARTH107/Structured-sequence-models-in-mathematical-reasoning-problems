    "message_1": "In a social network, there are 10 users who want to join discussion groups. There are 4 discussion groups available, but users who have had a conflict in the past cannot join the same group. How many ways are there to distribute the users among the discussion groups, if there cannot be any conflicts in the groups?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the conflicts between the users. The number of ways to distribute the users among the discussion groups depends on the relationships between the users and the specific conflicts that have occurred in the past. \n\nFor example, if there are no conflicts between any of the users, then each user can join any of the 4 discussion groups. In this case, there would be 4^10 = 1,048,576 ways to distribute the users among the discussion groups.\n\nHowever, if there are conflicts between some of the users, the number of ways to distribute the users will be less than 1,048,576. The exact number will depend on the specific conflicts and how they restrict the possible distributions of users among the groups.\n\nPlease provide more information about the conflicts between the users, and I will be able to give you a more specific answer."
