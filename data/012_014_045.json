    "message_2": "The graphs G and H are isomorphic. This means that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the edge structure is preserved.\n\nHere is an isomorphism between G and H:\n\nLet the vertices of G be labeled as G1, G2, G3, and G4, and the vertices of H be labeled as H1, H2, H3, and H4.\n\n```\n  G                 H\n  /\\                /\\\n  ||                ||\n  \\/                \\/\n G1 -- G2          H1 -- H2\n  |    |            |    |\n  |    |            |    |\n G3 -- G4          H3 -- H4\n```\n\nThe isomorphism can be defined as follows:\n\n- G1 ↔ H1\n- G2 ↔ H2\n- G3 ↔ H3\n- G4 ↔ H4\n\nThis mapping preserves the edge structure of both graphs, as each vertex in G is connected to the corresponding vertex in H with the same edge connections. Therefore, the graphs G and H are isomorphic."
