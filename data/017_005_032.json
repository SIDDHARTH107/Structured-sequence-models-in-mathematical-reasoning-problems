    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 1 (the index of the subgroup), and must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, there must be exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup, say P, in G. Since P is the unique 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of P. Since |P| = 5^3, P is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of p-groups, P has a non-trivial center, say Z(P). The order of Z(P) must be a power of 5, so |Z(P)| = 5 or |Z(P)| = 25.\n\nCase 1: |Z(P)| = 25\nIn this case, Z(P) is a normal subgroup of P of index 5. By the Correspondence Theorem, there are no subgroups of P with order strictly between 5 and 25. Thus, P must be a cyclic group of order 125, and G is a cyclic group.\n\nCase 2: |Z(P)| = 5\nIn this case, Z(P) is a cyclic group of order 5, say Z(P) = ⟨z⟩. Since Z(P) is normal in P, we can form the quotient group P/Z(P), which has order 25. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, P/Z(P) is isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 25 or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. \n\nIf P/Z(P) is a cyclic group of order 25, then by the Correspondence Theorem, P has a subgroup H of order 25 containing Z(P). Since H is of index 5 in P, H is normal in P. Now, G = P, and P is the internal direct product of H and Z(P), so G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIf P/Z(P) is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, then P is isomorphic to the direct product of Z(P) and a subgroup of order 25. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
