    "message_1": "Let A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to their Cartesian product. Finally, show that the symmetric difference is not commutative by comparing the result with the symmetric difference of B and A with respect to their Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to their Cartesian product. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ (A × B) = {1, 2, 3} Δ {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nSince the elements of A and the elements of A × B are not comparable (they are not of the same type), their intersection is empty, and the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\nA Δ (A × B) = {1, 2, 3, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A with respect to their Cartesian product:\n\nB Δ (A × B) = {2, 3, 4} Δ {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nSimilarly, since the elements of B and the elements of A × B are not comparable, their intersection is empty, and the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\nB Δ (A × B) = {2, 3, 4, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nComparing the symmetric differences, we can see that they are not equal:\n\nA Δ (A × B) ≠ B Δ (A × B)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference is not commutative in this case. However, it's important to note that the symmetric difference is generally commutative for sets with comparable elements (i.e., sets containing elements of the same type). In this problem, the sets A, B, and their Cartesian product A × B contain different types of elements, which leads to the non-commutative result."
