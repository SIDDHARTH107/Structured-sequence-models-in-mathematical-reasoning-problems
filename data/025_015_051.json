    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection of the given surfaces, we can use the method of substitution. We can solve one of the equations for one variable and substitute it into the other equation.\n\nLet's solve the second equation for z:\n$$ z = 3 - x - y $$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into the first equation:\n$$ x^2 + y^2 - (3 - x - y)^2 = 1 $$\n\nExpand the expression and simplify:\n$$ x^2 + y^2 - (9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2) = 1 $$\n\nCombine like terms:\n$$ -x^2 - y^2 + 6x + 6y - 2xy - 8 = 0 $$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation in the standard form of a plane equation, which is Ax + By + Cz + D = 0. To do this, we can add x^2 and y^2 to both sides and rearrange the terms:\n\n$$ 2xy - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8 $$\n\nNow, substitute back the expression for z:\n$$ 2xy - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + (3 - x - y)^2 = 8 $$\n\nExpand and simplify:\n$$ 2xy - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + 9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 8 $$\n\nCombine like terms:\n$$ 2x^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 - 12x - 12y + 1 = 0 $$\n\nSo, the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection of the given surfaces is:\n\n$$ 2x^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 - 12x - 12y + 1 = 0 $$"
