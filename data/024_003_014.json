    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 3), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet S(x, y) = (x, y, 2x^2 + y^2). Then, the partial derivatives of S with respect to x and y are:\n\nS_x = (1, 0, 4x)\nS_y = (0, 1, 2y)\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nS_xx = (0, 0, 4)\nS_xy = (0, 0, 0)\nS_yy = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we find the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, and G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, and N):\n\nE = <S_x, S_x> = 1 + 16x^2\nF = <S_x, S_y> = 8xy\nG = <S_y, S_y> = 1 + 4y^2\n\nL = <S_xx, N> = 4\nM = <S_xy, N> = 0\nN = <S_yy, N> = 2\n\nNow, we evaluate these coefficients at the point (1, 1, 3):\n\nE(1,1) = 17\nF(1,1) = 8\nG(1,1) = 5\n\nL(1,1) = 4\nM(1,1) = 0\nN(1,1) = 2\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (4 * 2 - 0^2) / (17 * 5 - 8^2)\nK = 8 / (85 - 64)\nK = 8 / 21\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1, 1, 3) is K = 8/21."
