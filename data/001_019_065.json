    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x + 3| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x + 3 is positive or zero, so the equation becomes:\n5x + 3 = 12\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n5x = 9\n\nDivide by 5:\nx = 9/5\n\nCase 2: 5x + 3 is negative, so the equation becomes:\n-(5x + 3) = 12\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-5x - 3 = 12\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n-5x = 15\n\nDivide by -5:\nx = -3\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 9/5 and x = -3."
