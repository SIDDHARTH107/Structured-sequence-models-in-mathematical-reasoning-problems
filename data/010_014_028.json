    "message_2": "To find the smallest possible value of n such that H^(n)(X; Z) is infinite, we can consider the cohomology groups of some well-known compact topological spaces.\n\nOne such space is the n-dimensional torus, T^n, which is the product of n circles. The cohomology groups of the n-dimensional torus are well-known and can be computed using the Künneth formula. In particular, we have:\n\nH^k(T^n; Z) = Z^(C(n, k))\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, i.e., the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. \n\nNow, let's consider the 3-dimensional torus T^3, which is the product of three circles. The cohomology groups of T^3 are:\n\nH^0(T^3; Z) = Z\nH^1(T^3; Z) = Z^3\nH^2(T^3; Z) = Z^3\nH^3(T^3; Z) = Z\n\nSince H^1(T^3; Z), H^2(T^3; Z), and H^3(T^3; Z) are all non-zero, this example satisfies the given condition. Moreover, all these cohomology groups are finite.\n\nNow, let's consider the 4-dimensional torus T^4, which is the product of four circles. The cohomology groups of T^4 are:\n\nH^0(T^4; Z) = Z\nH^1(T^4; Z) = Z^4\nH^2(T^4; Z) = Z^6\nH^3(T^4; Z) = Z^4\nH^4(T^4; Z) = Z\n\nAgain, H^1(T^4; Z), H^2(T^4; Z), and H^3(T^4; Z) are all non-zero, satisfying the given condition. However, in this case, H^4(T^4; Z) is also non-zero and finite.\n\nTo find an example with an infinite cohomology group, let's consider the infinite-dimensional torus T^∞, which is the countable product of circles. The cohomology groups of T^∞ are:\n\nH^k(T^∞; Z) = Z^(C(∞, k))\n\nIn this case, H^k(T^∞; Z) is infinite for all k ≥ 1. Therefore, the smallest possible value of n such that H^(n)(X; Z) is infinite is n = 1, which occurs for the infinite-dimensional torus T^∞."
