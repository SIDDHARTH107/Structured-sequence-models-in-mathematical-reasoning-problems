    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = [AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx]\n\nwhere A = [Ax, Ay, Az] and B = [Bx, By, Bz].\n\nGiven A = [3, 4, 1] and B = [2, -1, 5], we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nA x B = [(4)(5) - (1)(-1), (1)(2) - (3)(5), (3)(-1) - (4)(2)]\n\nA x B = [20 + 1, 2 - 15, -3 - 8]\n\nA x B = [21, -13, -11]\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and vector B is [21, -13, -11]."
