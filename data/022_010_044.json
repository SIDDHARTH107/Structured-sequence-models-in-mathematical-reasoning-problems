    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z(1+z)}$, we can first rewrite the function as a sum of two simpler functions:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z(1+z)} = \\frac{A}{z} + \\frac{B}{1+z}$$\n\nTo find the constants $A$ and $B$, we can clear the denominators:\n\n$$1 = A(1+z) + Bz$$\n\nSetting $z = 0$, we get $A = 1$. Setting $z = -1$, we get $B = -1$. So we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\frac{1}{1+z}$$\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term. The first term is already in the desired form:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nFor the second term, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1+z} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n$$\n\nSo the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n = \\frac{1}{z} - 1 + z - z^2 + z^3 - \\cdots$$\n\nThe radius of convergence of the series is determined by the second term, which is a geometric series. The geometric series converges when $|z| < 1$, so the radius of convergence is $R = 1$."
