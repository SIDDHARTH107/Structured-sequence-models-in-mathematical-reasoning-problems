    "message_2": "To find the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of a group G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, n_2 must divide 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibility is n_2 = 1, which means there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, and it is normal in G.\n\n2. Sylow 5-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, n_5 must divide 4 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possibilities are n_5 = 1 or 4. If n_5 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, and it is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\nCase 1: Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup are normal in G.\nLet P_2 be the Sylow 2-subgroup and P_5 be the Sylow 5-subgroup. Since both are normal and their intersection is trivial (only the identity element), G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_5. P_2 has two possible isomorphism classes: Z_4 (cyclic) and V_4 (Klein-4 group). P_5 is cyclic since 5 is prime, so P_5 ≅ Z_5. Therefore, we have two possibilities in this case: G ≅ Z_4 × Z_5 or G ≅ V_4 × Z_5.\n\nCase 2: The Sylow 5-subgroup is not normal in G (n_5 = 4).\nIn this case, we can use the semidirect product. Let P_2 act on P_5 by conjugation. Since P_5 is cyclic of prime order, it has only two possible actions: the trivial action and the nontrivial action. The trivial action results in the direct product, which we have already considered in Case 1. For the nontrivial action, we have G ≅ P_2 ⋊ P_5. Note that P_2 must be isomorphic to V_4 in this case, as Z_4 has only the trivial automorphism, and we need a nontrivial action. Thus, we have one possibility in this case: G ≅ V_4 ⋊ Z_5.\n\nIn total, we have three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 20: Z_4 × Z_5, V_4 × Z_5, and V_4 ⋊ Z_5. Every group of order 20 must have a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup, and by the Sylow theorems, they must fall into one of these cases. Therefore, every group of order 20 is isomorphic to one of these three groups."
