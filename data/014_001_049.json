    "message_1": "RSA is a public-key cryptography algorithm that uses two prime numbers to encrypt and decrypt messages. Suppose Alice chose 53 and 61 as her prime numbers to generate her public key (e=17) and private key (d=413). What is the encrypted message for the plaintext M = 17?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using RSA, we need to calculate the modulus n and the public key e. In this case, we are given the prime numbers p = 53 and q = 61, and the public key e = 17.\n\nFirst, we calculate the modulus n:\nn = p * q = 53 * 61 = 3233\n\nNow, we can encrypt the plaintext message M = 17 using the public key (e, n):\nCiphertext C = M^e mod n = 17^17 mod 3233\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the exponentiation by squaring method:\n\n1. 17^1 mod 3233 = 17\n2. 17^2 mod 3233 = 289\n3. 17^4 mod 3233 = 289^2 mod 3233 = 835\n4. 17^8 mod 3233 = 835^2 mod 3233 = 2790\n5. 17^16 mod 3233 = 2790^2 mod 3233 = 65\n\nNow, we can combine the results to get the final encrypted message:\n\nC = 17^17 mod 3233 = (17^16 * 17^1) mod 3233 = (65 * 17) mod 3233 = 1105\n\nSo, the encrypted message for the plaintext M = 17 is C = 1105."
