    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 2i to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:\n\n1) 3x + 2iy = 1 + 3i\n2) 4ix - 2iy = 4i + 8i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1, the second equation becomes:\n\n2) 4ix - 2iy = 4i - 8\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(3x + 2iy) + (4ix - 2iy) = (1 + 3i) + (4i - 8)\n3x + 4ix = -7 + 7i\n\nNow, let's factor x out:\n\nx(3 + 4i) = -7 + 7i\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by (3 + 4i):\n\nx = (-7 + 7i) / (3 + 4i)\n\nTo get rid of the complex denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (3 - 4i):\n\nx = (-7 + 7i)(3 - 4i) / (3 + 4i)(3 - 4i)\n\nx = (-21 + 28i + 21i - 28i^2) / (9 - 16i^2)\n\nx = (-21 + 49i + 28) / 25\n\nx = (7 + 49i) / 25\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use the second equation:\n\n2x - y = 2 + 4i\n2((7 + 49i) / 25) - y = 2 + 4i\n\nMultiply both sides by 25 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2(7 + 49i) - 25y = 50 + 100i\n\n14 + 98i - 25y = 50 + 100i\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\n-25y = 36 + 2i\n\ny = (-36 - 2i) / 25\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = (7 + 49i) / 25\ny = (-36 - 2i) / 25"
