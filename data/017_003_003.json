    "message_2": "To find a cyclic group of order 7, we can consider the group of integers modulo 7 under addition, denoted as Z_7. This group consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and the group operation is addition modulo 7.\n\nTo show that Z_7 is a cyclic group, we need to find a generator, i.e., an element that can generate the entire group through its powers. Let's consider the element 1. The powers of 1 modulo 7 are:\n\n1^1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n1^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n1^4 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n1^5 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n1^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n1^7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSince all the elements of Z_7 can be generated by the powers of 1, Z_7 is a cyclic group of order 7.\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of prime order is cyclic. Let G be a group of prime order p. We want to show that G is cyclic. Since G has p elements and p is prime, the order of any element a in G (except the identity element) must be a divisor of p. The only divisors of p are 1 and p itself. The order of an element cannot be 1, as this would mean that the element is the identity element. Therefore, the order of any non-identity element a in G must be p.\n\nLet's take an arbitrary non-identity element a in G. Since the order of a is p, the subgroup generated by a, denoted as <a>, must have p elements. By the definition of a subgroup, <a> is a subset of G. Since both G and <a> have the same number of elements (p), they must be equal. Therefore, G = <a>, which means that G is a cyclic group generated by the element a.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found a cyclic group of order 7 (Z_7) and proved that every group of prime order is cyclic."
