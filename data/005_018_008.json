    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected heart transplant patient will survive for more than 10 years, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (or a calculator) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (10 years), μ is the mean (8 years), and σ is the standard deviation (1 year).\n\nz = (10 - 8) / 1 = 2\n\nNow we need to find the probability that a value from the standard normal distribution is greater than 2. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area to the right of z = 2.\n\nUsing a table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = 2 is approximately 0.9772. Since the total area under the curve is 1, the area to the right of z = 2 is:\n\n1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected heart transplant patient will survive for more than 10 years is approximately 0.0228 or 2.28%."
