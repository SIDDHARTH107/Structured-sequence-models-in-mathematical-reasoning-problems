    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 2 over the interval [0, 4], we need to first find the critical points of the function and then evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.\n\n1. Find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 4x + 2) = 6x - 4\n\n2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find the critical points:\n\n6x - 4 = 0\n6x = 4\nx = 2/3\n\nSo, there is one critical point at x = 2/3.\n\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^2 - 4(0) + 2 = 2\nf(2/3) = 3(2/3)^2 - 4(2/3) + 2 = 3(4/9) - 8/3 + 2 = 4/3 - 8/3 + 6/3 = 2/3\nf(4) = 3(4)^2 - 4(4) + 2 = 3(16) - 16 + 2 = 48 - 14 = 34\n\n4. Compare the values of the function at the critical point and the endpoints:\n\nThe minimum value of the function is f(2/3) = 2/3, which occurs at x = 2/3.\nThe maximum value of the function is f(4) = 34, which occurs at x = 4."
