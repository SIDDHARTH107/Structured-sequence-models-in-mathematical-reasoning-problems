    "message_1": "A company wants to construct a rectangular storage container with a volume of 500 cubic meters. The cost of materials for the bottom of the container is twice the cost of the materials for the sides, and the cost of the materials for the top is equal to the cost of the materials for the bottom. If the cost of materials for the sides is $5 per square meter, what are the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of construction?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the container be length (L), width (W), and height (H). The volume of the container is given by:\n\nV = LWH = 500 cubic meters\n\nThe cost of materials for the sides is $5 per square meter. Since there are 4 sides, the total cost for the sides is:\n\nC_sides = 5(2LH + 2WH)\n\nThe cost of materials for the bottom is twice the cost of the materials for the sides, so:\n\nC_bottom = 2(5LW) = 10LW\n\nThe cost of materials for the top is equal to the cost of the materials for the bottom, so:\n\nC_top = 10LW\n\nThe total cost of the container is the sum of the costs of the sides, bottom, and top:\n\nC_total = C_sides + C_bottom + C_top = 5(2LH + 2WH) + 10LW + 10LW = 10LH + 10WH + 20LW\n\nWe want to minimize the total cost, so we need to find the dimensions that minimize this expression. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a Lagrange multiplier λ and form the function:\n\nF(L, W, H, λ) = 10LH + 10WH + 20LW + λ(500 - LWH)\n\nNow we find the partial derivatives with respect to L, W, H, and λ:\n\n∂F/∂L = 10H + 10W - WHλ = 0\n∂F/∂W = 10H + 20L - LHλ = 0\n∂F/∂H = 10L + 10W - LWλ = 0\n∂F/∂λ = 500 - LWH = 0\n\nFrom the first three equations, we can see that:\n\n10H + 10W = WHλ\n10H + 20L = LHλ\n10L + 10W = LWλ\n\nDivide the first equation by 10:\n\nH + W = (WHλ)/10\n\nDivide the second equation by 10:\n\nH + 2L = (LHλ)/10\n\nDivide the third equation by 10:\n\nL + W = (LWλ)/10\n\nNow we have a system of three equations:\n\nH + W = (WHλ)/10\nH + 2L = (LHλ)/10\nL + W = (LWλ)/10\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the dimensions L, W, and H that minimize the cost. \n\nFrom the first and third equations, we can see that H = L. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nL + 2L = (L^2λ)/10\n3L = (L^2λ)/10\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by L:\n\n3 = (Lλ)/10\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 30/L\n\nNow, substitute λ back into the first equation:\n\nL + L = (L^2 * 30/L)/10\n2L = 3L^2/10\n\nSolving for L, we get:\n\nL = 20/3 meters\n\nSince H = L, we also have:\n\nH = 20/3 meters\n\nNow, we can use the volume equation to find W:\n\n500 = (20/3)(20/3)W\n500 = 400/9 * W\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = 500 * 9/400\nW = 45/4 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of construction are:\n\nLength (L) = 20/3 meters\nWidth (W) = 45/4 meters\nHeight (H) = 20/3 meters"
