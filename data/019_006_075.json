    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but deontic logic doesn't typically involve numerical problems. It is a system of logic used to reason about moral principles and obligations. However, I can provide a question related to deontic logic that a student can contemplate:\n\nSuppose that it is morally permissible to lie to protect someone from harm. Does this mean that lying is morally right in all cases where it is done for the purpose of protecting someone from harm?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I will attempt to provide a logical analysis of the question:\n\nThe question asks if lying is morally right in all cases where it is done for the purpose of protecting someone from harm, given that it is morally permissible to lie to protect someone from harm.\n\nLet's use the following symbols to represent the statements:\n\nP: Lying is morally permissible to protect someone from harm.\nR: Lying is morally right in all cases where it is done for the purpose of protecting someone from harm.\n\nThe given information can be represented as:\n\nP: Lying is morally permissible to protect someone from harm.\n\nThe question asks if the following statement is true:\n\nR: Lying is morally right in all cases where it is done for the purpose of protecting someone from harm.\n\nFrom the given information (P), we know that there are situations where lying is morally permissible to protect someone from harm. However, this does not necessarily imply that lying is morally right in all cases where it is done for the purpose of protecting someone from harm (R).\n\nTo determine if R is true, we would need more information about the specific conditions and moral principles that govern when lying is morally right or wrong. Without this information, we cannot conclude that R is true based solely on the given information (P).\n\nIn summary, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that lying is morally right in all cases where it is done for the purpose of protecting someone from harm."
