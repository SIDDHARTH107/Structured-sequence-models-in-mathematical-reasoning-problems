    "message_2": "In the given topological space X = {a, b, c} and τ = {∅, X, {a}, {a, b}}, let's find the interior and closure of the set {a}.\n\nInterior:\nThe interior of a set A is the union of all open sets contained in A. In this case, A = {a}. Since {a} is an open set (it belongs to τ), the interior of {a} is {a} itself.\n\nInterior({a}) = {a}\n\nClosure:\nThe closure of a set A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. A set is closed if its complement (with respect to the topological space X) is open. Let's find the closed sets in this topological space.\n\nThe complements of open sets in τ are:\n- X \\ ∅ = X, which is closed (complement of the empty set)\n- X \\ X = ∅, which is closed (complement of the entire space)\n- X \\ {a} = {b, c}, which is closed (complement of {a})\n- X \\ {a, b} = {c}, which is not closed (complement of {a, b} is not in τ)\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of all closed sets containing {a}. The closed sets are {∅, X, {b, c}}. The sets containing {a} are {X, {b, c}}. The intersection of these sets is {a}.\n\nClosure({a}) = {a}\n\nSo, the interior of the set {a} is {a}, and the closure of the set {a} is {a}."
