Determine the possible group structures based on the prime factorization.\n\nThere are three possible group structures for a group of order 12:\n\na) C_12: A cyclic group of order 12.\nb) C_2 x C_6: A direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 6.\nc) C_3 x C_4: A direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 4.\nd) A_4: The alternating group on 4 elements, which is a non-abelian group of order 12.\n\n3. Determine if any of these group structures are isomorphic.\n\na) C_12 is not isomorphic to any other group structure because it is the only cyclic group of order 12.\nb) C_2 x C_6 is isomorphic to C_12 because their orders are the same and they are both abelian.\nc) C_3 x C_4 is not isomorphic to any other group structure because it is the only group structure with a direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 4.\nd) A_4 is not isomorphic to any other group structure because it is the only non-abelian group of order 12.\n\nSo, there are 3 distinct groups of order 12 up to isomorphism: C_12, C_3 x C_4, and A_4."
