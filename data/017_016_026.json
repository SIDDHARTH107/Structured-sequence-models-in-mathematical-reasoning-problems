    "message_2": "To show that H is normal in G, we will use the fact that the index of H in G is the smallest prime dividing the order of G. Since G has order 27 = 3^3, the smallest prime dividing the order of G is 3. Thus, the index of H in G is 3.\n\nNow, let g be an element in G. Then, the left coset gH is a subset of G with |gH| = |H| = 3. Since the index of H in G is 3, there are only three distinct left cosets of H in G. Similarly, there are only three distinct right cosets of H in G. If we can show that the left and right cosets coincide, then H is normal in G.\n\nConsider the set of left cosets {gH, g^2H, g^3H}. Since the index of H in G is 3, we know that g^3H = H. Now, let's look at the right cosets {Hg, Hg^2, Hg^3}. Since g^3 is in H, we have Hg^3 = H. Thus, the set of right cosets is also {Hg, Hg^2, Hg^3}.\n\nSince the left and right cosets coincide, H is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible structures of G. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, if G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G would be isomorphic to C27, the cyclic group of order 27.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, we will show that G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27. Since H is normal in G, we can consider the factor group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 27/3 = 9. Since 9 = 3^2, G/H is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3.\n\nIf G/H is isomorphic to C9, then G is an extension of H by C9. In this case, G would be abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\nIf G/H is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G is an extension of H by C3 × C3. Since H is normal in G, there exists a subgroup K of G such that G = HK and H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. The order of K is |G|/|H| = 9, so K is isomorphic to C3 × C3.\n\nNow, consider the action of K on H by conjugation. Since H is normal in G, this action is well-defined. The action of K on H induces a homomorphism φ: K → Aut(H), where Aut(H) is the group of automorphisms of H. Since H is isomorphic to C3, Aut(H) is isomorphic to C2.\n\nThe kernel of φ is the set of elements in K that act trivially on H. Since the action of K on H is non-trivial, the kernel of φ is a proper subgroup of K. The only proper subgroups of K are those of order 3, so the kernel of φ has order 3.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem, K/ker(φ) is isomorphic to the image of φ, which is a subgroup of Aut(H). Since |K| = 9 and |ker(φ)| = 3, the order of K/ker(φ) is 9/3 = 3. Thus, K/ker(φ) is isomorphic to C3.\n\nNow, we have G = HK, where H is normal in G, K is a subgroup of G, and K/ker(φ) is isomorphic to C3. This implies that G is a semidirect product of H and K, and since the action of K on H is non-trivial, G is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 27 with a normal subgroup H of order 3, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27."
