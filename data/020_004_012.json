    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has two factories that produce products A and B. Factory 1 can produce 10 units of A and 20 units of B per day, while factory 2 can produce 15 units of A and 10 units of B per day. The company needs to produce at least 200 units of A and 300 units of B per day. If each unit of A contributes $5 to profit and each unit of B contributes $3 to profit, how many units of A and B should be produced by each factory to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x1 be the number of days Factory 1 operates and x2 be the number of days Factory 2 operates.\n\nThe constraints for the production of A and B are as follows:\n\n10x1 + 15x2 >= 200 (A production constraint)\n20x1 + 10x2 >= 300 (B production constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP = 5(10x1 + 15x2) + 3(20x1 + 10x2)\n\nSimplifying the objective function:\n\nP = 50x1 + 75x2 + 60x1 + 30x2\nP = 110x1 + 105x2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x1 and x2 that satisfy the constraints and maximize the profit function.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint equations for x2:\n\nx2 >= (200 - 10x1) / 15 (A production constraint)\nx2 >= (300 - 20x1) / 10 (B production constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequalities to equalities and solving for x1 and x2:\n\nx1 = 0:\nx2 = 200/15 = 13.33 (A production constraint)\nx2 = 300/10 = 30 (B production constraint)\n\nx2 = 0:\nx1 = 200/10 = 20 (A production constraint)\nx1 = 300/20 = 15 (B production constraint)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 13.33) = 110(0) + 105(13.33) = 1399.65\nP(0, 30) = 110(0) + 105(30) = 3150\nP(20, 0) = 110(20) + 105(0) = 2200\nP(15, 0) = 110(15) + 105(0) = 1650\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 30), with a profit of $3150.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the total profit, Factory 1 should produce 0 units of A and 300 units of B (operating for 15 days), and Factory 2 should produce 200 units of A and 0 units of B (operating for 20 days)."
