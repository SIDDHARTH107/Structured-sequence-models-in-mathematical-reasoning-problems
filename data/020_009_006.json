    "message_1": "An oil refinery has two production units, A and B, with a total production capacity of 500 barrels of oil per day. The revenues from unit A and B are $10 and $15 per barrel, respectively. However, due to uncertain weather conditions, production rates are not constant and vary randomly. On an average day, unit A produces 200 barrels of oil with a standard deviation of 20 barrels, while unit B produces 300 barrels with a standard deviation of 30 barrels. What is the optimal daily production rate for each unit that maximizes the expected revenue for the refinery?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected revenue for the refinery, we need to find the optimal daily production rate for each unit. Since the production rates vary randomly, we can use the average production rates as the optimal daily production rates for each unit.\n\nFor unit A, the average daily production rate is 200 barrels. For unit B, the average daily production rate is 300 barrels. These production rates add up to the total production capacity of 500 barrels per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected revenue for each unit at these production rates:\n\nExpected revenue for unit A = (200 barrels) * ($10 per barrel) = $2000\nExpected revenue for unit B = (300 barrels) * ($15 per barrel) = $4500\n\nThe total expected revenue for the refinery is the sum of the expected revenues for units A and B:\n\nTotal expected revenue = $2000 + $4500 = $6500\n\nTherefore, the optimal daily production rate for unit A is 200 barrels, and for unit B is 300 barrels, which maximizes the expected revenue for the refinery at $6500 per day."
