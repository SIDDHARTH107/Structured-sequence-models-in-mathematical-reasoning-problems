    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that have a difference of 2. To find the smallest twin prime pair whose sum is greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers just above 50, since 50 + 50 = 100.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 50 is 53. However, 53 + 2 = 55, which is not a prime number. The next prime number is 59, and 59 + 2 = 61, which is also a prime number. Therefore, the smallest twin prime pair whose sum is greater than 100 is (59, 61), with a sum of 120."
