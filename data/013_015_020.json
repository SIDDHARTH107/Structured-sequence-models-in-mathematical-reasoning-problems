    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires an agent to perform a project that will generate $100,000 in revenue. The agent can either exert high effort, which will result in a successful project with probability 0.8, or low effort, which will result in a successful project with probability 0.3. If the project is successful, the agent receives a bonus of $20,000, but if the project fails, the agent will receive no bonus. The agent's effort cannot be observed by the company, but the company can create a contract that offers the agent a fixed salary and bonus based on the project's success or failure. If the agent values the fixed salary at $40,000, what bonus schedule should the company offer to incentivize the agent to exert high effort?",
    "message_2": "To incentivize the agent to exert high effort, the company needs to design a contract that makes the agent's expected payoff from high effort greater than the expected payoff from low effort. Let's denote the bonus for a successful project as B_s and the bonus for a failed project as B_f. The fixed salary is $40,000.\n\nExpected payoff from high effort (E_high) = 0.8 * (40,000 + B_s) + 0.2 * (40,000 + B_f)\nExpected payoff from low effort (E_low) = 0.3 * (40,000 + B_s) + 0.7 * (40,000 + B_f)\n\nTo incentivize high effort, we need E_high > E_low.\n\n0.8 * (40,000 + B_s) + 0.2 * (40,000 + B_f) > 0.3 * (40,000 + B_s) + 0.7 * (40,000 + B_f)\n\nNow, let's solve for the bonus schedule (B_s and B_f):\n\n0.8 * B_s + 0.2 * B_f > 0.3 * B_s + 0.7 * B_f\n\n0.5 * B_s > 0.5 * B_f\n\nB_s > B_f\n\nThis inequality tells us that the bonus for a successful project (B_s) should be greater than the bonus for a failed project (B_f) to incentivize the agent to exert high effort. The exact amounts of B_s and B_f will depend on the company's budget and willingness to pay for the agent's effort. However, as long as B_s > B_f, the agent will be incentivized to exert high effort."
