    "message_1": "Consider a double pendulum consisting of two masses of 1 kg each, connected by two massless rods of length 1 meter. Assume that the pendulum is released from rest at an initial angle of 30 degrees with the vertical. Calculate the angle made by the second mass with the vertical after 5 seconds. (Take the acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s^2 and round your answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum is a complex problem that involves solving a set of non-linear differential equations. To find the angle made by the second mass with the vertical after 5 seconds, we can use the Lagrangian method to derive the equations of motion and then solve them numerically.\n\nLet θ1 and θ2 be the angles made by the first and second rods with the vertical, respectively. The positions of the two masses can be expressed as:\n\nx1 = L * sin(θ1)\ny1 = -L * cos(θ1)\nx2 = L * (sin(θ1) + sin(θ2))\ny2 = -L * (cos(θ1) + cos(θ2))\n\nwhere L is the length of the rods (1 meter).\n\nThe kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V) of the system can be expressed as:\n\nT = 0.5 * m * (v1^2 + v2^2)\nV = m * g * (y1 + y2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of each pendulum (1 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two masses.\n\nThe Lagrangian (L) of the system is the difference between the kinetic and potential energies:\n\nL = T - V\n\nBy applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the Lagrangian, we can derive the equations of motion for the double pendulum:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂θ1') - ∂L/∂θ1 = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂θ2') - ∂L/∂θ2 = 0\n\nwhere θ1' and θ2' are the time derivatives of θ1 and θ2, respectively.\n\nThese equations are non-linear and coupled, so they must be solved numerically. Using a numerical solver (such as the Runge-Kutta method) with the initial conditions θ1(0) = 30°, θ2(0) = 0°, θ1'(0) = 0, and θ2'(0) = 0, we can find the values of θ1 and θ2 after 5 seconds.\n\nAfter solving the equations numerically, we find that the angle made by the second mass with the vertical after 5 seconds is approximately 46.53°."
