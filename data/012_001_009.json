    "message_1": "Consider the following weighted graph:\n\n- Node A is connected to nodes B and C (with weights 4 and 2, respectively).\n- Node B is connected to nodes C, D, and E (with weights 1, 2, and 3, respectively).\n- Node C is connected to node E (with weight 5).\n- Node D is connected to node E (with weight 2).\n\nWhat is the shortest path from node A to node E, and what is its length?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node E, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (A) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances to its neighbors (B and C) by adding the weight of the edge to the current distance. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (E) is visited.\n\nFollowing the algorithm:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E}, distance[A] = 0, distance[B] = infinity, distance[C] = infinity, distance[D] = infinity, distance[E] = infinity\n2. Select node A (smallest distance), mark as visited. Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E}\n3. Update distances: distance[B] = 4, distance[C] = 2\n4. Select node C (smallest distance), mark as visited. Unvisited nodes: {B, D, E}\n5. Update distances: distance[E] = 2 + 5 = 7 (C to E)\n6. Select node B (smallest distance), mark as visited. Unvisited nodes: {D, E}\n7. Update distances: distance[C] = min(4 + 1, 2) = 2 (not updated), distance[D] = 4 + 2 = 6, distance[E] = min(4 + 3, 7) = 7 (not updated)\n8. Select node D (smallest distance), mark as visited. Unvisited nodes: {E}\n9. Update distances: distance[E] = min(6 + 2, 7) = 7 (not updated)\n10. Select node E (smallest distance), mark as visited. All nodes visited or target node visited.\n\nThe shortest path from node A to node E is A -> C -> B -> E, and its length is 7."
