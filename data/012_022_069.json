    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,3) is the smallest integer n such that any complete graph of n vertices with edges colored either red or blue will contain either a red triangle or a blue triangle. The Ramsey number R(3,3) is 6.\n\nTo show that a complete graph with 6 vertices is needed to guarantee either a red triangle or blue triangle, we need to prove two things:\n\n1. A complete graph with 5 vertices can be colored without creating a red or blue triangle.\n2. In a complete graph with 6 vertices, there must be either a red triangle or a blue triangle.\n\nProof for 1:\nConsider a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5). Color the edges of the graph such that each vertex is connected to two vertices with red edges and two vertices with blue edges. This can be done by arranging the vertices in a circle and coloring the edges as follows: color the two edges adjacent to each vertex red and the two edges opposite each vertex blue. In this configuration, there are no red or blue triangles.\n\nProof for 2:\nNow consider a complete graph with 6 vertices (K6). Pick a vertex, say A. There are 5 edges connected to A, and by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of these edges must have the same color, say red. Let the vertices connected to A by red edges be B, C, and D.\n\nIf any of the edges between B, C, and D are red, then we have a red triangle (ABx, where x is one of B, C, or D). If all the edges between B, C, and D are blue, then we have a blue triangle (BCD). In either case, we have a monochromatic triangle.\n\nThus, the Ramsey number R(3,3) is 6, and a complete graph with 6 vertices is needed to guarantee either a red triangle or a blue triangle."
