The work shifts can start anytime between 8 AM to 6 PM and should be at least 4 hours long but not longer than 8 hours. Each employee can work for a maximum of 8 hours per day and the company needs at least 4 employees to be working at all times. Given the following table with the hourly productivity of each employee, what is the maximum productivity that can be achieved in a day?\n\n| Employee | Hourly Productivity |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| A        | 10      |\n| B        | 12      |\n| C        | 8       |\n| D        | 9       |\n| E        | 11      |\n\nNote: Assume the company is open for 10 hours between 8 AM to 6 PM.",
    "message_2": "To maximize productivity, we should schedule the employees with the highest hourly productivity to work the maximum number of hours (8 hours) and ensure that at least 4 employees are working at all times. \n\nFirst, let's sort the employees by their hourly productivity:\n\n1. Employee B: 12\n2. Employee E: 11\n3. Employee A: 10\n4. Employee D: 9\n5. Employee C: 8\n\nNow, let's schedule the employees:\n\n1. Employee B works from 8 AM to 4 PM (8 hours)\n2. Employee E works from 8 AM to 4 PM (8 hours)\n3. Employee A works from 8 AM to 4 PM (8 hours)\n4. Employee D works from 8 AM to 12 PM (4 hours) and Employee C works from 12 PM to 4 PM (4 hours)\n\nThis schedule ensures that at least 4 employees are working at all times and the employees with the highest hourly productivity work the maximum number of hours.\n\nNow let's calculate the total productivity:\n\nEmployee B: 12 * 8 = 96\nEmployee E: 11 * 8 = 88\nEmployee A: 10 * 8 = 80\nEmployee D: 9 * 4 = 36\nEmployee C: 8 * 4 = 32\n\nTotal productivity = 96 + 88 + 80 + 36 + 32 = 332\n\nThe maximum productivity that can be achieved in a day is 332."
