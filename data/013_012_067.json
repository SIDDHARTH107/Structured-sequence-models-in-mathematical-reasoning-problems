    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms, A and B, where the demand for the product they sell is given by the price equation: \n\n`P = 120 - Q`\n\nwhere P is the unit price and Q is the total quantity demanded in the market. Both firms have the same constant marginal cost of production equal to $20/unit.\n\nFirm A is the leader and decides how much output to produce first. Firm B knows the production level of firm A and chooses its own production level accordingly. This is known as the Stackelberg model. \n\nDetermine the optimal production levels for firms A and B in the Stackelberg equilibrium and the corresponding market price.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal production levels for firms A and B in the Stackelberg equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction function of firm B. The reaction function shows the optimal output for firm B given the output of firm A.\n\nLet qA be the output of firm A and qB be the output of firm B. The total quantity demanded in the market is Q = qA + qB. The price equation is P = 120 - Q, and the marginal cost for both firms is 20.\n\nFirm B's profit function is:\n\nπB = (P - MC) * qB = (120 - Q - 20) * qB = (100 - qA - qB) * qB\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm B will choose qB such that its marginal profit with respect to qB is zero:\n\ndπB/dqB = 100 - qA - 2qB = 0\n\nSolving for qB, we get firm B's reaction function:\n\nqB = (100 - qA) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find firm A's optimal output, knowing that firm B will react according to its reaction function. Firm A's profit function is:\n\nπA = (P - MC) * qA = (120 - Q - 20) * qA = (100 - qA - qB) * qA\n\nSubstitute firm B's reaction function into firm A's profit function:\n\nπA = (100 - qA - (100 - qA) / 2) * qA = (100 - qA - 50 + qA/2) * qA = (50 + qA/2) * qA\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm A will choose qA such that its marginal profit with respect to qA is zero:\n\ndπA/dqA = 50 - qA/2 = 0\n\nSolving for qA, we get:\n\nqA = 100\n\nNow, we can find the optimal output for firm B using its reaction function:\n\nqB = (100 - 100) / 2 = 0\n\nIn the Stackelberg equilibrium, firm A produces 100 units, and firm B produces 0 units. To find the corresponding market price, we can use the price equation:\n\nP = 120 - Q = 120 - (100 + 0) = 20\n\nThe market price in the Stackelberg equilibrium is $20."
