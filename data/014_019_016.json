    "message_1": "A transposition cipher uses a key of length 7 to encrypt a message. If the message has 168 characters, how many columns and rows are used in the encryption?",
    "message_2": "In a transposition cipher, the key length determines the number of columns, and the message length divided by the key length determines the number of rows.\n\nIn this case, the key length is 7, so there are 7 columns.\n\nTo find the number of rows, divide the message length (168 characters) by the key length (7 columns):\n\n168 characters / 7 columns = 24 rows\n\nSo, there are 7 columns and 24 rows used in the encryption."
