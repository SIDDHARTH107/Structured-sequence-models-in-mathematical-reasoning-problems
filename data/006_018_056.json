    "message_1": "In a company, the probability of a financial fraud occurring on any given year is 0.05. If the company has been operating for 10 years, what is the probability that at least one financial fraud would have occurred during that time period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in 10 years, we can first find the probability of no financial frauds occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no financial fraud occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no financial frauds to occur in 10 years, this probability must hold true for all 10 years. So, we have:\n\n0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in 10 years, we subtract the probability of no financial frauds from 1:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in the 10-year period is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
