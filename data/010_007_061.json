Let $p: \\widetilde{X}\\rightarrow X$ be a covering map, where $\\widetilde{X}$ is simply connected. Suppose that $p^{-1}(x_0)$ has 6 elements, where $x_0$ is the basepoint of $X$. Find the fundamental group of $X$.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of $X = S^1 \\vee S^1$, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a space $X$ can be written as the union of two open, path-connected subsets $U$ and $V$ such that $U \\cap V$ is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of $X$ can be computed as:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V)$$\n\nHere, $*$ denotes the free product of groups, and $_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)}$ indicates that we are taking the amalgamated free product with respect to the inclusion maps of $U \\cap V$ into $U$ and $V$.\n\nIn our case, we can choose $U$ and $V$ to be open neighborhoods of the two circles in the figure-eight shape, such that $U \\cap V$ is an open neighborhood of the basepoint $x_0$. Since each circle is homeomorphic to $S^1$, we have $\\pi_1(U) \\cong \\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, $U \\cap V$ is contractible, so $\\pi_1(U \\cap V) \\cong \\{1\\}$.\n\nApplying the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we get:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} *_{\\{1\\}} \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\nThe fundamental group of $X$ is the free group on two generators, which can be denoted as $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$ or $F_2$."
