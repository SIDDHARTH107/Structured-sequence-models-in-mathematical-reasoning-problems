    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain product by determining the optimal values of two design parameters x and y. The cost function C(x,y) is given by the equation:\nC(x,y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + 5y^2 + 6x - 6y\nUsing the whale optimization algorithm, find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost of production.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems, including continuous and discrete problems. However, it is not possible to apply the WOA directly in this text-based environment.\n\nInstead, I will provide you with a general outline of the steps involved in applying the WOA to this problem, and you can implement it in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, MATLAB, etc.):\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (search agents) with random positions in the search space (x, y).\n\n2. Define the maximum number of iterations (T) for the algorithm to run.\n\n3. For each iteration t (from 1 to T):\n   a. Calculate the fitness of each whale (search agent) using the cost function C(x, y).\n   b. Update the position of the best whale (the one with the lowest cost) as the current global best position.\n   c. Update the positions of all other whales using the WOA equations, which involve the encircling behavior, the spiral updating position, and the search for prey.\n   d. Apply any necessary boundary constraints to keep the whales within the search space.\n\n4. After the maximum number of iterations is reached, the global best position represents the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost function.\n\nTo implement the WOA, you can refer to the original research paper by Seyedali Mirjalili and Andrew Lewis, titled \"The Whale Optimization Algorithm,\" or find an existing implementation in a programming language of your choice."
