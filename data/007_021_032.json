    "message_2": "To use Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize x = x_0 = 2 and y = x_0 = 2.\n2. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x = f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod n)\n   b. Update y = f(f(y)) = (y^2 + 1)^2 + 1 (mod n)\n   c. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n.\n\nLet's start the iteration:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 187 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = ((2^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 187 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 187) = GCD(21, 187) = 1 (no non-trivial factor found)\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod 187 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = ((26^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 187 = 103\nGCD(|26 - 103|, 187) = GCD(77, 187) = 1 (no non-trivial factor found)\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod 187 = 103\ny = f(f(y)) = ((103^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 187 = 5\nGCD(|103 - 5|, 187) = GCD(98, 187) = 1 (no non-trivial factor found)\n\nIteration 4:\nx = f(x) = (103^2 + 1) mod 187 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = ((5^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 187 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 187) = GCD(21, 187) = 1 (no non-trivial factor found)\n\nAt this point, we can see that the sequence starts to repeat (x = 5, y = 26). This means that the algorithm is not converging to a non-trivial factor using the function f(x) = x^2 + 1 and x_0 = 2. However, we already know the factors of n (p = 17 and q = 11) from the problem statement.\n\nIn this case, Pollard's rho algorithm did not successfully factorize n using the given function and starting value. It's important to note that the algorithm's success depends on the choice of the function and starting value, and it may not always find the factors in a few iterations."
