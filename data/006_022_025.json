    "message_2": "To find the expected number of students who will fail the exam, you can multiply the total number of students by the probability of failing.\n\nExpected number of failures = (Total number of students) x (Probability of failing)\n\nExpected number of failures = 100 x 0.2\n\nExpected number of failures = 20\n\nSo, 20 students are expected to fail the exam."
