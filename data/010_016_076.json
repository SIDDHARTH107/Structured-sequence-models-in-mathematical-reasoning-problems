    "message_1": "A student is interested in studying the topology of a torus. Using intersection theory and Poincaré duality, the student wants to calculate the number of closed curves on the torus that pass through a given point exactly once. Let the torus's major radius be 4 units and minor radius be 2 units. How many such closed curves exist on the torus?",
    "message_2": "Intersection theory and Poincaré duality are powerful tools in algebraic topology, but they are not necessary to solve this problem. Instead, we can use a more elementary approach.\n\nConsider the torus as a square with opposite sides identified. The given point on the torus corresponds to a point in the square. A closed curve on the torus passing through the given point exactly once corresponds to a straight line in the square that connects a pair of opposite sides and passes through the given point.\n\nLet's denote the coordinates of the given point as (x, y), where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1 (we can normalize the coordinates to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by the side length of the square). A line with slope m that passes through (x, y) can be represented as:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (x, y). We can rewrite this as:\n\ny = mx + (y1 - mx1)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of distinct slopes m for which the line intersects the opposite sides of the square exactly once. This occurs when the line intersects the top side (y = 1) and the bottom side (y = 0) of the square.\n\nFor the top side (y = 1), we have:\n\n1 = mx + (y1 - mx1)\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = (1 - y1) / (x - x1)\n\nFor the bottom side (y = 0), we have:\n\n0 = mx + (y1 - mx1)\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = -y1 / (x - x1)\n\nSince the slopes must be rational numbers (to ensure that the curve is closed), we can write m as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors. Thus, we have two equations for m:\n\nm = (1 - y1) / (x - x1) = p1/q1\nm = -y1 / (x - x1) = p2/q2\n\nThe number of distinct slopes m (or distinct closed curves) is the number of distinct pairs (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) that satisfy these equations. This is equal to the number of lattice points (integer coordinates) on the boundary of the square, excluding the corners.\n\nThere are 4 sides to the square, and each side has a length of 1. Excluding the corners, there are 2 lattice points on each side, for a total of 4 * 2 = 8 lattice points. Therefore, there are 8 distinct closed curves on the torus that pass through the given point exactly once."
