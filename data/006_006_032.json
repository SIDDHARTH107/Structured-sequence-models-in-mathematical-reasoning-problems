    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of a player making a free throw is 0.75. If the player takes 10 free throws, what is the probability that he will make all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the player making all 10 free throws, we simply multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the probability of making a single free throw is 0.75, we have:\n\n0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.75^10 â‰ˆ 0.0563\n\nSo the probability of the player making all 10 free throws is approximately 0.0563 or 5.63%."
