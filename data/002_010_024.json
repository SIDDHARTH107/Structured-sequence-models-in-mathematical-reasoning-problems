    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the regular polygon, simply multiply the number of sides by the length of each side. In this case, there are 8 sides, and each side is 4 cm long.\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Length of each side)\nPerimeter = 8 × 4 cm\nPerimeter = 32 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the regular polygon is 32 centimeters."
