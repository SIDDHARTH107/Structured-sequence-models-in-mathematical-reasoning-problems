    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will use the Sylow theorems. First, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nThe order of G is 40, which can be factored as 2^3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups for a prime p dividing the order of G is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides the index of the p-subgroup in G.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and n_2 | 5, so n_2 can be 1 or 5.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and n_5 | 8, so n_5 can be 1 or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1, then G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P_5 of order 5. Both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, and their intersection is trivial (since their orders are coprime). By the product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is isomorphic to C_8 × C_5. Since C_8 × C_5 is isomorphic to C_40 (the cyclic group of order 40), in this case, G is isomorphic to C_40.\n\n2. If n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1, then G has five 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since P_5 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of the 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 and P_5. There are four possible non-isomorphic semidirect products in this case, which correspond to the four non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 8, then G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 8 and eight 5-Sylow subgroups of order 5. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D_20, as D_20 has two 5-Sylow subgroups, not eight.\n\n4. If n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 8, then G has five 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and eight 5-Sylow subgroups of order 5. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D_20, as D_20 has two 5-Sylow subgroups, not eight.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_40 or one of the four non-abelian groups of order 40 formed by the semidirect product of a 2-Sylow subgroup and the unique 5-Sylow subgroup. However, without additional information about G, we cannot determine which specific group G is isomorphic to."
