    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production process involves three machines: M1, M2, and M3. The production times (in minutes) for one unit of each product and each machine are as follows:\n\n| Product  | M1 | M2 | M3 |\n|----------|----|----|----|\n| A        | 2  | 1  | 4  |\n| B        | 3  | 2  | 2  |\n\nThe company has 20 hours of machine time available for each machine during the next week. Each product must be produced in integer amounts. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and profit per unit of product B is $15. How many units of each product should be produced to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machine times are as follows:\n\nM1: 2x + 3y ≤ 20 * 60 (20 hours converted to minutes)\nM2: 1x + 2y ≤ 20 * 60\nM3: 4x + 2y ≤ 20 * 60\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. M1 constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 1200\n   y ≤ (1200 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. M2 constraint: x + 2y ≤ 1200\n   y ≤ (1200 - x) / 2\n\n3. M3 constraint: 4x + 2y ≤ 1200\n   y ≤ (1200 - 4x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of M1 and M2 constraints:\n   2x + 3y = 1200\n   x + 2y = 1200\n   Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n   x + y = 600\n   y = 600 - x\n   Substituting this into the M2 constraint:\n   x + 2(600 - x) = 1200\n   x = 400\n   y = 600 - 400 = 200\n\n2. Intersection of M1 and M3 constraints:\n   2x + 3y = 1200\n   4x + 2y = 1200\n   Dividing the second equation by 2:\n   2x + y = 600\n   Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n   -2y = -600\n   y = 300\n   Substituting this into the M1 constraint:\n   2x + 3(300) = 1200\n   x = 300\n\n3. Intersection of M2 and M3 constraints:\n   x + 2y = 1200\n   4x + 2y = 1200\n   Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n   3x = 0\n   x = 0\n   Substituting this into the M2 constraint:\n   y = 600\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are (400, 200), (300, 300), and (0, 600).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\n1. Profit at (400, 200): 10(400) + 15(200) = 7000\n2. Profit at (300, 300): 10(300) + 15(300) = 7500\n3. Profit at (0, 600): 10(0) + 15(600) = 9000\n\nThe maximum profit is $9,000 when producing 0 units of product A and 600 units of product B."
