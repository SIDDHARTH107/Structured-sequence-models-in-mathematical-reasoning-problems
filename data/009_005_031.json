The system is then switched on at t=0, at which point the current begins to flow. Write the differential equation for the current and solve it to find an expression for the current as a function of time.",
    "message_2": "To write the differential equation for the current, we will use Kirchhoff's voltage law, which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero. In this case, the loop consists of the battery, the resistor, and the inductor.\n\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law: V_R = IR, where I is the current and R is the resistance (2 ohms in this case). The voltage across the inductor is given by V_L = L(dI/dt), where L is the inductance (0.1 H in this case) and dI/dt is the time derivative of the current.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's voltage law, we have:\n\nV_battery - V_R - V_L = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for V_R and V_L, we get:\n\n12 - 2I - 0.1(dI/dt) = 0\n\nRearranging the equation, we get the differential equation for the current:\n\n0.1(dI/dt) + 2I = 12\n\nNow, we will solve this first-order linear differential equation. First, we find the integrating factor, which is given by e^(∫(2/0.1)dt) = e^(20t).\n\nMultiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(20t) * 0.1(dI/dt) + 2e^(20t) * I = 12e^(20t)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of I(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (I(t) * e^(20t)) = 12e^(20t)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d/dt (I(t) * e^(20t)) dt = ∫12e^(20t) dt\n\nI(t) * e^(20t) = (12/20)e^(20t) + C\n\nNow, solve for I(t):\n\nI(t) = (12/20)e^(-20t) + Ce^(-20t)\n\nSince the circuit is initially at rest (t=0), the initial current is 0:\n\nI(0) = (12/20)e^(0) + Ce^(0) => 0 = 12/20 + C => C = -12/20\n\nSo, the expression for the current as a function of time is:\n\nI(t) = (12/20)(1 - e^(-20t))"
