    "message_1": "Suppose there are six variables in a data set: x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6. The principal components analysis (PCA) of this data set yields the following eigenvalues:\n\nλ1 = 4.25, λ2 = 2.61, λ3 = 1.80, λ4 = 1.15, λ5 = 0.69, λ6 = 0.10\n\nWhat is the proportion of the total variance explained by the first three principal components (PCs)?",
    "message_2": "To find the proportion of the total variance explained by the first three principal components, we need to calculate the sum of the eigenvalues for the first three components and divide it by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nSum of first three eigenvalues: λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 4.25 + 2.61 + 1.80 = 8.66\nSum of all eigenvalues: λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 + λ5 + λ6 = 4.25 + 2.61 + 1.80 + 1.15 + 0.69 + 0.10 = 10.60\n\nProportion of total variance explained by the first three PCs = (Sum of first three eigenvalues) / (Sum of all eigenvalues) = 8.66 / 10.60 ≈ 0.816\n\nSo, the proportion of the total variance explained by the first three principal components is approximately 81.6%."
