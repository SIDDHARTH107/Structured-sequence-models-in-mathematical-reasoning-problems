We can define $\\psi$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\psi := \\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\cdots \\exists x_{n+1} \\bigwedge_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n+1} (x_i < x_j \\lor x_j < x_i) \\land \\bigwedge_{1 \\leq i \\neq j \\leq n+1} (x_i \\neq x_j)\n$$\n\nThe formula $\\psi$ states that there exist $n+1$ distinct elements that are linearly ordered. Any linearly ordered set of size at least $n+1$ will satisfy $\\psi$, as it will have at least $n+1$ distinct elements that can be ordered. However, every linear ordering of size $n$ or smaller will fail to satisfy $\\psi$, as it will not have enough distinct elements to satisfy the existence quantifiers in $\\psi$."
