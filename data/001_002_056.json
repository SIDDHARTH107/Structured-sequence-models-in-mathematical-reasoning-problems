    "message_2": "To graph the line represented by the equation y = 2x - 5, we can start by finding two points on the line and then connecting them.\n\nLet's find the points by choosing two x-values and calculating the corresponding y-values using the equation:\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny = 2(0) - 5\ny = -5\nSo, the point (0, -5) is on the line.\n\n2. When x = 1:\ny = 2(1) - 5\ny = 2 - 5\ny = -3\nSo, the point (1, -3) is on the line.\n\nNow, we can connect these two points to graph the line.\n\nTo find the point at which the line intersects the x-axis, we need to find the x-value when y = 0. We can do this by setting y to 0 in the equation and solving for x:\n\n0 = 2x - 5\n\nNow, add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n5 = 2x\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\n5/2 = x\n\nSo, the line intersects the x-axis at the point (5/2, 0)."
