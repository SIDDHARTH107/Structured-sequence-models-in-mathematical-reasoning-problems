    "message_1": "A 10-foot ladder is leaning against a wall. If the base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall? Use Calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder has a length of 10 feet, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nNow, we want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 6 feet and dx/dt = 2 feet per second (the rate at which the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall).\n\nFirst, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd/dt(x^2 + y^2) = d/dt(100)\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 feet per second. To find y when x = 6 feet, we can plug x = 6 back into the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow we have all the information needed to find dy/dt:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16 = -3/2\n\nSo, when the base of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 feet per second (negative sign indicates downward direction)."
