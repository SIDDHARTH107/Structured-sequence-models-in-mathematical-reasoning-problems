    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the length of the Dragon curve doubles. So, after 8 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nInitial length * 2^number of iterations\n1 * 2^8 = 1 * 256 = 256 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after the first 8 iterations is 256 units."
