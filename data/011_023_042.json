    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the graph, we can use the concept of the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 8 vertices and 14 edges. The maximum degree of a vertex in this graph (denoted as Δ(G)) is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex. Since we don't have information about the specific graph structure, we can use the following inequality to find an upper bound for the chromatic number:\n\nchromatic number χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nNow, let's find the maximum possible degree for a vertex in this graph. In a complete graph with 8 vertices, there would be 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28 edges. However, our graph has only 14 edges, which is half of the maximum possible edges. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the maximum degree of a vertex in this graph is less than or equal to half of the maximum degree in a complete graph with 8 vertices, which is 8 - 1 = 7. So, Δ(G) ≤ 7 / 2 = 3.5.\n\nSince the degree of a vertex must be an integer, we can round up to get Δ(G) ≤ 4. Using the inequality above, we get:\n\nχ(G) ≤ 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the graph is at most 5. However, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact chromatic number."
