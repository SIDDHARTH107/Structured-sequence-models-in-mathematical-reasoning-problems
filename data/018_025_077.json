    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nA △ B = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted as B △ A. However, since the symmetric difference is commutative, meaning A △ B = B △ A, we already have the result:\n\nB △ A = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nNow we need to find the intersection of (A △ B) and (B △ A):\n\n(A △ B) ∩ (B △ A) = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8} ∩ {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nSince both sets are identical, their intersection is the same set:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ (B △ A) = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}"
