    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each Product A requires 5 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor, while each Product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 6 hours of labor. The company has 1000 hours of machine time and 900 hours of labor available. The profit for each Product A is $10 and the profit for each Product B is $15. The company wants to maximize its profit. \n\nWhat is the optimal production plan for the company (i.e. how many units of each product should it produce) and what is the maximum profit it can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor are as follows:\n\nMachine time: 5x + 2y ≤ 1000\nLabor: 3x + 6y ≤ 900\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraints for y:\n\nFrom the machine time constraint: y ≤ (1000 - 5x) / 2\nFrom the labor constraint: y ≤ (900 - 3x) / 6\n\nNow we'll find the corner points of the feasible region by setting the inequalities as equalities and solving the system of equations:\n\n1) x = 0, y = (1000 - 5(0)) / 2 => y = 500\n2) x = 0, y = (900 - 3(0)) / 6 => y = 150\n3) y = 0, x = (1000 - 2(0)) / 5 => x = 200\n4) 5x + 2y = 1000 and 3x + 6y = 900\n\nSolving the system of equations in 4):\n\n3x + 6y = 900 => x + 2y = 300 => x = 300 - 2y\nSubstitute x in the machine time equation:\n5(300 - 2y) + 2y = 1000\n1500 - 10y + 2y = 1000\n-8y = -500\ny = 62.5\n\nNow substitute y back into the x equation:\nx = 300 - 2(62.5)\nx = 300 - 125\nx = 175\n\nSo the corner points are (0, 500), (0, 150), (200, 0), and (175, 62.5).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1) Profit(0, 500) = 10(0) + 15(500) = $7,500\n2) Profit(0, 150) = 10(0) + 15(150) = $2,250\n3) Profit(200, 0) = 10(200) + 15(0) = $2,000\n4) Profit(175, 62.5) = 10(175) + 15(62.5) = $3,437.50\n\nThe maximum profit is $7,500 when producing 0 units of Product A and 500 units of Product B."
