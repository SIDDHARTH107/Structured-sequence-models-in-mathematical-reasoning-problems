    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company claims that their new model can travel a mean distance of at least 700 kilometers on a full tank of gas. A sample of 25 cars was taken and the mean distance traveled on a full tank was found to be 690 kilometers with a standard deviation of 20 kilometers. Test the hypothesis that the true mean distance traveled on a full tank is at least 700 kilometers at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean distance is at least 700 kilometers, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean distance is less than 700 kilometers.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 700\nH1: μ < 700\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = 690 km\nSample standard deviation (s) = 20 km\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 25, we will use a t-distribution. First, we need to calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (690 - 700) / (20 / √25)\nt = (-10) / (20 / 5)\nt = -10 / 4\nt = -2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.711\n\nNow, we compare the calculated t-score with the critical t-value:\n\nt = -2.5 < t_critical = -1.711\n\nSince the calculated t-score is less than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to support the claim that the true mean distance traveled on a full tank is less than 700 kilometers at a significance level of 0.05."
