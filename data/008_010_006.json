    "message_2": "First, we will write the given system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  3 -1 |  1 ]\n[ 4  2  3 |  4 ]\n[ 3 -1  2 | -2 ]\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will use the first row as a pivot. We will subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 1.5 times the first row from the third row.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 1.5 * Row1\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n[  2   3  -1 |   1  ]\n[  0  -4   5 |   2  ]\n[  0  -5.5 3.5 | -3.5 ]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will use the second row as a pivot. First, we need to make the leading coefficient of y in the second row equal to 1. We will multiply the second row by -1/4.\n\nRow2 = -1/4 * Row2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n[  2    3   -1  |   1   ]\n[  0    1   -5/4|  -1/2 ]\n[  0  -5.5  3.5 | -3.5 ]\n\nNow, we will add 5.5 times the second row to the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 + 5.5 * Row2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n[  2    3    -1  |   1   ]\n[  0    1   -5/4 |  -1/2 ]\n[  0    0    1/4 |  -2   ]\n\nStep 3: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n1/4 * z = -2\nz = -8\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny - 5/4 * z = -1/2\ny - 5/4 * (-8) = -1/2\ny + 10 = -1/2\ny = -21/2\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n2x + 3y - z = 1\n2x + 3(-21/2) + 8 = 1\n2x - 63/2 + 8 = 1\n2x - 47/2 = 1\nx = 24/2\nx = 12\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 12, y = -21/2, and z = -8."
