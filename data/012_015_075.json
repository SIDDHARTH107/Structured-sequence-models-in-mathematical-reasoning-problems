    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 8 vertices, so a connected graph would need at least 8-1=7 edges. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the graph is connected just because it has more than 7 edges. We need to consider the possibility of disconnected components. The maximum number of edges in a connected graph with 8 vertices is given by the formula (n*(n-1))/2, which is (8*7)/2 = 28 edges. Since our graph has only 10 edges, it is also possible that the graph is disconnected.\n\nTo determine the number of connected components, we can use the fact that the sum of the number of edges in each connected component is equal to the total number of edges in the graph. Let's consider the possible combinations of connected components and their corresponding number of edges:\n\n1. One connected component with 8 vertices: This would require at least 7 edges, but since we have 10 edges, there must be more than one connected component.\n2. Two connected components: The possible combinations are:\n   a. One component with 7 vertices and one with 1 vertex: The component with 7 vertices would require at least 6 edges, and the component with 1 vertex would require 0 edges. This combination is not possible since it only accounts for 6 edges.\n   b. One component with 6 vertices and one with 2 vertices: The component with 6 vertices would require at least 5 edges, and the component with 2 vertices would require 1 edge. This combination accounts for 6 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n   c. One component with 5 vertices and one with 3 vertices: The component with 5 vertices would require at least 4 edges, and the component with 3 vertices would require at least 2 edges. This combination accounts for 6 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n   d. One component with 4 vertices and one with 4 vertices: The component with 4 vertices would require at least 3 edges, and the other component with 4 vertices would also require at least 3 edges. This combination accounts for 6 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n\nSince none of the combinations of two connected components account for the 10 edges in the graph, we can conclude that there must be more than two connected components.\n\n3. Three connected components: The possible combinations are:\n   a. One component with 5 vertices, one with 2 vertices, and one with 1 vertex: The component with 5 vertices would require at least 4 edges, the component with 2 vertices would require 1 edge, and the component with 1 vertex would require 0 edges. This combination accounts for 5 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n   b. One component with 4 vertices, one with 3 vertices, and one with 1 vertex: The component with 4 vertices would require at least 3 edges, the component with 3 vertices would require at least 2 edges, and the component with 1 vertex would require 0 edges. This combination accounts for 5 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n   c. One component with 4 vertices, one with 2 vertices, and one with 2 vertices: The component with 4 vertices would require at least 3 edges, and each of the components with 2 vertices would require 1 edge. This combination accounts for 5 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n\nSince none of the combinations of three connected components account for the 10 edges in the graph, we can conclude that there must be more than three connected components.\n\n4. Four connected components: The only possible combination is one component with 3 vertices, one with 2 vertices, one with 2 vertices, and one with 1 vertex. The component with 3 vertices would require at least 2 edges, and each of the components with 2 vertices would require 1 edge, and the component with 1 vertex would require 0 edges. This combination accounts for 4 edges, which is less than the 10 edges we have.\n\nSince none of the combinations of four connected components account for the 10 edges in the graph, we can conclude that there must be more than four connected components.\n\nHowever, we have reached a contradiction, as it is not possible to have more than four connected components with 8 vertices. This means that our initial assumption that the graph is disconnected is incorrect, and the graph must be connected.\n\nTherefore, the graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges is connected, and there is only one connected component."
