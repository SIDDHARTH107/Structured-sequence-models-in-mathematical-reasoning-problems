    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 individuals who can each contribute $20 to a public good with a total cost of $100. The public good provides a benefit of $200 to each individual who contributed. If everyone contributes, what will be the individual payoff for each person?",
    "message_2": "If everyone contributes, each of the 10 individuals will contribute $20, which will cover the total cost of the public good ($100). Since the public good provides a benefit of $200 to each individual who contributed, each person will receive a benefit of $200.\n\nTo calculate the individual payoff for each person, we need to subtract their contribution from the benefit they receive:\n\nIndividual payoff = Benefit - Contribution\nIndividual payoff = $200 - $20\nIndividual payoff = $180\n\nSo, if everyone contributes, the individual payoff for each person will be $180."
