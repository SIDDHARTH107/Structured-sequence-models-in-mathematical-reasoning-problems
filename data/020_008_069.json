    "message_1": "A cereal company produces two types of cereal: Alpha and Beta. The Alpha cereal costs $3 per box to make and can be sold for $5 per box. The Beta cereal costs $4 per box to make and can be sold for $6 per box. The company has a production capacity of 800 boxes per day and wants to maximize their profits. How many boxes of each type of cereal should they produce per day to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Alpha cereal boxes and y be the number of Beta cereal boxes produced per day.\n\nThe profit for Alpha cereal is $2 per box (selling price $5 - cost $3), and the profit for Beta cereal is $2 per box (selling price $6 - cost $4).\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nTotal Profit = 2x + 2y\n\nThe company has a production capacity of 800 boxes per day, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nx + y = 800\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can solve for y in the capacity equation:\n\ny = 800 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the total profit equation:\n\nTotal Profit = 2x + 2(800 - x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nTotal Profit = 2x + 1600 - 2x\n\nTotal Profit = 1600\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the total profit is constant and does not depend on the number of Alpha or Beta cereal boxes produced. Therefore, the company can produce any combination of Alpha and Beta cereal boxes that add up to 800 boxes per day, and the total profit will always be $1600.\n\nFor example, they could produce 400 boxes of Alpha and 400 boxes of Beta, or 600 boxes of Alpha and 200 boxes of Beta, or any other combination that adds up to 800 boxes."
