    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. To apply the Bat Algorithm to the given function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 8, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the bat population with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Define the frequency, pulse rate, and loudness of each bat.\n3. Update the position and velocity of each bat based on the frequency, pulse rate, and loudness.\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each bat.\n5. Update the global best solution if a better solution is found.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the maximum number of iterations.\n\nHowever, since the Bat Algorithm is a complex optimization algorithm that involves randomness and multiple iterations, it is not possible to provide a step-by-step solution here. Instead, we can use the vertex formula to find the minimum value of the quadratic function.\n\nThe vertex formula for a quadratic function in the form of f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 8:\n\na = 1\nb = 5\nc = -8\n\nApplying the vertex formula:\n\nx = -5 / (2 * 1)\nx = -5 / 2\nx = -2.5\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging the x value into the function:\n\nf(-2.5) = (-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) - 8\nf(-2.5) = 6.25 - 12.5 - 8\nf(-2.5) = -14.25\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 8 in the interval [-10, 10] is -14.25 at x = -2.5."
