    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors, we multiply the corresponding components of each vector and then sum the results. In this case, the vectors A and B are given by A = (3, 4) and B = (5, -2).\n\nThe dot product of A and B is:\n\nA · B = (3 * 5) + (4 * -2)\n\nA · B = (15) + (-8)\n\nA · B = 7\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors A and B is 7."
