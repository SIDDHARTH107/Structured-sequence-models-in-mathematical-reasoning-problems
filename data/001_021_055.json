    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 12)) / 2\n\nx = (4 ± √4) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (4 + √4) / 2\nx = (4 + 2) / 2\nx = 6 / 2\nx = 3\n\n2) x = (4 - √4) / 2\nx = (4 - 2) / 2\nx = 2 / 2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 are x = 1 and x = 3."
