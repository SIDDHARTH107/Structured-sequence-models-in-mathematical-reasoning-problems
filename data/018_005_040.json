    "message_2": "First, let's define the sets A and B:\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThe complement of a set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. In this case, the universal set U consists of all integers between 1 and 10, inclusive:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of set A:\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = B\n\nNow, we want to prove that the intersection of A and its complement A' is the empty set. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, we want to find the elements that are common to A and A':\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A contains only even numbers and A' contains only odd numbers, there are no elements that are common to both sets. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis proves that the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set."
