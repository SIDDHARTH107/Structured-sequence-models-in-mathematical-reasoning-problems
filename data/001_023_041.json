    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(3x) - sin(x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identities:\n\n1. cos(3x) = 4cos^3(x) - 3cos(x)\n2. sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nNow, let's rewrite the given equation using the first identity:\n\n4cos^3(x) - 3cos(x) - sin(x) = 1\n\nWe want to have everything in terms of cos(x), so let's use the second identity to express sin(x) in terms of cos(x):\n\nsin(x) = ±√(1 - cos^2(x))\n\nNow, substitute sin(x) in the equation:\n\n4cos^3(x) - 3cos(x) - ±√(1 - cos^2(x)) = 1\n\nLet's consider both cases, positive and negative square root:\n\nCase 1: Positive square root\n\n4cos^3(x) - 3cos(x) - √(1 - cos^2(x)) = 1\n\nLet y = cos(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n4y^3 - 3y - √(1 - y^2) = 1\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the solutions for y, and then find the corresponding x values.\n\nCase 2: Negative square root\n\n4cos^3(x) - 3cos(x) + √(1 - cos^2(x)) = 1\n\nLet y = cos(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n4y^3 - 3y + √(1 - y^2) = 1\n\nThis equation is also difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the solutions for y, and then find the corresponding x values.\n\nUsing numerical methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator), we can find the solutions for y in both cases. Then, we can find the corresponding x values by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the y values, making sure they are within the given range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π."
