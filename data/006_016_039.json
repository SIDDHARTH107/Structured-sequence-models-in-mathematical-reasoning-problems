    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces widgets and there is a probability of 0.05 that any given widget will have a certain type of defect. If a quality control inspector randomly selects 20 widgets from the production line, what is the probability that at least one of the 20 widgets will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the 20 widgets will have the defect, we can first find the probability that none of the 20 widgets have the defect and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single widget does not have the defect is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the widgets are selected randomly and independently, the probability that all 20 widgets do not have the defect is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one of the 20 widgets has the defect, we subtract the probability that none of them have the defect from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 20 widgets will have the defect is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
