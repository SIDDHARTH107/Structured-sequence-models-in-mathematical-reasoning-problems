    "message_1": "In a Playfair cipher encryption scheme, the key is \"MATHS\" and the plaintext message is \"HELLO\". Using the Playfair encryption algorithm, what is the ciphertext that would be produced?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them and continue. In this case, \"HELLO\" becomes \"HE\", \"LX\", and \"LO\".\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the following rules:\n\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n4. Encrypt the digraphs:\n\n   - HE: H and E are in the same row, so replace them with the letters to their right: \"SF\".\n   - LX: L and X form a rectangle, so replace L with N and X with K: \"NK\".\n   - LO: L and O are in the same column, so replace them with the letters below them: \"NQ\".\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext: \"SFNKNQ\"."
