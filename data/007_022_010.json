    "message_2": "1. To calculate the order of the elliptic curve, we need to find the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.

Since all the points on the curve have the same order (as they are all part of the same group), the point with the highest order is any of the points on the curve. For example, we can choose the point (2, 16).\n\n3. Constructing a group table for the points on the curve would require calculating the sum of each pair of points on the curve. However, this is a very tedious process and not practical to do by hand. Instead, we can use a computer program or an online tool to generate the group table.\n\n4. To calculate $P+Q$, we can use the group table generated in step 3. However, since we don't have the group table, we can calculate $P+Q$ using the point addition formula for elliptic curves:\n\nIf $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$, then $P+Q = (x_3, y_3)$, where\n- $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{29}$\n- $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{29}$\n\nand\n- If $P \\neq Q$, then $\\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\pmod{29}$\n- If $P = Q$, then $\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} \\pmod{29}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term in the elliptic curve equation (in this case, $a = 9$).\n\nSince $P \\neq Q$, we have:\n- $\\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\pmod{29} = \\frac{2 - 14}{23 - 13} \\pmod{29} = \\frac{-12}{10} \\pmod{29} = 3 \\pmod{29}$\n\nNow we can calculate $x_3$ and $y_3$:\n- $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 \\pmod{29} = 3^2 - 13 - 23 \\pmod{29} = 9 - 36 \\pmod{29} = 2 \\pmod{29}$\n- $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 \\pmod{29} = 3(13 - 2) - 14 \\pmod{29} = 33 - 14 \\pmod{29} = 19 \\pmod{29}$\n\nSo, $P+Q = (2, 19)$."
