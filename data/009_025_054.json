    "message_1": "Suppose a stock has a current price of $100, the annual risk-free interest rate is 4% and the annual volatility is 20%. An investor wants to purchase a European call option with a strike price of $110 that expires in 6 months. Using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, what is the price of the call option?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, we need to use the following formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS = current stock price\nX = strike price\nr = risk-free interest rate\nT = time to expiration (in years)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nσ = annual volatility\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nS = 100\nX = 110\nr = 0.04\nT = 0.5 (6 months = 0.5 years)\nσ = 0.20\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.04 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.2449\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.20 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ -0.4449\n\nNext, we need to find N(d1) and N(d2):\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.4032\nN(d2) ≈ 0.3280\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\nC = 100 * 0.4032 - 110 * e^(-0.04 * 0.5) * 0.3280\nC ≈ 40.32 - 110 * 0.9802 * 0.3280\nC ≈ 40.32 - 35.27\nC ≈ 5.05\n\nTherefore, the price of the European call option is approximately $5.05."
