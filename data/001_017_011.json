    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+5) - log2(x-7) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the quotient rule for logarithms, which states that logb(a) - logb(c) = logb(a/c). Applying this rule, we get:\n\nlog2((x+5)/(x-7)) = 3\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form. This gives us:\n\n2^3 = (x+5)/(x-7)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8 = (x+5)/(x-7)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x-7):\n\n8(x-7) = x+5\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n8x - 56 = x + 5\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n7x - 56 = 5\n\nAdding 56 to both sides, we get:\n\n7x = 61\n\nFinally, dividing by 7, we get:\n\nx = 61/7\n\nSo, the solution for x is x = 61/7."
