    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The two faces with dimensions 8 cm (length) and 6 cm (width):\nArea = length × width = 8 cm × 6 cm = 48 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is 48 cm² × 2 = 96 cm².\n\n2. The two faces with dimensions 8 cm (length) and 10 cm (height):\nArea = length × height = 8 cm × 10 cm = 80 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is 80 cm² × 2 = 160 cm².\n\n3. The two faces with dimensions 6 cm (width) and 10 cm (height):\nArea = width × height = 6 cm × 10 cm = 60 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is 60 cm² × 2 = 120 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\nTotal surface area = 96 cm² + 160 cm² + 120 cm² = 376 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 376 square centimeters."
