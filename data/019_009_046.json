    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nLet a be a prime number greater than 2. We need to prove that a is an odd number.\n\nBy definition, a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. \n\nNow, let's consider the case where a is an even number. An even number can be written in the form 2k, where k is an integer. If a is an even number, then it can be written as a = 2k. In this case, a has at least three distinct positive divisors: 1, 2, and itself (2k). This contradicts the definition of a prime number, which has only two distinct positive divisors.\n\nTherefore, if a is a prime number greater than 2, it cannot be an even number. Thus, a must be an odd number."
