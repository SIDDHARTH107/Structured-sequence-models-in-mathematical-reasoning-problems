    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent to the curve C at the point (1, -1), we first need to find the derivative of the equation with respect to x. The given equation is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 4x\n\nNow, differentiate both sides with respect to x using implicit differentiation:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of dy/dx at the point (1, -1). Plug in x = 1 and y = -1 into the equation:\n\n2(-1)(dy/dx) = 3(1)^2 - 4\n\n-2(dy/dx) = -1\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = 1/2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent to the curve C at the point (1, -1) is 1/2."
