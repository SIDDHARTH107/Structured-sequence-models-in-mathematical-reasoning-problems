The table below shows the skill level of each employee for each task on a scale of 1 (lowest skill) to 5 (highest skill):\n\n|     | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 | Task 4 | Task 5 | Task 6 | Task 7 | Task 8 |\n|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Emp1| \t5    |     2   |     4   |     1   |     3   |     2   |     4   |     1   |\n| Emp2| \t3    |     1   |     2   |     4   |     5   |     1   |     3   |     2   |\n| Emp3| \t4    |     3   |     1   |     5   |     2   |     4   |     1   |     3   |\n| Emp4| \t2    |     4   |     5   |     2   |     1   |     5   |     2   |     4   |\n| Emp5| \t1    |     5   |     3   |     3   |     4   |     3   |     5   |     2   |\n| Emp6| \t2    |     3   |     5   |     1   |     5   |     2   |     4   |     3   |\n| Emp7| \t3    |     4   |     2   |     5   |     1   |     4   |     3   |     2   |\n| Emp8| \t4    |     1   |     3   |     4   |     2   |     3   |     1   |     5   |\n\nThe goal is to assign each employee to a task such that the total skill level required for all tasks is minimized.\n\nWhat is the minimum total skill level required for all tasks, and what is the optimal employee-task assignment that achieves this minimum?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal employee-task assignment that minimizes the total skill level required for all tasks, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm. Applying the Hungarian Algorithm to the given table, we get the following optimal assignment:\n\n- Emp1: Task 4\n- Emp2: Task 6\n- Emp3: Task 7\n- Emp4: Task 5\n- Emp5: Task 1\n- Emp6: Task 3\n- Emp7: Task 2\n- Emp8: Task 8\n\nThe minimum total skill level required for all tasks with this assignment is:\n\n1 (Emp5-Task1) + 4 (Emp7-Task2) + 5 (Emp6-Task3) + 1 (Emp1-Task4) + 1 (Emp4-Task5) + 1 (Emp2-Task6) + 1 (Emp3-Task7) + 5 (Emp8-Task8) = 19"
