    "message_2": "Let's denote the initial length of the Heighway dragon curve as L. After each iteration, the length increases by a factor of $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Therefore, after 10 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\n$L \\times (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^{10}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$L \\times (\\frac{2^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{2})^{10} = L \\times (2^{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10})^{-1} = L \\times 2^{-5}$\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is:\n\n$L \\times 2^{-5}$"
