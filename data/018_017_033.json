    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of these two sets. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. In other words, we want to find the elements that are unique to each set.\n\n(A × B) ∆ (B × A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of (A × B) and (B × A) is {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}."
