    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly market with two firms, A and B, selling identical products. The demand function for the product is P = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the quantity in the market. Each firm has a constant marginal cost of $20. What will be the quantity produced by each firm, and the market equilibrium price?",
    "message_2": "To find the quantity produced by each firm and the market equilibrium price in a Cournot duopoly, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction functions for both firms.\n2. Solve for the Nash equilibrium by equating the reaction functions.\n3. Calculate the total quantity produced in the market.\n4. Determine the market equilibrium price using the demand function.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction functions for both firms.\n\nThe profit function for firm A is given by:\n\nπ_A = (P - MC_A) * q_A = (100 - Q - 20) * q_A = (80 - q_A - q_B) * q_A\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm A will choose q_A such that the first-order condition (FOC) is satisfied:\n\nd(π_A) / dq_A = 80 - 2q_A - q_B = 0\n\nSimilarly, the profit function for firm B is given by:\n\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * q_B = (100 - Q - 20) * q_B = (80 - q_A - q_B) * q_B\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm B will choose q_B such that the first-order condition (FOC) is satisfied:\n\nd(π_B) / dq_B = 80 - 2q_B - q_A = 0\n\nNow we have the reaction functions for both firms:\n\nR_A(q_B) = (80 - q_B) / 2\nR_B(q_A) = (80 - q_A) / 2\n\nStep 2: Solve for the Nash equilibrium by equating the reaction functions.\n\nR_A(q_B) = R_B(q_A)\n\n(80 - q_B) / 2 = (80 - q_A) / 2\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we can equate the numerators:\n\n80 - q_B = 80 - q_A\n\nq_A = q_B\n\nNow we can substitute this back into one of the reaction functions to find the equilibrium quantity for each firm:\n\nq_A = (80 - q_A) / 2\n\n2q_A = 80 - q_A\n\n3q_A = 80\n\nq_A = 80 / 3 ≈ 26.67\n\nSince q_A = q_B, we also have:\n\nq_B = 26.67\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total quantity produced in the market.\n\nQ = q_A + q_B = 26.67 + 26.67 = 53.34\n\nStep 4: Determine the market equilibrium price using the demand function.\n\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - 53.34 ≈ 46.66\n\nSo, in this Cournot duopoly, each firm will produce approximately 26.67 units of the product, and the market equilibrium price will be approximately $46.66."
