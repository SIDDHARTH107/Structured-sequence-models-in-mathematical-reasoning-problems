    "message_2": "To find the x-coordinate of the inflection point, we need to find the second derivative of the function f(x) and then set it equal to zero to solve for x.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 12x^2 + 18x) = 6x^2 - 24x + 18\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 24x + 18) = 12x - 24\n\nTo find the inflection point, we set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n12x - 24 = 0\n12x = 24\nx = 2\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the inflection point is 2."
