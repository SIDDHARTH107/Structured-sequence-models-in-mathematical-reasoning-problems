    "message_2": "To find the diameter of G, we need to determine the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with 12 vertices. This can be calculated using the formula for a complete graph:\n\nEdges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices.\n\nEdges = 12 * (12 - 1) / 2 = 12 * 11 / 2 = 66\n\nSo, the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with 12 vertices is 66. However, our graph G has only 30 edges, which means it is not a complete graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum possible diameter for a graph with 12 vertices. This would occur in a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the diameter would be 1, since any two vertices are directly connected by an edge.\n\nSince our graph G has fewer edges than a complete graph, its diameter must be greater than 1. Let's consider the next smallest possible diameter, which is 2. In a graph with diameter 2, every pair of vertices can be connected by a path of length 2 or less. \n\nTo achieve a diameter of 2, we can construct a graph with a \"center\" vertex connected to all other vertices, and all other vertices connected to each other. This would require:\n\n1. 11 edges connecting the center vertex to the other 11 vertices\n2. (11 * 10) / 2 = 55 edges connecting the remaining 11 vertices to each other\n\nTotal edges = 11 + 55 = 66 edges\n\nHowever, our graph G has only 30 edges, which is not enough to create a graph with diameter 2.\n\nNow, let's consider a graph with diameter 3. In this case, every pair of vertices can be connected by a path of length 3 or less. One way to construct such a graph is to create a \"hub\" of vertices that are all connected to each other, and then connect the remaining vertices to this hub. \n\nFor example, we can create a hub of 6 vertices, which would require (6 * 5) / 2 = 15 edges. Then, we can connect the remaining 6 vertices to this hub, requiring an additional 6 edges. This would result in a graph with 21 edges, which is less than the 30 edges in our graph G.\n\nSince we can construct a graph with diameter 3 using fewer than 30 edges, it is possible for our graph G to have a diameter of 3. Therefore, the diameter of G is at most 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the diameter of the graph G with 12 vertices and 30 edges is 3."
