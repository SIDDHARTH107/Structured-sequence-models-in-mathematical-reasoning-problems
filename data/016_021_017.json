    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal curve that is generated by iteratively replacing a line segment with two segments, each of length (1/2) times the original length, and connected at an angle of 60 degrees. After each iteration, the total length of the curve increases by a factor of 3/2.\n\nLet L_n be the total length of the curve after the nth iteration. We have:\n\nL_0 = 1 (the original line segment)\nL_1 = (3/2) * L_0\nL_2 = (3/2) * L_1\nL_3 = (3/2) * L_2\nL_4 = (3/2) * L_3\n\nWe want to find L_4. We can do this by iteratively applying the formula:\n\nL_1 = (3/2) * 1 = 3/2\nL_2 = (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4\nL_3 = (3/2) * (9/4) = 27/8\nL_4 = (3/2) * (27/8) = 81/16\n\nSo the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 4th iteration is 81/16 units."
