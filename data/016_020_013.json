    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the 1st iteration, there is 1 tetrahedron.\nIn the 2nd iteration, there are 4 tetrahedra.\nIn the 3rd iteration, there are 4^2 = 16 tetrahedra.\nIn the 4th iteration, there are 4^3 = 64 tetrahedra.\n\nSo, in the 5th iteration, there are 4^4 = 256 tetrahedra."
