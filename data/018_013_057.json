    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products and unions for the given sets.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nA x {3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n{2} x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the unions:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (A x {3}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} ∪ {(1, 3), (2, 3)} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ ({2} x A) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} ∪ {(2, 1), (2, 2)} = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the results:\n\n(A x B) ∪ (A x {3}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n(B x A) ∪ ({2} x A) = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) ∪ (A x {3}) ≠ (B x A) ∪ ({2} x A). This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
