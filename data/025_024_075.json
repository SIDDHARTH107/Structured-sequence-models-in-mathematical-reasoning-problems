    "message_2": "The curve given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$ is a circle centered at the origin with radius 1. The group $G$ of rotations about the origin acts on the set of points on the curve with $x > 0$. \n\nLet's consider the action of $G$ on the set of points on the curve. Since the curve is a circle, any rotation about the origin will map a point on the curve to another point on the curve. Thus, the orbits of $G$ acting on the set of points on the curve are the sets of points that are obtained by rotating a given point on the curve about the origin.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of points on the curve with $x > 0$. This set consists of the points in the right half of the circle, excluding the points on the $y$-axis. Since the circle is symmetric about the $x$-axis, any point in the right half of the circle can be rotated to another point in the right half of the circle by a rotation of angle $2\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the line connecting the origin to the point and the $x$-axis.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct orbits of $G$ acting on the set of points on the curve with $x > 0$ is equal to the number of distinct angles $\\theta$ such that $0 < \\theta < \\pi/2$. Since there are infinitely many such angles, there are infinitely many distinct orbits of $G$ acting on the set of points on the curve with $x > 0$."
