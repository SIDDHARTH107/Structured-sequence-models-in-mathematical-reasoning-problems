    "message_2": "First, we will write the given system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 5 -4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | -8  |\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -4) - (2 * 5) = -12 - 10 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists.
