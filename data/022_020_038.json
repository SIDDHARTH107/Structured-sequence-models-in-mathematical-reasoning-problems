    "message_2": "To find the values of u(2i) and u(-2i), we will first evaluate the function f(z) at these points.\n\nf(2i) = (2i)/((2i)^2 - 4) = (2i)/(4i^2 - 4) = (2i)/(-4 - 4) = (2i)/(-8) = -i/4\n\nf(-2i) = (-2i)/((-2i)^2 - 4) = (-2i)/(4i^2 - 4) = (-2i)/(-4 - 4) = (-2i)/(-8) = i/4\n\nNow, we will use the boundary conditions to find the values of u(2i) and u(-2i).\n\nSince f(z) is the solution to the boundary value problem, we know that:\n\nu(z) = 5, on the segment (-2,2) of the real axis\n\nu(z) = 0, on the upper half circle |z| = 2\n\nThe points 2i and -2i are not on the real axis, so the first boundary condition does not apply. However, they are on the upper half circle |z| = 2, so the second boundary condition applies:\n\nu(2i) = 0\nu(-2i) = 0\n\nThus, the values of u(2i) and u(-2i) are both 0."
