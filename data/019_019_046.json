    "message_2": "To construct a Turing machine that accepts the language {0^n1^n | n ≥ 1}, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start in the initial state, q0.\n2. If the input is empty, reject (since n ≥ 1).\n3. If the first symbol is 1, reject (since there must be at least one 0 before any 1's).\n4. If the first symbol is 0, mark it with an 'x' and move right to find the first 1.\n5. When the first 1 is found, mark it with a 'y' and move left to find the first 'x'.\n6. If an 'x' is found, move right to find the next unmarked 0, and repeat steps 4-5.\n7. If no unmarked 0 is found, move right to find the first 'y'.\n8. If a 'y' is found, move right to check if there are any unmarked 1's.\n9. If there are no unmarked 1's, accept.
