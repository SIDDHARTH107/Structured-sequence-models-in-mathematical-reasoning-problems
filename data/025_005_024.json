    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve defined by the equation $y^2 - x^3 = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0 \\Rightarrow -3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nThus, the only singular point of the curve is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$."
