    "message_1": "A technological company has produced a system which has 6 critical components, each with a failure probability of 0.05. What is the probability that at least 1 critical component will not work properly when the system is being used?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 1 critical component will not work properly, we can first find the probability that all components work properly and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component works properly is 1 - failure probability = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 6 critical components and their failure probabilities are independent, the probability that all components work properly is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components work properly) = 0.95^6 ≈ 0.7351\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least 1 component does not work properly by subtracting the probability that all components work properly from 1:\n\nP(at least 1 component fails) = 1 - P(all components work properly) = 1 - 0.7351 ≈ 0.2649\n\nSo, the probability that at least 1 critical component will not work properly when the system is being used is approximately 0.2649 or 26.49%."
