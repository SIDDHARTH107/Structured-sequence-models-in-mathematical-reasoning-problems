    "message_2": "The fourth Maxwell equation is Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition, which relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop and the time-varying electric field. In this problem, we are dealing with a steady-state condition, which means there is no time-varying electric field. Therefore, we can use the simplified version of Ampere's law without Maxwell's addition:\n\n∮B⋅dl = μ₀I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, dl is an infinitesimal segment of the closed loop, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), and I is the current passing through the loop.\n\nSince we are dealing with an infinitely long straight wire carrying a current, the magnetic field B will be in the form of concentric circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop with a radius r (in this case, r = 5 cm = 0.05 m) as our Amperian loop. The magnetic field B will be tangent to the loop at every point, and the angle between B and dl will be 0 degrees. Therefore, the dot product B⋅dl = Bdlcos(0) = Bdl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's law for our chosen loop:\n\n∮Bdl = B∮dl = μ₀I\n\nSince the magnetic field B is constant along the loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB∮dl = μ₀I\n\nThe integral ∮dl represents the circumference of the circular loop, which is 2πr:\n\nB(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nNow, we can solve for the magnetic field B:\n\nB = μ₀I / (2πr)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)(10 A) / (2π(0.05 m))\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-6) Tm) / (0.1π m)\n\nB = 0.04 T\n\nNow, we have the magnetic field B at a distance of 5 cm from the wire. However, the problem asks for the electric field, not the magnetic field. Since we are dealing with a steady-state condition, there is no time-varying magnetic field, and hence, there is no induced electric field according to Faraday's law. Therefore, the electric field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire is 0 V/m."
