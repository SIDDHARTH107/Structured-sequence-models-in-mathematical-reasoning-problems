    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. At each level, the curve becomes more complex, and its total length increases. The total length of a Hilbert curve at any level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal Length = (Number of Segments) * (Unit Length)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve, the number of segments at any level can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of Segments = 4^Level\n\nFor a level 8 Hilbert curve with a unit length of one, we can calculate the total length as follows:\n\nNumber of Segments = 4^8 = 65536\n\nTotal Length = 65536 * 1 = 65536\n\nSo, the total length of a level 8 Hilbert curve with a unit length of one is 65,536 units."
