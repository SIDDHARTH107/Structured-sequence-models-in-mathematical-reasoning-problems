    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  2 |\n    | 2  8 12 |\n    | 2 12 21 |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    | 62  |\n    |107  |\n\nNow, we need to decompose the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T. \n\nL = | l11  0   0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nL^T = | l11 l21 l31 |\n      |  0  l22 l32 |\n      |  0   0  l33 |\n\nUsing Cholesky decomposition, we can find the elements of the matrix L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(8 - 2^2) = sqrt(4) = 2\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (12 - 2 * 2) / 2 = 4\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(21 - 2^2 - 4^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\n\nSo, the matrix L is:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  2  0 |\n    | 2  4  1 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | |y1|   |  7  |\n| 2  2  0 | |y2| = | 62  |\n| 2  4  1 | |y3|   |107  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 7 / 1 = 7\ny2 = (62 - 2 * 7) / 2 = 24\ny3 = (107 - 2 * 7 - 4 * 24) / 1 = -1\n\nSo, the vector y is:\n\ny = |  7  |\n    | 24  |\n    | -1  |\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system L^T x = y for x:\n\n| 1  2  2 | |x1|   |  7  |\n| 0  2  4 | |x2| = | 24  |\n| 0  0  1 | |x3|   | -1  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx3 = -1 / 1 = -1\nx2 = (24 - 4 * (-1)) / 2 = 14\nx1 = (7 - 2 * 14 - 2 * (-1)) / 1 = -21\n\nSo, the vector x is:\n\nx = | -21 |\n    |  14  |\n    |  -1  |\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -21, y = 14, and z = -1."
