    "message_1": "A math student is asked to find the number of roots of the polynomial equation $z^5 + 2z^3 + 3 = 0$ in the complex plane. Using Liouville's Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, calculate the exact number of roots of the equation.",
    "message_2": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial equation of degree n with complex coefficients has exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. In this case, the given polynomial equation is $z^5 + 2z^3 + 3 = 0$. The degree of this polynomial is 5 (the highest power of z), so according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, there are exactly 5 roots in the complex plane. Liouville's Theorem is not needed to solve this problem."
