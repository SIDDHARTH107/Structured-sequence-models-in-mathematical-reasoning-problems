    "message_2": "To find the total area of the three smaller triangles, we first need to find the coordinates of the midpoints of each side of the original triangle.\n\nLet A = (0,0), B = (2,0), and C = (1,3).\n\nMidpoint of AB: M1 = ((0+2)/2, (0+0)/2) = (1,0)\nMidpoint of BC: M2 = ((2+1)/2, (0+3)/2) = (1.5, 1.5)\nMidpoint of AC: M3 = ((0+1)/2, (0+3)/2) = (0.5, 1.5)\n\nNow, we have three smaller triangles: AM1M3, BM1M2, and CM2M3.\n\n1. Triangle AM1M3:\nBase = AM1 = 1 (distance between A and M1)\nHeight = M3_y - M1_y = 1.5 - 0 = 1.5 (difference in y-coordinates of M3 and M1)\nArea = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 1 * 1.5 = 0.75 square units\n\n2. Triangle BM1M2:\nBase = BM1 = 1 (distance between B and M1)\nHeight = M2_y - M1_y = 1.5 - 0 = 1.5 (difference in y-coordinates of M2 and M1)\nArea = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 1 * 1.5 = 0.75 square units\n\n3. Triangle CM2M3:\nBase = CM2 = 1 (distance between C and M2)\nHeight = M3_x - M2_x = 0.5 - 1.5 = -1 (difference in x-coordinates of M3 and M2)\nArea = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 1 * (-1) = -0.5 square units (negative sign indicates that we have taken the wrong direction for height, but the area should be positive)\nArea = 0.5 square units\n\nTotal area of the three smaller triangles = 0.75 + 0.75 + 0.5 = 2 square units."
