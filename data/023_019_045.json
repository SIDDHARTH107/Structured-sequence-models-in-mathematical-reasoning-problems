    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system described by the transfer function H(s), we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function. A system is stable if all its poles have negative real parts.\n\nFirst, let's find the poles of H(s). The poles are the roots of the denominator of the transfer function:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 13 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\ns = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\ns = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\ns = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\ns = (-4 ± 6i) / 2\n\nThe roots are s1 = -2 + 3i and s2 = -2 - 3i. Both roots have negative real parts (-2), so the system is stable for all values of ω.\n\nIn summary, the system described by the transfer function H(s) = (s + 3)/(s^2 + 4s + 13) is stable for all values of ω, as both poles have negative real parts."
