    "message_2": "To prove that G is a cyclic group, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G has order 7, we know that |G| = 7, which means there are 7 elements in G. Let's denote these elements as {e, g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element g in G, where g â‰  e. We will examine the powers of g: g^1, g^2, g^3, ..., g^6.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 7. Since 7 is a prime number, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 7. The only element with order 1 is the identity element e, so the order of g must be 7.\n\nThis means that the set {g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6} contains 6 distinct elements, and none of them can be equal to the identity element e. Therefore, the set {e, g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6} contains all 7 elements of G.\n\nSince every element in G can be expressed as a power of g, we can conclude that G is a cyclic group, generated by the element g."
