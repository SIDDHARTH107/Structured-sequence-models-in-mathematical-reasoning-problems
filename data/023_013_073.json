    "message_1": "What is the temperature distribution at any point in a one-dimensional rod of length 2 cm that has a uniform initial temperature of 20°C, and one end is kept at 0°C and the other end is maintained at 100°C for 10 minutes using the Fourier transform method? The thermal conductivity of the rod is 50 W/m•°C and the specific heat capacity is 500 J/kg•°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with the Fourier series method. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity, which is given by:\n\nα = k/(ρc)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity. We don't have the density given, but we can still proceed with the solution in terms of α.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\nT(0,t) = 0°C\nT(L,t) = 100°C\nT(x,0) = 20°C\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (0.02 m).\n\nWe can solve the heat conduction equation using the method of separation of variables. Let T(x,t) = X(x)T(t), then we have:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = αX(x)T'(t)\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(X''(x)/X(x)) = (T'(t)/αT(t))\n\nSince the left side is only a function of x and the right side is only a function of t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Then we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe second equation can be solved directly:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nThe first equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(L) = 0. The solution is:\n\nX(x) = Bsin(λx)\n\nwhere B is another constant. The boundary conditions give us:\n\nλn = nπ/L, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo the solution is a sum of the form:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [Ansin(λnx)e^(-αλn²t)]\n\nwhere An are constants to be determined from the initial condition T(x,0) = 20°C. We have:\n\n20 = Σ [Ansin(λnx)]\n\nWe can find An by multiplying both sides by sin(λmx) and integrating from 0 to L:\n\n∫₀ᴸ 20sin(λmx)dx = Σ [An∫₀ᴸ sin(λmx)sin(λnx)dx]\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\nAn = (2/L)∫₀ᴸ 20sin(λnx)dx\n\nNow we can find the temperature distribution T(x,t) at any point in the rod and any time t:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [(2/L)∫₀ᴸ 20sin(λnx)dx * sin(λnx)e^(-αλn²t)]\n\nThis is the general solution for the temperature distribution in the rod. To find the temperature distribution after 10 minutes, plug in t = 600 seconds and evaluate the series. Note that the series converges quickly, so you can truncate it after a few terms to get a good approximation."
