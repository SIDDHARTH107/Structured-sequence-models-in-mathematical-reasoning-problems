A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, the cut vertices are:\n- Vertex 1: Removing it disconnects vertices 2, 3, and 4 from the rest of the graph.\n- Vertex 5: Removing it disconnects vertices 6, 7, and 8 from the rest of the graph.\n\nThe bridges in the graph are:\n- Edge (1, 5): Removing it disconnects vertices 6, 7, and 8 from the rest of the graph.\n- Edge (1, 9): Removing it disconnects vertex 9 from the rest of the graph."
