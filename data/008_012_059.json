    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the inverse matrix method, we first need to write the given equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables, and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | -8 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted by A^(-1). To do this, we will first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant(A) = (3 * -5) - (2 * 4) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we will find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/Determinant(A)) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors. In this case:\n\nadjoint(A) = | -5 -2 |\n             | -4  3 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-23) * | -5 -2 |\n                  | -4  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/23  2/23 |\n         | 4/23 -3/23 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   |  5/23  2/23 |   | 11 |\n| y | = |  4/23 -3/23 | * | -8 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices:\n\nx = (5/23 * 11) + (2/23 * -8) = 55/23 - 16/23 = 39/23\ny = (4/23 * 11) + (-3/23 * -8) = 44/23 + 24/23 = 68/23\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 39/23\ny = 68/23"
