    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 20, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers with a difference of at least 20.\n\nThe prime gap of 20 occurs between the prime numbers 89 and 109. The difference between these two prime numbers is 109 - 89 = 20. Therefore, the smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 20 is 20."
