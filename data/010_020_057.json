What is the effective resistance between points A and B?\n\n```\n----[Resistor 1]----\n|                   |\n|                   |\n[Point A]         [Point B]\n|                   |\n|                   |\n----[Resistor 2]----\n```\n\nHint: Use Floer homology to find the effective resistance of the circuit.",
    "message_2": "Floer homology is not applicable to this problem, as it is a mathematical concept used in the study of symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology, not electrical circuits. To find the effective resistance between points A and B, we can use basic circuit analysis.\n\nIn this case, the circuit is very simple, and the two resistors are connected in parallel. The formula for the effective resistance (Req) of two resistors in parallel is:\n\nReq = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)\n\nSince both resistors have a resistance of 1 ohm, we can plug in the values:\n\nReq = (1 * 1) / (1 + 1)\nReq = 1 / 2\n\nThe effective resistance between points A and B is 0.5 ohms."
