    "message_2": "To solve the reaction-diffusion equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = 2X''(x)T(t) + (X(x)T(t) - (X(x)T(t))^3)$$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{2X''(x)}{X(x)} + 1 - (X(x)T(t))^2$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2$$\n$$\\frac{2X''(x)}{X(x)} + 1 - (X(x)T(t))^2 = -k^2$$\n\nNow, we have two separate ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $$T'(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$$\n2) $$2X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 1 - (X(x)T(t))^2$$\n\nThe first equation is a simple linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\n$$T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2t}$$\n\nThe second equation is a nonlinear ODE, and it is difficult to find an exact solution. However, we can use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(\\pi x)$ to find an approximate solution. Since $u(x,0) = X(x)T(0)$, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = \\frac{\\cos(\\pi x)}{C_1}$$\n\nNow, we can use the boundary conditions to find the value of $k$. Since the solution must be periodic in $x$, we have:\n\n$$X(0) = X(1) \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\cos(0)}{C_1} = \\frac{\\cos(\\pi)}{C_1} \\Rightarrow k = \\pi$$\n\nThus, the approximate solution is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = C_1 e^{-\\pi^2 t} \\cos(\\pi x)$$\n\nTo find the value of $C_1$, we can use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(\\pi x)$:\n\n$$C_1 e^{-\\pi^2 \\cdot 0} \\cos(\\pi x) = \\cos(\\pi x) \\Rightarrow C_1 = 1$$\n\nSo, the approximate solution is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = e^{-\\pi^2 t} \\cos(\\pi x)$$\n\nFinally, we can find the solution at $t=5$ and $x=0.5$:\n\n$$u(0.5, 5) = e^{-\\pi^2 \\cdot 5} \\cos(\\pi \\cdot 0.5) = e^{-25\\pi^2} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the approximate solution $u(x,t)$ at $t=5$ and $x=0.5$ is $0$."
