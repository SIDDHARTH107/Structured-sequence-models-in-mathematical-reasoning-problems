    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 5 cm and 7 cm, and an included angle of 45 degrees. What is the perimeter of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and C = 45 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\n45 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 0.7854 radians\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(0.7854)\nc² ≈ 25 + 49 - 70 * 0.7071\nc² ≈ 74 - 49.498\nc² ≈ 24.502\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √24.502 ≈ 4.95 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 5 + 7 + 4.95\nPerimeter ≈ 16.95 cm"
