    "message_2": "The sectional curvature of a cylinder is the curvature of a curve formed by the intersection of the cylinder's surface with a plane that contains the cylinder's axis. In this case, we are asked to find the sectional curvature at a point on the surface that is 3 cm away from the base.\n\nFirst, let's find the curve formed by the intersection of the cylinder's surface with a plane that contains the cylinder's axis and is 3 cm away from the base. This curve will be a circle with the same radius as the cylinder, which is 4 cm.\n\nThe curvature of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nCurvature (K) = 1 / Radius (R)\n\nIn this case, the radius of the circle is 4 cm. So, the sectional curvature of the cylinder at the given point is:\n\nK = 1 / 4\n\nK = 0.25 cm^(-1)\n\nTherefore, the sectional curvature of the cylinder at a point on the surface that is 3 cm away from the base is 0.25 cm^(-1)."
