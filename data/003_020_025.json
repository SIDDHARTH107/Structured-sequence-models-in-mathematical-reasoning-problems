    "message_2": "To find the distance between the person and the base of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (the height of the tower) and the adjacent side (the distance between the person and the base of the tower).\n\nLet's denote the distance between the person and the base of the tower as x. Then, we can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = (40 meters) / x\n\nSince the tangent of 60 degrees is equal to √3, we have:\n\n√3 = 40 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 40 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nx = (40 * √3) / (3)\n\nx ≈ 23.09 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the person and the base of the tower is approximately 23.09 meters."
