    "message_2": "To analyze the given function y = 2sin(3x + π/4), we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A*sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 2, so the amplitude is 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In this case, B = 3, so the period is (2π)/3.\n\n3. Phase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C in the general form. In this case, C = π/4. Since the term inside the sine function is positive, the phase shift is to the left by π/4 units.\n\nNow, let's find the x- and y-intercepts:\n\n4. x-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2sin(3x + π/4)\n\nsin(3x + π/4) = 0\n\n3x + π/4 = nπ, where n is an integer.\n\n3x = nπ - π/4\n\nx = (nπ - π/4) / 3\n\nThe x-intercepts occur at x = (nπ - π/4) / 3, where n is an integer.\n\n5. y-intercept: To find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2sin(3(0) + π/4)\n\ny = 2sin(π/4)\n\ny = 2*(√2/2)\n\ny = √2\n\nThe y-intercept occurs at the point (0, √2).\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, the phase shift is π/4 units to the left, the x-intercepts occur at x = (nπ - π/4) / 3 (where n is an integer), and the y-intercept is at the point (0, √2)."
