    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B, which require raw materials of varying quantities. Each unit of product A requires 3 units of material X, 4 units of material Y, and 5 units of material Z. Each unit of product B requires 2 units of material X, 5 units of material Y, and 7 units of material Z. The maximum amounts of raw materials in stock are 250 units of X, 200 units of Y, and 350 units of Z. If the profit from each unit of product A is $60 and from each unit of product B is $75, determine the optimal production quantities of each product that will maximize the total profit. Use artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is used to find the optimal solution to complex optimization problems. In this case, we will use the ABC algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B that maximize the total profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 60x + 75y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 250 (Material X constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 200 (Material Y constraint)\n5x + 7y ≤ 350 (Material Z constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo apply the ABC algorithm, we need to define the following parameters:\n\n1. Number of employed bees (n): This is the number of bees searching for food sources (solutions). We can set n = 50.\n2. Number of onlooker bees (m): This is the number of bees observing the employed bees and deciding to follow them based on their fitness. We can set m = 50.\n3. Maximum number of iterations (MaxIter): This is the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run. We can set MaxIter = 1000.\n\nNow, we will follow these steps to implement the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the objective function.\n3. Employed bees phase: Each employed bee searches for a new solution in the neighborhood of its current solution. If the new solution is better, it replaces the current solution.\n4. Onlooker bees phase: Each onlooker bee selects a solution based on its fitness (probability) and searches for a new solution in the neighborhood of the selected solution. If the new solution is better, it replaces the selected solution.\n5. Scout bees phase: If a solution is not improved for a certain number of iterations, it is abandoned, and a scout bee searches for a new random solution.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the optimal solution is found.\n\nAfter implementing the ABC algorithm, we will obtain the optimal production quantities of products A and B that maximize the total profit. Note that the actual implementation of the ABC algorithm requires programming knowledge and cannot be demonstrated in plain text."
