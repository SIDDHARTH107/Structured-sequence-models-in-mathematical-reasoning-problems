    "message_2": "To calculate the median, mean, and standard deviation of the given dataset, we will first find the median, then the mean, and finally the standard deviation.\n\n1. Median:\nThe median is the middle value of a dataset when the data is sorted in ascending order. Since there are 10 observations in the dataset, the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th observations.\n\n(20 + 24) / 2 = 22\n\nThe median of the dataset is 22.\n\n2. Mean:\nThe mean is the sum of all the observations divided by the number of observations.\n\n(4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 24 + 28 + 32 + 36 + 40) / 10 = 220 / 10 = 22\n\nThe mean of the dataset is 22.\n\n3. Standard Deviation:\nThe standard deviation is a measure of dispersion in the dataset. To calculate the standard deviation, we will first find the variance and then take the square root of the variance.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean (already calculated above as 22)\nStep 2: Subtract the mean from each observation and square the result\n(4-22)^2 = 324\n(8-22)^2 = 196\n(12-22)^2 = 100\n(16-22)^2 = 36\n(20-22)^2 = 4\n(24-22)^2 = 4\n(28-22)^2 = 36\n(32-22)^2 = 100\n(36-22)^2 = 196\n(40-22)^2 = 324\n\nStep 3: Calculate the mean of the squared differences\n(324 + 196 + 100 + 36 + 4 + 4 + 36 + 100 + 196 + 324) / 10 = 1320 / 10 = 132\n\nStep 4: Take the square root of the mean of the squared differences\n√132 ≈ 11.49\n\nThe standard deviation of the dataset is approximately 11.49.\n\nIn summary, the median is 22, the mean is 22, and the standard deviation is approximately 11.49."
