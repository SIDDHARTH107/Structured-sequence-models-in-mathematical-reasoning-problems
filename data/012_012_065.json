    "message_2": "To determine the girth of G, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices and minimum degree δ has girth at most 1 + ⌊(2(n-1))/δ⌋.\n\nIn this case, we have a connected graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges. The minimum degree δ of G can be found using the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\n2 * 15 = 30\n\nSince G is connected, the minimum degree δ must be at least 2. If δ = 2, then the sum of degrees would be 2 * 10 = 20, which is less than 30. Therefore, the minimum degree δ must be at least 3.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the girth:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 1 + ⌊(2(10-1))/3⌋ = 1 + ⌊(18)/3⌋ = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nSo, the girth of G is at most 7. However, we need to check if there exists a cycle of length less than 7 in G.\n\nConsider a graph with 10 vertices and minimum degree 3. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one vertex with degree at least 4. Let's call this vertex v. Since v has 4 neighbors, there must be at least one pair of neighbors that are connected by an edge, otherwise, we would have more than 15 edges in G. This forms a cycle of length 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of G is 3."
