    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to Wilson's theorem:\n\nIf p is a prime number and (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p, then what is the value of p?\n\nUsing Wilson's theorem, you can show that for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is always divisible by p. So, finding the value of p that satisfies this condition can be a good problem for the student to solve.",
    "message_2": "As per Wilson's theorem, for a prime number p, the following equation holds true:\n\n(p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n(p-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p)\n\nSince the given problem states that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p, it means that the above equation holds true. Therefore, any prime number p will satisfy this condition. There isn't a unique value for p, as it can be any prime number (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...)."
