    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 7\n2) 4x + 6y = 14\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (2x + 3y) = 14 - 7\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow we have the same equation as before. This means that the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Since they are the same line, they have infinitely many solutions, and the system is consistent. Any point on the line will satisfy both equations."
