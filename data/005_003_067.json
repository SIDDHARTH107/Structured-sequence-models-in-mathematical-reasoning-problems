    "message_1": "Suppose a company conducted a study to determine if there's a relationship between an employee's age and their salary. The results of the study showed that a linear regression model is appropriate, and the regression equation is 天 = 4000 + 100x, where 天 is the predicted salary and x is the age of the employee.\n\nWhat would be the predicted salary for an employee who is 35 years old, according to this regression model?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted salary for an employee who is 35 years old, we can plug the age (x) into the regression equation:\n\n天 = 4000 + 100x\n\nFor x = 35:\n\n天 = 4000 + 100(35) = 4000 + 3500 = 7500\n\nSo, the predicted salary for a 35-year-old employee would be $7,500."
