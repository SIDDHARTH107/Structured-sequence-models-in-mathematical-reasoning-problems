    "message_2": "Let's first find the angular velocity of the ferris wheel. Since it makes one complete revolution (360 degrees) every 40 seconds, we can calculate the angular velocity (ω) as follows:\n\nω = (360 degrees) / (40 seconds) = 9 degrees/second\n\nNow, after 25 seconds, we can find the angle (θ) the ferris wheel has rotated:\n\nθ = ω * time = 9 degrees/second * 25 seconds = 225 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the angle to find the height (h) above the ground. The height can be found using the sine function, as the height is the vertical component of the radius:\n\nh = radius * sin(θ)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 225 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) ≈ 3.93 radians\n\nNow, we can find the height:\n\nh = 20 meters * sin(3.93 radians) ≈ 20 meters * (-0.819) ≈ -16.38 meters\n\nSince the height is negative, it means the passenger is below the horizontal line passing through the center of the ferris wheel. To find the actual height above the ground, we need to add the radius of the ferris wheel:\n\nActual height = -16.38 meters + 20 meters = 3.62 meters\n\nSo, after 25 seconds, the passenger is approximately 3.62 meters above the ground."
