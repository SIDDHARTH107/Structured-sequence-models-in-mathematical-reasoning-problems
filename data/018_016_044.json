(A x B) U (B x A) (Union of the Cartesian products from parts 1 and 2)\n4.

    "message_2": "1. A x B (Cartesian product of A and B):\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\n2. B x A (Cartesian product of B and A):\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)}\n\n3. (A x B) U (B x A) (Union of the Cartesian products from parts 1 and 2):\n(A x B) U (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n4.

This contradicts the statement in the problem. The problem statement is incorrect."
