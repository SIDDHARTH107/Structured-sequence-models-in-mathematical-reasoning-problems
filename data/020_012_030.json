    "message_2": "To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function on the interval [0, 4], we need to first find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\n1. Find the derivative of the function f(x):\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\n2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the equation:\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\nx = 1, 3\n\nSo, we have two critical points: x = 1 and x = 3.\n\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\n4. Compare the function values to find the absolute maximum and minimum:\nThe absolute maximum value is 6, which occurs at x = 1 and x = 4.\nThe absolute minimum value is 2, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 3."
