    "message_1": "A fluid flow is described by the velocity profile u(y) = 3cos(5y) m/s, where y is the distance from the bottom wall of the fluid in meters. Calculate the maximum velocity of the fluid and the height of the fluid channel if the wavelength of the wave is λ = 0.4 m. Use Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum velocity of the fluid, we need to find the maximum value of the function u(y) = 3cos(5y). Since the maximum value of the cosine function is 1, the maximum velocity will be when cos(5y) = 1. Therefore, the maximum velocity is:\n\nu_max = 3 * 1 = 3 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the fluid channel. Given the wavelength λ = 0.4 m, we can find the relationship between the wavelength and the wave number k (which is the coefficient of y in the cosine function) using the formula:\n\nλ = 2π / k\n\nWe know that k = 5, so we can solve for λ:\n\n0.4 = 2π / 5\n5 * 0.4 = 2π\n2 = π\n\nThis means that the fluid channel has a half-wavelength within the given distance. To find the height of the fluid channel, we need to find the distance corresponding to a full wavelength. Since the height of the fluid channel corresponds to a full wavelength, we can find the height by doubling the given wavelength:\n\nHeight = 2 * λ = 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 m\n\nSo, the maximum velocity of the fluid is 3 m/s, and the height of the fluid channel is 0.8 m."
