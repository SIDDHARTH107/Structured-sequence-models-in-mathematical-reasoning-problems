    "message_1": "In a given ciphertext encrypted using a Vigenere cipher, the keyword used is  \"MATH\" and the length of the plaintext is 30 characters. If the frequency analysis method is used to break the cipher, how many occurrences of a single letter in the ciphertext would a cryptanalyst need to fully recover the keyword \"MATH\"?",
    "message_2": "To break the Vigenere cipher using frequency analysis, a cryptanalyst needs to analyze the ciphertext for repeating patterns that correspond to the keyword length. In this case, the keyword \"MATH\" has a length of 4. Since the plaintext has 30 characters, it can be divided into 4 groups based on the keyword length (i.e., every 4th character will be encrypted using the same letter of the keyword).\n\nFor each group, the cryptanalyst would need to analyze the frequency of the letters and compare it to the known frequency of letters in the language (e.g., English). To have a reasonable chance of identifying the correct letter for each group, the cryptanalyst would need a sufficient number of occurrences of a single letter in each group.\n\nAssuming the cryptanalyst needs at least 5 occurrences of a single letter in each group to have a reasonable chance of identifying the correct letter, they would need a total of 5 * 4 = 20 occurrences of a single letter in the ciphertext to fully recover the keyword \"MATH\"."
