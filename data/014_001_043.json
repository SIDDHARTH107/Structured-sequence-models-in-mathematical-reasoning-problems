    "message_2": "To encrypt a plaintext message \"1234\" using RSA encryption, we need to convert the message into an integer. Since the message is already a number, we can use it directly.\n\nNow, we use the public key (e = 3, n = 437) to encrypt the message:\n\nCiphertext = (Plaintext^e) mod n\nCiphertext = (1234^3) mod 437\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nCiphertext = 384\n\nSo, the ciphertext that results from encrypting the plaintext message \"1234\" is 384."
