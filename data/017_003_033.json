    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to Z_7, we need to show that there exists a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function φ: G → Z_7 such that φ(ab) = φ(a) + φ(b) (mod 7) for all a, b in G.\n\nSince |G| = 7 and 7 is prime, G is a cyclic group. Let g be a generator of G, i.e., G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6}, where e is the identity element of G. We can define the isomorphism φ: G → Z_7 as follows:\n\nφ(e) = 0\nφ(g) = 1\nφ(g^2) = 2\nφ(g^3) = 3\nφ(g^4) = 4\nφ(g^5) = 5\nφ(g^6) = 6\n\nNow, we need to show that φ is a homomorphism, i.e., φ(ab) = φ(a) + φ(b) (mod 7) for all a, b in G. Let a = g^i and b = g^j for some i, j in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Then, ab = g^(i+j). Thus,\n\nφ(ab) = φ(g^(i+j)) = (i + j) (mod 7).\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nφ(a) + φ(b) (mod 7) = φ(g^i) + φ(g^j) (mod 7) = i + j (mod 7).\n\nSince φ(ab) = φ(a) + φ(b) (mod 7) for all a, b in G, φ is a homomorphism.\n\nNow, we need to show that φ is a bijection. Since φ is defined on a finite set, it is enough to show that φ is either one-to-one or onto.\n\nLet's show that φ is one-to-one. Suppose φ(a) = φ(b) for some a, b in G. Then, a = g^i and b = g^j for some i, j in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and i = j (mod 7). Since 7 is prime, this implies that i = j, and hence a = b. Thus, φ is one-to-one.\n\nSince |G| = |Z_7| = 7, φ is also onto.\n\nTherefore, φ is a bijection, and G is isomorphic to Z_7."
