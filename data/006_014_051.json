    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (failures in this case) in n trials (components)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (failure) for each trial (component)\n- n is the number of trials (components)\n- k is the number of successes (failures) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 5 (5 components)\n- k = 2 (we want to find the probability of exactly 2 failures)\n- p = 0.1 (each component has a 0.1 probability of failure)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 2):\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 5! / (2!3!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)(3*2*1)) = 120 / (2*6) = 10\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * p^2 * (1-p)^(5-2) = 10 * (0.1)^2 * (0.9)^3 = 10 * 0.01 * 0.729 = 0.0729\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 5 components will fail in one day is 0.0729 or 7.29%."
