    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(x, y) = 2xy.\n2. Set the initial values: x0 = 0, y0 = 1, h = 0.1.\n3. Calculate the Runge-Kutta coefficients (k1, k2, k3, k4) for each iteration.\n4. Update the values of x and y using the Runge-Kutta formula.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the desired value of x is reached.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 0, y0 = 1\n\nk1 = h * f(x0, y0) = 0.1 * f(0, 1) = 0.1 * 2 * 0 * 1 = 0\nk2 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2) = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.05 * 1 = 0.01\nk3 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2) = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1.005) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.05 * 1.005 = 0.0101\nk4 = h * f(x0 + h, y0 + k3) = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.0101) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.1 * 1.0101 = 0.020202\n\ny1 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6 = 1 + (0 + 2*0.01 + 2*0.0101 + 0.020202) / 6 = 1.010101\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = 0.1, y1 = 1.010101\n\nk1 = h * f(x1, y1) = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.010101) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.1 * 1.010101 = 0.020202\nk2 = h * f(x1 + h/2, y1 + k1/2) = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.020202) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.15 * 1.020202 = 0.030606\nk3 = h * f(x1 + h/2, y1 + k2/2) = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.030606) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.15 * 1.030606 = 0.030909\nk4 = h * f(x1 + h, y1 + k3) = 0.1 * f(0.2, 1.040909) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.2 * 1.040909 = 0.041818\n\ny2 = y1 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6 = 1.010101 + (0.020202 + 2*0.030606 + 2*0.030909 + 0.041818) / 6 = 1.040404\n\nSo, the value of y(0.2) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with h = 0.1 is approximately y(0.2) â‰ˆ 1.040404."
