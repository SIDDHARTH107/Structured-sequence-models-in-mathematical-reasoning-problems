    "message_2": "First, let's convert the system of linear equations into an augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5 & 3 & | & 7 \\\\\n10 & 6 & | & 14.2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination. We'll start by dividing the first row by 5 to get a leading 1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0.6 & | & 1.4 \\\\\n10 & 6 & | & 14.2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we'll subtract 10 times the first row from the second row to eliminate the leading 10 in the second row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0.6 & | & 1.4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & | & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second row represents the equation $0x + 0y = 0$, which is always true and doesn't give us any new information. This means that we have an infinite number of solutions, and the system is dependent.\n\nSince the resulting matrix is not the identity matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}$, we cannot find a unique solution for the system. Instead, we can express the solution in terms of a free variable. From the first row, we have the equation $x + 0.6y = 1.4$. We can solve for x:\n\n$$\nx = 1.4 - 0.6y\n$$\n\nSo the solution to the system is given by:\n\n$$\nx = 1.4 - 0.6y, \\quad y \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$"
