    "message_1": "Consider a vector bundle $E \\to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. If $E$ is a rank 2 bundle, what is the Euler class of $E$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the Euler class of a rank 2 vector bundle $E \\to S^2$, we can use the fact that the Euler class is an element of the second cohomology group $H^2(S^2; \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $S^2$ has a simple cohomology ring, we know that $H^2(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the Euler class of $E$ can be represented by an integer.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the Euler class is related to the Euler number (also known as the Euler-Poincar√© characteristic) of the base space $S^2$. The Euler number of $S^2$ is given by $\\chi(S^2) = 2$. Since the rank of the vector bundle is 2, the Euler class of $E$ is simply twice the Euler number of the base space. Thus, the Euler class of the rank 2 vector bundle $E \\to S^2$ is $2 \\cdot \\chi(S^2) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$."
