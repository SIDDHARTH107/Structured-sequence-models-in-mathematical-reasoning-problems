    "message_2": "Proof that X is totally bounded:\n\nTo show that X is totally bounded, we need to show that for any given δ > 0, there exists a finite number of balls with radius δ that cover X.\n\nLet δ > 0. Since ε > 0, we can choose a positive integer k such that 1/k < ε/2 and δ > ε/2. Now, consider the collection of open balls with radius ε/2 centered at points in X, i.e., {B(x, ε/2) : x ∈ X}. Since X is compact, there exists a finite subcover of this collection, say {B(x1, ε/2), B(x2, ε/2), ..., B(xm, ε/2)}.\n\nNow, let's show that the balls with radius δ centered at the same points cover X. Consider an arbitrary point y ∈ X. Since {B(x1, ε/2), B(x2, ε/2), ..., B(xm, ε/2)} is an open cover of X, there exists an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) such that y ∈ B(xi, ε/2). Then, the distance between y and xi is less than ε/2.\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary point z ∈ B(y, δ). The distance between z and xi is at most d(z, y) + d(y, xi) < δ + ε/2 < ε. Thus, the diameter of the set {y, z} is less than ε, and by the given condition, this set is contained in some Ui. Since Ui is open, there exists a δ-ball centered at y, say B(y, δ), that is contained in Ui.\n\nTherefore, the collection {B(x1, δ), B(x2, δ), ..., B(xm, δ)} is a finite cover of X with δ-balls, which shows that X is totally bounded.\n\nProof that a compact metric space is sequentially compact:\n\nLet (x_n) be a sequence in the compact metric space X. Since X is totally bounded (as we just proved), for any positive integer N, there exists a finite cover of X with balls of radius 1/N. By the pigeonhole principle, there must exist an index i_N and a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that x_{n_k} ∈ B(x_{i_N}, 1/N) for infinitely many k.\n\nNow, consider the diagonal subsequence (x_{n_k_k}). This subsequence is contained in the balls B(x_{i_1}, 1), B(x_{i_2}, 1/2), B(x_{i_3}, 1/3), ... . Since the radii of these balls converge to 0, the sequence (x_{n_k_k}) is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nFinally, since X is compact, it is also complete (every Cauchy sequence in X converges to a point in X). Therefore, the Cauchy sequence (x_{n_k_k}) converges to a point in X, which means that the original sequence (x_n) has a convergent subsequence. This shows that X is sequentially compact."
