    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept(s) of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 9x^2 + 15x + 25, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 15x + 25\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (25) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±5, and ±25.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 5 is a root:\n\n0 = (5)^3 - 9(5)^2 + 15(5) + 25\n0 = 125 - 225 + 75 + 25\n0 = 0\n\nSo, x = 5 is a root, and we can now perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 - 9x^2 + 15x + 25) / (x - 5)\n\nThe result is:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 5\n\nNow, we can find the remaining roots by solving the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 20)) / 2\nx = (4 ± √36) / 2\nx = (4 ± 6) / 2\n\nThis gives us two more roots: x = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5 and x = (4 - 6) / 2 = -1.\n\nHowever, x = 5 is a repeated root, so the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation are x = 5 and x = -1."
