    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix, we first need to convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25). \n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nSince the key matrix is 2x2, we need to break the message into 2-letter blocks. In this case, we have the blocks \"MA\" and \"TH\". Now, we represent these blocks as column vectors:\n\nMA: |12| and TH: |19|\n    | 0|         | 7|\n\nNext, we multiply the key matrix by each of these column vectors:\n\nFor MA:\n[3 4] |12|   |3*12 + 4*0|   |36|\n[2 5] | 0| = |2*12 + 5*0| = |24|\n\nFor TH:\n[3 4] |19|   |3*19 + 4*7|   |85|\n[2 5] | 7| = |2*19 + 5*7| = |61|\n\nNow, we convert the resulting numbers back to letters (mod 26):\n\n36 mod 26 = 10 -> K\n24 mod 26 = 24 -> Y\n85 mod 26 = 7 -> H\n61 mod 26 = 9 -> J\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"KYHJ\"."
