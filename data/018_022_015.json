    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A Δ B with A and B, denoted as (A Δ B) × A and (A Δ B) × B.\n\n(A Δ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\n(A Δ B) × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A Δ B) × A and (A Δ B) × B.\n\n((A Δ B) × A) Δ ((A Δ B) × B) = {(1, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNotice that ((A Δ B) × A) Δ ((A Δ B) × B) ≠ (A × B) Δ (A Δ B), which means that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
