She wishes to conduct a factor analysis on the data to determine if there is a latent variable that underlies both height and weight. Using a statistical software, the analyst calculates the sample covariance matrix with the following results:\n\n    Variable   Height       Weight\n    Height     256.00       180.03\n    Weight     180.03       144.76\n\nWhat is the value of the sample correlation between height and weight?",
    "message_2": "To find the sample correlation between height and weight, we need to first calculate the sample standard deviations of height and weight using the variances given in the covariance matrix. The variances are the diagonal elements of the matrix: 256.00 for height and 144.76 for weight.\n\nSample standard deviation of height = √(variance of height) = √(256.00) = 16 cm\nSample standard deviation of weight = √(variance of weight) = √(144.76) = 12.03 kg\n\nNext, we use the covariance between height and weight, which is 180.03, and the sample standard deviations to calculate the sample correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = (covariance between height and weight) / (sample standard deviation of height * sample standard deviation of weight)\nr = 180.03 / (16 * 12.03)\nr ≈ 0.937\n\nThe value of the sample correlation between height and weight is approximately 0.937."
