    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the average length of a certain type of wire is 40 inches, with a standard deviation of 2.5 inches. A sample of 36 wires is selected at random and their average length is found to be 38.5 inches. Can we conclude, with a 95% level of confidence, that the true mean length of the wire is different from 40 inches?",
    "message_2": "To determine if we can conclude with a 95% level of confidence that the true mean length of the wire is different from 40 inches, we will perform a hypothesis test using a t-distribution.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 40 inches (the true mean length of the wire is 40 inches)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 40 inches (the true mean length of the wire is different from 40 inches)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nThe test statistic for a t-test is given by the formula:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / √n)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 38.5 inches, the population mean is 40 inches, the standard deviation is 2.5 inches, and the sample size is 36.\n\nt = (38.5 - 40) / (2.5 / √36)\nt = (-1.5) / (2.5 / 6)\nt = -1.5 / 0.4167\nt ≈ -3.6\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nFor a 95% level of confidence and a two-tailed test, the critical value for a t-distribution with 36 - 1 = 35 degrees of freedom can be found using a t-table or calculator. The critical values are approximately ±2.03.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value.\nSince the test statistic t ≈ -3.6 is less than the lower critical value of -2.03, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nWith a 95% level of confidence, we can conclude that the true mean length of the wire is different from 40 inches."
