    "message_1": "A message needs to be digitally signed by Alice using RSA algorithm with a private key exponent of 17 and a modulus of 3233. The message produces a hash value of 2533. What is the digital signature that Alice creates for the message?",
    "message_2": "To create a digital signature using the RSA algorithm, Alice needs to raise the hash value (H) to the power of her private key exponent (d) and then take the modulus with respect to her modulus (n). In this case, H = 2533, d = 17, and n = 3233.\n\nThe formula for the digital signature (S) is:\n\nS ≡ H^d (mod n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS ≡ 2533^17 (mod 3233)\n\nTo compute this, we can use the modular exponentiation technique:\n\n1. Calculate the binary representation of the exponent (17): 10001\n2. Perform a series of squaring and multiplying operations based on the binary representation:\n\n   - Start with the base (2533) and square it, then take the modulus with respect to 3233:\n     2533^2 ≡ 640139 (mod 3233) ≡ 855\n\n   - Since the second bit of the binary representation is 0, we only need to square the result:\n     855^2 ≡ 730725 (mod 3233) ≡ 3105\n\n   - The third bit is also 0, so we square the result again:\n     3105^2 ≡ 9641025 (mod 3233) ≡ 1808\n\n   - The fourth bit is also 0, so we square the result again:\n     1808^2 ≡ 3267264 (mod 3233) ≡ 3134\n\n   - The last bit is 1, so we square the result and multiply it by the base, then take the modulus:\n     (3134^2 * 2533) ≡ 31005956 (mod 3233) ≡ 2201\n\nSo, the digital signature S is 2201."
