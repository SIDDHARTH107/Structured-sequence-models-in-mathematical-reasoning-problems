    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one car accident occurring during the next 6 months, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accidents occurring in a given month is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no accidents to occur during the next 6 months, this has to happen for each of the 6 months. The probability of this happening is 0.95^6.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one accident occurring by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - P(no accidents)\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - 0.95^6\nP(at least one accident) ≈ 1 - 0.7351\nP(at least one accident) ≈ 0.2649\n\nSo, the probability of at least one car accident occurring at this intersection during the next 6 months is approximately 0.2649 or 26.49%."
