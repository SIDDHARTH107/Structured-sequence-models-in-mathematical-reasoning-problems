Antiderivative of 3x^2:\nn = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of 2x:\nn = 1, so the antiderivative is (2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (2x^2)/2 = x^2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of 1:\nn = 0, so the antiderivative is (1x^(0+1))/(0+1) = x.\n\nNow, we add the antiderivatives of each term together and include the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + C."
