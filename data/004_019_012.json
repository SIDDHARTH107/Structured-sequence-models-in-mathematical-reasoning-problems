    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the initial and final speeds from km/hr to m/s.\n\nInitial speed (u) = 60 km/hr * 0.2778 m/s = 16.668 m/s\nFinal speed (v) = 80 km/hr * 0.2778 m/s = 22.224 m/s\n\nThe time taken (t) for the acceleration is given as 10 seconds.\n\nWe can use the formula for acceleration (a) in uniformly accelerated motion:\n\na = (v - u) / t\n\na = (22.224 m/s - 16.668 m/s) / 10 s\n\na = 5.556 m/s / 10 s\n\na = 0.5556 m/s²\n\nThe car's acceleration is 0.5556 m/s²."
