    "message_2": "First, let's find (AxB) U (BxA):\n\nAxB = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\nBxA = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\n(AxB) U (BxA) = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nNow let's find (A U B) x (A U B):\n\nA U B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n(A U B) x (A U B) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n\nNow we can compare (AxB) U (BxA) and (A U B) x (A U B):\n\n(AxB) U (BxA) = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\n(A U B) x (A U B) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n\nAs we can see, the two sets are not equal. (AxB) U (BxA) has 12 elements, while (A U B) x (A U B) has 25 elements. Additionally, (A U B) x (A U B) contains elements with the same first and second components (e.g., (1,1), (2,2), etc.), which are not present in (AxB) U (BxA). Therefore, (AxB) U (BxA) and (A U B) x (A U B) are not equal."
