    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the data set in ascending order: 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27.\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3).\n\nThe median (Q2) is the average of the two middle values: (15 + 18) / 2 = 16.5.\n\nThe lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the data: (12 + 13) / 2 = 12.5.\n\nThe upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the data: (22 + 25) / 2 = 23.5.\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 23.5 - 12.5 = 11.\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the 1.5*IQR rule:\n\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 12.5 - 1.5 * 11 = -3.5\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 23.5 + 1.5 * 11 = 39.5\n\nNow we check if there are any values in the data set that are below the lower bound or above the upper bound:\n\n10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27\n\nAll values are within the range of -3.5 to 39.5, so there are no outliers in the data set using the 1.5*IQR rule."
