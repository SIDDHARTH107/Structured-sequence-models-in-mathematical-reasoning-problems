    "message_2": "To determine the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, we can use the formula:\n\nwavelength (λ) = c / f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in free space (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency of the wave.\n\nGiven the frequency f = 5 GHz = 5 x 10^9 Hz, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (5 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.06 m\n\nNow, to determine the magnitude of the B-field amplitude, we can use the formula:\n\nB = E / c\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field amplitude, E is the electric field amplitude, and c is the speed of light in free space.\n\nGiven the E-field amplitude E = 10 V/m, we can calculate the B-field amplitude:\n\nB = (10 V/m) / (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 3.333 x 10^-8 T\n\nSo, the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is 0.06 m, and the corresponding magnitude of the B-field amplitude is 3.333 x 10^-8 T."
