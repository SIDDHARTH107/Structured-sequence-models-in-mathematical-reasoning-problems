    "message_2": "The union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, the union of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}\n\nNow, to show that the union of A and B is a superset of both sets A and B, we need to prove that every element in A and B is also in A ∪ B.\n\nFor set A:\n- 2 is in A and 2 is in A ∪ B\n- 4 is in A and 4 is in A ∪ B\n- 6 is in A and 6 is in A ∪ B\n\nFor set B:\n- 3 is in B and 3 is in A ∪ B\n- 6 is in B and 6 is in A ∪ B\n- 9 is in B and 9 is in A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of sets A and B are in the union A ∪ B, we can conclude that the union of A and B is a superset of both sets A and B."
