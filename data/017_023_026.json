    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the prime factorization of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(a-1) * (p^a - 1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q^b - 1))\n\nwhere n(G) is the number of groups of order G, p and q are prime factors, and a and b are their respective powers in the prime factorization.\n\nFor our case, p = 2, a = 3, q = 3, and b = 2.\n\nn(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1)) * (3^(2-1) * (3^2 - 1))\nn(G) = (2^2 * 7) * (3^1 * 8)\nn(G) = (4 * 7) * (3 * 8)\nn(G) = 28 * 24\nn(G) = 672\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of abelian groups of order 72 from this total. There are three abelian groups of order 72: Z_72, Z_2 x Z_36, and Z_4 x Z_18.\n\nSo, the number of non-abelian groups of order 72 is:\n\n672 - 3 = 669\n\nNow, let's provide an example of a non-abelian group of order 72. One such group is the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_8, denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_8. This group is non-abelian because the semidirect product of two non-trivial groups is non-abelian if and only if the action of one group on the other is non-trivial. In this case, the action of Z_8 on Z_9 is non-trivial, making the semidirect product non-abelian."
