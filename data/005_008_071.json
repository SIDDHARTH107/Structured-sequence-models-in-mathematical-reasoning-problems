    "message_2": "a) To forecast the number of monthly sales for January of the next year, we can use the simple linear regression method. First, we need to find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the regression line.\n\nLet's assign numerical values to the months: Jan = 1, Feb = 2, ..., Dec = 12.\n\nThe slope (b) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nb = (n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)\n\nwhere n is the number of data points (months), x is the month number, and y is the number of sales.\n\nThe y-intercept (a) can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = (Σy - b * Σx) / n\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\nΣx = 1 + 2 + ... + 12 = 78\nΣy = 120 + 100 + ... + 200 = 1695\nΣ(xy) = 1*120 + 2*100 + ... + 12*200 = 13770\nΣ(x^2) = 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 12^2 = 650\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a):\n\nb = (12 * 13770 - 78 * 1695) / (12 * 650 - 78^2) = 7.42\na = (1695 - 7.42 * 78) / 12 = 97.25\n\nNow, we can forecast the number of monthly sales for January of the next year (month 13):\n\nSales(13) = a + b * 13 = 97.25 + 7.42 * 13 = 193.71 ≈ 194\n\nSo, the forecasted number of monthly sales for January of the next year is 194.\n\nb) To calculate the seasonal index for the month of December, we need to find the average sales for all months and then divide the sales of December by the average sales.\n\nAverage sales = Σy / n = 1695 / 12 = 141.25\n\nSeasonal index (December) = Sales(December) / Average sales = 200 / 141.25 = 1.415\n\nThe seasonal index for the month of December is 1.415.\n\nc) To calculate the moving average for a window of 3 months, we will average the sales for each 3-month period and plot the series.\n\nMoving average (Jan-Mar) = (120 + 100 + 135) / 3 = 118.33\nMoving average (Feb-Apr) = (100 + 135 + 115) / 3 = 116.67\nMoving average (Mar-May) = (135 + 115 + 125) / 3 = 125\nMoving average (Apr-Jun) = (115 + 125 + 140) / 3 = 126.67\nMoving average (May-Jul) = (125 + 140 + 150) / 3 = 138.33\nMoving average (Jun-Aug) = (140 + 150 + 170) / 3 = 153.33\nMoving average (Jul-Sep) = (150 + 170 + 160) / 3 = 160\nMoving average (Aug-Oct) = (170 + 160 + 180) / 3 = 170\nMoving average (Sep-Nov) = (160 + 180 + 190) / 3 = 176.67\nMoving average (Oct-Dec) = (180 + 190 + 200) / 3 = 190\n\nPlotting the moving average series:\n\n| Month      | Moving Average |\n|------------|----------------|\n| Jan-Mar    | 118.33         |\n| Feb-Apr    | 116.67         |\n| Mar-May    | 125            |\n| Apr-Jun    | 126.67         |\n| May-Jul    | 138.33         |\n| Jun-Aug    | 153.33         |\n| Jul-Sep    | 160            |\n| Aug-Oct    | 170            |\n| Sep-Nov    | 176.67         |\n| Oct-Dec    | 190            |"
