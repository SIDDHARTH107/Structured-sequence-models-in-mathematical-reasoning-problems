    "message_2": "To find all the points with integer coordinates on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3 over the field with 11 elements, we will plug in all the possible x values (0 to 10) and check if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation.\n\n1. For x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 2*0 + 3\ny^2 = 3\nThere are no integer solutions for y in the field with 11 elements.\n\n2. For x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 2*1 + 3\ny^2 = 6\nThere are no integer solutions for y in the field with 11 elements.\n\n3. For x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 2*2 + 3\ny^2 = 15 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = ±2 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (2, 2) and (2, 9).\n\n4. For x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 2*3 + 3\ny^2 = 36 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\nThere are no integer solutions for y in the field with 11 elements.\n\n5. For x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 2*4 + 3\ny^2 = 75 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\ny = ±3 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (4, 3) and (4, 8).\n\n6. For x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 2*5 + 3\ny^2 = 133 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\ny = ±1 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (5, 1) and (5, 10).\n\n7. For x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 2*6 + 3\ny^2 = 225 ≡ 0 (mod 11)\ny = 0 (mod 11)\nSo, the point is (6, 0).\n\n8. For x = 7:\ny^2 = 7^3 + 2*7 + 3\ny^2 = 357 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\nThere are no integer solutions for y in the field with 11 elements.\n\n9. For x = 8:\ny^2 = 8^3 + 2*8 + 3\ny^2 = 531 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\ny = ±2 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (8, 2) and (8, 9).\n\n10. For x = 9:\ny^2 = 9^3 + 2*9 + 3\ny^2 = 747 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\nThere are no integer solutions for y in the field with 11 elements.\n\n11. For x = 10:\ny^2 = 10^3 + 2*10 + 3\ny^2 = 1003 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\ny = ±1 (mod 11)\nSo, the points are (10, 1) and (10, 10).\n\nThus, the points with integer coordinates on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3 over the field with 11 elements are:\n\n(2, 2), (2, 9), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 10), (6, 0), (8, 2), (8, 9), (10, 1), and (10, 10)."
