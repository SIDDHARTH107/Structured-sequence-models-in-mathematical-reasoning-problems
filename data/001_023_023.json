    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin²x + 4sinx - 4 = 0, we can first factor the equation:\n\n2(sin²x + 2sinx - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can use substitution to make the equation look like a quadratic equation. Let y = sinx, then the equation becomes:\n\n2(y² + 2y - 2) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny² + 2y - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for y:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -2:\n\ny = (-2 ± √(2² - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\ny = (-2 ± √(4 + 8)) / 2\ny = (-2 ± √12) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (-2 + √12) / 2\ny2 = (-2 - √12) / 2\n\nRecall that y = sinx, so we need to find the values of x for which sinx = y1 and sinx = y2. We can use the arcsin (inverse sine) function for this:\n\nx1 = arcsin(y1) = arcsin((-2 + √12) / 2)\nx2 = arcsin(y2) = arcsin((-2 - √12) / 2)\n\nHowever, since x is between 0 and 360 degrees, we need to consider all possible angles that have the same sine values. For sine, this means we should also consider the supplementary angles:\n\nx1' = 180 - x1\nx2' = 180 - x2\n\nNow, we need to calculate the values of x1, x1', x2, and x2' and check if they are within the given range of 0 to 360 degrees:\n\nx1 ≈ arcsin((-2 + √12) / 2) ≈ 23.07°\nx1' ≈ 180 - 23.07 ≈ 156.93°\nx2 ≈ arcsin((-2 - √12) / 2) is not a valid angle since the value inside the arcsin is not within the range of -1 to 1.\n\nSo, the solutions for x within the range of 0 to 360 degrees are:\n\nx ≈ 23.07° and x ≈ 156.93°"
