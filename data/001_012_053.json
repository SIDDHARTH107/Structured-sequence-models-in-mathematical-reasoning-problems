    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common factor of 3x from the numerator:\n\n(6x^3 + 9x^2 + 3x) / (3x) = 3x(2x^2 + 3x + 1) / 3x\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor of 3x from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n3x(2x^2 + 3x + 1) / 3x = (2x^2 + 3x + 1)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression in lowest terms is:\n\n2x^2 + 3x + 1"
