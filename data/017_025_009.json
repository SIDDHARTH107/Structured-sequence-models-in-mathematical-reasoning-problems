    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorems, we know the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime p dividing the order of G. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\n1. For p = 2, we have n_2 | 3 * 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. For p = 3, we have n_3 | 2^3 * 5 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). We are given that n_3 = 4.\n3. For p = 5, we have n_5 | 2^3 * 3 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\nCase 1: G is a cyclic group of order 120.\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to C120, and we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not a cyclic group.\nIn this case, we know that G has a non-trivial Sylow 2-subgroup, a non-trivial Sylow 3-subgroup, and a non-trivial Sylow 5-subgroup. Let P_2, P_3, and P_5 be Sylow 2, 3, and 5-subgroups of G, respectively.\n\nSince n_3 = 4, by Sylow's Theorem, there exists a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3, in G. Thus, G has a subgroup of order 3, and by Cauchy's Theorem, G has an element of order 3. Let x be an element of order 3 in G.\n\nSimilarly, since n_5 can be 1 or 6, G has a subgroup of order 5, and by Cauchy's Theorem, G has an element of order 5. Let y be an element of order 5 in G.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by x and y, i.e., H = ⟨x, y⟩. Since x and y have relatively prime orders, xy has order 15, and H is a subgroup of order 15. Moreover, since G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, G has a subgroup of index 2, which is normal in G. Let K be a subgroup of G with index 2.\n\nNow, consider the semi-direct product of H and K, denoted by H ⋊ K. The order of H ⋊ K is |H| * |K| = 15 * 8 = 120, which is the same as the order of G. Thus, G is isomorphic to H ⋊ K.\n\nWe have two possibilities for the structure of H ⋊ K:\n\n1. H ⋊ K is isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2. In this case, we are done.\n2. H ⋊ K is not isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2. In this case, G is one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120."
