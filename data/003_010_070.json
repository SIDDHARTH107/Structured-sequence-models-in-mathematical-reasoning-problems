    "message_1": "A flagpole is standing vertically on the ground. The angle of elevation from a point on the ground to the top of the flagpole is 35 degrees. If the distance between the point on the ground and the base of the flagpole is 30 meters, what is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = (height of flagpole) / (distance from point to flagpole)\n\nWe are given the angle of elevation (35 degrees) and the distance from the point to the flagpole (30 meters). We can plug these values into the equation and solve for the height of the flagpole:\n\ntan(35) = (height of flagpole) / 30\n\nTo find the height of the flagpole, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\n30 * tan(35) = height of flagpole\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 35 degrees:\n\ntan(35) ≈ 0.7002\n\nNow, multiply this value by 30:\n\n30 * 0.7002 ≈ 21.006\n\nTherefore, the height of the flagpole is approximately 21.006 meters."
