    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we can add the first and third equations together:\n\nx + 2y - z = 0\n2x + y - z = 0\n-------------------\n3x + 3y = 0\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by dividing by 3:\n\nx + y = 0\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n2(x + 2y - z) = 2(0)\n3x - 4y + 2z = 0\n-------------------\n2x + 4y - 2z = 0\n3x - 4y + 2z = 0\n-------------------\n5x = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n5x = 0\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the equation x + y = 0:\n\n0 + y = 0\ny = 0\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of x and y back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. Let's use the first equation:\n\nx + 2y - z = 0\n0 + 2(0) - z = 0\n-z = 0\nz = 0\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
