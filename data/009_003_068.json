    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to Heat Transfer and Diffusion Equations:\n\nA metal plate has a thickness of 2 cm and its initial temperature is 100°C. One side of the plate is kept at a constant 200°C temperature, whereas the other side is insulated. Using the heat transfer equation and assuming that the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 cm2/sec, find the temperature distribution in the plate after 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the plate after 10 seconds, we can use the one-dimensional heat transfer equation, also known as the one-dimensional unsteady-state heat conduction equation. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere:\n∂T/∂t is the rate of change of temperature with respect to time,\nα is the thermal diffusivity (0.1 cm²/s),\n∂²T/∂x² is the second derivative of temperature with respect to the spatial coordinate x.\n\nSince the problem involves an insulated side, we need to consider the boundary conditions. Let x = 0 be the side with a constant temperature of 200°C, and x = L be the insulated side (L = 2 cm). The boundary conditions are:\n\n1. T(0, t) = 200°C (constant temperature at x = 0)\n2. ∂T/∂x (L, t) = 0 (insulated side, no heat flux at x = L)\n\nThe initial condition is T(x, 0) = 100°C for 0 < x < L.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form T(x, t) = X(x) * Θ(t). Substituting this into the heat transfer equation and dividing by T(x, t) gives:\n\n(1/Θ) * dΘ/dt = (α/X) * d²X/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\ndΘ/dt = -λ²αΘ\nd²X/dx² = -λ²X\n\nThe first equation can be solved directly, giving Θ(t) = C1 * exp(-λ²αt), where C1 is a constant.\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = 200 and dX/dx(L) = 0. The solution is given by:\n\nX(x) = C2 * cosh(λx) + C3 * sinh(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nC2 = 200\nC3 = -200/ sinh(λL)\n\nThe general solution is given by the sum of the product of X(x) and Θ(t) for all possible eigenvalues λ:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [200 * cosh(λx) - (200/ sinh(λL)) * sinh(λx)] * exp(-λ²αt)\n\nTo satisfy the initial condition, we need to find the Fourier series of the initial temperature distribution:\n\n100 = Σ [200 * cosh(λx) - (200/ sinh(λL)) * sinh(λx)]\n\nUnfortunately, finding the eigenvalues λ and the coefficients for the Fourier series is not straightforward and requires numerical methods. However, once these are found, the temperature distribution T(x, t) can be determined for any time t, including t = 10 seconds."
