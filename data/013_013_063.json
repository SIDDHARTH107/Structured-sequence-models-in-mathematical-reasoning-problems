    "message_1": "Suppose there are four bidders participating in an auction for a painting. Each bidder has an independent private valuation for the painting, drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 100]. The auction follows a first-price sealed-bid format, in which bidders submit their bids simultaneously and the highest bidder wins the painting at a price equal to their bid. If the bidding is tied, the painting is awarded to one of the bidders at random. \n\nWhat is the expected revenue from this auction format?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected revenue from this auction format, we need to determine the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder and then calculate the expected revenue based on those strategies.\n\nIn a first-price sealed-bid auction, the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is to shade their bid below their true valuation. In this case, with four bidders and a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 100], the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder can be derived as follows:\n\nLet V be the true valuation of a bidder, and B be their bid. The bidder wants to maximize their expected utility, which is given by the probability of winning the auction multiplied by the difference between their valuation and their bid:\n\nExpected Utility = P(win) * (V - B)\n\nThe probability of winning the auction is the probability that all other bidders submit a lower bid:\n\nP(win) = P(B1 < B, B2 < B, B3 < B)\n\nSince the bidders' valuations are drawn from a uniform distribution, the probability that a bidder with valuation V_i submits a bid lower than B is B/V_i. Therefore, the probability of winning the auction is:\n\nP(win) = (B/V1) * (B/V2) * (B/V3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expected utility equation:\n\nExpected Utility = [(B/V1) * (B/V2) * (B/V3)] * (V - B)\n\nTo find the optimal bidding strategy, we differentiate the expected utility with respect to B and set the result equal to zero:\n\nd(Expected Utility)/dB = 0\n\nSolving this equation, we find that the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is:\n\nB = V * (n - 1) / n\n\nwhere n is the number of bidders, which is 4 in this case. So the optimal bidding strategy is:\n\nB = V * (4 - 1) / 4 = (3/4) * V\n\nNow that we have the optimal bidding strategy, we can calculate the expected revenue. The expected revenue is the expected value of the highest bid, which is the maximum of the four bidders' bids. Since the bidders' valuations are uniformly distributed, the expected value of the highest bid can be calculated as:\n\nExpected Revenue = ∫∫∫∫ max(B1, B2, B3, B4) * f(V1) * f(V2) * f(V3) * f(V4) dV1 dV2 dV3 dV4\n\nwhere f(V) is the probability density function of the uniform distribution, which is 1/100 for all V in the interval [0, 100]. \n\nCalculating this integral is quite complex, but the result can be found in the literature:\n\nExpected Revenue ≈ 0.6 * (100)\n\nwhere 0.6 is an approximation of the expected value of the highest order statistic for four uniformly distributed variables.\n\nSo the expected revenue from this auction format is approximately:\n\nExpected Revenue ≈ 60"
