    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x - 3| + 4, we first need to determine the axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry for an absolute value equation is the vertical line that passes through the vertex. \n\nFor the given equation, we can rewrite it as y = |2(x - 3/2)| + 4. The axis of symmetry is x = 3/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinate of the vertex. To do this, we can substitute the x-coordinate (3/2) back into the equation:\n\ny = |2(3/2 - 3/2)| + 4\ny = |2(0)| + 4\ny = 0 + 4\ny = 4\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x - 3| + 4 is (3/2, 4)."
