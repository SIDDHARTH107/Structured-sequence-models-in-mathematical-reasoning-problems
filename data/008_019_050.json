    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can follow the same steps as we would for a system with real coefficients. First, we can eliminate one of the variables by multiplying one of the equations by a constant and then adding/subtracting the equations. In this case, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to match the coefficients of x in both equations:\n\n(2)(2x + 3yi) = (2)(7 + 4i)\n4x + 6yi = 14 + 8i\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x + 6yi = 14 + 8i\n4x - 6yi = -6 - 8i\n\nWe can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x + 6yi) + (4x - 6yi) = (14 + 8i) + (-6 - 8i)\n8x = 8\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of y:\n\n2x + 3yi = 7 + 4i\n2(1) + 3yi = 7 + 4i\n2 + 3yi = 7 + 4i\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n3yi = 5 + 4i\n\nDivide by 3i:\n\ny = (5 + 4i) / (3i)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary number in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is -3i:\n\ny = ((5 + 4i) / (3i)) * ((-3i) / (-3i))\ny = (-15i - 12i^2) / 9\ny = (-15i - 12(-1)) / 9\ny = (-15i + 12) / 9\n\nNow we can simplify:\n\ny = (12 - 15i) / 9\ny = 4/3 - 5i/3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 1\ny = 4/3 - 5i/3"
