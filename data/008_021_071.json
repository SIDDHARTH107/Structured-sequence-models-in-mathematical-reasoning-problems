    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods and determinants, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 1  2  3 |\n    | 3  4  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    |  7 |\n    | 13 |\n\nNow, we will find the determinant of matrix A, denoted as |A|.\n\n|A| = 2(2*5 - 4*3) - 3(1*5 - 3*3) + 4(1*4 - 2*3)\n    = 2(-2) - 3(-4) + 4(1)\n    = -4 + 12 + 4\n    = 12\n\nSince |A| â‰  0, the system of linear equations has a unique solution. We can now use Cramer's rule to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nLet A_x be the matrix obtained by replacing the first column of A with B:\n\nA_x = | 10  3  4 |\n      |  7  2  3 |\n      | 13  4  5 |\n\n|A_x| = 10(2*5 - 4*3) - 3(7*5 - 3*13) + 4(7*4 - 2*13)\n      = 10(-2) - 3(1) + 4(1)\n      = -20 - 3 + 4\n      = -19\n\nNow, let A_y be the matrix obtained by replacing the second column of A with B:\n\nA_y = | 2  10  4 |\n      | 1   7  3 |\n      | 3  13  5 |\n\n|A_y| = 2(7*5 - 3*13) - 10(1*5 - 3*3) + 4(1*13 - 7*3)\n      = 2(-4) - 10(-4) + 4(1)\n      = -8 + 40 + 4\n      = 36\n\nFinally, let A_z be the matrix obtained by replacing the third column of A with B:\n\nA_z = | 2  3  10 |\n      | 1  2   7 |\n      | 3  4  13 |\n\n|A_z| = 2(2*13 - 4*7) - 3(1*13 - 7*3) + 10(1*4 - 2*3)\n      = 2(-6) - 3(-4) + 10(-2)\n      = -12 + 12 - 20\n      = -20\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = |A_x| / |A| = -19 / 12\ny = |A_y| / |A| = 36 / 12 = 3\nz = |A_z| / |A| = -20 / 12 = -5/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -19/12\ny = 3\nz = -5/3"
