Use Bezout's theorem to solve the problem.\"",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two plane curves with no common components is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity.\n\nIn this problem, we are given two plane curves C and D with degrees 3 and 4 respectively. Since they are not nested and have no common components, we can apply Bezout's theorem to find the number of intersection points.\n\nThe number of intersection points is equal to the product of the degrees of the two curves:\n\nNumber of intersection points = degree of C × degree of D\nNumber of intersection points = 3 × 4\nNumber of intersection points = 12\n\nSo, the two plane curves C and D have 12 intersection points."
