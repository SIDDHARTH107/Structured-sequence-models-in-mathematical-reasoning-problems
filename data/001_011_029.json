    "message_2": "To solve the equation (4/x) + (3/x^2) = 5, we first find a common denominator for the two fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x^2. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(4x/x^2) + (3/x^2) = 5\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions:\n\n(4x + 3)/x^2 = 5\n\nNext, we can get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by x^2:\n\n(4x + 3) = 5x^2\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. To solve it, we set it equal to zero:\n\n5x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = -4, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(5)(-3))) / (2(5))\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 60)) / 10\n\nx = (4 ± √76) / 10\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (4 + √76) / 10\nx = (4 - √76) / 10\n\nThese are the two solutions for x in the given equation."
