    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms, which is 3x:\n\n3x(2x^2 - x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials that multiply to the given quadratic expression:\n\n(2x^2 - x - 2)\n\nTo do this, we need to find two numbers that multiply to the product of the leading coefficient (2) and the constant term (-2), which is -4, and add up to the middle coefficient (-1).\n\nThe two numbers that fit these conditions are -2 and 2. Now, we can rewrite the middle term using these two numbers:\n\n2x^2 - 2x + 2x - 2\n\nNext, we can use factoring by grouping:\n\n2x(x - 1) + 2(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common binomial factor (x - 1):\n\n(2x + 2)(x - 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n3x(2x + 2)(x - 1)"
