    "message_1": "Suppose that you have two bags of marbles, bag A and bag B. Bag A has 6 blue marbles and 4 red marbles, while bag B has 3 blue marbles and 7 red marbles. You draw a marble from one of the bags at random, and it turns out to be blue. What is the probability that the marble came from bag A, given that it is blue?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that the marble came from bag A (event A) given that it is blue (event B). \n\nFirst, we need to find the probabilities of each event:\n\n1. P(A): The probability of choosing bag A is 1/2 since there are two bags.\n2. P(B|A): The probability of drawing a blue marble from bag A is 6/10 (6 blue marbles out of 10 total marbles in bag A).\n3. P(B): The probability of drawing a blue marble from either bag. We can find this by considering the probability of drawing a blue marble from each bag and summing them up:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')\n\nHere, A' represents choosing bag B.\n\nP(B|A') = 3/10 (3 blue marbles out of 10 total marbles in bag B)\n\nSo, P(B) = (6/10) * (1/2) + (3/10) * (1/2) = (6 + 3) / 20 = 9/20\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A|B) = (6/10) * (1/2) / (9/20) = (6/10) * (1/2) * (20/9) = 6/9 = 2/3\n\nSo, the probability that the blue marble came from bag A is 2/3 or approximately 0.67."
