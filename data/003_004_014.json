    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin²x - 3cosx = 0, we can use the Pythagorean identity sin²x + cos²x = 1. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in terms of sinx and cosx:\n\n2sin²x - 3cosx = 0\n\nNow, let's express sin²x in terms of cosx using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin²x = 1 - cos²x\n\nSubstitute this into the original equation:\n\n2(1 - cos²x) - 3cosx = 0\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n2 - 2cos²x - 3cosx = 0\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n2cos²x + 3cosx - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in terms of cosx. Let's solve for cosx using the quadratic formula:\n\ncosx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -2:\n\ncosx = (-3 ± √(3² - 4(2)(-2))) / (2(2))\n\ncosx = (-3 ± √(9 + 16)) / 4\n\ncosx = (-3 ± √25) / 4\n\ncosx = (-3 ± 5) / 4\n\nWe have two possible solutions for cosx:\n\ncosx = (2 / 4) = 1/2\ncosx = (-8 / 4) = -2\n\nHowever, the second solution, cosx = -2, is not possible since the range of cosx is between -1 and 1. Therefore, we only consider the first solution:\n\ncosx = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the angles x between 0 and 360 degrees that satisfy this equation:\n\nx = arccos(1/2)\n\nThere are two angles in the given range:\n\nx = 60 degrees\nx = 360 - 60 = 300 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = 60 degrees and x = 300 degrees."
