    "message_1": "Here's a stochastic optimization problem for a math student:\n\nSuppose you are tasked with minimizing the expected cost of producing a certain product over a year. The cost of producing a single unit of the product fluctuates according to a stochastic process, modeled by the following formula:\n\nC_t = 10 + 2W_t\n\nwhere C_t is the cost of producing a unit at time t, and W_t is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nThere is also a fixed cost of production of $100 per year.\n\nAssuming that you can choose the production level for each unit of time, what is the optimal production level for each time that minimizes the expected cost over the year?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the expected cost over the year, we need to find the optimal production level for each unit of time. Let's denote the production level at time t as P_t.\n\nThe total cost of production at time t is given by the product of the cost per unit and the production level, plus the fixed cost:\n\nTotal_Cost_t = C_t * P_t + 100\n\nSince C_t = 10 + 2W_t, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nTotal_Cost_t = (10 + 2W_t) * P_t + 100\n\nNow, we want to minimize the expected total cost over the year. To do this, we need to minimize the expected value of Total_Cost_t. Since W_t is a random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, the expected value of 2W_t is 0. Therefore, the expected value of C_t is:\n\nE[C_t] = E[10 + 2W_t] = 10 + 2 * E[W_t] = 10\n\nNow, we can find the expected total cost at time t:\n\nE[Total_Cost_t] = E[(10 + 2W_t) * P_t + 100] = 10 * P_t + 100\n\nTo minimize the expected total cost, we need to minimize 10 * P_t + 100. Since the fixed cost of $100 is constant, we need to minimize 10 * P_t. The minimum value of 10 * P_t occurs when P_t = 0.\n\nHowever, having a production level of 0 for each unit of time is not practical, as it means not producing any product at all. Therefore, the optimal production level should be determined based on the demand for the product and other constraints, such as storage capacity and production capacity.\n\nIn summary, the optimal production level for each time that minimizes the expected cost over the year depends on the demand and other constraints. The mathematical model provided does not account for these factors, so it is not possible to determine the optimal production level solely based on the given information."
