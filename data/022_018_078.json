    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the method of characteristics, we first rewrite the PDE in the form:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -2i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNow, we introduce a new variable $s$ as a parameter along the characteristic curves. We have:\n\n$$\\frac{d u}{d s} = -2i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\frac{d z}{d s}$$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{d u}{d s} = -2i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\frac{d z}{d t}\\frac{d t}{d s}$$\n\nSince $\\frac{d z}{d t} = 2i$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d u}{d s} = -2i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}(2i)\\frac{d t}{d s}$$\n\nNow, we can cancel the $-2i$ on both sides:\n\n$$\\frac{d u}{d s} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\frac{d t}{d s}$$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $s$, we get:\n\n$$u(z,t) = u(z,0) + \\int_0^t \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} ds$$\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $u(z,0) = z^2 + 3iz + 1$:\n\n$$u(z,t) = z^2 + 3iz + 1 + \\int_0^t \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} ds$$\n\nTo find $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}$, we differentiate the initial condition with respect to $z$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 2z + 3i$$\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for $u(z,t)$:\n\n$$u(z,t) = z^2 + 3iz + 1 + \\int_0^t (2z + 3i) ds$$\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to $s$:\n\n$$u(z,t) = z^2 + 3iz + 1 + (2z + 3i)t$$\n\nThis is the general solution for $u(z,t)$. Now, we find the solution for $t=2$:\n\n$$u(z,2) = z^2 + 3iz + 1 + (2z + 3i)(2)$$\n\n$$u(z,2) = z^2 + 3iz + 1 + 4z + 6i$$\n\n$$u(z,2) = z^2 + (4z) + (3i + 6i)z + 1$$\n\n$$u(z,2) = z^2 + 4z + 9iz + 1$$\n\nSo, the solution for $t=2$ is:\n\n$$u(z,2) = z^2 + 4z + 9iz + 1$$"
