    "message_2": "To find the degree of the moduli space of algebraic curves isomorphic to $C$ with the roles of $x$ and $y$ reversed, we first need to find an equation for the curve with the roles of $x$ and $y$ reversed. Let's call this curve $C'$. To reverse the roles of $x$ and $y$, we can simply swap $x$ and $y$ in the equation for $C$:\n\n$x^2 = y^3 - y$.\n\nNow, we want to find the degree of the moduli space of algebraic curves isomorphic to $C'$. The moduli space of algebraic curves is a space that parameterizes isomorphism classes of algebraic curves. In this case, we are looking for the degree of the moduli space of curves isomorphic to $C'$.\n\nThe degree of a curve is the highest degree of its defining polynomial. In this case, the defining polynomial is $x^2 = y^3 - y$. The highest degree term in this polynomial is $y^3$, so the degree of the curve $C'$ is 3.\n\nNow, we want to find the degree of the moduli space of algebraic curves isomorphic to $C'$. Since the degree of $C'$ is 3, the moduli space of algebraic curves isomorphic to $C'$ will also have degree 3. Therefore, the degree of the moduli space of algebraic curves that are isomorphic to $C$ but with the roles of $x$ and $y$ reversed is 3."
