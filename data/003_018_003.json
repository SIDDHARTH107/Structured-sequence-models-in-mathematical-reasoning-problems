    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 3sin(2x) + 2cos(3x), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [3sin(2x)] + d/dx [2cos(3x)]\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 3sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 3cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 2. Applying the chain rule:\n\nd/dx [3sin(2x)] = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is 2cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is -2sin(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 3. Applying the chain rule:\n\nd/dx [2cos(3x)] = -2sin(3x) * 3 = -6sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can write the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 6cos(2x) - 6sin(3x)\n\nTo find the derivative at x = π/4, we'll plug in the value of x:\n\nf'(π/4) = 6cos(2(π/4)) - 6sin(3(π/4))\nf'(π/4) = 6cos(π/2) - 6sin(3π/4)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(3π/4) = √2/2, so:\n\nf'(π/4) = 6(0) - 6(√2/2)\nf'(π/4) = -3√2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3sin(2x) + 2cos(3x) at x = π/4 is -3√2."
