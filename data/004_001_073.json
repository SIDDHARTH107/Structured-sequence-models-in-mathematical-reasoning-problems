    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 1, we will apply the power rule for derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's find the derivative term by term:\n\n1. The derivative of 2x^3:\n   Using the power rule, we have n = 3, so f'(x) = 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n\n2. The derivative of 5x^2:\n   Using the power rule, we have n = 2, so f'(x) = 2 * 5x^(2-1) = 10x.\n\n3. The derivative of -4x:\n   Using the power rule, we have n = 1, so f'(x) = 1 * -4x^(1-1) = -4.\n\n4. The derivative of the constant term 1:\n   The derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we can combine these derivatives to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 4"
