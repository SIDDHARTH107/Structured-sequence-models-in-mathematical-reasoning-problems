    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x in the equation. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n√(x+5) - 2 + 2 = 1 + 2\n√(x+5) = 3\n\n2. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n(√(x+5))^2 = 3^2\nx+5 = 9\n\n3. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\nx+5-5 = 9-5\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4."
