    "message_2": "To find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, we use Sylow's Theorem. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisor that satisfies both conditions is n_3 = 1. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which must be of order 3^3 = 27.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G and it has order 27, it must be a normal subgroup of G. In fact, it must be equal to G itself. This means that G is a p-group, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 3).\n\nNow, we know that every group of order p^3 (where p is a prime) is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C_(p^3) or a non-abelian group of order p^3. In our case, G has order 27 = 3^3, so G is either isomorphic to C_27 or a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nSince G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal and equal to G itself, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_27. This is because a non-abelian group of order 27 would have more than one non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup, which contradicts our finding that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in G.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_27."
