    "message_2": "To determine the girth of the graph (the length of the shortest cycle), we can use the following inequality:\n\ng ≤ 1 + (2 * E) / V\n\nwhere g is the girth, E is the number of edges, and V is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, we have E = 19 and V = 12. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ng ≤ 1 + (2 * 19) / 12\ng ≤ 1 + 38 / 12\ng ≤ 1 + 3.1667\ng ≤ 4.1667\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get the smallest possible girth:\n\ng ≤ 5\n\nSo, the girth of the graph is at most 5. However, we need to check if a graph with 12 vertices, 19 edges, and girth 5 is possible.\n\nConsider a graph with girth 5. This means that the shortest cycle in the graph has 5 vertices. We can start by creating a 5-cycle with 5 vertices and 5 edges. Now, we have 7 vertices and 14 edges left to add to the graph.\n\nFor each of the remaining 7 vertices, we can connect them to two vertices in the 5-cycle without creating a cycle of length less than 5. This will add 2 edges for each of the 7 vertices, resulting in 14 additional edges.\n\nThus, it is possible to create a graph with 12 vertices, 19 edges, and girth 5. Therefore, the girth of the graph is 5."
