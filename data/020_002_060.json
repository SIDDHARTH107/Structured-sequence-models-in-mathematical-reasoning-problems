    "message_1": "A farmer has a plot of land that is 2000 square meters. He wants to grow two different crops: wheat and barley. The cost of planting one square meter of wheat is $2 and the cost of planting one square meter of barley is $3. The farmer has a budget of $4000 for planting expenses. If the farmer can harvest 30 kilograms of wheat per square meter and 40 kilograms of barley per square meter, how many square meters should he allocate for each crop to maximize his harvest and profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of square meters allocated for wheat and y be the number of square meters allocated for barley. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 2000 (total land area constraint)\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 4000 (budget constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the total harvest, which is given by the objective function:\n\nTotal harvest = 30x + 40y\n\nFirst, we will solve the budget constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 4000 - 2x\ny ≤ (4000 - 2x)/3\n\nNow, we will find the critical points by plugging this expression for y into the total land area constraint:\n\nx + (4000 - 2x)/3 ≤ 2000\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3x + 4000 - 2x ≤ 6000\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx ≤ 2000\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative, we have the following bounds for x and y:\n\n0 ≤ x ≤ 2000\n0 ≤ y ≤ (4000 - 2x)/3\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at the critical points and the bounds:\n\n1. x = 0, y = (4000 - 2(0))/3 = 4000/3\nTotal harvest = 30(0) + 40(4000/3) = 160000/3 kg\n\n2. x = 2000, y = (4000 - 2(2000))/3 = 0\nTotal harvest = 30(2000) + 40(0) = 60000 kg\n\nComparing the total harvest at these points, we find that the maximum harvest is achieved when x = 2000 and y = 0. Therefore, the farmer should allocate all 2000 square meters for wheat to maximize his harvest and profits. The total harvest will be 60,000 kg."
