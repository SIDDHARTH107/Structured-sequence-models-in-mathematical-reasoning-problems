    "message_1": "A rocket is launched from a launch site and its height (in meters) at time t (in seconds) is given by the function h(t) = -5t^3 + 150t^2 + 100t. The rocket engine can only supply full thrust for the first 90 seconds, after which the engine thrust reduces by 10% every 10 seconds. How long should the rocket engine supply full thrust to maximize the rocket's height? What is the maximum height the rocket reaches? Round your answers to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the time at which the rocket reaches its maximum height, we need to find the critical points of the height function h(t). We do this by taking the first derivative of h(t) with respect to time t and setting it equal to 0.\n\nh(t) = -5t^3 + 150t^2 + 100t\n\nh'(t) = -15t^2 + 300t + 100\n\nNow, we set h'(t) = 0 and solve for t:\n\n-15t^2 + 300t + 100 = 0\n\nWe can divide the equation by -5 to simplify:\n\n3t^2 - 60t - 20 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the two possible values for t:\n\nt = (60 ± √(60^2 - 4 * 3 * (-20))) / (2 * 3)\n\nt ≈ 2.15, 3.09\n\nSince the rocket engine can only supply full thrust for the first 90 seconds, we should choose the time t = 3.09 seconds (rounded to two decimal places) to maximize the rocket's height.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height by plugging this value of t back into the height function h(t):\n\nh(3.09) = -5(3.09)^3 + 150(3.09)^2 + 100(3.09)\n\nh(3.09) ≈ 1423.96\n\nSo, the rocket engine should supply full thrust for 3.09 seconds to maximize the rocket's height, and the maximum height the rocket reaches is approximately 1423.96 meters (rounded to two decimal places)."
