    "message_1": "Suppose a company has only $10,000 to invest in two different projects. Project A will return $2,000 for every unit invested and project B will return $3,000 for every unit invested. However, project A requires a minimum investment of 5 units and project B requires a minimum investment of 3 units. The company wants to maximize their total profit. How many units should the company invest in each project?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units invested in project A and y be the number of units invested in project B. The total investment should not exceed $10,000, so we have the constraint:\n\nx + y ≤ (10,000 / 1,000) = 10\n\nSince project A requires a minimum investment of 5 units and project B requires a minimum investment of 3 units, we have the following constraints:\n\nx ≥ 5\ny ≥ 3\n\nThe company wants to maximize their total profit, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nProfit = 2,000x + 3,000y\n\nNow we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and maximize the profit. We can use the graphical method to solve this linear programming problem.\n\nFirst, we can plot the constraint inequalities on a coordinate plane:\n\nx + y ≤ 10\nx ≥ 5\ny ≥ 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the quadrilateral with vertices at points (5, 3), (5, 5), (7, 3), and (5, 7).\n\nNow we need to find the maximum value of the objective function within the feasible region. We can evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (5, 3) = 2,000(5) + 3,000(3) = 10,000 + 9,000 = 19,000\n2. Profit at (5, 5) = 2,000(5) + 3,000(5) = 10,000 + 15,000 = 25,000\n3. Profit at (7, 3) = 2,000(7) + 3,000(3) = 14,000 + 9,000 = 23,000\n4. Profit at (5, 7) = 2,000(5) + 3,000(7) = 10,000 + 21,000 = 31,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $31,000, which occurs when the company invests 5 units in project A and 7 units in project B."
