    "message_1": "In a message encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the letter 'E' appears most frequently, followed by 'A', 'T', and 'O', in that order. The letters 'Z' and 'X' never appear. If you intercept a ciphertext consisting of 200 letters, how many of those letters are likely to be the letter 'E'?",
    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a fixed replacement letter. The frequency of letters in the ciphertext will be the same as the frequency of letters in the plaintext, but with the letters substituted.\n\nIn English, the letter 'E' is the most common letter, followed by 'A', 'T', and 'O'. According to the problem, the ciphertext has the same frequency distribution as English text. Therefore, we can use the frequency of 'E' in English to estimate the number of 'E's in the ciphertext.\n\nThe frequency of 'E' in English text is approximately 12.7%. To estimate the number of 'E's in the 200-letter ciphertext, we can multiply the frequency of 'E' by the total number of letters:\n\nNumber of 'E's = (Frequency of 'E') * (Total number of letters)\nNumber of 'E's = (0.127) * (200)\nNumber of 'E's â‰ˆ 25.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a letter, we can round the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are likely to be approximately 25 'E's in the ciphertext."
