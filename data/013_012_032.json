The demand function for the market is P = 50 – Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity supplied.

    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing output for each firm in this Stackelberg competition, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction function for firm 2 (the follower).\n2. Substitute the reaction function into the demand function to find the residual demand for firm 1 (the leader).\n3. Maximize the profit for firm 1.\n4. Use the output of firm 1 to find the output of firm 2.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for firm 2\nTo find the reaction function for firm 2, we need to maximize its profit, which is the difference between its revenue and cost. The revenue for firm 2 is R2 = P * Q2, and the cost is TC2 = 10Q2.\n\nFirst, we need to express P in terms of Q2. From the demand function, we have P = 50 - Q, and Q = Q1 + Q2. Therefore, P = 50 - (Q1 + Q2).\n\nNow, we can write the revenue for firm 2 as R2 = (50 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2.\n\nThe profit for firm 2 is Π2 = R2 - TC2 = (50 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 10Q2.\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to take the first derivative of Π2 with respect to Q2 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Π2)/dQ2 = (50 - Q1 - 2Q2) - 10 = 0.\n\nSolving for Q2, we get the reaction function for firm 2:\n\nQ2 = (40 - Q1) / 2.\n\nStep 2: Substitute the reaction function into the demand function to find the residual demand for firm 1\nNow, we need to substitute the reaction function for firm 2 into the demand function to find the residual demand for firm 1:\n\nQ = Q1 + Q2 = Q1 + (40 - Q1) / 2.\n\nSolving for Q1, we get:\n\nQ1 = (80 - Q1) / 2.\n\nStep 3: Maximize the profit for firm 1\nThe profit for firm 1 is Π1 = R1 - TC1, where R1 = P * Q1 and TC1 = 10Q1.\n\nUsing the residual demand for firm 1, we can write the revenue for firm 1 as R1 = (50 - (80 - Q1) / 2) * Q1.\n\nThe profit for firm 1 is Π1 = R1 - TC1 = (50 - (80 - Q1) / 2) * Q1 - 10Q1.\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to take the first derivative of Π1 with respect to Q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Π1)/dQ1 = (20 + Q1 / 2) - 10 = 0.\n\nSolving for Q1, we get:\n\nQ1 = 20.\n\nStep 4: Use the output of firm 1 to find the output of firm 2\nNow, we can use the output of firm 1 to find the output of firm 2 using the reaction function:\n\nQ2 = (40 - Q1) / 2 = (40 - 20) / 2 = 10.\n\nSo, the profit-maximizing output for firm 1 (the leader) is 20 units, and the profit-maximizing output for firm 2 (the follower) is 10 units in this Stackelberg competition."
