    "message_2": "To find the number of cut vertices or bridges in the graph G, we need to analyze the structure of the graph. Unfortunately, without more information about the specific connections between vertices, it is impossible to determine the exact number of cut vertices or bridges.\n\nHowever, we can discuss some general properties of graphs and their cut vertices or bridges:\n\n1. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, it is a vertex that connects two or more subgraphs.\n\n2. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, it is an edge that connects two subgraphs.\n\n3. The minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 8 vertices is 7 (forming a tree). In this case, all the vertices except the leaves would be cut vertices, and all the edges would be bridges.\n\n4. The maximum number of edges a graph with 8 vertices can have without forming a cycle is also 7 (forming a tree). Adding more edges will create cycles, which will reduce the number of cut vertices and bridges.\n\n5. As the number of edges increases, the graph becomes more connected, and the number of cut vertices and bridges generally decreases.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph G depends on its specific structure. To determine the exact number, we would need more information about the connections between the vertices."
