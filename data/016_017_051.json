    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal curve that is constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a right angle. Each iteration doubles the number of segments in the curve, and each segment has the same length as the original segment.\n\nLet's denote the length of the original segment as L. In the first iteration, there are 2 segments, so the total length is 2L. In the second iteration, there are 4 segments, so the total length is 4L. In general, for the nth iteration, there are 2^n segments, so the total length is 2^n * L.\n\nFor the 7th iteration, the total length is 2^7 * L = 128 * L."
