    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G, denoted by n_2, must divide the order of G and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, the possible values for n_2 are 1, 2, or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of P is 16, P is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or D8. We know that G is isomorphic to a group that contains P as a normal subgroup. Since P is normal and has index 1, G is isomorphic to P. Thus, G is isomorphic to C16 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 2\nIf there are two Sylow 2-subgroups, let P and Q be these subgroups. Since the order of P and Q is 8, they are isomorphic to either C8 or D4. Note that the intersection of P and Q must have order 2, as the order of G is 16. Let R = P ∩ Q. Then, R is a normal subgroup of both P and Q. \n\nIf P and Q are both isomorphic to C8, then R is isomorphic to C2, and G is generated by P and Q. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nIf P and Q are both isomorphic to D4, then R is isomorphic to C2, and G is generated by P and Q. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 4\nIf there are four Sylow 2-subgroups, then G cannot be isomorphic to C16 or D8, as these groups have only one or two Sylow 2-subgroups, respectively. Thus, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, if the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is 1 or 2, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16 or the dihedral group D8. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16."
