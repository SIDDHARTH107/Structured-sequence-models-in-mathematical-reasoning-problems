    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product having a certain type of defect is 0.15. If a sample of 200 products is chosen, what is the probability that at least 25 of them will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of products (200 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective products (we want to find the probability of at least 25 defective products)\n- p is the probability of a product having a defect (0.15 in this case)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 25 defective products, we need to find the probability of having 25, 26, 27, ..., 200 defective products and sum them up. However, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can find the probability of having less than 25 defective products (0 to 24) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we want to find:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 24)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 24 and sum them up:\n\nsum = 0\nn = 200\np = 0.15\n\nfor k in range(0, 25):\n    C_n_k = C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n    P_X_k = C_n_k * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n    sum += P_X_k\n\nFinally, subtract the sum from 1 to get the probability of having at least 25 defective products:\n\nP(X >= 25) = 1 - sum\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 25) â‰ˆ 0.8913\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 25 defective products in a sample of 200 is approximately 0.8913 or 89.13%."
