    "message_1": "In a company of 100 employees, the probability of any employee committing financial fraud is 0.02. What is the probability that at least 2 employees in the company will commit financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 employees committing financial fraud, we can first find the probability of 0 or 1 employee committing financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of 0 employees committing financial fraud:\nP(0) = (1 - 0.02)^100\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 employee committing financial fraud:\nP(1) = C(100, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (1 - 0.02)^99\nwhere C(100, 1) is the number of combinations of choosing 1 employee out of 100, which is 100.\n\nP(1) = 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99\n\nNow, let's find the probability of at least 2 employees committing financial fraud:\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - (1 - 0.02)^100 - 100 * 0.02 * (0.98)^99\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nP(at least 2) ≈ 1 - 0.1339796748 - 0.2712477392\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.594772586\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 employees in the company will commit financial fraud is approximately 0.5948 or 59.48%."
