    "message_1": "Sam has an isosceles triangle with two congruent sides of length 8 cm each. If the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm, what is the length of the remaining side?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the remaining side be x cm. Since the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm, we can write the equation:\n\n8 + 8 + x = 24\n\n16 + x = 24\n\nNow, subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 24 - 16\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of the remaining side is 8 cm."
