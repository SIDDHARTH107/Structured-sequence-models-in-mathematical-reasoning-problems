    "message_2": "To find the contact structure of the sphere at the point (3, 4, 0), we first need to find the normal vector to the sphere at this point. The normal vector is given by the gradient of the sphere's equation, which is the vector (x, y, z) at the point (3, 4, 0). So, the normal vector is (3, 4, 0).\n\nNow, let's find the contact form α. The contact form is a 1-form that annihilates the tangent plane to the sphere at the point (3, 4, 0). Since the normal vector to the tangent plane is (3, 4, 0), we can write the contact form as:\n\nα = a dx + b dy + c dz\n\nwhere (a, b, c) is the normal vector (3, 4, 0), and dx, dy, and dz are the differential 1-forms of the coordinates x, y, and z, respectively.\n\nSo, the contact form α is:\n\nα = 3 dx + 4 dy\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the contact structure in terms of α. The contact structure is a 2-plane distribution on the sphere, which is given by the kernel of the contact form α:\n\nker(α) = {(u, v, w) ∈ T_p(S) | α(u, v, w) = 0}\n\nwhere T_p(S) is the tangent space to the sphere at the point (3, 4, 0), and (u, v, w) are the components of a tangent vector to the sphere.\n\nSubstituting the contact form α into the equation, we get:\n\n3u + 4v = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the contact structure of the sphere at the point (3, 4, 0) in terms of its contact form α."
