    "message_2": "To find the cross product of vectors A and B, we can use the following formula:\n\nA x B = (A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y, A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z, A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)\n\nGiven vector A = (3, -1, 2) and vector B = (5, 2, -3), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nA x B = ((-1) * (-3) - 2 * 2, 2 * 5 - 3 * (-3), 3 * 2 - (-1) * 5)\n\nA x B = (3 - 4, 10 + 9, 6 + 5)\n\nA x B = (-1, 19, 11)\n\nSo, the cross product of vectors A and B is (-1, 19, 11)."
