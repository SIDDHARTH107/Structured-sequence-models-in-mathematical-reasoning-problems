At what rate is the water level rising when the water is 6 meters deep? (Hint: Use the related rate formula and the volume formula for a cone).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the volume formula for a cone and then use the related rate formula.\n\nThe volume formula for a cone is given by:\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nWhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nSince the water tank is in the shape of a cone, we can find the relationship between the radius and height of the water in the tank by using similar triangles. The ratio of the radius to the height is constant:\n\nr/h = 4/10\nr = (2/5)h\n\nNow, we will find the volume of the water in the tank as a function of its height:\n\nV = (1/3)π((2/5)h)^2h\nV = (1/3)π(4/25)h^3\nV = (4/75)πh^3\n\nNow, we will use the related rate formula. We are given that dV/dt = 3 cubic meters per minute, and we want to find dh/dt when h = 6 meters.\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the volume equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (4/75)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nPlug in the given values: dV/dt = 3 and h = 6:\n\n3 = (4/75)π(3(6)^2)(dh/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dh/dt:\n\n3 = (4/75)π(108)(dh/dt)\n3 = (432/75)π(dh/dt)\n\nDivide both sides by (432/75)π:\n\ndh/dt = 3 / ((432/75)π)\ndh/dt ≈ 0.0729\n\nTherefore, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.0729 meters per minute when the water is 6 meters deep."
