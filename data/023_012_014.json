    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function f(x), we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n, which are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(0) dx) from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(n * x) dx) from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(0 * cos(0) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1 * cos(0) dx) from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 + ∫(dx) from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [x] from 0 to π\na_0 = (1/π) * (π - 0)\na_0 = 1\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(0 * cos(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1 * cos(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [0 + ∫(cos(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * sin(n * x)] from 0 to π\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(0))]\na_n = 0 (since sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(0 * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1 * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [0 + ∫(sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * cos(n * x)] from 0 to π\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0))]\nb_n = (-1/nπ) * (cos(n * π) - 1) for n ≠ 0\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) ≈ (1/2) + Σ((-1/nπ) * (cos(n * π) - 1) * sin(n * x)) from n = 1 to ∞\n\nTo sketch the graph of the function and its Fourier series, we can plot f(x) and the partial sums of the Fourier series for different values of n. As n increases, the Fourier series will converge to the original function f(x) in the interval -π < x < π. The graph of f(x) is a square wave with a period of 2π, with f(x) = 0 for -π ≤ x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x < π. The Fourier series will approximate this square wave with increasing accuracy as more terms are included in the series."
