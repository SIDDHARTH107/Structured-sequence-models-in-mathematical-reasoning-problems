    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x - 5| = 9, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 5 = 9\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n2x = 14\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\nx = 7\n\nCase 2: 2x - 5 = -9\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n2x = -4\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for the absolute value equation |2x - 5| = 9 are x = 7 and x = -2."
