    "message_2": "To prove that $\\diamond \\neg q$ implies $\\neg p$, we will use the contrapositive method. The contrapositive of an implication is the statement that the negation of the conclusion implies the negation of the premise. In this case, the contrapositive is $\\neg (\\neg p) \\implies \\neg (\\diamond \\neg q)$. If we can prove the contrapositive, then the original statement is true.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the contrapositive statement:\n1. $\\neg (\\neg p) \\implies \\neg (\\diamond \\neg q)$\n2. $p \\implies \\neg (\\diamond \\neg q)$\n\nNow, let's use the given modal logic formula $\\square p \\rightarrow \\square \\diamond q$:\n3. If $p$ is true, then $\\square p$ is also true.\n4. Since $\\square p \\rightarrow \\square \\diamond q$, if $\\square p$ is true, then $\\square \\diamond q$ must be true as well.\n\nNow, let's analyze the meaning of $\\square \\diamond q$:\n5. $\\square \\diamond q$ means that in all possible worlds, there exists a world where $q$ is true.\n\nNow, let's negate the statement $\\diamond \\neg q$:\n6. $\\neg (\\diamond \\neg q)$ means that there is no possible world where $\\neg q$ is true.\n7. This implies that in all possible worlds, $q$ is true.\n\nNow, let's combine steps 2, 4, and 7:\n8. If $p$ is true, then in all possible worlds, $q$ is true.\n\nFinally, let's prove the contrapositive statement:\n9. If $p$ is true, then $\\neg (\\diamond \\neg q)$ is true (from step 8).\n10. Therefore, $p \\implies \\neg (\\diamond \\neg q)$.\n\nSince we have proven the contrapositive, the original statement is true:\n$\\diamond \\neg q$ implies $\\neg p$."
