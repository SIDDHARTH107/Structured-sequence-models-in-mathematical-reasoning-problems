    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface S, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y.\n\nf_x = ∂f/∂x = 2x\nf_y = ∂f/∂y = 8y\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives.\n\nf_xx = ∂²f/∂x² = 2\nf_yy = ∂²f/∂y² = 8\nf_xy = ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNext, we need to find the unit normal vector N at the point (1, 2). The gradient of f(x, y) is given by:\n\n∇f = (f_x, f_y, -1) = (2x, 8y, -1)\n\nAt the point (1, 2), we have:\n\n∇f(1, 2) = (2, 16, -1)\n\nNow, we normalize this vector to get the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = ∇f(1, 2) / ||∇f(1, 2)|| = (2, 16, -1) / sqrt(2^2 + 16^2 + (-1)^2) = (2, 16, -1) / sqrt(261)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = N ⋅ f_xx = (2/261) * 2 = 4/261\nF = N ⋅ f_xy = (2/261) * 0 = 0\nG = N ⋅ f_yy = (16/261) * 8 = 128/261\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (f_xx * f_yy - f_xy^2) / (E * G - F^2)\n\nK = (2 * 8 - 0^2) / ((4/261) * (128/261) - 0^2) = 16 / (512/261^2) = 16 * (261^2) / 512 = 10816 / 512 = 21/8\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, 2) is K = 21/8."
