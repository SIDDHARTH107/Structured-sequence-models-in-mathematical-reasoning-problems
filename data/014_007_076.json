    "message_1": "Assuming you have a stream cipher key consisting of 10 bits, and a plaintext message consisting of 32 bits, how many possible ciphertext messages can be generated using this key?",
    "message_2": "A stream cipher key with 10 bits can have 2^10 different possible keys, since each bit can be either 0 or 1. So, there are 1,024 (2^10) possible keys.\n\nFor each of these 1,024 keys, you can generate a unique ciphertext message for the given 32-bit plaintext message. Therefore, there are 1,024 possible ciphertext messages that can be generated using a 10-bit stream cipher key for a 32-bit plaintext message."
