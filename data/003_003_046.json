    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sin(120°) using the unit circle, we can use the angle addition formula for sine, which states that sin(A + B) = sin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B). In this case, we can break down 120° into two angles that we know the sine and cosine values for: 90° and 30°.\n\nSo, sin(120°) = sin(90° + 30°) = sin(90°)cos(30°) + cos(90°)sin(30°).\n\nWe know that sin(90°) = 1, cos(90°) = 0, sin(30°) = 1/2, and cos(30°) = √3/2.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nsin(120°) = (1)(√3/2) + (0)(1/2) = √3/2.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of sin(120°) is √3/2."
