    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a Caesar Cipher. Frequency analysis of the encrypted message shows that the letter \"F\" appears most frequently, followed by the letters \"W\" and \"H\" respectively. What is the most likely shift value used in the Caesar Cipher encryption of this message?",
    "message_2": "In the English language, the most frequent letters are \"E\", \"T\", and \"A\". Since \"F\" appears most frequently in the encrypted message, it is likely that \"F\" corresponds to \"E\" in the original message. To find the shift value, we can calculate the difference between the positions of \"F\" and \"E\" in the alphabet.\n\nF (6th letter) - E (5th letter) = 1\n\nSo, the most likely shift value used in the Caesar Cipher encryption of this message is 1."
