The metric tensor for the given metric is:\n\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is:\n\n$$\n\\det(g) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix} = 9 \\cdot 9 - 0 \\cdot 0 = 81\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the square root of the determinant:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{81} = 9\n$$\n\nThe volume form for a two-dimensional manifold is given by:\n\n$$\ndV = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nSo, the volume form for the given metric is:\n\n$$\ndV = 9 \\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nAt the point (1, 2), the volume form remains the same, as it does not depend on the coordinates:\n\n$$\ndV(1, 2) = 9 \\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$"
