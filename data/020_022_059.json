    "message_1": "A farmer wants to plant at least 100 acres of crops but has only 2000 pounds of fertilizer and 1500 hours of labor available. The farmer can produce a maximum of 8 bushels per acre of corn or 6 bushels per acre of wheat. Corn sells for $10 per bushel and wheat for $8 per bushel. How many acres of each crop should the farmer plant to maximize his profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of wheat. The farmer wants to maximize his profit, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nProfit = 8 * $10 * x + 6 * $8 * y = 80x + 48y\n\nThe constraints for this problem are:\n\n1. x + y ≥ 100 (at least 100 acres of crops)\n2. Fertilizer constraint: 10x + 20y ≤ 2000 (2000 pounds of fertilizer available)\n3. Labor constraint: 20x + 10y ≤ 1500 (1500 hours of labor available)\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will use the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 100 (boundary line for the first constraint)\n2. 10x + 20y = 2000 (boundary line for the fertilizer constraint)\n3. 20x + 10y = 1500 (boundary line for the labor constraint)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with the following vertices:\n\nA. (0, 100)\nB. (50, 50)\nC. (75, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at A: 80(0) + 48(100) = 4800\n2. Profit at B: 80(50) + 48(50) = 6400\n3. Profit at C: 80(75) + 48(0) = 6000\n\nThe maximum profit is $6400, which occurs when the farmer plants 50 acres of corn and 50 acres of wheat."
