    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A generates a profit of $5, while each unit of Product B generates a profit of $8. However, due to raw material shortages, the company can produce only a maximum of 100 units of Product A and 120 units of Product B. The manufacturing process is stochastic, meaning there is a 20% chance that the production of any given unit of Product A will fail, while there is a 10% chance that the production of any given unit of Product B will fail. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce to maximize expected profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B that the company produces. The expected profit function can be written as:\n\nExpected Profit = 5 * 0.8x + 8 * 0.9y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx ≤ 100\ny ≤ 120\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y. Since the profit per unit of Product B is higher than that of Product A, and the failure rate of Product B is lower than that of Product A, it is beneficial for the company to produce as many units of Product B as possible. Therefore, the company should produce the maximum allowed number of units of Product B, which is 120 units.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of units of Product A to produce. Since the company can produce a maximum of 100 units of Product A, we can calculate the expected profit for producing all 100 units:\n\nExpected Profit = 5 * 0.8 * 100 + 8 * 0.9 * 120\nExpected Profit = 400 + 864\nExpected Profit = $1,264\n\nThus, to maximize the expected profit, the company should produce 100 units of Product A and 120 units of Product B. The maximum expected profit is $1,264."
