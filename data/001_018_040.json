    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms:\n\n1. log_a(b) - log_a(c) = log_a(b/c)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog base 2 (8x/4) = 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\nlog base 2 (2x) = 2\n\nTo remove the logarithm, we can use the property:\n\nlog_a(b) = c is equivalent to a^c = b\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2^2 = 2x\n\n4 = 2x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 4/2\n\nx = 2"
