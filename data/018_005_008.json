    "message_2": "The intersection of a set A and its complement A' is always the empty set, denoted as ∅. This is because the complement of a set contains all the elements that are not in the set A, so there are no common elements between A and its complement A'. In this case, the intersection of the set of prime numbers between 1 and 20 (A) and its complement (A') is ∅."
