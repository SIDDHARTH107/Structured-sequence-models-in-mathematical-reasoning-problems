    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. To find the genus of a complete graph Kₙ, we can use the formula:\n\ng(Kₙ) = (n - 3)(n - 4)/12\n\nIn the case of K₇ (a complete graph with 7 vertices), we can plug in n = 7 into the formula:\n\ng(K₇) = (7 - 3)(7 - 4)/12\ng(K₇) = (4)(3)/12\ng(K₇) = 12/12\ng(K₇) = 1\n\nSo, the genus of a complete graph K₇ is 1."
