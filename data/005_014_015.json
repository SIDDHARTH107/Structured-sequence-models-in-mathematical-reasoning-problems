    "message_1": "A math student is given a set of data containing 6 variables. They are asked to perform factor analysis to identify underlying factors contributing to the data. After conducting the analysis, the student discovers that the first two factors explain 75% of the total variability in the data. What is the total proportion of variability explained by the remaining factors?",
    "message_2": "If the first two factors explain 75% of the total variability in the data, then the remaining factors must explain the rest of the variability. To find the proportion of variability explained by the remaining factors, subtract the proportion explained by the first two factors from 100%.\n\n100% - 75% = 25%\n\nSo, the remaining factors explain 25% of the total variability in the data."
