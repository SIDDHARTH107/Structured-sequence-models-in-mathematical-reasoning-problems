    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = cos(2x) with initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3 using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation.\n\nLet Y(w) be the Fourier transform of y(x) and F(w) be the Fourier transform of cos(2x). Then, the Fourier transform of y''(x) is given by (iw)^2 * Y(w), where i is the imaginary unit and w is the angular frequency.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given differential equation in the frequency domain:\n\n(1) (iw)^2 * Y(w) + 4Y(w) = F(w)\n\nThe Fourier transform of cos(2x) is given by:\n\nF(w) = π[δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2)], where δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can solve equation (1) for Y(w):\n\nY(w) = F(w) / [(iw)^2 + 4]\n\nY(w) = π[δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2)] / [(iw)^2 + 4]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) to get y(x). We can do this by using the convolution theorem:\n\ny(x) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[e^(iwx) * (π[δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2)]) / [(iw)^2 + 4] dw]\n\ny(x) = (1 / 2) * [h(x) * (δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2))], where h(x) = (1 / π) * e^(-2|w|)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of h(x):\n\nh(x) = (1 / π) * e^(-2|w|)\n\nNow, we can find y(x) by convolving h(x) with the sum of the two delta functions:\n\ny(x) = (1 / 2) * [h(x) * (δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2))]\n\ny(x) = (1 / 2) * [h(x - 2) + h(x + 2)]\n\ny(x) = (1 / 2) * [(1 / π) * e^(-2|x - 2|) + (1 / π) * e^(-2|x + 2|)]\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3:\n\n2 = (1 / 2) * [(1 / π) * e^(-2|0 - 2|) + (1 / π) * e^(-2|0 + 2|)]\n\n3 = (1 / 2) * [(1 / π) * (-2) * e^(-2|0 - 2|) + (1 / π) * 2 * e^(-2|0 + 2|)]\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n2 = (1 / π) * [e^(-4) + e^(-4)]\n\n3 = (1 / π) * [-2 * e^(-4) + 2 * e^(-4)]\n\nNow, we can solve for the constants:\n\nA = e^(-4)\nB = e^(-4)\n\nSo, the solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = (1 / 2) * [(1 / π) * e^(-2|x - 2|) + (1 / π) * e^(-2|x + 2|)]"
