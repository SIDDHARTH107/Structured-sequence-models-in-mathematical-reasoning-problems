    "message_2": "Let g be an element of G with order 9. Since the order of g is 9, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has 9 elements. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. In this case, the order of ⟨g⟩ is 9, which divides the order of G, which is also 9. Therefore, ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we know that the order of G is 9, and the order of ⟨g⟩ is also 9. This means that the number of elements in G and ⟨g⟩ is the same. Since ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G, it must be the case that G = ⟨g⟩. In other words, G is generated by the single element g.\n\nRecall that a cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. Since G is generated by the single element g, G is a cyclic group. The cyclic group of order 9 is denoted as C9. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C9."
