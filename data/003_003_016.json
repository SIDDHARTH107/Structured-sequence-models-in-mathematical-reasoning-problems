    "message_2": "To find the sine of 60 degrees using the unit circle method, first convert 60 degrees to radians. \n\n60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, consider a unit circle (a circle with a radius of 1) with its center at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. The sine of an angle in the unit circle is the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle.\n\nFor a 60-degree angle (π/3 radians), the point of intersection on the unit circle is at (1/2, √3/2). Therefore, the sine of 60 degrees is the y-coordinate of this point:\n\nsin(60°) = sin(π/3) = √3/2"
