    "message_1": "A math student is interested in estimating the average salary of all employees in a company. They take a random sample of 50 employees and use bootstrapping to estimate the standard error of the mean. The bootstrap standard error turns out to be 5000 dollars. What is the estimated 95% confidence interval for the true average salary of all employees in the company?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nIn this case, we are not given the mean salary of the 50 employees, so let's represent it as X̄. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval using the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) is approximately 1.96. The standard error is given as 5000 dollars.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = X̄ ± (1.96 * 5000)\n\nConfidence Interval = X̄ ± 9800\n\nSo, the estimated 95% confidence interval for the true average salary of all employees in the company is (X̄ - 9800) to (X̄ + 9800) dollars."
