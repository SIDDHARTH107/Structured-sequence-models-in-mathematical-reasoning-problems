    "message_2": "Your winning strategy in this game is to ensure that after each of your turns, the total number of stones removed by both players is a multiple of 4. This way, you can always maintain control over the number of stones left in the pile and force your opponent to take the last stone.\n\nHere's the step-by-step strategy:\n\n1. In your first turn, remove 1 stone. This leaves 24 stones in the pile (a multiple of 4).\n2. Observe how many stones your opponent takes in their turn (either 1, 2, or 3).\n3. In your next turn, remove enough stones to make the total number of stones removed by both players in that round a multiple of 4. For example, if your opponent took 2 stones, you should take 2 stones as well (2+2=4). If your opponent took 3 stones, you should take 1 stone (3+1=4).\n4. Continue this strategy for each turn, always ensuring that the total number of stones removed in each round is a multiple of 4.\n\nBy following this strategy, you will force your opponent to take the last stone, and you will win the game."
