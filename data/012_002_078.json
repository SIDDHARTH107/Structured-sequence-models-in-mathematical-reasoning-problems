    "message_2": "This graph is a 3-regular graph, meaning that each vertex has exactly 3 edges connected to it. According to the Four Color Theorem, any planar graph can be colored with no more than four colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. However, we can try to find a lower bound for the number of colors needed.\n\nSince each vertex has 3 edges connected to it, we know that at least 3 colors are needed. If we can find a 3-coloring for this graph, then 3 colors would be the minimum number of colors needed.\n\nHere's a possible 3-coloring for the graph:\n\n1. Color the top-left vertex with color A.\n2. Color the top-right vertex with color B.\n3. Color the bottom-left vertex with color C.\n4. Color the bottom-right vertex with color A.\n5. Color the center-left vertex with color B.\n6. Color the center-right vertex with color C.\n\nWith this coloring, no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of this graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 3."
