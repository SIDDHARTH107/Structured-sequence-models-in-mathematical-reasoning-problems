    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^(3x-4) = 32, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides.\nSince 32 can be written as 2^5, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(3x-4) = 2^5\n\nStep 2: Equate the exponents.\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n3x - 4 = 5\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x - 4 + 4 = 5 + 4\n3x = 9\nx = 9/3\nx = 3\n\nSo, the value of x in the exponential equation 2^(3x-4) = 32 is x = 3."
