    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will analyze the given presentation and compare it to the properties of the three possible groups of order 20: C20, D10, and the non-abelian group.\n\n1. C20: The cyclic group of order 20 has a single generator, say a, such that a^20 = 1. This group is abelian, meaning that the elements commute (i.e., ab = ba for all elements a and b in the group).\n\n2. D10: The dihedral group of order 20, denoted D10, is the group of symmetries of a regular decagon. It has two generators, say r and s, with the relations r^10 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^9s. This group is non-abelian.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 20: This group is also non-abelian and has different properties than the dihedral group.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given presentation of G:\n\nG = < x, y | x^4 = y^5 = 1, yx = x^3y >\n\nThe order of x is 4, and the order of y is 5. Since the orders of x and y are coprime, the order of the group G is 4 * 5 = 20. The relation yx = x^3y shows that G is non-abelian, as the elements x and y do not commute.\n\nComparing G to the three possible groups:\n\n1. C20: G cannot be isomorphic to C20 since G is non-abelian, while C20 is abelian.\n\n2. D10: G cannot be isomorphic to D10 since the order of x in G is 4, while the order of the rotation element r in D10 is 10.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 20: G is non-abelian and has the same order as this group. Since G does not match the properties of C20 or D10, it must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20."
