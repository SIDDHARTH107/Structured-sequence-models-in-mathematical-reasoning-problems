    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the Cartesian products and unions separately:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's calculate (A × B) ∪ {5}:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5}\n\nNext, let's calculate B × {5} and A × {5}:\n\nB × {5} = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\nA × {5} = {(1, 5), (2, 5)}\n\nNow, let's calculate (B × {5}) ∪ A × {5}:\n\n(B × {5}) ∪ A × {5} = {(3, 5), (4, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\n(A × B) ∪ {5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5}\n(B × {5}) ∪ A × {5} = {(3, 5), (4, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, the two sets are not equal. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
