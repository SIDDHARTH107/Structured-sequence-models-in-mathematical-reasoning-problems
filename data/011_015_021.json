    "message_2": "The function $R(k,k)$ is known as the Ramsey number. It is the smallest integer such that any graph with $R(k,k)$ vertices must contain either a clique of size $k$ or an independent set of size $k$. The exact values of Ramsey numbers are difficult to compute, and only a few are known.\n\nFor small values of $k$, the Ramsey numbers are as follows:\n\n- $R(1,1) = 1$\n- $R(2,2) = 2$\n- $R(3,3) = 6$\n- $R(4,4) = 18$\n\nFor larger values of $k$, the exact values of Ramsey numbers are not known, but there are bounds. For example, for $k = 5$, it is known that $43 \\leq R(5,5) \\leq 49$. In general, it is known that:\n\n$$R(k,k) \\leq \\binom{2k-2}{k-1}$$\n\nHowever, finding the exact value of $R(k,k)$ is an open problem in graph theory and combinatorics for most values of $k$."
