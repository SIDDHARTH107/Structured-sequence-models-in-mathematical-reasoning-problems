The team needs to be split into three smaller teams, such that one team has 4 people and the other two teams have 3 people each. \n\nAssuming that the order in which the teams are selected doesn't matter, how many ways are there to split the team into these smaller teams? Use recurrence relation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a recurrence relation, we can use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, such that the order of the items does not matter. The number of combinations of n items taken k at a time is denoted as C(n, k) and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n).\n\nIn this problem, we need to split 10 employees into three smaller teams: one with 4 people and two with 3 people each. We can approach this problem in two steps:\n\n1. Select 4 people for the first team.\n2. From the remaining 6 people, select 3 people for the second team. The last 3 people will automatically form the third team.\n\nNow, let's calculate the combinations for each step:\n\n1. Select 4 people for the first team:\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4! * (10 - 4)!) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210\n\n2. From the remaining 6 people, select 3 people for the second team:\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to split the team, we multiply the combinations from both steps:\n\nTotal ways = C(10, 4) * C(6, 3) = 210 * 20 = 4200\n\nSo, there are 4200 ways to split the team of 10 employees into one team of 4 people and two teams of 3 people each."
