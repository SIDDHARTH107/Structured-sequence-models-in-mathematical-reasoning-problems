    "message_2": "Let G be the group of order 48 with 5 elements of order 3 and 3 elements of order 2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of G.\n\nFirst, note that 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2^4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is n_3 = 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which we will call P_3. Since it is unique, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, there would be a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which we will call P_2, and it would be normal in G. In this case, G would be the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which are both cyclic (since they have prime order). However, this would imply that G is abelian, which contradicts the given information about the number of elements of order 2 and 3. Therefore, n_2 must be 3, and there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, none of which are normal in G.\n\nSince P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. The fact that there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and that none of them are normal in G implies that G is non-abelian. Therefore, G must be one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
