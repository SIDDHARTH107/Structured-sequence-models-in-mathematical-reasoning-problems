    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 72 are there, and can you list all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find all possible group structures. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures of groups of order 72.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, both Sylow subgroups are normal, and the group is a direct product of the Sylow subgroups. Since the orders of the subgroups are coprime, the group is abelian. This case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, but the Sylow 3-subgroup is not. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, so it is either Z_8, Z_4 × Z_2, or Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2. The Sylow 3-subgroup has order 9, so it is either Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. The only possible non-abelian semi-direct product in this case is Z_8 ⋊ Z_3, which gives us one non-abelian group.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, but the Sylow 2-subgroup is not. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow subgroups. The Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, so it is either Z_8, Z_4 × Z_2, or Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2. The Sylow 3-subgroup has order 9, so it is either Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. The only possible non-abelian semi-direct product in this case is Z_4 × Z_2 ⋊ Z_9, which gives us one non-abelian group.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, neither Sylow subgroup is normal. There are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 2 non-abelian groups of order 72: Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 and Z_4 × Z_2 ⋊ Z_9."
