    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply it by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so the side length of each triangle in the hexagon is also 5 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nFor our triangle with side length 5 cm:\n\nArea = (5² * √3) / 4\nArea = (25 * √3) / 4\nArea = 25√3 / 4\n\nNow, we have the area of one equilateral triangle. Since there are 6 triangles in the hexagon, we multiply the area of one triangle by 6:\n\nTotal area of hexagon = 6 * (25√3 / 4)\nTotal area of hexagon = 150√3 / 4\nTotal area of hexagon ≈ 64.95 cm²"
