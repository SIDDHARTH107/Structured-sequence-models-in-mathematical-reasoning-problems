    "message_1": "Consider an auction where there are two bidders and one item for sale. Each bidder has a private value for the item, drawn uniformly at random from the interval [0, 100]. The auctioneer can use a posted price or a sealed-bid auction. The auctioneer's utility is the difference between the revenue generated by the auction and the cost of acquiring the item. Suppose the cost of acquiring the item is $25. What is the optimal reserve price for the auctioneer to set in a posted-price auction?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal reserve price for the auctioneer in a posted-price auction, we need to maximize the auctioneer's expected utility. Let R be the reserve price. The probability that a bidder's valuation is at least R is (100 - R)/100, since the valuations are uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. The probability that at least one of the two bidders has a valuation of at least R is 1 - the probability that both have valuations less than R, which is 1 - [(R/100)^2].\n\nThe auctioneer's expected utility is the expected revenue minus the cost of acquiring the item. The expected revenue is the reserve price R times the probability that at least one bidder has a valuation of at least R, which is R * (1 - (R/100)^2). The auctioneer's expected utility is then R * (1 - (R/100)^2) - 25.\n\nTo maximize the expected utility, we can take the derivative with respect to R and set it equal to 0:\n\nd/dr [R * (1 - (R/100)^2) - 25] = 0\n\nSolving for R, we get:\n\n1 - 2*(R/100)^2 - 2*R*(R/100)*(1/50) = 0\n\nMultiplying by 100^2 to eliminate fractions:\n\n10000 - 200R^2 + 4R^3 = 0\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n2500 - 50R^2 + R^3 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the optimal reserve price R. Using a numerical solver, we find that the optimal reserve price R is approximately 50. This means that the auctioneer should set a reserve price of $50 in a posted-price auction to maximize their expected utility."
