    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the parabola, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have the equation:\n\n0 = 2x^2 - 4x - 1\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -4, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / (2(2))\nx = (4 ± √(16 + 8)) / 4\nx = (4 ± √24) / 4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the parabola are:\n\nx = (4 + √24) / 4 and x = (4 - √24) / 4"
