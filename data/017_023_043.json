    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, there are the following possibilities:\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (2^3)\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 (2^2)\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, there are the following possibilities:\n1. One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9 (3^2)\n\nNow, we can combine these possibilities to form groups of order 72:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9:\n   - The group is a direct product of these subgroups: Z_8 x Z_9\n   - The group is a semidirect product of these subgroups: Z_8 ⋊ Z_9\n   - The group is a semidirect product of these subgroups: Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_9\n\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9:\n   - The group is a direct product of these subgroups: (Z_4 x Z_2) x Z_9\n   - The group is a semidirect product of these subgroups: (Z_4 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_9\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. Z_8 x Z_9 (Direct product of cyclic groups)\n2. Z_8 ⋊ Z_9 (Semidirect product with nontrivial action)\n3. Z_4 x Z_2 ⋊ Z_9 (Semidirect product with nontrivial action)\n4. (Z_4 x Z_2) x Z_9 (Direct product of cyclic groups)\n5. (Z_4 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_9 (Semidirect product with nontrivial action)"
