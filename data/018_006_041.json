    "message_2": "First, let's find the complement of set X with respect to the universal set U. The complement of X, denoted as X', contains all the elements in U that are not in X.\n\nSince U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the complement of X is:\n\nX' = {10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set X and its complement X'. The union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nX ∪ X' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} ∪ {10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThe union of set X and its complement X' is equal to the universal set U, as both sets contain the same elements:\n\nX ∪ X' = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}"
