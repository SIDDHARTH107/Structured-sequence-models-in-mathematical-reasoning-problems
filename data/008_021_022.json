    "message_2": "You are correct that the coefficient matrix of this system is singular. This means that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. Let's analyze the given system:\n\n2x + 3y = 5\n4x + 6y = 10\n\nNotice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (multiplied by 2). In other words, these two equations represent the same line. When this happens, the system of linear equations has either infinitely many solutions or no solution at all.\n\nIn this case, since both equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 5\n\nFirst, isolate the term with y:\n\n3y = 5 - 2x\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\ny = (5 - 2x) / 3\n\nThis equation represents the general solution for the system, where x can be any real number and y will be determined by the equation y = (5 - 2x) / 3."
