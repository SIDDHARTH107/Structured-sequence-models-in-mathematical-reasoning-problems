    "message_2": "To find the total length of the remaining intervals in the Cantor set, we can analyze the process of removing the middle third of each interval at each step.\n\nAt the first step, we remove the middle third from the interval $[0,1]$, leaving two intervals of length $\\frac{1}{3}$ each. The total length at this step is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nAt the second step, we remove the middle third from each of the two remaining intervals, leaving four intervals of length $\\frac{1}{9}$ each. The total length removed at this step is $\\frac{2}{9}$, so the remaining length is $\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\nAt the third step, we remove the middle third from each of the four remaining intervals, leaving eight intervals of length $\\frac{1}{27}$ each. The total length removed at this step is $\\frac{4}{27}$, so the remaining length is $\\frac{4}{9} - \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{8}{27}$.\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. At each step, we remove a total length of $\\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}}$, where $n$ is the step number (starting from 0). To find the total length of the remaining intervals in the Cantor set, we need to sum the lengths removed at each step and subtract that from the initial length of 1.\n\nThe sum of the lengths removed is given by the geometric series:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n$$\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with the first term $a = \\frac{1}{3}$ and common ratio $r = \\frac{2}{3}$. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:\n\n$$S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$$\n\nPlugging in the values for $a$ and $r$, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 1$$\n\nSince the sum of the lengths removed is 1, the total length of the remaining intervals in the Cantor set is $1 - 1 = 0$."
