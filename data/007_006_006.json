Divide the larger number (39) by the smaller number (26) and find the remainder.\n   39 รท 26 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 13.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (39) with the smaller number (26) and the smaller number with the remainder (13) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   26 รท 13 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 13. So, the GCD of 26 and 39 is 13."
