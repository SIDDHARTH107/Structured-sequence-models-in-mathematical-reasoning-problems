    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge numbers of $X$, we first need to find the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. We can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve given by:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree of the curve is the maximum of the degrees of $x$ and $y$ in the equation $y^3 = x^4 - x$. The degree of $x$ is 4, and the degree of $y$ is 3. Therefore, the degree of the curve is $d = 4$.\n\nNow, we can compute the genus:\n\n$g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} = 3$.\n\nThe genus of the curve $C$ is 3.\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge numbers $h^{2,0}$ and $h^{1,1}$ using the Hodge diamond for a smooth projective curve:\n\n$h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 0$ (since $X$ is a curve, there are no nontrivial 2-forms),\n\n$h^{1,1} = 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\n\nThus, the Hodge numbers of $X$ are $h^{2,0} = 0$ and $h^{1,1} = 4$."
