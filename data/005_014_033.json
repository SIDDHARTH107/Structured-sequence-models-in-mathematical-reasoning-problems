    "message_1": "Suppose you have a data set with 6 variables: X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6. Using factor analysis, you find that the first two factors explain 80% of the total variance. What is the total percentage of variance explained by the first three factors?",
    "message_2": "To determine the total percentage of variance explained by the first three factors, we would need to know the percentage of variance explained by the third factor (X3). Unfortunately, the information provided does not give us the percentage of variance explained by X3, so we cannot calculate the total percentage of variance explained by the first three factors."
