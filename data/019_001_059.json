    "message_2": "To represent the given statement symbolically, we can use the conjunction operator (AND) and the negation operator (NOT). The symbolic expression for the statement would be:\n\nP ∧ ¬Q\n\nNow, to calculate the truth value, we need to know the truth values of P and Q. Let's assume:\n\nP (it is raining) = True\nQ (it is cold outside) = False\n\nNow, we can calculate the truth value of the statement:\n\nP ∧ ¬Q = True ∧ ¬False = True ∧ True = True\n\nSo, the truth value of the statement \"It is raining and it is not cold outside\" is True."
