    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle is also known as its circumference. The formula to find the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius of the circular garden is 7 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2πr\nC = 2 × 3.14159 × 7\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the garden is approximately 43.98 meters."
