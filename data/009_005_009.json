    "message_2": "To find the particular solution, we first need to find the complementary solution and then the particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation. Finally, we will apply the initial conditions to determine the constants.\n\n1. Complementary solution:\n\nThe complementary equation is given by:\n\n(LC)(d^2 V/dt^2) + (RC)(dV/dt) + V = 0\n\nLet's find the characteristic equation:\n\n(LC)m^2 + (RC)m + 1 = 0\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(0.2 * 10^-6)m^2 + (100 * 10^-6)m + 1 = 0\n\nSolve for m:\n\nm^2 + 500m + 5*10^6 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nm = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nm = (-500 ± √(500^2 - 4 * 5*10^6)) / 2\n\nm ≈ -250 ± 223.61i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the complementary solution is in the form:\n\nVc(t) = e^(-250t)(Acos(223.61t) + Bsin(223.61t))\n\n2. Particular solution:\n\nAssume a particular solution of the form:\n\nVp(t) = M*cos(50t) + N*sin(50t)\n\nDifferentiate Vp(t) with respect to t:\n\ndVp/dt = -50M*sin(50t) + 50N*cos(50t)\n\nDifferentiate dVp/dt with respect to t:\n\nd^2 Vp/dt^2 = -2500M*cos(50t) - 2500N*sin(50t)\n\nNow, substitute Vp(t) and its derivatives into the given differential equation:\n\n(LC)(d^2 Vp/dt^2) + (RC)(dVp/dt) + Vp = 100cos(50t)\n\n(0.2 * 10^-6)(-2500M*cos(50t) - 2500N*sin(50t)) + (100 * 10^-6)(-50M*sin(50t) + 50N*cos(50t)) + (M*cos(50t) + N*sin(50t)) = 100cos(50t)\n\nComparing the coefficients of cos(50t) and sin(50t), we get:\n\n-0.5M + 5N + M = 100\n-0.5N - 5M = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nM = 20\nN = 200\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nVp(t) = 20*cos(50t) + 200*sin(50t)\n\n3. General solution:\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\nV(t) = e^(-250t)(Acos(223.61t) + Bsin(223.61t)) + 20*cos(50t) + 200*sin(50t)\n\nNow, apply the initial conditions:\n\nV(0) = 0:\nA = -20\n\ndV/dt(0) = 0:\n-250B + 200 = 0\nB = 0.8\n\nSo, the particular solution that satisfies the initial conditions is:\n\nV(t) = e^(-250t)(-20cos(223.61t) + 0.8sin(223.61t)) + 20*cos(50t) + 200*sin(50t)"
