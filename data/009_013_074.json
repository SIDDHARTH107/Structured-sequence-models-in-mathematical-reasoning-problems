    "message_1": "Suppose the population of rabbits in a certain area is described by the Lotka-Volterra equation: \n\ndR/dt = 0.5R - 0.1RF\n\nwhere R is the population of rabbits and F is the population of foxes, with F = 50.\n\nAssume that at time t = 0, there are 200 rabbits in the area. Using the Lotka-Volterra equation, find the population of rabbits at t = 3 months.",
    "message_2": "To find the population of rabbits at t = 3 months, we need to solve the given differential equation:\n\ndR/dt = 0.5R - 0.1RF\n\nSince F is constant at 50, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndR/dt = 0.5R - 0.1R(50)\n\ndR/dt = 0.5R - 5R\n\ndR/dt = -4.5R\n\nNow, we can solve this first-order linear differential equation using separation of variables:\n\ndR/R = -4.5 dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/R) dR = ∫(-4.5) dt\n\nln|R| = -4.5t + C\n\nNow, solve for R:\n\nR(t) = e^(-4.5t + C)\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition R(0) = 200:\n\n200 = e^(0 + C)\n\nC = ln(200)\n\nSo, the equation for R(t) is:\n\nR(t) = e^(-4.5t + ln(200))\n\nNow, we can find the population of rabbits at t = 3 months:\n\nR(3) = e^(-4.5(3) + ln(200))\n\nR(3) ≈ 3.22\n\nAt t = 3 months, there are approximately 3 rabbits left in the area."
