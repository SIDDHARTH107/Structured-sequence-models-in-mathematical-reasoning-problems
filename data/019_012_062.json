    "message_1": "Sorry, I can not provide a numerical problem for the subtopic Paraconsistent logic as it deals with logic that allows for contradictions to coexist, and it is not based on numerical calculations. Instead, here is a question related to Paraconsistent logic:\n\nWhat is an example of a situation where two contradictory statements can both be true under the principles of Paraconsistent logic?",
    "message_2": "An example of a situation where two contradictory statements can both be true under the principles of Paraconsistent logic is the liar paradox. The liar paradox is a statement that says, \"This statement is false.\" \n\nIf we assume the statement is true, then it must be false, as it claims to be. However, if we assume the statement is false, then it must be true, as it accurately describes itself as being false. In classical logic, this creates a contradiction, as a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nHowever, under Paraconsistent logic, it is possible for a statement to be both true and false without creating an inconsistency. In this case, the liar paradox can be considered both true and false simultaneously, allowing for the coexistence of contradictory statements."
