    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after each iteration. It remains constant regardless of the number of iterations. To calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and S = 3 (each segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619.\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 5th iteration is approximately 1.2619."
