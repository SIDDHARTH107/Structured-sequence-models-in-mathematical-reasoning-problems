    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem from Linear Logic for a math student to solve: \n\nSuppose we have two propositions P and Q, such that the truth of P implies the truth of Q. If P has a truth value of 0.6, and the truth value of Q is unknown, what is the maximum possible truth value of Q?",
    "message_2": "Since the truth of P implies the truth of Q, we can represent this relationship as Q ≥ P. Given that P has a truth value of 0.6, we can write the inequality as:\n\nQ ≥ 0.6\n\nThere is no upper limit to the truth value of Q, as long as it is greater than or equal to 0.6. However, since truth values are typically represented on a scale from 0 to 1, the maximum possible truth value of Q would be 1."
