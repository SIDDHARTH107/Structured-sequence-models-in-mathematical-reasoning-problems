    "message_2": "To prove that there are only eight non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we will first use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 32 = 2^5, any group of order 32 must have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32. We will now examine the possible structures of these Sylow 2-subgroups and show that there are only eight non-isomorphic possibilities.\n\n1. Cyclic group: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be a cyclic group of order 32, denoted as C_32. This is the first non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the direct product of two cyclic groups, one of order 16 and one of order 2, denoted as C_16 x C_2. This is the second non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the direct product of three cyclic groups, one of order 8, one of order 4, and one of order 2, denoted as C_8 x C_4 x C_2. This is the third non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n4. Direct product of four cyclic groups: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the direct product of four cyclic groups, each of order 4, denoted as C_4 x C_4 x C_4 x C_4. This is the fourth non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n5. Direct product of five cyclic groups: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the direct product of five cyclic groups, each of order 2, denoted as C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2. This is the fifth non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n6. Quasidihedral group: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the quasidihedral group of order 32, denoted as QD_32. This is the sixth non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n7. Dihedral group: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the dihedral group of order 32, denoted as D_32. This is the seventh non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\n8. Semidirect product of C_16 and C_2: The Sylow 2-subgroup can be the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as C_16 ⋊ C_2. This is the eighth non-isomorphic group of order 32.\n\nWe have now shown that there are eight non-isomorphic groups of order 32. To classify them, we can list them as follows:\n\n1. C_32: Cyclic group of order 32\n2. C_16 x C_2: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2\n3. C_8 x C_4 x C_2: Direct product of a cyclic group of order 8, a cyclic group of order 4, and a cyclic group of order 2\n4. C_4 x C_4 x C_4 x C_4: Direct product of four cyclic groups, each of order 4\n5. C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2: Direct product of five cyclic groups, each of order 2\n6. QD_32: Quasidihedral group of order 32\n7. D_32: Dihedral group of order 32\n8. C_16 ⋊ C_2: Semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 2"
