    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski 3-simplex, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of triangles increases.\n\nIn the 0th iteration, there is only 1 tetrahedron, which has 4 faces (triangles).\n\nIn the 1st iteration, the original tetrahedron is divided into 4 smaller tetrahedra, each with 4 faces (triangles). So, there are 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, the total number of triangles is given by the formula:\n\nT(n) = 4^n * 4\n\nFor the 6th iteration, we have:\n\nT(6) = 4^6 * 4 = 16384 triangles."
