    "message_2": "To solve the given complex partial differential equation using the method of characteristics, we first rewrite the equation in terms of the real and imaginary parts of $z$ and $u$. Let $z = x + iy$ and $u(x, y) = u_1(x, y) + iu_2(x, y)$, where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are real-valued functions. Then, we have $\\overline{z} = x - iy$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given equation as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (u_1 + iu_2)}{\\partial (x - iy)} = 2\\frac{\\partial^2 (u_1 + iu_2)}{\\partial (x + iy) \\partial (x - iy)}.\n$$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y} + i\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial y^2} + 2i\\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right).\n$$\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get two real partial differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial y^2}\\right),\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x} = 2\\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial x \\partial y}.\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the method of characteristics. For the first equation, we have the characteristic equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1, \\hspace{5mm} \\frac{dy}{dt} = 1, \\hspace{5mm} \\frac{du_1}{dt} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial y^2}\\right).\n$$\n\nSolving the first two equations, we get $x = t + x_0$ and $y = t + y_0$, where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are constants. Thus, the first equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{du_1}{dt} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial (t + x_0)^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial (t + y_0)^2}\\right).\n$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $t$, we obtain:\n$$\nu_1(t + x_0, t + y_0) = \\int_0^t 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial (s + x_0)^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_1}{\\partial (s + y_0)^2}\\right) ds + F(x_0, y_0),\n$$\nwhere $F(x_0, y_0)$ is an arbitrary function of $x_0$ and $y_0$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation, we have the characteristic equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1, \\hspace{5mm} \\frac{dy}{dt} = -1, \\hspace{5mm} \\frac{du_2}{dt} = 2\\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial x \\partial y}.\n$$\n\nSolving the first two equations, we get $x = t + x_0$ and $y = -t + y_0$, where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are constants. Thus, the second equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{du_2}{dt} = 2\\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial (t + x_0) \\partial (-t + y_0)}.\n$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $t$, we obtain:\n$$\nu_2(t + x_0, -t + y_0) = \\int_0^t 2\\frac{\\partial^2 u_2}{\\partial (s + x_0) \\partial (-s + y_0)} ds + G(x_0, y_0),\n$$\nwhere $G(x_0, y_0)$ is an arbitrary function of $x_0$ and $y_0$.\n\nFinally, the general solution of the given complex partial differential equation is:\n$$\nu(x, y) = u_1(x, y) + iu_2(x, y) = F(x - y, x + y) + iG(x + y, x - y).\n$$"
