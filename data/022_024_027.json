    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use separation of variables and Fourier series. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by XYT:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = X''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y)\n\nSince the left side is only a function of t and the right side is only a function of x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = X''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nY''(y) + (λ - k^2)Y(y) = 0\n\nwith boundary conditions X(0) = X(π) = 0 and initial condition u(x, y, 0) = cos(x) + i sin(x).\n\nSolving the first ODE for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A sin(√λ x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we find that √λ = n, where n is an integer. Thus, λ = n^2 and X(x) = A sin(nx).\n\nNow, solving the second ODE for Y(y), we get:\n\nY(y) = B cosh(√(n^2 - k^2)y) + C sinh(√(n^2 - k^2)y)\n\nSince u(x, 0, t) = 0, we have Y(0) = 0, which implies B = 0. Thus, Y(y) = C sinh(√(n^2 - k^2)y).\n\nNow, the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑[A_n sin(nx) sinh(√(n^2 - k^2)y) e^(-n^2t)]\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = cos(x) + i sin(x), we get:\n\ncos(x) + i sin(x) = ∑[A_n sin(nx) sinh(√(n^2 - k^2)y)]\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(nx), we find that A_n = (2/π)∫[0, π] (cos(x) + i sin(x)) sin(nx) dx.\n\nComputing the integral, we get:\n\nA_n = (2/π)[(-1)^n/n - i(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^2 - 1)]\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(x, y, t) at time t = π/4 as:\n\nu(x, y, π/4) = ∑[((-1)^n/n - i(1 - (-1)^n)/(n^2 - 1)) sin(nx) sinh(√(n^2 - k^2)y) e^(-n^2π/4)]\n\nThis is the solution to the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions at time t = π/4."
