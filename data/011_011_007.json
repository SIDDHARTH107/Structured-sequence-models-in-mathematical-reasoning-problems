    "message_1": "A common variation on the classic \"partition problem\" involves finding the number of ways to partition a given set of numbers into two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal. \n\nFor example, suppose you have the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. In how many ways can you partition this set into two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the total sum of the given set and check if it's even because if the sum is odd, it's impossible to divide the set into two equal subsets.\n\nThe given set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The sum of the elements in the set is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is an odd number. Therefore, it is impossible to partition this set into two subsets with equal sums. \n\nSo, the answer is 0 ways."
