The production cost of each chair type, and the proportion of the market demand for each type are given in the following table:\n\n| Chair Type | Production Cost ($) | Market Demand (%) |\n|------------|----------------:|------------------:|\n| 1          |            50 |                20% |\n| 2          |            40 |                25% |\n| 3          |            60 |                15% |\n| 4          |            80 |                10% |\n| 5          |            70 |                30% |\n\nThe factory wants to allocate its resources in such a way that production cost is minimized, and at least 20% of each type of chair is produced to meet the market demand. What is the minimum total production cost that the factory can achieve while meeting the market demand requirements?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum total production cost, we need to determine the cost of producing at least 20% of each type of chair. Since the market demand for each chair type is already at least 20% (except for chair type 4), we can use the given market demand percentages to calculate the minimum production cost.\n\nLet's assume the factory produces 100 chairs in total. Then, the number of chairs produced for each type based on the market demand percentages would be:\n\nChair Type 1: 20 chairs (20% of 100)\nChair Type 2: 25 chairs (25% of 100)\nChair Type 3: 15 chairs (15% of 100)\nChair Type 4: 20 chairs (20% of 100, to meet the minimum requirement)\nChair Type 5: 30 chairs (30% of 100)\n\nNow, we can calculate the production cost for each chair type:\n\nChair Type 1: 20 chairs * $50 = $1000\nChair Type 2: 25 chairs * $40 = $1000\nChair Type 3: 15 chairs * $60 = $900\nChair Type 4: 20 chairs * $80 = $1600\nChair Type 5: 30 chairs * $70 = $2100\n\nFinally, we can find the minimum total production cost by adding the production costs of all chair types:\n\nMinimum Total Production Cost = $1000 + $1000 + $900 + $1600 + $2100 = $6600\n\nSo, the minimum total production cost that the factory can achieve while meeting the market demand requirements is $6600."
