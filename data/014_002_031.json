Their shared public parameters are a prime number p = 23 and a generator g = 5. Alice's private key is a = 6 and Bob's private key is b = 15. What is the value of the shared secret key that they can use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "To compute the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes his public key B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key S = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key S = A^b mod p\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1. A = 5^6 mod 23\n   A = 15625 mod 23\n   A = 8\n\n2. B = 5^15 mod 23\n   B = 30517578125 mod 23\n   B = 19\n\n3. S_Alice = 19^6 mod 23\n   S_Alice = 47045881 mod 23\n   S_Alice = 2\n\n4. S_Bob = 8^15 mod 23\n   S_Bob = 35184372088832 mod 23\n   S_Bob = 2\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have computed the same shared secret key, S = 2. They can now use this key for secure communication."
