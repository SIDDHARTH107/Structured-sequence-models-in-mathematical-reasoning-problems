    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x, we first need to find the second derivative of the function.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), represents the slope of the tangent line to the function at any given point. The second derivative, f''(x), represents the concavity of the function.\n\n1. Find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 9x) = 3x^2 - 9\n\n2. Find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 9) = 6x\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined, as these are potential inflection points.\n\n6x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, there is a potential inflection point at x = 0. To confirm that it is indeed an inflection point, we need to check if the concavity changes sign around this point.\n\nChoose test points on either side of x = 0, say x = -1 and x = 1.\n\nf''(-1) = 6(-1) = -6 (concave down)\nf''(1) = 6(1) = 6 (concave up)\n\nSince the concavity changes from down to up, there is an inflection point at x = 0. Now, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging this value back into the original function:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0) = 0\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (0, 0)."
