    "message_2": "For a Calabi-Yau threefold X, the Euler characteristic χ(X) can be expressed in terms of Hodge numbers as follows:\n\nχ(X) = 2(h^{0,0} - h^{1,0} + h^{2,0} - h^{3,0}) + 2(h^{1,1} - h^{2,1}).\n\nSince X is a Calabi-Yau threefold, it has a trivial canonical bundle, which implies that h^{1,0}(X) = h^{2,0}(X) = h^{3,0}(X) = 0. Moreover, h^{0,0}(X) = 1, as it represents the constant functions on X.\n\nNow, we are given that h^{2,1}(X) = 101. We can use the Euler characteristic formula to find the value of h^{1,1}(X). The Euler characteristic of a Calabi-Yau threefold is 0, so we have:\n\n0 = 2(1 - 0 + 0 - 0) + 2(h^{1,1} - 101)\n0 = 2 + 2(h^{1,1} - 101)\n-2 = 2(h^{1,1} - 101)\n-1 = h^{1,1} - 101\n\nTherefore, the Hodge number h^{1,1}(X) is equal to 100."
