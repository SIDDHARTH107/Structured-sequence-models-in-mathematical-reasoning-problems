    "message_1": "A mass-spring system has a mass of 0.5kg attached to a spring with a spring constant of 10 N/m. It is displaced from its equilibrium position by 0.1m and then released. Find the frequency, natural frequency, amplitude, and period of the resulting oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency, natural frequency, amplitude, and period of the resulting oscillation, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Natural frequency (ω) = sqrt(k/m)\n2. Frequency (f) = ω / 2π\n3. Period (T) = 1 / f\n4. Amplitude (A) is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nGiven:\nMass (m) = 0.5 kg\nSpring constant (k) = 10 N/m\nDisplacement (A) = 0.1 m\n\n1. Natural frequency (ω):\nω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(10/0.5) = sqrt(20) = 4.47 rad/s\n\n2. Frequency (f):\nf = ω / 2π = 4.47 / (2 * 3.14159265) = 0.711 Hz\n\n3. Period (T):\nT = 1 / f = 1 / 0.711 = 1.406 s\n\n4. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is given as the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, which is 0.1 m.\n\nSo, the natural frequency is 4.47 rad/s, the frequency is 0.711 Hz, the amplitude is 0.1 m, and the period is 1.406 s."
