    "message_2": "The period-doubling bifurcation diagram shown is for the logistic map, which is defined by the following function:\n\nx_{n+1} = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the value of the function at the nth iteration, and r is the control parameter.\n\nTo find the fixed points for a given value of r, we need to solve the equation:\n\nx = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nFor r = 3.56995, the equation becomes:\n\nx = 3.56995 * x * (1 - x)\n\nTo find the fixed points, we can rearrange the equation and solve for x:\n\nx - 3.56995 * x^2 + 3.56995 * x^3 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and we can factor out x:\n\nx * (1 - 3.56995 * x + 3.56995 * x^2) = 0\n\nThis equation has three solutions: x = 0, and the two other fixed points that we need to find. To find the other fixed points, we can solve the quadratic equation:\n\n1 - 3.56995 * x + 3.56995 * x^2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 3.56995, b = -3.56995, and c = 1. We get:\n\nx = (3.56995 ± √((-3.56995)^2 - 4 * 3.56995 * 1)) / (2 * 3.56995)\n\nx = (3.56995 ± √(12.748)) / 7.1399\n\nx ≈ 0.13198, 0.86802\n\nSo, the two different fixed points for the control parameter value of 3.56995 are approximately x ≈ 0.13198 and x ≈ 0.86802."
