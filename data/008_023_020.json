    "message_2": "To find the maximum error bound for the solution vector (x, y, z), we first need to solve the system of linear equations and then consider the effect of the measurement error on the coefficients of the x-variable.\n\n1. Solve the system of linear equations:\n\nWe can use the matrix method to solve the system of linear equations. The augmented matrix for the system is:\n\n| 3  4 -1 | 5 |\n| 2 -1  4 | 7 |\n| 5  2  3 |15 |\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, we can find the reduced row echelon form:\n\n| 1  0  0 | x |\n| 0  1  0 | y |\n| 0  0  1 | z |\n\nThe solution is (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Consider the effect of the measurement error on the coefficients of the x-variable:\n\nNow, we need to consider the effect of the +/- 0.1 error on the coefficients of the x-variable. We can do this by finding the partial derivatives of the solution with respect to the coefficients of the x-variable and then multiplying by the error.\n\nLet's denote the coefficients of the x-variable as a, b, and c, so the system of linear equations becomes:\n\na * x + 4y - z = 5\nb * x - y + 4z = 7\nc * x + 2y + 3z = 15\n\nNow we need to find the partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to a, b, and c:\n\n∂x/∂a, ∂x/∂b, ∂x/∂c\n∂y/∂a, ∂y/∂b, ∂y/∂c\n∂z/∂a, ∂z/∂b, ∂z/∂c\n\nComputing these partial derivatives analytically can be quite complex. However, we can estimate the maximum error bound by using numerical methods, such as the finite difference method.\n\nFor example, we can compute the partial derivatives using the central difference method:\n\n∂x/∂a ≈ (x(a+0.1) - x(a-0.1))/0.2\n∂x/∂b ≈ (x(b+0.1) - x(b-0.1))/0.2\n∂x/∂c ≈ (x(c+0.1) - x(c-0.1))/0.2\n\nAnd similarly for y and z.\n\n3. Compute the maximum error bound:\n\nFinally, we can compute the maximum error bound for the solution vector (x, y, z) by multiplying the partial derivatives by the error and summing the absolute values:\n\nError_x = |∂x/∂a * 0.1| + |∂x/∂b * 0.1| + |∂x/∂c * 0.1|\nError_y = |∂y/∂a * 0.1| + |∂y/∂b * 0.1| + |∂y/∂c * 0.1|\nError_z = |∂z/∂a * 0.1| + |∂z/∂b * 0.1| + |∂z/∂c * 0.1|\n\nThe maximum error bound for the solution vector (x, y, z) is (Error_x, Error_y, Error_z).\n\nNote that this is an approximation, and the actual maximum error bound may be slightly different. However, this method provides a reasonable estimate of the maximum error bound due to the measurement error in the coefficients of the x-variable."
