    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, at each iteration, the structure is divided into 5 self-similar pieces (N = 5) and the scaling factor is 3 (s = 3) since each side is divided into 3 equal parts.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a step size of 1 and iteration order of 3 is approximately 1.465."
