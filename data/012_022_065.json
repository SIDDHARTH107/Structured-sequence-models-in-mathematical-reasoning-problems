    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,4) is the smallest number of vertices needed in a graph to guarantee either a complete graph of 3 vertices (a triangle) or an independent set of 4 vertices (no edges between them). To find R(3,4), we can use the recursive formula for Ramsey numbers:\n\nR(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) - 1\n\nFirst, we need to find the base cases R(2,4) and R(3,3):\n\nR(2,4) = 4, because a graph with 4 vertices guarantees either a complete graph of 2 vertices (an edge) or an independent set of 4 vertices.\n\nR(3,3) = 6, because a graph with 6 vertices guarantees either a complete graph of 3 vertices (a triangle) or an independent set of 3 vertices.\n\nNow we can use the formula to find R(3,4):\n\nR(3,4) = R(2,4) + R(3,3) - 1\nR(3,4) = 4 + 6 - 1\nR(3,4) = 9\n\nSo, the Ramsey number R(3,4) is 9. This means that in a graph with 9 vertices, there is always either a complete graph of 3 vertices (a triangle) or an independent set of 4 vertices."
