    "message_1": "Here's a question in Birational geometry with a numerical problem:\n\nConsider the affine plane curve defined by the equation $f(x,y) = x^3 - y^3 -3xy^2 +3x^2y = 0$. Find all the points on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the line $y = 2x$.\n\nGood luck with the solution!",
    "message_2": "To find the points on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the line $y = 2x$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$. These partial derivatives will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nWe have $f(x,y) = x^3 - y^3 - 3xy^2 + 3x^2y$. Computing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2 + 6xy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -3y^2 - 6xy + 3x^2$\n\nNow, the slope of the tangent line at a point $(x,y)$ on the curve is given by the ratio of these partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}$\n\nWe want this slope to be equal to the slope of the line $y = 2x$, which is $2$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2 = \\frac{-3y^2 - 6xy + 3x^2}{3x^2 - 3y^2 + 6xy}$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$-6y^2 - 12xy + 6x^2 = 6x^2 - 6y^2 + 12xy$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$24xy = 12xy$\n\nDividing both sides by $12$, we get:\n\n$2x = y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points on the curve $f(x,y) = 0$ that satisfy this equation. Substituting $y = 2x$ into the equation for the curve, we get:\n\n$x^3 - (2x)^3 - 3x(2x)^2 + 3x^2(2x) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$x^3 - 8x^3 - 12x^3 + 6x^3 = 0$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$-13x^3 = 0$\n\nThus, $x = 0$. Since $y = 2x$, we also have $y = 0$. Therefore, the only point on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the line $y = 2x$ is $(0,0)$."
