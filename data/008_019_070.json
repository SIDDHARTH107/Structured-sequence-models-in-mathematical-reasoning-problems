    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equations:\n\n(1) 2x + 3y + iz = 5 + 2i\n(2) 3x - 4y + 5iz = -9 - 7i\n(3) x - y - z = 1 + 3i\n\nWe will eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (3) by 3 and then subtract it from equation (2):\n\n3 * (3): 3x - 3y - 3z = 3 + 9i\n(2) - 3 * (3): (3x - 4y + 5iz) - (3x - 3y - 3z) = (-9 - 7i) - (3 + 9i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-y + 8iz = -12 - 16i\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from equations (1) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (3) by 2 and then subtract it from equation (1):\n\n2 * (3): 2x - 2y - 2z = 2 + 6i\n(1) - 2 * (3): (2x + 3y + iz) - (2x - 2y - 2z) = (5 + 2i) - (2 + 6i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5y + 3iz = 3 - 4i\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two complex variables y and z:\n\n(4) -y + 8iz = -12 - 16i\n(5) 5y + 3iz = 3 - 4i\n\nWe will eliminate y from equations (4) and (5). To do this, we will multiply equation (4) by 5 and add it to equation (5):\n\n5 * (4): -5y + 40iz = -60 - 80i\n(5) + 5 * (4): (5y + 3iz) + (-5y + 40iz) = (3 - 4i) + (-60 - 80i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n43iz = -57 - 84i\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = (-57 - 84i) / 43i\n\nz = (-57 - 84i) * (-i) / (43i * (-i))\n\nz = (84 - 57i) / 43\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into equation (4) or (5) to find y. We will use equation (5):\n\n5y + 3i(84 - 57i) = 3 - 4i\n\n5y + 252i + 171 = 3 - 4i\n\n5y = -168 + 61i\n\ny = (-168 + 61i) / 5\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute y and z back into equation (3) to find x:\n\nx - (-168 + 61i) / 5 - (84 - 57i) / 43 = 1 + 3i\n\nx = (1 + 3i) + (168 - 61i) / 5 + (84 - 57i) / 43\n\nx = (1 + 3i) + (336 - 122i) / 10 + (84 - 57i) / 43\n\nx = (1 + 3i) + (33.6 - 12.2i) + (1.953488372093023 - 1.325581395348837i)\n\nx = 36.55348837209302 - 10.52558139534884i\n\nSo the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 36.55348837209302 - 10.52558139534884i\ny = -168/5 + 61/5i\nz = 84/43 - 57/43i"
