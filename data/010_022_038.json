    "message_2": "Let's consider a point P on the surface of the sphere. As the sphere rolls through one complete rotation, the point P will trace out a curve on the horizontal plane. To find the area of the region swept out by point P, we can think of it as the area of the curve traced by P.\n\nWhen the sphere rolls, the point P will move along a circle with a radius equal to the diameter of the sphere. This is because the sphere is rolling without slipping, so the point P will move along a circle with a diameter equal to the sphere's diameter.\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is 2 * radius = 2 * 5 cm = 10 cm. Therefore, the radius of the circle traced by point P is 10 cm.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula A = π * r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nSo, the area of the region swept out by point P is:\n\nA = π * (10 cm)^2 = 100π cm^2.\n\nThus, the area of the region swept out by a point on the surface of the sphere as it rolls through one complete rotation is 100π cm^2."
