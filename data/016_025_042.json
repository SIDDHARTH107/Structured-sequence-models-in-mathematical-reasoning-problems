    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing triangles from an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the remaining triangles are divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, and the central triangle is removed (shaded). \n\nThe number of non-shaded triangles in the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of non-shaded triangles = (3^n - 3) / 2\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of non-shaded triangles = (3^5 - 3) / 2\nNumber of non-shaded triangles = (243 - 3) / 2\nNumber of non-shaded triangles = 240 / 2\nNumber of non-shaded triangles = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 non-shaded triangles in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski sieve."
