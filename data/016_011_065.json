    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. In a Vicsek fractal, we start with a single line segment. In each iteration, we divide each line segment into 4 equal parts and remove the middle two, leaving 2 line segments for each original segment.\n\nLet n be the number of iterations, and L(n) be the number of line segments after n iterations.\n\nFor the first iteration (n=1), we have:\nL(1) = 2 line segments\n\nFor the second iteration (n=2), we have:\nL(2) = 2 * L(1) = 2 * 2 = 4 line segments\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, we have:\nL(n) = 2 * L(n-1)\n\nWe are given that L(n) = 375 line segments. We need to find the iteration number n.\n\n375 = 2 * L(n-1)\nL(n-1) = 375/2 = 187.5\n\nSince the number of line segments must be an integer, there is no such iteration number n that would generate a Vicsek fractal with exactly 375 line segments using the given self-similarity rule."
