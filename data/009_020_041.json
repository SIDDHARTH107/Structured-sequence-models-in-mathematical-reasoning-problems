    "message_2": "To find the optimal control u(t) that minimizes the cost functional, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we define the Hamiltonian function H as follows:\n\nH(x, u, p) = (x - 5)^2 + u^2 + p(x + u + 1)\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable. According to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. The state equation: x'(t) = ∂H/∂p = x(t) + u(t) + 1\n2. The costate equation: p'(t) = -∂H/∂x = -2(x(t) - 5)\n3. The optimal control condition: ∂H/∂u = 0\n\nNow, we find the optimal control u(t) by solving the third condition:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u(t) + p(t) = 0\n=> u(t) = -p(t)/2\n\nNext, we solve the state and costate equations simultaneously:\n\nx'(t) = x(t) - p(t)/2 + 1\np'(t) = -2(x(t) - 5)\n\nWe can solve these equations using the given initial condition x(0) = 2:\n\nx'(t) = x(t) + 1 - p(t)/2\np'(t) = -2(x(t) - 5)\n\nLet's solve these equations using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor for the first equation is e^(∫1 dt) = e^t. Multiply the first equation by e^t:\n\ne^t * x'(t) - e^t * x(t) = e^t - e^t * p(t)/2\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(e^t * x'(t) - e^t * x(t)) dt = ∫(e^t - e^t * p(t)/2) dt\n\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\n\nx(t) * e^t = e^t * t - (1/2) * ∫e^t * p(t) dt + C1\n\nNow, we can find x(t) by dividing both sides by e^t:\n\nx(t) = t - (1/2) * ∫e^(-t) * p(t) dt + C1 * e^(-t)\n\nNext, we solve the second equation:\n\np'(t) = -2(x(t) - 5)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\np(t) = -2 * ∫(x(t) - 5) dt + C2\n\nNow, we can substitute x(t) from the previous equation:\n\np(t) = -2 * ∫(t - (1/2) * ∫e^(-t) * p(t) dt + C1 * e^(-t) - 5) dt + C2\n\nThis is a difficult integral to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to solve this integral and find the optimal control u(t) = -p(t)/2 that minimizes the cost functional."
