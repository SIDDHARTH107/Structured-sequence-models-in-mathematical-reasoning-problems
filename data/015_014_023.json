    "message_2": "There is no definitive answer to the minimum number of variables needed to accurately model the weather system using chaos theory, as weather is an incredibly complex and dynamic system. However, the more variables that are included in the model, the more accurate the predictions will be. Some of the key variables to consider include temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation."
