    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of machines, A and B. Each machine requires a maximum of 10 hours of labor per day. The company has a total of 120 hours of labor per day available. A machine of type A requires 4 hours of labor and generates a profit of $40, while a machine of type B requires 5 hours of labor and generates a profit of $50. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many machines of each type should the company produce per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of machines of type A and y be the number of machines of type B. The company's objective is to maximize its profit, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nProfit = 40x + 50y\n\nThe labor constraint can be represented by the equation:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 120\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region and the corner points to apply the linear programming method. Rearranging the labor constraint equation, we get:\n\ny ≤ (120 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\ny ≤ (120 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 24), and (30, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0): 40(0) + 50(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 24): 40(0) + 50(24) = $1200\n3. Profit at (30, 0): 40(30) + 50(0) = $1200\n\nBoth corner points (0, 24) and (30, 0) give the maximum profit of $1200. This means the company can either produce 24 machines of type B or 30 machines of type A per day to maximize its profit."
