We will show that each of these groups is isomorphic to one of the following types: the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\n1. Cyclic group C16: This group has a single generator, and every element can be expressed as a power of the generator. It is abelian and has order 16.\n\n2. Dihedral group D8: This group is the group of symmetries of a regular octagon, including rotations and reflections. It has order 16 and is non-abelian.\n\n3-14. Non-abelian groups of order 16: There are 12 non-abelian groups of order 16 up to isomorphism. These groups can be constructed using the following methods:\n\na) Direct products of smaller groups: For example, the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, denoted as C4 × C4, is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nb) Semidirect products of smaller groups: For example, the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 4, denoted as C4 ⋊ C4, is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nc) Extensions of smaller groups: For example, the extension of a cyclic group of order 4 by a cyclic group of order 4, denoted as C4 : C4, is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nd) Quaternion group Q16: This group is generated by two elements i and j, with relations i^4 = j^4 = 1 and ij = -ji. It is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nEach of these non-abelian groups of order 16 is distinct up to isomorphism, and they are not isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16 or the dihedral group D8.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 14 distinct groups of order 16 up to isomorphism, and each of these groups is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or one of the 12 non-abelian groups of order 16."
