    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit obtained from each product is $5 and $8, respectively. The production of each unit of A requires 2 units of material X and 1 unit of material Y. The production of each unit of B requires 4 units of material X and 2 units of material Y. The company has 20 units of material X and 16 units of material Y available for production. Determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by producing products A and B, using Harmony Search optimization technique.",
    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) optimization technique is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this problem, we will use the HS algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B that maximize the profit while considering the constraints on materials X and Y.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 5x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 20 (material X constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 16 (material Y constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo apply the HS algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the Harmony Memory (HM): Create a set of random solutions (x, y) that satisfy the constraints. For example, let's create 5 random solutions:\n\nHM = {(0, 0), (2, 3), (4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0)}\n\n2. Improvise a new harmony: Generate a new solution (x', y') by selecting values from the existing solutions in HM and applying a pitch adjustment. For example, let's say we generate (4, 1) as a new solution.\n\n3. Update the Harmony Memory: If the new solution (x', y') has a better objective function value (higher profit) than the worst solution in HM, replace the worst solution with the new solution. In this case, (4, 1) has a profit of 28, which is better than the worst solution (0, 0) with a profit of 0. So, we update HM:\n\nHM = {(2, 3), (4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0), (4, 1)}\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the HS algorithm for a sufficient number of iterations, we will obtain an optimal or near-optimal solution for the problem. In this case, let's say the optimal solution found by the HS algorithm is (4, 2), which corresponds to producing 4 units of product A and 2 units of product B.\n\nThe maximum profit that can be obtained is:\n\nProfit = 5(4) + 8(2) = 20 + 16 = $36"
