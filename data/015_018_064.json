For the specific values δ = 0.1, α = -1, β = 1, γ = 0.3, ω = 1.2, and initial conditions x(0) = 0.5, dx/dt(0) = 0.5, find the time when the displacement from equilibrium reaches 1 for the first time.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use a numerical method called the Runge-Kutta method (specifically, the 4th order Runge-Kutta method) to approximate the solution of the Duffing oscillator's differential equation. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = v\ndv/dt = γ cos(ωt) - δv - αx - βx³\n\nNow, let's implement the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations:\n\n1. Define the given parameters and initial conditions:\n\nδ = 0.1\nα = -1\nβ = 1\nγ = 0.3\nω = 1.2\nx(0) = 0.5\nv(0) = 0.5\n\n2. Define the functions for the system of equations:\n\ndxdt = lambda x, v, t: v\ndvdt = lambda x, v, t: γ * np.cos(ω * t) - δ * v - α * x - β * x**3\n\n3. Implement the 4th order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef runge_kutta_4th(x0, v0, dxdt, dvdt, t0, tf, h):\n    t = np.arange(t0, tf, h)\n    x = np.zeros(len(t))\n    v = np.zeros(len(t))\n    x[0] = x0\n    v[0] = v0\n\n    for i in range(1, len(t)):\n        k1_x = h * dxdt(x[i-1], v[i-1], t[i-1])\n        k1_v = h * dvdt(x[i-1], v[i-1], t[i-1])\n\n        k2_x = h * dxdt(x[i-1] + k1_x/2, v[i-1] + k1_v/2, t[i-1] + h/2)\n        k2_v = h * dvdt(x[i-1] + k1_x/2, v[i-1] + k1_v/2, t[i-1] + h/2)\n\n        k3_x = h * dxdt(x[i-1] + k2_x/2, v[i-1] + k2_v/2, t[i-1] + h/2)\n        k3_v = h * dvdt(x[i-1] + k2_x/2, v[i-1] + k2_v/2, t[i-1] + h/2)\n\n        k4_x = h * dxdt(x[i-1] + k3_x, v[i-1] + k3_v, t[i-1] + h)\n        k4_v = h * dvdt(x[i-1] + k3_x, v[i-1] + k3_v, t[i-1] + h)\n\n        x[i] = x[i-1] + (k1_x + 2*k2_x + 2*k3_x + k4_x) / 6\n        v[i] = v[i-1] + (k1_v + 2*k2_v + 2*k3_v + k4_v) / 6\n\n    return t, x, v\n```\n\n4. Find the time when the displacement from equilibrium reaches 1 for the first time:\n\n```python\nt0 = 0\ntf = 100\nh = 0.01\nt, x, v = runge_kutta_4th(0.5, 0.5, dxdt, dvdt, t0, tf, h)\n\nfor i in range(len(x)):\n    if x[i] >= 1:\n        break\n\nfirst_time = t[i]\n```\n\nThe variable `first_time` will contain the approximate time when the displacement from equilibrium reaches 1 for the first time. Note that the accuracy of the result depends on the step size `h` and the range of the time interval `[t0, tf]`. You can adjust these values to improve the accuracy of the result."
