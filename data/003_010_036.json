    "message_2": "To determine the height of the building using trigonometry, we can use the tangent function. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the building) to the adjacent side (distance from the building).\n\nLet h be the height of the building. We are given that the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the building is 20 meters. We can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(45) = h / 20\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = h / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 20 * 1\nh = 20 meters\n\nHowever, this is the difference in height between your eye level and the top of the building. Since the building is 50 meters tall, the height of the building remains unchanged. Therefore, the height of the building is 50 meters."
