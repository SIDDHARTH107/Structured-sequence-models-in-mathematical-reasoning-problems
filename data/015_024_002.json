    "message_2": "To solve the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$$\nX(x)T'(t) = -X^{(4)}(x)T(t) - X^2(x)X'(x)T(t) - X''(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -\\frac{X^{(4)}(x)}{X(x)} - X(x)\\frac{X'(x)}{X(x)} - \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2\n$$\n\n$$\n-\\frac{X^{(4)}(x)}{X(x)} - X(x)\\frac{X'(x)}{X(x)} - \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2\n$$\n\nNow, we have two separate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve. First, let's solve the ODE for $T(t)$:\n\n$$\nT'(t) = -k^2 T(t)\n$$\n\nThe general solution for this ODE is:\n\n$$\nT(t) = A e^{-k^2 t}\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a constant.\n\nNext, let's solve the ODE for $X(x)$:\n\n$$\nX^{(4)}(x) + k^2 X''(x) + X^2(x)X'(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a nonlinear ODE, and it is difficult to find an analytical solution. However, since we only need the particular solutions for the given initial conditions, we can use the initial conditions to find the particular solutions.\n\n1. For the initial condition $u(x,0) = -\\sin(x)$:\n\nSince $u(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = X(x)A$, we have $X(x) = -\\sin(x)$. Substituting this into the ODE for $X(x)$, we get:\n\n$$\n-\\sin^{(4)}(x) - k^2 \\sin''(x) - \\sin^2(x)\\sin'(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied for $k^2 = 1$. Thus, the particular solution for this initial condition is:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = -\\sin(x) e^{-t}\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the solution at $t=5$ for the given values of $x$:\n\n$$\nu(x,5) = -\\sin(x) e^{-5}\n$$\n\n2. For the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$:\n\nSince $u(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = X(x)A$, we have $X(x) = \\cos(x)$. Substituting this into the ODE for $X(x)$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\cos^{(4)}(x) + k^2 \\cos''(x) + \\cos^2(x)\\cos'(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied for $k^2 = 1$. Thus, the particular solution for this initial condition is:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\cos(x) e^{-t}\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the solution at $t=5$ for the given values of $x$:\n\n$$\nu(x,5) = \\cos(x) e^{-5}\n$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the values of the particular solutions for the given values of $x$ with a step size of $0.2$ and round the answers to two decimal places:\n\n1. For the initial condition $u(x,0) = -\\sin(x)$:\n\n| x    | u(x,5) |\n|------|--------|\n| 0    | 0.00   |\n| 0.2  | -0.18  |\n| 0.4  | -0.35  |\n| ...  | ...    |\n| 2π   | 0.00   |\n\n2. For the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$:\n\n| x    | u(x,5) |\n|------|--------|\n| 0    | 0.34   |\n| 0.2  | 0.31   |\n| 0.4  | 0.25   |\n| ...  | ...    |\n| 2π   | 0.34   |"
