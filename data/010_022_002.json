    "message_2": "To find the total arc length of the curve, we need to integrate the speed of the curve with respect to time. The speed of the curve is given by the formula:\n\nv(t) = R(t) * |K(t)|\n\nwhere R(t) is the radius of curvature at time t, and K(t) is the curvature at time t. Since K(t) = 4cos(t) + 2, we have:\n\nv(t) = R(t) * |4cos(t) + 2|\n\nNow, we know that the radius of curvature R(t) is related to the curvature K(t) by the formula:\n\nR(t) = 1 / K(t)\n\nSo, we can substitute this into the formula for v(t):\n\nv(t) = (1 / (4cos(t) + 2)) * |4cos(t) + 2|\n\nSince 0 <= t < pi/2, cos(t) is always positive in this interval, so we don't need the absolute value:\n\nv(t) = 1 / (4cos(t) + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the total arc length by integrating v(t) with respect to time from 0 to pi/2:\n\nArc length = ∫(1 / (4cos(t) + 2)) dt from 0 to pi/2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = 4cos(t) + 2. Then, du = -4sin(t) dt. We also need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nu(0) = 4cos(0) + 2 = 6\nu(pi/2) = 4cos(pi/2) + 2 = 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nArc length = -1/4 ∫(1 / u) du from 6 to 2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nArc length = -1/4 [ln(u)] from 6 to 2\n\nArc length = -1/4 [ln(2) - ln(6)]\n\nArc length = -1/4 [ln(1/3)]\n\nArc length = 1/4 ln(3)\n\nSo, the total arc length of the curve for 0 <= t < pi/2 is (1/4)ln(3)."
