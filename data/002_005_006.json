    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of its longest diagonal? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(10² + 8² + 6²)\nDiagonal length = √(100 + 64 + 36)\nDiagonal length = √200\n\nNow, we can approximate the square root of 200:\n\nDiagonal length ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
