    "message_2": "To find the probability of passing the quiz if a student studies for exactly 2.5 hours, we can use linear interpolation between the given probabilities at 2 hours and 3 hours.\n\nLet x be the number of hours studied and y be the probability of passing the quiz. We have two points: (2, 0.5) and (3, 0.8).\n\nThe slope of the line between these two points is:\n\nm = (0.8 - 0.5) / (3 - 2) = 0.3\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - 0.5 = 0.3(x - 2)\n\nWe want to find the probability of passing the quiz when studying for 2.5 hours, so we plug in x = 2.5:\n\ny - 0.5 = 0.3(2.5 - 2)\n\ny - 0.5 = 0.3(0.5)\n\ny - 0.5 = 0.15\n\ny = 0.65\n\nSo, the probability of passing the quiz if a student studies for exactly 2.5 hours is 0.65."
