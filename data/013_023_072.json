    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, Player A is given $10 and must decide how much to give to Player B. Player B is then given the amount that Player A gives and must decide how much of it to return to Player A. If Player B returns nothing, then Player A loses the amount that they gave away. If Player B returns the full amount, then both players end up with $10 each. If Player B returns a fraction of the amount, then Player A and Player B end up with the amounts left after the fractions are returned. If Player A gives $4, what amount should Player B return to maximize the total amount that both players end up with?",
    "message_2": "If Player A gives $4 to Player B, then Player A is left with $6. To maximize the total amount that both players end up with, Player B should return the full $4 to Player A. This way, both players will have $10 each, resulting in a total of $20 for both players."
