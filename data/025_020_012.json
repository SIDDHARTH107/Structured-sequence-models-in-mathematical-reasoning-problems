    "message_1": "Let X be a Calabi-Yau variety of dimension d=3. Suppose X is given by the equations:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0\nx^2y + xy^2 + x^2z + xz^2 + y^2z + yz^2 = 0\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 - txyz = 0\n\nDetermine the degree of X in terms of t.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of X in terms of t, we first need to find the degrees of the individual equations. The degree of an equation is the highest total degree of any term in the equation.\n\nFor the first equation, x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0, the degree is 3, as the highest total degree of any term is x^3, y^3, or z^3.\n\nFor the second equation, x^2y + xy^2 + x^2z + xz^2 + y^2z + yz^2 = 0, the degree is also 3, as the highest total degree of any term is x^2y, xy^2, x^2z, xz^2, y^2z, or yz^2.\n\nFor the third equation, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - txyz = 0, the degree depends on the value of t. If t = 0, the degree is 2, as the highest total degree of any term is x^2, y^2, or z^2. If t ≠ 0, the degree is 3, as the highest total degree of any term is txyz.\n\nNow, to find the degree of X, we need to find the degree of the intersection of these equations. Since the first two equations have degree 3, their intersection will have degree at most 3. However, the third equation has degree 2 if t = 0, which would result in an intersection of degree at most 2. Therefore, the degree of X in terms of t is as follows:\n\nDegree of X = {3 if t ≠ 0, 2 if t = 0}"
