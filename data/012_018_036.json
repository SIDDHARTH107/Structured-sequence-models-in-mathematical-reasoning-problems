    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph into two disconnected parts, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between any vertex in one part and any vertex in the other part.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph G is a complete graph, meaning that each vertex is connected to every other vertex. A complete graph with n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges. In our case, with 10 vertices, the complete graph would have 10(10-1)/2 = 45 edges.\n\nHowever, our graph G has only 15 edges, which means it is not a complete graph. To disconnect the graph into two parts, we can try to remove edges that are part of a cut between the two parts.\n\nLet's consider a cut that divides the graph into two parts, one with k vertices and the other with (10-k) vertices. The maximum number of edges that can cross this cut is k(10-k). To minimize the number of edges to be removed, we should maximize the value of k(10-k).\n\nBy testing different values of k (from 1 to 9), we find that the maximum value of k(10-k) occurs when k=5, which gives us 5(10-5) = 25. However, since our graph has only 15 edges, it is not possible to have 25 edges crossing the cut.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the largest value of k(10-k) that is less than or equal to 15. Testing different values of k, we find that the largest value is when k=4, which gives us 4(10-4) = 24. Since 24 is greater than 15, we can't have 24 edges crossing the cut, but we can have at most 15 edges crossing the cut.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, we need to remove all 15 edges to disconnect the graph into two disconnected parts."
