    "message_1": "Unfortunately, as a language model AI, I can't share numerical questions or problems in Deontic logic since it's a branch of logic that deals with the concepts of obligation, permission, and prohibition. It does not involve numerical problem-solving but rather focuses on understanding ethical concepts in a formal logical framework. Is there any other mathematics subject or subtopic that I can assist you with?",
    "message_2": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. I understand that you are looking for assistance with a mathematical problem. Please provide me with the specific problem or topic you would like help with, and I will do my best to assist you."
