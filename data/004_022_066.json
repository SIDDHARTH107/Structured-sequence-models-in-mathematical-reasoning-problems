    "message_1": "A farmer wants to fence a rectangular field that lies along a straight stream. The farmer has 1800 meters of fencing material and wants to enclose a maximum area. One side of the rectangle will be the stream, so there is no need to fence that side. Find the dimensions of the rectangle that will give them a maximum area.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle parallel to the stream be x meters and the width perpendicular to the stream be y meters. Since the farmer has 1800 meters of fencing material and only needs to fence three sides of the rectangle, we can write the constraint equation as:\n\nx + 2y = 1800\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nWe can solve the constraint equation for x and substitute it into the area equation:\n\nx = 1800 - 2y\nArea = (1800 - 2y) * y = 1800y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to y and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dy = 1800 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 1800\ny = 450\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 1800 - 2(450) = 1800 - 900 = 900\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that will give the maximum area are 900 meters parallel to the stream and 450 meters perpendicular to the stream. The maximum area enclosed is 900 * 450 = 405,000 square meters."
