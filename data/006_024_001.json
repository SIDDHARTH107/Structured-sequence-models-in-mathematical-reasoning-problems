    "message_1": "A bus company operates 10 buses daily, each with a seating capacity of 50 persons. If the probability of a passenger showing up on a given day for a particular bus is 0.75, what is the probability that more than 350 passengers will show up on a particular day for all 10 buses?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (passengers showing up) in n trials (seats)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (passenger showing up) = 0.75\n- n is the number of trials (seats) = 50\n- k is the number of successes (passengers showing up)\n\nWe want to find the probability that more than 350 passengers will show up on a particular day for all 10 buses. Since each bus has a seating capacity of 50, there are a total of 10 * 50 = 500 seats available.\n\nLet X be the total number of passengers showing up for all 10 buses. We want to find P(X > 350). To do this, we can find the complementary probability P(X ≤ 350) and then subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X > 350) = 1 - P(X ≤ 350)\n\nSince each bus is independent, we can find the probability for one bus and then raise it to the power of 10 (for 10 buses). Let Y be the number of passengers showing up for one bus. We want to find P(Y ≤ 35) for one bus (since 350 passengers for 10 buses means 35 passengers per bus on average):\n\nP(Y ≤ 35) = Σ P(Y = k) for k = 0 to 35\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to find P(Y = k) for each k from 0 to 35 and sum them up:\n\nP(Y ≤ 35) = Σ C(50, k) * 0.75^k * 0.25^(50-k) for k = 0 to 35\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(Y ≤ 35) ≈ 0.9824\n\nNow, we can find the probability for all 10 buses:\n\nP(X ≤ 350) = (P(Y ≤ 35))^10 ≈ 0.9824^10 ≈ 0.8246\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that more than 350 passengers will show up:\n\nP(X > 350) = 1 - P(X ≤ 350) = 1 - 0.8246 ≈ 0.1754\n\nSo, the probability that more than 350 passengers will show up on a particular day for all 10 buses is approximately 0.1754 or 17.54%."
