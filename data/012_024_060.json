    "message_2": "Euler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 10 and E = 18. We want to determine if G is planar or not, and if not, find its genus.\n\nFirst, let's check if G is planar. If it is planar, then we can find F using Euler's formula:\n\n10 - 18 + F = 2\nF = 10\n\nNow, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case:\n\n18 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n18 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that G is planar. However, this is not a guarantee, as there might still be a non-planar subgraph within G (e.g., K5 or K3,3). We need to check if G contains any such subgraphs.\n\nIf G is not planar, we can find its genus using the formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nwhere g is the genus of the graph. Rearranging the formula to solve for g:\n\ng ≥ (E - 3V + 6) / 6\n\nIn our case:\n\ng ≥ (18 - 3 * 10 + 6) / 6\ng ≥ (-6) / 6\ng ≥ -1\n\nSince the genus cannot be negative, the minimum value for g is 0, which means the graph is planar. Therefore, the genus of G is 0."
