    "message_2": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by A = 4πr², where A is the surface area and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nA = 4π(5 cm)²\nA = 4π(25 cm²)\nA = 100π cm²\n\nNow, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nA ≈ 100 * 3.14 cm²\nA ≈ 314 cm²\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth of a square centimeter, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.0 cm²."
