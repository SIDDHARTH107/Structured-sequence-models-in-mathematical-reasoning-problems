    "message_2": "Let's denote the vector bundle as $E$. Since the rank of $E$ is 2, we know that the total Chern class $c(E)$ can be written as:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E)$$\n\nwhere $c_1(E)$ is the first Chern class and $c_2(E)$ is the second Chern class.\n\nWe are given that the Euler class of the bundle is equal to $-5$. The Euler class of a rank 2 vector bundle is given by the top Chern class, which in this case is the second Chern class $c_2(E)$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$c_2(E) = -5$$\n\nNow, we need to find the first Chern class $c_1(E)$. Since $M$ is a closed three-dimensional manifold, the first Chern class must be an element of the cohomology group $H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. However, we don't have enough information to determine $c_1(E)$ explicitly. So, we can only express the total Chern class in terms of the first Chern class:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) - 5$$"
