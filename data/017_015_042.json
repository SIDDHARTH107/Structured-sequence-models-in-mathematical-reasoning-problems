List all possible divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n3. Determine the number of groups of each order using the formula for the number of groups of order p^n * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, and n and m are positive integers:\n\n   a. For groups of order 2^3 = 8, there are 5 groups (1 cyclic, 4 non-cyclic).\n   b. For groups of order 3^1 = 3, there is 1 group (cyclic).\n\n4. Use the formula for the number of groups of order p^n * q^m to find the number of groups of order 24:\n\n   a. Number of groups of order 2^3 * 3^1 = (5 * 1) + (4 * 1) = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
