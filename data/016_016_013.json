    "message_1": "Suppose that we start with a Gosper curve (also known as a Peano-Gosper curve) of length 50 units. If we were to create a new curve by iterating the same process of adding smaller Gosper curves replacing the straight segments, how long would this new curve be after two iterations?",
    "message_2": "A Gosper curve is a fractal curve that is generated by replacing each straight segment with a smaller Gosper curve. In each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 7/3.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the new curve will be (50 * 7/3) units.\n\nAfter the second iteration, the length of the new curve will be (50 * 7/3) * (7/3) units.\n\nSo, the length of the new curve after two iterations will be:\n\n50 * (7/3) * (7/3) = 50 * 49/9 = 2450/3 â‰ˆ 816.67 units."
