    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos^2(x) - 2cos(x) = 0 for x, where x ∈ [0, 2π], we can factor the equation.\n\ncos^2(x) - 2cos(x) = cos(x)(cos(x) - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1) cos(x) = 0\n2) cos(x) - 2 = 0, which means cos(x) = 2\n\nFor the first case, cos(x) = 0:\nx = π/2, 3π/2\n\nFor the second case, cos(x) = 2:\nThere are no solutions for this case, as the cosine function has a range of [-1, 1], and 2 is not in this range.\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation cos^2(x) - 2cos(x) = 0 for x, where x ∈ [0, 2π], are x = π/2 and x = 3π/2."
