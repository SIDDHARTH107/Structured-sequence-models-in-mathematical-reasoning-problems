    "message_2": "To find the probability of a theft occurring in a specific neighborhood in one week, we first need to find the average number of thefts per week. Since there are 12 thefts in a year and 52 weeks in a year, the average number of thefts per week is:\n\nλ = 12 thefts/year / 52 weeks/year = 0.230769 thefts/week\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of a theft occurring in one week:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nFor k = 1 (one theft occurring in one week):\n\nP(X=1) = (e^(-0.230769) * (0.230769^1)) / 1! = 0.198\n\nSo, the probability of a theft occurring in a specific neighborhood in one week is approximately 0.198 or 19.8%."
