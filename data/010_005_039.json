If A is connected, B is connected, and A intersection Y equals B intersection Y equals Y, prove that Y is path-connected. \n\nAdditionally, find an example of a topological space X, a connected subspace Y of X, sets A and B satisfying the above conditions, and a point y in Y that cannot be joined to a point in A by a path in Y.",
    "message_2": "Proof that Y is path-connected:\n\nLet x, y be two points in Y. Since A and B are connected and Y = A ∩ B, we have x, y ∈ A and x, y ∈ B. \n\nSince A is connected, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → A such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Similarly, since B is connected, there exists a continuous function g: [0, 1] → B such that g(0) = x and g(1) = y.\n\nNow, consider the function h: [0, 1] → Y defined by h(t) = f(t) if t ∈ [0, 1/2] and h(t) = g(t) if t ∈ (1/2, 1]. Since f and g are continuous and f(1/2) = g(1/2) = x, h is continuous on [0, 1]. Moreover, h(0) = x and h(1) = y, so h is a path in Y connecting x and y. Since x and y were arbitrary points in Y, this shows that Y is path-connected.\n\nExample:\n\nLet X = [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] with the subspace topology from the standard topology on ℝ. Let Y = {1, 2}, A = [0, 1], and B = [2, 3]. Then A ∪ B = X, A ∩ B = Y, and A ∩ Y = B ∩ Y = Y. Moreover, A and B are connected as they are closed intervals in ℝ. However, there is no path in Y connecting 1 and 2, since any such path would have to pass through a point not in Y."
