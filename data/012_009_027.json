    "message_2": "To determine the degree sequence of the graph, we need to find the degrees of all the vertices in the graph. Since there are 18 edges and each edge connects two vertices, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 18 = 36.\n\nHowever, we cannot uniquely determine the degree sequence of the graph with only the information provided. There are multiple possible degree sequences that can result in a graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. A graph with degrees: 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\n2. A graph with degrees: 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1\n3. A graph with degrees: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many other possible degree sequences for a graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges. To uniquely determine the degree sequence, more information about the graph's structure is needed."
