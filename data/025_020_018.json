If L is a very ample line bundle on X, prove that |mL-K_X-H| is base-point-free for all sufficiently large integer m. \n\nFor instance, show that |3L-K_X-H| is base-point-free.",
    "message_2": "To prove that |mL-K_X-H| is base-point-free for all sufficiently large integer m, we will use the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem.\n\nFirst, recall that X is a Calabi-Yau variety of dimension 3, so it has a trivial canonical divisor, i.e., K_X ≅ O_X. Also, L is a very ample line bundle on X, and H is an ample divisor on X.\n\nNow, let's consider the line bundle mL-K_X-H. Since K_X ≅ O_X, we have:\n\nmL-K_X-H ≅ mL-H.\n\nWe want to show that |mL-H| is base-point-free for all sufficiently large integer m. By the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, we have:\n\nR^i(X, mL-H) = 0 for all i > 0 and for all sufficiently large integer m.\n\nIn particular, for i = 1, we have:\n\nR^1(X, mL-H) = 0 for all sufficiently large integer m.\n\nNow, consider the short exact sequence of sheaves on X:\n\n0 → O_X(-H) → O_X → O_H → 0.\n\nTensoring this sequence with the line bundle mL, we get:\n\n0 → mL(-H) → mL → (mL)|_H → 0.\n\nApplying the cohomology functor, we obtain the following long exact sequence:\n\n0 → H^0(X, mL(-H)) → H^0(X, mL) → H^0(H, (mL)|_H) → H^1(X, mL(-H)) → ...\n\nBy the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, we know that H^1(X, mL(-H)) = 0 for all sufficiently large integer m. Therefore, the map:\n\nH^0(X, mL) → H^0(H, (mL)|_H)\n\nis surjective for all sufficiently large integer m. This implies that the linear system |mL-H| is base-point-free for all sufficiently large integer m.\n\nNow, let's show that |3L-K_X-H| is base-point-free. Since K_X ≅ O_X, we have:\n\n3L-K_X-H ≅ 3L-H.\n\nBy the argument above, we know that |mL-H| is base-point-free for all sufficiently large integer m. In particular, if m = 3 is sufficiently large, then |3L-H| is base-point-free."
