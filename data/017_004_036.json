    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide 25 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possible value for n_5 is 1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of P. Since P is a group of order 5, which is a prime number, P must be cyclic. Let a be a generator of P, so P = ⟨a⟩.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of G. Since P is normal in G and has order 5, we can form the quotient group G/P. The order of G/P is |G|/|P| = 25/5 = 5, which is a prime number. Therefore, G/P must be cyclic. Let G/P = ⟨bP⟩, where b is an element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the element c = ab ∈ G. We will show that G = ⟨c⟩, which would imply that G is cyclic, or G = ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩, which would imply that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nFirst, let's show that ⟨c⟩ = ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩. Since a and b are elements of G, it is clear that ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since a and b have orders 5 and |G| = 25, the orders of a and b are coprime. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the order of c = ab is lcm(5, 5) = 25. Therefore, ⟨c⟩ is a subgroup of G of order 25, which means that ⟨c⟩ = G.\n\nNow, let's show that G is isomorphic to ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩. Define a homomorphism φ: ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩ → G by φ(a^i, b^j) = a^i * b^j. Since a and b have orders 5 and |G| = 25, the orders of a and b are coprime. Therefore, φ is an isomorphism, and G is isomorphic to ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 25 is either cyclic (G = ⟨c⟩) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (G ≅ ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩)."
