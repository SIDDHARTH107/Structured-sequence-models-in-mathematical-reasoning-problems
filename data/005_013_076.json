    "message_2": "To find the covariance between two variables X and Y, we can use the formula:\n\nCov(X, Y) = Î£((Xi - X_mean) * (Yi - Y_mean)) / (n - 1)\n\nwhere Xi and Yi are the individual data points, X_mean and Y_mean are the means of the respective data sets, and n is the number of data points.\n\nFirst, let's find the means of X and Y:\n\nX_mean = (2 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 4) / 5 = 22 / 5 = 4.4\nY_mean = (7 + 9 + 6 + 12 + 5) / 5 = 39 / 5 = 7.8\n\nNow, let's calculate the covariance:\n\nCov(X, Y) = [((2 - 4.4) * (7 - 7.8)) + ((5 - 4.4) * (9 - 7.8)) + ((3 - 4.4) * (6 - 7.8)) + ((8 - 4.4) * (12 - 7.8)) + ((4 - 4.4) * (5 - 7.8))] / (5 - 1)\n\nCov(X, Y) = [((-2.4) * (-0.8)) + (0.6 * 1.2) + (-1.4 * -1.8) + (3.6 * 4.2) + (-0.4 * -2.8)] / 4\n\nCov(X, Y) = [(1.92) + (0.72) + (2.52) + (15.12) + (1.12)] / 4\n\nCov(X, Y) = 21.4 / 4\n\nCov(X, Y) = 5.35\n\nSo, the covariance between X and Y is 5.35."
