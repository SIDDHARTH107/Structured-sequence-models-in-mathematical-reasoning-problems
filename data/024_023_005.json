    "message_2": "The given equation x² + y² + z² = 1 represents a 2-dimensional sphere (S²) in 3-dimensional Euclidean space (ℝ³). The symmetries of this manifold are the transformations that preserve the geometric structure of the sphere.\n\nThe symmetries of a sphere are described by the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant ±1. These matrices represent rotations and reflections in 3-dimensional space.\n\nRotations: Any rotation around an axis passing through the center of the sphere will preserve the sphere's structure. These rotations can be represented by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. The group of all such rotations is called the special orthogonal group, denoted as SO(3).\n\nReflections: A reflection across any plane passing through the center of the sphere will also preserve the sphere's structure. These reflections can be represented by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant -1.\n\nIn conclusion, the symmetries of the manifold M defined by the equation x² + y² + z² = 1 are given by the orthogonal group O(3), which includes both rotations (SO(3)) and reflections."
