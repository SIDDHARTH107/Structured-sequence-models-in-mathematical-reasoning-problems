    "message_2": "To find the area of the 60-degree slice of pizza, we first need to find the area of the entire pizza and then find the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 60-degree slice.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 6 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the entire pizza:\nA = π(6)^2\nA = 36π square inches\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 60-degree slice. There are 360 degrees in a circle, so the fraction of the pizza that corresponds to the 60-degree slice is 60/360 = 1/6.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the 60-degree slice by multiplying the area of the entire pizza by the fraction:\nArea of 60-degree slice = (1/6) * 36π\nArea of 60-degree slice = 6π square inches\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the area of the 60-degree slice is approximately 18.85 square inches."
