    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nSymmetric difference of A and B: (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {2, 6, 8}\nB - A = {1, 3, 7}\n\nSymmetric difference of A and B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of the sets A and B. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both A and B.\n\nIntersection of A and B: A ∩ B = {4}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B. The distributive property states that A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) and A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C).\n\nIn our case, we want to check if (A Δ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A Δ B) ∩ A ∩ B.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} ∩ {4} = ∅ (empty set)\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ A = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {2, 6, 8}\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} ∩ {1, 3, 4, 7} = {1, 3, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the two sets we just found:\n\n{2, 6, 8} ∩ {1, 3, 7} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal to the empty set, the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B."
