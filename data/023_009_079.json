The temperature on the top side of the square is fixed at 100 degrees Celsius, while the other three sides are insulated, so that no heat flows across them. Find the steady-state temperature distribution at any point inside the square using Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution inside the square, we can use the 2D heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The 2D heat equation is:\n\n∇²T(x, y) = 0\n\nwhere T(x, y) is the temperature distribution inside the square, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\n1. T(x, 0) = 100 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2\n2. ∂T/∂y(x, 2) = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 (insulated)\n3. ∂T/∂x(0, y) = 0 for 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 (insulated)\n4. ∂T/∂x(2, y) = 0 for 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 (insulated)\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve this problem. Let T(x, y) = X(x)Y(y), then the heat equation becomes:\n\n(1/X) * d²X/dx² + (1/Y) * d²Y/dy² = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n(d²X/dx²) / X = -(d²Y/dy²) / Y = λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nd²X/dx² - λX = 0\nd²Y/dy² + λY = 0\n\nSolving these equations with the given boundary conditions, we get the eigenvalues λ_n = (n * π / 2)^2 for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\nX_n(x) = cos(n * π * x / 2)\nY_n(y) = cosh(n * π * y / 2)\n\nNow, we can represent the temperature distribution T(x, y) as a Fourier series:\n\nT(x, y) = Σ [A_n * cos(n * π * x / 2) * cosh(n * π * y / 2)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the boundary condition T(x, 0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ [A_n * cos(n * π * x / 2) * cosh(0)]\n\nSince cosh(0) = 1, we have:\n\n100 = Σ [A_n * cos(n * π * x / 2)]\n\nNow, we can find A_n by multiplying both sides by cos(m * π * x / 2) and integrating over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nA_n = (2 / L) * ∫[0, 2] 100 * cos(n * π * x / 2) dx\n\nwhere L = 2. Solving this integral, we get:\n\nA_n = (400 / nπ) * [1 - (-1)^n] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nFinally, the steady-state temperature distribution inside the square is:\n\nT(x, y) = Σ [(400 / nπ) * [1 - (-1)^n] * cos(n * π * x / 2) * cosh(n * π * y / 2)] for n = 1, 3, 5, ..."
