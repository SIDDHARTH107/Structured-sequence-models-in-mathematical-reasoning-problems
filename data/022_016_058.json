    "message_2": "We can construct the desired bijective holomorphic map $f: D \\to \\mathbb{C}\\setminus[1,\\infty)$ as a composition of several well-known holomorphic maps.\n\nFirst, consider the map $g(z) = z^2$. This map sends the unit disc $D$ to itself, and it has the property that $g(0) = 0$. However, it is not bijective, as it is a 2-to-1 map.\n\nNext, consider the map $h(z) = \\frac{z-1}{z+1}$. This map sends the unit disc $D$ to the right half-plane $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\operatorname{Re}(z) > 0\\}$. Moreover, it is bijective and holomorphic.\n\nNow, consider the map $k(z) = \\log(z)$. This map sends the right half-plane to the strip $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : 0 < \\operatorname{Im}(z) < \\pi\\}$. Note that we are using the principal branch of the logarithm here, which is holomorphic on the right half-plane.\n\nFinally, consider the map $l(z) = e^z$. This map sends the strip $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : 0 < \\operatorname{Im}(z) < \\pi\\}$ to the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$ without the non-negative real axis, i.e., $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus[0,\\infty)$.\n\nNow, let's compose these maps to obtain the desired map $f: D \\to \\mathbb{C}\\setminus[1,\\infty)$:\n\n$$f(z) = l(k(h(g(z)))) = e^{\\log\\left(\\frac{z^2-1}{z^2+1}\\right)} = \\frac{z^2-1}{z^2+1}.$$\n\nIt is easy to verify that $f(0) = 0$, and $f$ is holomorphic as it is a composition of holomorphic maps. Moreover, $f$ is bijective, as it is a composition of bijective maps. Thus, $f: D \\to \\mathbb{C}\\setminus[1,\\infty)$ is the desired bijective holomorphic map."
