    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step. We have a square of side length 2, and we subdivide each side into n equal segments. Then, we join the corresponding points to form an n-gon.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when n = 2. In this case, we have a square with side length 2, and we subdivide each side into 2 equal segments of length 1. Then, we join the corresponding points to form a square with side length 1. Since all angles in a square are right angles (90 degrees), there are no acute angles in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n > 2. In this case, we have a square with side length 2, and we subdivide each side into n equal segments of length 2/n. Then, we join the corresponding points to form an n-gon. To maximize the number of acute angles, we need to consider the angles formed by the diagonals of the square.\n\nLet's analyze the angles formed by the diagonals. The diagonals of the square have length √8 (using the Pythagorean theorem). When we join the corresponding points, we form isosceles triangles with side lengths 2/n, 2/n, and √8. Let's denote the angle opposite the side with length √8 as α.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we can find the cosine of α:\n\ncos(α) = (2 * (2/n)^2 - (√8)^2) / (2 * (2/n) * (2/n))\n\ncos(α) = (8/n^2 - 8) / (8/n^2)\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of acute angles, which means we want to find the maximum value of n for which cos(α) > 0 (since an angle is acute if its cosine is positive).\n\ncos(α) > 0\n\n(8/n^2 - 8) / (8/n^2) > 0\n\n(1 - n^2) / n^2 > 0\n\n1 - n^2 > 0\n\nn^2 < 1\n\nSince n is a positive integer, the only possible value for n is 1. However, this case corresponds to the original square, which has no acute angles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in such an n-gon is 0, and this number is achieved for n = 1 (the original square)."
