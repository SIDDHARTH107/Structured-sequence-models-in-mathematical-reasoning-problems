    "message_1": "A car manufacturer produces two models of cars - Model A and Model B. The profit per unit of Model A is $700 and the profit per unit of Model B is $500. The manufacturing process for Model A requires 6 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while Model B requires 4 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has 1500 hours of labor and 1200 hours of machine time available.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can earn if they produce and sell only Model A or Model B, or a combination of both?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model A cars produced and y be the number of Model B cars produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 700x + 500y, subject to the constraints of labor and machine time.\n\nThe constraints are:\n6x + 4y ≤ 1500 (labor constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 1200 (machine constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. Labor constraint:\ny ≤ (1500 - 6x) / 4\n\n2. Machine constraint:\ny ≤ (1200 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow we will find the corner points of the feasible region by setting x or y to 0 and solving for the other variable, or by solving the system of equations formed by the two constraints:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\n2. x = 0, y = (1500 - 6*0) / 4 => y = 375\n3. x = 0, y = (1200 - 3*0) / 4 => y = 300\n4. y = 0, x = (1500 - 4*0) / 6 => x = 250\n5. y = 0, x = (1200 - 4*0) / 3 => x = 400\n\nNow we will find the intersection point of the two constraints by solving the system of equations:\n\n6x + 4y = 1500\n3x + 4y = 1200\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:\n\n3x = 300\nx = 100\n\nNow substituting x back into one of the equations to find y:\n\n3(100) + 4y = 1200\n300 + 4y = 1200\n4y = 900\ny = 225\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 375), (0, 300), (250, 0), (400, 0), and (100, 225).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 700x + 500y at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 0\n2. P(0, 375) = 187500\n3. P(0, 300) = 150000\n4. P(250, 0) = 175000\n5. P(400, 0) = 280000\n6. P(100, 225) = 700(100) + 500(225) = 70000 + 112500 = 182500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (400, 0), with a profit of $280,000. Therefore, the company should produce 400 units of Model A and no units of Model B to maximize their profit."
