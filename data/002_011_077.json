    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The ladder is 10 feet long and the base of the ladder is 8 feet away from the wall. How far above the ground does the ladder reach? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth)",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the ladder is the hypotenuse, and the distance from the wall and the height above the ground are the other two sides.\n\nLet h be the height above the ground that the ladder reaches. Then we have:\n\n10^2 = 8^2 + h^2\n\n100 = 64 + h^2\n\n36 = h^2\n\nh = âˆš36\n\nh = 6\n\nSo, the ladder reaches 6 feet above the ground."
