    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible divisors for each prime factor using the formula (p^(n+1) - 1)/(p - 1), where p is the prime factor and n is its exponent.\n   For 2: (2^(4+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = 31/1 = 31\n   For 3: (3^(1+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = 8/2 = 4\n3. Calculate the number of possible groups using the formula: (number of divisors for 2) * (number of divisors for 3)\n   31 * 4 = 124\n\nHowever, this number includes isomorphic groups, so we need to eliminate them. We can use the following facts to help us:\n\n- There is only one group of order p^n for each prime p and integer n (up to isomorphism), which is the cyclic group of order p^n.\n- There are two groups of order 4 (up to isomorphism): the cyclic group Z4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n- There are two groups of order 8 (up to isomorphism): the cyclic group Z8 and the dihedral group D4.\n- There are three groups of order 16 (up to isomorphism): the cyclic group Z16, the dihedral group D8, and the quaternion group Q16.\n\nUsing these facts, we can determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48 as follows:\n\n1. One group is the cyclic group of order 48, Z48.\n2. There are two possibilities for a group of order 48 as a direct product of groups of order 16 and 3: Z16 x Z3 and Q16 x Z3.\n3. There are four possibilities for a group of order 48 as a direct product of groups of order 8 and 6: Z8 x Z6, Z8 x (Z2 x Z3), D4 x Z6, and D4 x (Z2 x Z3).\n4. There are two possibilities for a group of order 48 as a direct product of groups of order 4 and 12: Z4 x Z12 and V4 x Z12.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
