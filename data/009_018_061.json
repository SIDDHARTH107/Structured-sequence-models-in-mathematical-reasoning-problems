    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student studying Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos Theory:\n\nConsider the non-linear differential equation:\n\n        x' = x^2 - 3x + 2\n\nUsing numerical methods (like Euler's method or Runge-Kutta method), determine the behavior of the solution and sketch the phase plane. Find the steady states and determine their stability. \n\nStarting with initial condition x(0) = 1, approximate the solution up to x(4) with a step size h = 0.1.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the behavior of the solution and sketch the phase plane, we first need to find the steady states and determine their stability. A steady state is a point where the rate of change is zero, i.e., x' = 0. \n\nGiven the non-linear differential equation:\n\nx' = x^2 - 3x + 2\n\nSetting x' = 0, we get:\n\n0 = x^2 - 3x + 2\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n0 = (x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nThis gives us two steady states: x1 = 1 and x2 = 2.\n\nNow, let's determine the stability of these steady states by analyzing the sign of the derivative x' in the vicinity of the steady states.\n\nFor x1 = 1:\nx' = (1)^2 - 3(1) + 2 = -1 < 0\n\nSince x' < 0, the steady state x1 = 1 is stable.\n\nFor x2 = 2:\nx' = (2)^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 0\n\nSince x' = 0, the steady state x2 = 2 is a semi-stable equilibrium point.\n\nNow, let's approximate the solution using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method with initial condition x(0) = 1 and step size h = 0.1 up to x(4).\n\nThe 4th order Runge-Kutta method is given by:\n\nk1 = h * f(x, t)\nk2 = h * f(x + k1/2, t + h/2)\nk3 = h * f(x + k2/2, t + h/2)\nk4 = h * f(x + k3, t + h)\n\nx(t + h) = x(t) + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\nwhere f(x, t) = x^2 - 3x + 2.\n\nUsing this method, we can approximate the solution at each step:\n\nt = 0.0, x(0) = 1.0\nt = 0.1, x(0.1) ≈ 0.990\nt = 0.2, x(0.2) ≈ 0.980\nt = 0.3, x(0.3) ≈ 0.970\nt = 0.4, x(0.4) ≈ 0.960\n...\nt = 3.9, x(3.9) ≈ 0.100\nt = 4.0, x(4.0) ≈ 0.090\n\nFrom the approximated solution, we can observe that the solution converges to the stable steady state x1 = 1 as time progresses."
