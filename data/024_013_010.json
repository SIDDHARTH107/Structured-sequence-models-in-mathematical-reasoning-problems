    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor g. The metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements (1, 3, 4) and off-diagonal elements being zero:\n\ng = | 1  0  0 |\n      | 0  3  0 |\n      | 0  0  4 |\n\nThe determinant of g, denoted by |g|, is the product of the diagonal elements since it is a diagonal matrix:\n\n|g| = 1 * 3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, the volume form is given by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume element in 3-dimensional space, which is dx ∧ dy ∧ dz (where ∧ denotes the wedge product):\n\nvolume form = √|g| dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = √12 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric is:\n\n√12 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz"
