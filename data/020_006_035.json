The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while the production of Product B requires 3 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The company has 50 hours of labor and 24 hours of machine time available per day. The profit for each unit of Product A is $10 and for each unit of Product B is $12. The company wants to maximize their daily profit.\n\nWrite the mixed-integer programming problem that will help the company determine the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce per day, given the available labor and machine time.",
