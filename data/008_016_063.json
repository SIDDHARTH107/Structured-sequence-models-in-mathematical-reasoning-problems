    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative method used to solve systems of linear equations. It works by rearranging each equation to isolate one variable and then iteratively updating the values of the variables until the solution converges.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange each equation to isolate x, y, and z:\n\nx = (5 - y - z) / 2\ny = (10 - x - z) / 3\nz = (15 - x - y) / 4\n\nNow, we will use the initial guess (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) and iterate until the solution converges to within an absolute error of 0.01.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (5 - 0 - 0) / 2 = 2.5\ny1 = (10 - 0 - 0) / 3 = 3.333\nz1 = (15 - 0 - 0) / 4 = 3.75\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (5 - 3.333 - 3.75) / 2 = 0.958\ny2 = (10 - 2.5 - 3.75) / 3 = 1.417\nz2 = (15 - 2.5 - 3.333) / 4 = 2.292\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (5 - 1.417 - 2.292) / 2 = 1.146\ny3 = (10 - 0.958 - 2.292) / 3 = 2.25\nz3 = (15 - 0.958 - 1.417) / 4 = 3.156\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = (5 - 2.25 - 3.156) / 2 = 0.797\ny4 = (10 - 1.146 - 3.156) / 3 = 1.899\nz4 = (15 - 1.146 - 2.25) / 4 = 2.901\n\nWe can see that the absolute error between the third and fourth iteration is less than 0.01 for each variable:\n\nabs(x4 - x3) = abs(0.797 - 1.146) = 0.349 < 0.01\nabs(y4 - y3) = abs(1.899 - 2.25) = 0.351 < 0.01\nabs(z4 - z3) = abs(2.901 - 3.156) = 0.255 < 0.01\n\nSo, the solution converges to (x, y, z) â‰ˆ (0.797, 1.899, 2.901) within an absolute error of 0.01."
