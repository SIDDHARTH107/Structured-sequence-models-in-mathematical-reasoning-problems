    "message_2": "In second-order logic, predicates can have variables that range over sets of individuals (unlike first-order logic, where variables range only over individuals). The maximum number of predicates is not limited by the number of arguments, as you can have infinitely many predicates with different names or symbols.\n\nHowever, if you are asking about the maximum number of different combinations of arguments for a single predicate with at most 3 arguments, we can analyze it as follows:\n\nLet's consider three types of entities: individuals (denoted by 'a', 'b', 'c', ...), sets of individuals (denoted by 'A', 'B', 'C', ...), and variables that range over sets of individuals (denoted by 'X', 'Y', 'Z', ...).\n\nFor a predicate with 1 argument, there are 3 possibilities: individual (e.g., Pa), set of individuals (e.g., PA), and variable ranging over sets of individuals (e.g., PX).\n\nFor a predicate with 2 arguments, there are 3 * 3 = 9 possibilities (e.g., Pab, PaA, PaX, PAb, PAA, PAX, PXb, PXA, and PXX).\n\nFor a predicate with 3 arguments, there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 possibilities (e.g., Pabc, PabA, PabX, PaAc, PaAA, PaAX, PaXc, PaXA, PaXX, PAbc, PAbA, PAbX, PAac, PAAA, PAAX, PAXc, PAXA, PAXX, PXbc, PXbA, PXbX, PXAc, PXAA, PXAX, PXXc, PXXA, and PXXx).\n\nSo, for a single predicate with at most 3 arguments, there are a total of 3 + 9 + 27 = 39 different combinations of arguments. However, there is no maximum limit on the number of predicates that a second-order logic can admit."
