    "message_2": "The Koch curve is a fractal that is formed by iterating a simple process of adding an equilateral triangle to a line segment and then removing the base of the triangle. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the Koch curve after the third iteration:\n\n1st iteration: Length = (4/3) * 6 cm\n2nd iteration: Length = (4/3) * (4/3) * 6 cm\n3rd iteration: Length = (4/3) * (4/3) * (4/3) * 6 cm\n\nSo, the length of the Koch curve after the third iteration is:\n\nLength = (4/3)^3 * 6 cm ≈ 2.37037 * 6 cm ≈ 14.2222 cm"
