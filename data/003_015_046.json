    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the sinusoidal function, we first need to understand the properties of the ferris wheel.\n\nThe diameter of the ferris wheel is 80 feet, which means the radius is half of that, or 40 feet. The amplitude of the sinusoidal function will be equal to the radius, since the height of a person on the ferris wheel will oscillate between the highest and lowest points, which are the radius distance above and below the center of the wheel. Therefore, the amplitude is 40 feet.\n\nThe period of the sinusoidal function represents the time it takes for the ferris wheel to complete one full revolution. In this case, the ferris wheel completes one revolution in 60 seconds, so the period is 60 seconds.\n\nNow we can write the sinusoidal function that models the height of a person on the ferris wheel in terms of time (t), assuming they start at the bottom of the wheel:\n\nh(t) = 40 * sin((2π/60)t) + 40\n\nHere, h(t) represents the height of the person at time t, 40 is the amplitude, (2π/60) is the angular frequency (which determines the period), and the additional 40 at the end accounts for the fact that the person starts at the bottom of the wheel, which is 40 feet above the ground.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the sinusoidal function is 40 feet, and the period is 60 seconds."
