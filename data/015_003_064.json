Since this is a complex task that requires a large number of calculations and plotting, it is best done using a computer program or software like Python, MATLAB, or Mathematica.\n\nAfter creating the bifurcation diagram, you will notice that the sequence becomes chaotic at certain values of $r$. The first value of $r$ where the sequence becomes chaotic is around $r \\approx 3.57$. This is the onset of chaos.\n\nTo estimate the Feigenbaum constant, we need to find the ratio of consecutive bifurcation intervals. The Feigenbaum constant is given by the limit of the ratio of consecutive bifurcation intervals as the number of bifurcations approaches infinity:\n\n$\\delta = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{r_{n-1} - r_{n-2}}{r_n - r_{n-1}}$\n\nBy analyzing the bifurcation diagram, we can estimate the Feigenbaum constant by finding the ratio of consecutive bifurcation intervals for a few bifurcations. The Feigenbaum constant is approximately equal to 4.669.\n\nKeep in mind that the values provided here are approximations, and more accurate values can be obtained by using more precise calculations and a larger number of iterations in the bifurcation diagram."
