    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with metric tensor $g$ and let $f:M\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are smooth vector fields on $M$. Consider a rank-2 covariant tensor $T$ defined by $T(X,Y)=fXY$, where $XY$ denotes the Lie bracket of vector fields $X$ and $Y$. \n\nFind the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$.",
    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$, we use the following formula for the covariant derivative of a rank-2 tensor:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)(Y, Z) = X(T(Y, Z)) - T(\\nabla_X Y, Z) - T(Y, \\nabla_X Z)$,\n\nwhere $\\nabla_X Y$ and $\\nabla_X Z$ are the covariant derivatives of the vector fields $Y$ and $Z$ with respect to $X$, and $T(Y, Z) = fYZ$.\n\nNow, let's compute each term in the formula:\n\n1. $X(T(Y, Z)) = X(fYZ) = (Xf)YZ + fX(YZ)$, using the Leibniz rule for the Lie derivative.\n\n2. $T(\\nabla_X Y, Z) = f(\\nabla_X Y)Z = f(XY - [Y, X])Z = f(XY)Z - f[Y, X]Z$.\n\n3. $T(Y, \\nabla_X Z) = fY(XZ - [Z, X]) = fY(XZ) - fY[Z, X]$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the formula for the covariant derivative of $T$:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)(Y, Z) = (Xf)YZ + fX(YZ) - f(XY)Z + f[Y, X]Z - fY(XZ) + fY[Z, X]$.\n\nWe can simplify this expression by using the properties of the Lie bracket:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)(Y, Z) = (Xf)YZ + fX(YZ) - f(XY)Z + f[Z, Y]Z - fY(XZ) + fY[Z, X]$.\n\nThus, the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$ is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)(Y, Z) = (Xf)YZ + fX(YZ) - f(XY)Z + f[Z, Y]Z - fY(XZ) + fY[Z, X]$."
