    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to find a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other. This can be proven using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nLet's label the 6 people as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We will start by considering person A. There are 5 other people in the group, so A must have either at least 3 friends or at least 3 strangers among the other 5 people.\n\nCase 1: A has at least 3 friends.\nLet's assume A is friends with B, C, and D. Now, we will consider the relationships between B, C, and D. If any one of them is friends with the other two, we have a group of 3 friends (A, B, C, or D). If none of them are friends with each other, then B, C, and D form a group of 3 strangers.\n\nCase 2: A has at least 3 strangers.\nLet's assume A is a stranger to B, C, and D. Now, we will consider the relationships between B, C, and D. If any one of them is a stranger to the other two, we have a group of 3 strangers (A, B, C, or D). If none of them are strangers to each other, then B, C, and D form a group of 3 friends.\n\nIn both cases, we can find a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other or a group of 3 people who are all strangers to each other."
