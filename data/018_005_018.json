    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and its complement is the empty set, we first need to find the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nSo, A' = {8, 9, 10} because these are the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A'.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A and A' have no common elements (A contains elements 1 to 7, and A' contains elements 8 to 10), their intersection is the empty set.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThus, we have proven that the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set."
