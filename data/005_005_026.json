    "message_1": "Suppose that the weights of avocados in a grocery store are normally distributed with a mean of 200 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs less than 180 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs less than 180 grams, we need to calculate the z-score and then find the corresponding probability from the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (180 grams), μ is the mean (200 grams), and σ is the standard deviation (20 grams).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (180 - 200) / 20\nz = -20 / 20\nz = -1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to a z-score of -1 from the standard normal distribution table. The table gives us the area to the left of the z-score (i.e., the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs less than 180 grams).\n\nLooking up the z-score of -1 in the standard normal distribution table, we find a probability of approximately 0.1587.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected avocado weighs less than 180 grams is approximately 0.1587 or 15.87%."
