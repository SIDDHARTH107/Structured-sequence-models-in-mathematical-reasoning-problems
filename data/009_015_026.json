    "message_1": "A particular radioactive substance decays at a rate of 0.05 per hour. If the initial amount of the substance is 100 grams, how many grams of the substance will remain after 24 hours? Use the half-life equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the decay equation:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1 - Decay Rate)^Time\n\nwhere Final Amount is the amount of the substance remaining after a certain time, Initial Amount is the starting amount of the substance, Decay Rate is the rate at which the substance decays, and Time is the number of hours that have passed.\n\nIn this case, the Initial Amount is 100 grams, the Decay Rate is 0.05 per hour, and the Time is 24 hours. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1 - 0.05)^24\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (0.95)^24\n\nFinal Amount ≈ 100 * 0.359381366\n\nFinal Amount ≈ 35.9381366\n\nAfter 24 hours, approximately 35.94 grams of the radioactive substance will remain."
