    "message_1": "A student wants to buy a new set of pens. He wants to buy at least 3 pens but no more than 7 pens. If he has $20 to spend and each pen costs either $2 or $3, how many different numbers of pens can he buy? Use recurrence relations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's use recurrence relations to solve this problem. Let's denote the number of ways to buy n pens with a budget of $m as T(n, m). We have two cases to consider: buying a $2 pen and buying a $3 pen.\n\nCase 1: Buying a $2 pen\nIf the student buys a $2 pen, he will have a budget of $m - 2 and will need to buy n - 1 more pens. So, the number of ways to do this is T(n - 1, m - 2).\n\nCase 2: Buying a $3 pen\nIf the student buys a $3 pen, he will have a budget of $m - 3 and will need to buy n - 1 more pens. So, the number of ways to do this is T(n - 1, m - 3).\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for this problem is:\nT(n, m) = T(n - 1, m - 2) + T(n - 1, m - 3)\n\nNow, let's find the base cases for our recurrence relation:\n\n1. If the student has no money left (m = 0) and still needs to buy pens (n > 0), there are no ways to do this, so T(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0.\n2. If the student has money left (m > 0) but doesn't need to buy any more pens (n = 0), there is 1 way to do this (not buying any more pens), so T(0, m) = 1 for m > 0.\n3. If the student has no money left and doesn't need to buy any more pens (n = 0 and m = 0), there is 1 way to do this (not buying any more pens), so T(0, 0) = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the recurrence relation and base cases to find the number of ways to buy between 3 and 7 pens with a budget of $20:\n\nT(3, 20) = T(2, 18) + T(2, 17)\nT(4, 20) = T(3, 18) + T(3, 17)\nT(5, 20) = T(4, 18) + T(4, 17)\nT(6, 20) = T(5, 18) + T(5, 17)\nT(7, 20) = T(6, 18) + T(6, 17)\n\nCalculating these values:\n\nT(3, 20) = T(2, 18) + T(2, 17) = 6 + 5 = 11\nT(4, 20) = T(3, 18) + T(3, 17) = 5 + 4 = 9\nT(5, 20) = T(4, 18) + T(4, 17) = 4 + 3 = 7\nT(6, 20) = T(5, 18) + T(5, 17) = 3 + 2 = 5\nT(7, 20) = T(6, 18) + T(6, 17) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSince the student can buy between 3 and 7 pens, we have 5 different numbers of pens that he can buy: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
