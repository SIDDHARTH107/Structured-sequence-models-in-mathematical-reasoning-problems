    "message_2": "To find the genus of the curve $C$, we first need to find the degree of the curve and then use the genus-degree formula for plane curves:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus and $d$ is the degree of the curve.\n\nSince $C$ is given by $X = 0$, we can substitute this into the equation of the projective variety:\n\n$0^3 + Y^2Z - Z^3 = Y^2Z - Z^3 = 0$\n\nNow, we can factor out $Z$:\n\n$Z(Y^2 - Z^2) = Z(Y - Z)(Y + Z) = 0$\n\nThis equation represents the union of three lines in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, so the degree of the curve $C$ is $d = 3$.\n\nNow, we can use the genus-degree formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nTherefore, the genus of the curve $C$ is $1$."
