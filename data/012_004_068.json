    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of the given graph using Kruskal's algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are (V-1) edges in the minimum spanning tree, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nNow, let's apply Kruskal's algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Sort the edges by weight:\n   (A, B, 1), (A, C, 2), (B, D, 2), (C, D, 3), (C, E, 4), (D, F, 4), (E, F, 5)\n\n2. Start with an empty graph.\n\n3. Add edges one by one:\n   - Add edge (A, B, 1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Add edge (A, C, 2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Add edge (B, D, 2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Skip edge (C, D, 3) because it would form a cycle with edges (A, C, 2) and (B, D, 2).\n   - Add edge (C, E, 4) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Add edge (D, F, 4) to the minimum spanning tree.\n   - Skip edge (E, F, 5) because it would form a cycle with edges (C, E, 4) and (D, F, 4).\n\n4. The minimum spanning tree now has 5 edges (one less than the number of vertices), so the algorithm is complete.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree for the given graph is:\n\n![Minimum Spanning Tree](https://i.imgur.com/0p5I9vL.png)\n\nEdges in the minimum spanning tree are: (A, B, 1), (A, C, 2), (B, D, 2), (C, E, 4), and (D, F, 4)."
