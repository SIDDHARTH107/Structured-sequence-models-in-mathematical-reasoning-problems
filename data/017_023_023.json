    "message_1": "For a math student, the question could be:\n\nGiven a group of order 72, use the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem to determine the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups. Use this information to determine if the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow Theorems to determine the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, let n_3 be the number of such subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, n_3 must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, let n_2 be the number of such subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\nNow, we will use the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem to determine if G is isomorphic to C72, A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C72, then G is a cyclic group and has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. In this case, n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2, then G has 4 Sylow 3-subgroups and 9 Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 9.\n\n3. If G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, then G cannot have unique Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 9.\n\nFrom the possible values of n_3 and n_2, we can conclude the following:\n\n- If n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1, then G is isomorphic to C72.\n- If n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 9, then G can be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot determine the exact isomorphism class of G."
