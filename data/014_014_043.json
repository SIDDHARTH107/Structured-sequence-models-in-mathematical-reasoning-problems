    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTOLOGY\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 matrix using the key and the English alphabet (excluding the letter 'J', which is usually combined with 'I').\n\n2. Pair the plaintext letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them.\n\n3. Encrypt the pairs using the Playfair cipher rules.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 matrix:\n\n   C R Y P T\n   O L G A B\n   D E F H I\n   K M N Q S\n   U V W X Z\n\n2. Pair the plaintext letters and insert 'X' if needed:\n\n   MA TH EM AT IX CS\n\n3. Encrypt the pairs:\n\n   - MA: M is in row 3, column 2, and A is in row 1, column 4. So, the encrypted pair is DF.\n   - TH: T is in row 0, column 4, and H is in row 2, column 3. So, the encrypted pair is PY.\n   - EM: E is in row 2, column 1, and M is in row 3, column 1. So, the encrypted pair is DR.\n   - AT: A is in row 1, column 4, and T is in row 0, column 4. So, the encrypted pair is OG.\n   - IX: I is in row 2, column 4, and X is in row 4, column 3. So, the encrypted pair is NZ.\n   - CS: C is in row 0, column 0, and S is in row 3, column 4. So, the encrypted pair is KU.\n\nSo, the Playfair cipher encryption of the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the key \"CRYPTOLOGY\" is:\n\n   DFPYDROGNZKU"
