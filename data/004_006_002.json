    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x, we first need to find its first and second derivatives.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 18x + 24) = 6x - 18\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for x:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFactor:\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSolutions:\nx = 2, x = 4\n\nNow, we have two critical points: x = 2 and x = 4. To classify them as maximum, minimum, or inflection points, we need to analyze the second derivative at these points:\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 18 = -6\nf''(4) = 6(4) - 18 = 6\n\nSince f''(2) < 0, the point x = 2 is a local maximum.\nSince f''(4) > 0, the point x = 4 is a local minimum.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 5]:\n\nf'(0) = 3(0)^2 - 18(0) + 24 = 24 (not a critical point, since f'(0) ≠ 0)\nf'(5) = 3(5)^2 - 18(5) + 24 = -1 (not a critical point, since f'(5) ≠ 0)\n\nSo, within the interval [0, 5], there are two critical points:\n- x = 2 is a local maximum\n- x = 4 is a local minimum"
