    "message_2": "To find the derivative dy/dx, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as an implicit function of x. We'll use the chain rule when necessary.\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) + d/dx (sin(xy)) = d/dx (10)\n\nDifferentiating each term:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) + (cos(xy))(y + x(dy/dx)) = 0\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) + x(dy/dx)cos(xy) = -2x - ycos(xy)\n\nFactor dy/dx from the left side:\n\ndy/dx(2y + xcos(xy)) = -2x - ycos(xy)\n\nNow, divide both sides by (2y + xcos(xy)) to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (-2x - ycos(xy)) / (2y + xcos(xy))\n\nFinally, we'll evaluate dy/dx at the point (1, 2):\n\ndy/dx = (-2(1) - 2cos(2)) / (2(2) + 1cos(2))\n\ndy/dx = (-2 - 2cos(2)) / (4 + cos(2))\n\nThis is the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (1, 2)."
