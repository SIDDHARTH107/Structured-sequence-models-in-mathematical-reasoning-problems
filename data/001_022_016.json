    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x - 8\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^3 + 4(0)^2 - 6(0) - 8\n\nLet's first find the y-intercept:\n\ny = -8\n\nSo the y-intercept is (0, -8).\n\nNow let's find the x-intercepts:\n\n0 = 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x - 8\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it doesn't factor easily. We can use either synthetic division or the Rational Root Theorem to find the roots. Let's use the Rational Root Theorem:\n\nThe possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (8) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (2). So the possible rational roots are:\n\n±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±1/2, ±2/2, ±4/2, ±8/2\n\n±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±1/2, ±1, ±2, ±4\n\nNow we can test these possible roots to see if they are actual roots of the equation:\n\nFor x = 1: 2(1)^3 + 4(1)^2 - 6(1) - 8 = 2 + 4 - 6 - 8 = -8 ≠ 0\nFor x = -1: 2(-1)^3 + 4(-1)^2 - 6(-1) - 8 = -2 + 4 + 6 - 8 = 0\n\nSo x = -1 is a root of the equation. Now we can use synthetic division to find the remaining roots:\n\n-1 |  2  4  -6  -8\n       -2   2   4\n-------------------\n     2  2  -4  -4\n\nThe quotient is 2x^2 + 2x - 4. We can now solve this quadratic equation:\n\n2x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 + x - 2 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo the remaining roots are x = -2 and x = 1.\n\nNow we have the x-intercepts: (-1, 0), (-2, 0), and (1, 0).\n\nTo graph the equation, plot the x-intercepts and the y-intercept, and then sketch the curve of the cubic equation:\n\n1. Plot the x-intercepts: (-1, 0), (-2, 0), and (1, 0)\n2. Plot the y-intercept: (0, -8)\n3. Sketch the curve of the cubic equation, making sure it passes through the intercepts and has the general shape of a cubic equation (an \"S\" shape).\n\nThe graph of the equation y = 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 6x - 8 will have x-intercepts at (-1, 0), (-2, 0), and (1, 0) and a y-intercept at (0, -8)."
