    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of f(x), we need to calculate the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to calculate the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx (for n = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's calculate b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1) * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (1) * sin(nx) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-∫[-π, 0] sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] sin(nx) dx]\n\nIntegrating sin(nx) with respect to x, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-(-cos(nx)/n)|[-π, 0] + (cos(nx)/n)|[0, π]]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(cos(nπ)/n - cos(0)/n) + (cos(nπ)/n - cos(0)/n)]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (2/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = Σ (b_n * sin(nx))\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nx)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of f(π/3) using the first three terms of the series:\n\nf(π/3) = (2/π) * [(cos(π) - 1) * sin(π/3) + (1/2) * (cos(2π) - 1) * sin(2π/3) + (1/3) * (cos(3π) - 1) * sin(3π/3)]\n\nf(π/3) = (2/π) * [(-2) * (1/2) + 0 + (2/3) * (-1) * 0]\n\nf(π/3) = (2/π) * (-1)\n\nf(π/3) ≈ -0.6366\n\nSo, the value of f(π/3) using the first three terms of the Fourier series is approximately -0.6366."
