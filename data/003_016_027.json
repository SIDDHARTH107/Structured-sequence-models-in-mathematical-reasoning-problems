    "message_2": "The general form of a sine function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function y = 2sin(2x + pi/4), we can rewrite it as y = 2sin(2(x + pi/8)) by factoring out the 2 from the argument.\n\nNow, comparing it to the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is pi/8.\n\nSo, the phase shift for the function y = 2sin(2x + pi/4) is pi/8 radians."
