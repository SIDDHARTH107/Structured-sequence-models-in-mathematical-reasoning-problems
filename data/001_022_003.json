    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 3x^2 - 10x + 24\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we can try factoring the polynomial or using synthetic division. In this case, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of 24 divided by the factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). These are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, and ±24.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = 2 is a root:\n\n0 = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 - 10(2) + 24\n0 = 8 - 12 - 20 + 24\n0 = 0\n\nNow that we have found one root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining roots:\n\nDividing the polynomial by (x - 2):\n\n            x^2 - x - 6\n          ______________\nx - 2 | x^3 - 3x^2 - 10x + 24\n            x^3 - 2x^2\n          ______________\n                     -1x^2 - 10x\n                     -1x^2 + 2x\n          ______________\n                             -12x + 24\n                             -12x + 24\n          ______________\n                                        0\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as (x - 2)(x^2 - x - 6). Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - x - 6 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -6:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-6))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 24)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √25) / 2\nx = (1 ± 5) / 2\n\nThis gives us two more roots: x = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3 and x = (1 - 5) / 2 = -2.\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = -2, x = 2, and x = 3.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 - 10(0) + 24\ny = 24\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = 24.\n\nIn summary, the x-intercepts are x = -2, x = 2, and x = 3, and the y-intercept is y = 24."
