    "message_2": "First, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 with respect to x. \n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), so:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(4x)/dx + d(5)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^(2-1)) - 4(1x^(1-1)) + 0\nf'(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 4\nf'(2) = 12 - 4\nf'(2) = 8\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 at x = 2 is 8."
