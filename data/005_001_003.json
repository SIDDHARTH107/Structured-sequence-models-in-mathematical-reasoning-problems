    "message_1": "A soft drink company claims that the average volume of its cans is 355 milliliters. To test this claim, a sample of 25 cans is taken and the volume of each can is recorded. The data shows a mean volume of 351 milliliters with a standard deviation of 4 milliliters. Does this data provide sufficient evidence to contradict the company's claim at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean volume of the cans is 355 milliliters, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean volume is not 355 milliliters.\n\nH0: μ = 355 ml\nH1: μ ≠ 355 ml\n\nGiven data:\nSample mean (x̄) = 351 ml\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample standard deviation (s) = 4 ml\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (351 - 355) / (4 / √25)\nt = (-4) / (4 / 5)\nt = -4 / 0.8\nt = -5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% significance level and 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical = ± 2.064\n\nNow, we compare the calculated t-score with the critical t-value:\n\n-5 < -2.064\n\nSince the calculated t-score is less than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is sufficient evidence to contradict the company's claim that the average volume of its cans is 355 milliliters at a 5% significance level."
