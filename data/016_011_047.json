    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, which means that with each iteration, the pattern repeats itself on a smaller scale. The fractal is formed by dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the middle square and the corner squares, leaving only the 4 squares at the center of each edge.\n\nThe area of the remaining squares after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (initial area) * (number of remaining squares) / (total number of squares)\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, the number of remaining squares is 4, and the total number of squares is 9. So, the area after each iteration can be calculated as:\n\nArea = (initial area) * (4/9)\n\nAfter the 5th iteration, the area can be calculated as:\n\nArea = 1 * (4/9)^5\n\nArea â‰ˆ 0.0137174\n\nSo, the area of the Vicsek fractal after the 5th iteration is approximately 0.0137174."
