    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph with 10 vertices into 3 components, we need to remove at least enough edges to separate the vertices into 3 disjoint sets. One way to do this is to remove edges that connect 2 vertices to the rest of the graph, and then remove edges that connect another 2 vertices to the remaining 6 vertices. This would result in 3 components: one with 2 vertices, one with another 2 vertices, and one with the remaining 6 vertices.\n\nTo disconnect the first 2 vertices, we need to remove at least 2 edges (one for each vertex). Then, to disconnect the next 2 vertices from the remaining 6, we need to remove at least another 2 edges (one for each of the next 2 vertices). So, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThe edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In this case, the edge connectivity is 4, as we determined that removing 4 edges is the minimum required to disconnect the graph into 3 components."
