    "message_2": "To encrypt a plaintext using the Vigenère cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the plaintext. In this case, the keyword becomes \"MATHMATHMATHM\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenère square (or tabula recta) to encrypt the plaintext. For each letter in the plaintext, we find the corresponding row in the Vigenère square using the plaintext letter, and then find the corresponding column using the keyword letter. The letter at the intersection of the row and column is the encrypted letter.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter in the plaintext \"ATTACKATDAWN\":\n\n1. A (plaintext) + M (keyword) = M (ciphertext)\n2. T + A = T\n3. T + T = X\n4. A + H = H\n5. C + M = O\n6. K + A = K\n7. A + T = T\n8. T + H = W\n9. D + M = W\n10. A + A = A\n11. W + T = D\n12. N + H = T\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"MTXHOKTWWDAT\"."
