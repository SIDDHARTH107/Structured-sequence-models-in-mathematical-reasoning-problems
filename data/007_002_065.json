    "message_2": "Let's start by finding the smallest three-digit multiple of 9. The smallest three-digit number is 100. Dividing 100 by 9, we get 11 with a remainder of 1. So, the smallest three-digit multiple of 9 is 9 * 11 = 99.\n\nNow, let's check each multiple of 9 and see if its reverse is a multiple of 4.\n\n- 99 * 2 = 198, reverse is 891 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 3 = 297, reverse is 792 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 4 = 396, reverse is 693 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 5 = 495, reverse is 594 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 6 = 594, reverse is 495 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 7 = 693, reverse is 396 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 8 = 792, reverse is 297 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 9 = 891, reverse is 198 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 10 = 990, reverse is 099 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 11 = 1089, reverse is 9801 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 12 = 1188, reverse is 8811 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 13 = 1287, reverse is 7821 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 14 = 1386, reverse is 6831 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 15 = 1485, reverse is 5841 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 16 = 1584, reverse is 4851 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 17 = 1683, reverse is 3861 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 18 = 1782, reverse is 2871 (not a multiple of 4)\n- 99 * 19 = 1881, reverse is 1881 (a multiple of 4)\n\nSo, the smallest three-digit multiple of 9 which, when its digits are reversed, yields a multiple of 4 is 1881."
