    "message_1": "A group of two hunters A and B are going for hunting. They have two choices: to hunt a stag or a hare. Hunting a stag requires both of them to cooperate while hunting the hare can be done individually. If they both go after the stag, they will be more successful and get a payoff of 12. If one goes after the stag while the other goes after the hare, the payoff is 0. If they both go after the hare, they will get a payoff of 4 each. \n\nWhat should be the strategy of each hunter to maximize their payoff in the Stag Hunt game?",
    "message_2": "In the Stag Hunt game, there are two Nash equilibria: both hunters going after the stag (cooperating) and both hunters going after the hare (not cooperating). To maximize their payoff, the hunters should choose the strategy of both going after the stag, as this will result in a higher payoff (12) compared to both going after the hare (4 each, totaling 8).\n\nHowever, this strategy requires trust and communication between the hunters, as they need to be sure that the other will also go after the stag. If one hunter believes the other will go after the hare, they may choose to do the same to avoid getting a payoff of 0. Therefore, the best strategy for each hunter to maximize their payoff is to cooperate and both go after the stag, but this requires trust and communication to ensure that both hunters follow through with the plan."
