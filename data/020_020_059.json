    "message_2": "To find the dimensions that would give the maximum area for a rectangular garden with a fixed perimeter, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and the formula for the area of a rectangle.\n\nLet the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the perimeter is fixed at 60 meters, we have:\n\n60 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (60 - 2L) / 2\nW = 30 - L\n\nThe area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for W from above into the area formula:\n\nA = L * (30 - L)\n\nA = 30L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to L and set it to zero:\n\ndA/dL = 30 - 2L = 0\n\nSolve for L:\n\n2L = 30\nL = 15\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 30 - 15\nW = 15\n\nSo, the dimensions that would give the maximum area for the rectangular garden with a fixed perimeter of 60 meters are 15 meters by 15 meters."
