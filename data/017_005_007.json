    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup, say P, of order 5^3 = 125. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 5 and divides the order of G, which is 125. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which means P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we consider the structure of P. Since P has order 125, it is a p-group with p = 5. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_125 (cyclic group of order 125)\n2. C_25 × C_5 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5)\n3. C_5 × C_5 × C_5 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5)\n\nWe will show that the third option is not possible, and thus, G must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nSuppose P is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5 × C_5. Then, the center of P, Z(P), must be non-trivial, as the center of a non-trivial p-group is always non-trivial. However, the center of C_5 × C_5 × C_5 is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5 × C_5 itself, which means that every element of P commutes with every other element of P. This implies that P is abelian, which contradicts the assumption that P is isomorphic to C_5 × C_5 × C_5.\n\nTherefore, P must be isomorphic to either C_125 or C_25 × C_5. Since P is a normal subgroup of G and G has order 125, we have that G is isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to C_125 (cyclic group of order 125)\n2. G is isomorphic to C_25 × C_5 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5)\n\nThus, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
