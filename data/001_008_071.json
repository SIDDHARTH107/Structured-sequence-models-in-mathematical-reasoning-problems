    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 4 < 10, we need to isolate x. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality:\n   3x + 4 - 4 < 10 - 4\n   3x < 6\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 3:\n   3x/3 < 6/3\n   x < 2\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x < 2. To graph this solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with 2 as a reference point.\n2. Since x is strictly less than 2, place an open circle at 2.\n3. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating that all values of x less than 2 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---( )--->\n    2"
