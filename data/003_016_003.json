    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In this case, the function is f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/4). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the argument of the sine function, which is (3x - π/4).\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, we have A = 2, B = 3, and the argument is (3x - π/4).\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to rewrite the argument in the form B(x - C). In this case, we have:\n\n3x - π/4 = 3(x - C)\n\nNow, we can see that C = π/12, since:\n\n3x - π/4 = 3x - 3(π/12) = 3(x - π/12)\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x - π/4) is π/12."
