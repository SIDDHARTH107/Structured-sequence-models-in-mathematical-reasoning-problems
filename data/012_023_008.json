The clique number is the size of the largest clique in the graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the clique number, we need to identify the largest clique in the graph. Let's examine the graph:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 3.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1 and 3.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 3 and 5.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's find the largest clique:\n\n1. Vertices 1, 2, and 3 form a clique, as they are all connected to each other.\n2. Vertices 3, 4, and 5 also form a clique, as they are all connected to each other.\n\nThere are no larger cliques in the graph. Therefore, the clique number of the graph is 3."
