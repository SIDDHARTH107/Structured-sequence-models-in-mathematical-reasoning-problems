    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm.\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 5^2 + 12^2\nc^2 = 25 + 144\nc^2 = 169\nc = âˆš169\nc = 13 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the triangle, we add the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 5 + 12 + 13\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 30 cm."
