    "message_2": "To find the particular solution of the given differential equation y' + 2y = 5cos(x), we first find the complementary function and then the particular integral.\n\n1. Complementary function:\nThe complementary function is the solution of the homogeneous equation y' + 2y = 0. The characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nr + 2 = 0\nr = -2\n\nSo, the complementary function is:\n\nyc(x) = Ae^(-2x)\n\n2. Particular integral:\nTo find the particular integral, we assume a solution of the form:\n\nyp(x) = Bcos(x) + Csin(x)\n\nNow, we find the first derivative of yp(x):\n\nyp'(x) = -Bsin(x) + Ccos(x)\n\nSubstitute yp(x) and yp'(x) into the given differential equation:\n\n(-Bsin(x) + Ccos(x)) + 2(Bcos(x) + Csin(x)) = 5cos(x)\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of cos(x) and sin(x):\n\nFor cos(x): C + 2B = 5\nFor sin(x): -B + 2C = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nB = 1\nC = 1/2\n\nSo, the particular integral is:\n\nyp(x) = cos(x) + (1/2)sin(x)\n\n3. General solution:\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary function and the particular integral:\n\ny(x) = yc(x) + yp(x)\ny(x) = Ae^(-2x) + cos(x) + (1/2)sin(x)\n\n4. Particular solution:\nGiven the initial condition y(0) = 1, we can find the value of A:\n\n1 = A*e^0 + cos(0) + (1/2)sin(0)\n1 = A + 1\n\nA = 0\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = cos(x) + (1/2)sin(x)"
