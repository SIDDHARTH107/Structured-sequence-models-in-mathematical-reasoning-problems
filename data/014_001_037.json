    "message_1": "Alice and Bob want to communicate securely using RSA encryption. Alice chooses two prime numbers p=11 and q=17, and calculates n=pq=187 and phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)=160. She then chooses e=7 as a public key. If Bob wants to send Alice the message \"35\", what is the encrypted message that he should send to her? Also, what is the private key that Alice should use to decrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message, Bob will use Alice's public key (n, e) = (187, 7). The encryption formula is:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) mod n\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nciphertext = (35^7) mod 187\n\nCalculating the result:\n\nciphertext = 104\n\nSo, the encrypted message Bob should send to Alice is \"104\".\n\nNow, to find the private key (d) that Alice should use to decrypt the message, we need to find a value for d such that:\n\n(e * d) mod phi(n) = 1\n\nIn other words, we need to find the modular inverse of e (7) with respect to phi(n) (160):\n\n7 * d mod 160 = 1\n\nThe value of d that satisfies this equation is 23. You can verify this by checking that (7 * 23) mod 160 = 1.\n\nSo, the private key that Alice should use to decrypt the message is d = 23."
