    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  3  2 | -1 + 3i ]\n[ 2 -1  7 |  2 - 4i ]\n[ 5  2 -1 |  3 + 2i ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the coefficients below the pivot element in the first column.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 5 * Row1\n\n```\n[ 1  3   2  | -1 + 3i ]\n[ 0 -7  3  |  4 - 10i ]\n[ 0 -13 -9 |  8 - 13i ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7 to make the pivot element in the second row equal to 1.\n\nRow2 = Row2 / -7\n\n```\n[ 1  3    2  | -1 + 3i ]\n[ 0  1 -3/7 | -4/7 + 10/7i ]\n[ 0 -13 -9  |  8 - 13i ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the coefficients below the pivot element in the second column.\n\nRow3 = Row3 + 13 * Row2\n\n```\n[ 1  3    2  | -1 + 3i ]\n[ 0  1 -3/7 | -4/7 + 10/7i ]\n[ 0  0 -2/7 |  0 + 6i ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -2/7 to make the pivot element in the third row equal to 1.\n\nRow3 = Row3 / (-2/7)\n\n```\n[ 1  3    2  | -1 + 3i ]\n[ 0  1 -3/7 | -4/7 + 10/7i ]\n[ 0  0   1  |  0 - 3i ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Perform back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nz = 0 - 3i\n\ny = -4/7 + 10/7i + 3/7 * z = -4/7 + 10/7i + 3/7(0 - 3i) = -4/7 + 10/7i - 9/7i = -4/7 + 1/7i\n\nx = -1 + 3i - 3y - 2z = -1 + 3i - 3(-4/7 + 1/7i) - 2(0 - 3i) = -1 + 3i + 12/7 - 3/7i + 6i = -1 + 12/7 + 3i - 3/7i + 6i = 5/7 + 9i\n\nSo, the solution set as a vector in terms of the variables x, y, and z is:\n\n[ 5/7 + 9i ]\n[ -4/7 + 1/7i ]\n[ 0 - 3i ]"
