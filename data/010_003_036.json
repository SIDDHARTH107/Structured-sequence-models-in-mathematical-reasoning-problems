    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information. We have a topological space X with the property that every two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets. This means that X is a Hausdorff space (also known as a T2 space). We are also given that X has exactly 7 open sets.\n\nNow let's consider the open sets in X. Since X is a topological space, it must contain the empty set Ã˜ and the whole space X as open sets. So, we have 5 more open sets to consider.\n\nLet's assume that X has n points. Since X is a Hausdorff space, for each pair of distinct points, there must be disjoint open sets containing them. Let's consider the maximum number of points that can be separated by these 5 open sets.\n\nIf we have 1 open set, we can separate at most 2 points (one in the open set and one in its complement).\n\nIf we add another open set, we can separate at most 3 points: one in the intersection of the first two open sets, one in the first open set but not the second, and one in the second open set but not the first.\n\nContinuing this process, we can separate at most 4 points with 3 open sets, 5 points with 4 open sets, and 6 points with 5 open sets.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of points that X can have is 6."
