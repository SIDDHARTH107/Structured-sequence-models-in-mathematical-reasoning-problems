    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the power series method. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$\\psi(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n$\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$\\psi'(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}$\n\n$\\psi''(x) = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n x^{n-2}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n x^{n-2} + (4 - x^2) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n = 0$\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of each power of $x$ to zero. For the constant term, we have:\n\n$2a_2 + 4a_0 = 0$\n\nFor the linear term, we have:\n\n$6a_3 + 4a_1 = 0$\n\nFor the quadratic term and higher, we have:\n\n$n(n-1)a_n + 4a_{n-2} - a_{n-4} = 0$ for $n \\geq 4$\n\nUsing the initial conditions $\\psi(0) = 1$ and $\\psi'(0) = 0$, we get $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 0$. Now, we can find the other coefficients recursively:\n\n$a_2 = -\\frac{4}{2} a_0 = -2$\n\n$a_3 = -\\frac{4}{6} a_1 = 0$\n\n$a_4 = -\\frac{4}{12} a_2 + \\frac{1}{12} a_0 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n$a_5 = -\\frac{4}{20} a_3 = 0$\n\nAnd so on. The general solution for the Schrödinger equation is:\n\n$\\psi(x) = 1 - 2x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x^4 + \\cdots$\n\nThis is an even function, which is consistent with the initial conditions. Note that this solution converges only for a certain range of $x$, and it may not be valid for all values of $x$. However, this is the complex solution for the Schrödinger equation with the given initial conditions."
