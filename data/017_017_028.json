    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 30 is 2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, we consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, the group is the direct product of these subgroups, which gives us the cyclic group of order 30, C_30.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since there are two possible actions of a group of order 2 on a group of order 3 (trivial and non-trivial), there are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: C_6 × C_5 and D_6 × C_5.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 10, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup. However, there is only one action of a group of order 3 on a group of order 5 (trivial), so there is only one non-isomorphic group in this case: C_2 × C_15.\n\nThus, there are 4 distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30: C_30, C_6 × C_5, D_6 × C_5, and C_2 × C_15."
