    "message_1": "A metal rod is formed into a circular arc with a radius of 4 meters. The angle that the arc subtends at the center is 60 degrees. If the temperature profile along the rod can be modeled using the function $T(\\theta)=100\\sin(\\theta)+120$, where $\\theta$ is the angle in radians, find the average temperature of the rod. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the average temperature of the rod, we need to integrate the temperature function over the length of the arc and then divide by the length of the arc. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can set up the integral for the average temperature:\n\nAverage temperature = (1 / length of arc) * ∫[T(θ) * d(arc length)]\n\nThe differential arc length, d(arc length), can be expressed as:\n\nd(arc length) = R * dθ\n\nwhere R is the radius of the circle (4 meters in this case).\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nAverage temperature = (1 / length of arc) * ∫[T(θ) * 4 * dθ]\n\nThe length of the arc can be calculated as:\n\nLength of arc = R * θ = 4 * π/3\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the integral:\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * ∫[T(θ) * 4 * dθ] from 0 to π/3\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * ∫[(100 * sin(θ) + 120) * 4 * dθ] from 0 to π/3\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * [(-400 * cos(θ) + 480 * θ) | from 0 to π/3]\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * [(-400 * cos(π/3) + 480 * π/3) - (-400 * cos(0) + 480 * 0)]\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * [(-400 * 1/2 + 480 * π/3) - (-400 * 1)]\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * (-200 + 480 * π/3 + 400)\n\nAverage temperature = (3 / (4 * π)) * (200 + 480 * π/3)\n\nAverage temperature ≈ (3 / (4 * π)) * (200 + 480 * 1.047)\n\nAverage temperature ≈ (3 / (4 * π)) * (200 + 502.56)\n\nAverage temperature ≈ (3 / (4 * π)) * 702.56\n\nAverage temperature ≈ 167.43\n\nThe average temperature of the rod is approximately 167.43°C."
