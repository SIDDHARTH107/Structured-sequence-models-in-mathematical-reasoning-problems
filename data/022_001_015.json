    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = sqrt(z-1) from z=1 to z=4, we need to consider a path in the complex plane that connects these two points and avoids the branch point at z=1.\n\nLet's choose a straight line path from z=1 to z=4. We can parameterize this path as:\n\nz(t) = 1 + 3t, where t âˆˆ [0, 1]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function f(z) in terms of t:\n\nf(z(t)) = sqrt(z(t) - 1) = sqrt(3t)\n\nTo find the analytic continuation, we need to find a function that is analytic on the path z(t) and agrees with f(z(t)) on this path. Since f(z(t)) = sqrt(3t) is already analytic on the path, it is the analytic continuation of the function f(z) from z=1 to z=4.\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of f(z) = sqrt(z-1) from z=1 to z=4 is f(z(t)) = sqrt(3t)."
