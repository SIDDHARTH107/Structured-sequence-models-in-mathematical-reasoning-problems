    "message_1": "Consider the two curves in the xy-plane: \n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 = 4 and C2: y = x^3 - 2x \n\nFind the number of intersection points of these two curves.",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the two curves, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 = 4\nC2: y = x^3 - 2x\n\nFirst, we can substitute the expression for y from C2 into C1:\n\nx^2 + (x^3 - 2x)^2 = 4\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x. Expand the equation:\n\nx^2 + (x^6 - 4x^4 + 4x^2) = 4\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nx^6 - 4x^4 + 5x^2 - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a sextic polynomial equation. To find the number of intersection points, we need to find the number of real roots of this equation. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots, but none of them work. \n\nWe can also analyze the equation graphically or use numerical methods to approximate the roots. By doing so, we find that there are 3 real roots for x. For each value of x, there is a corresponding value of y from the equation y = x^3 - 2x. Therefore, there are 3 intersection points of the two curves."
