    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 7, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nSo, for the given function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(7)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 2x^(2-1) + 2 * 1x^(1-1) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at the point x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) + 2\nf'(4) = 24 + 2\nf'(4) = 26\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 7 at the point x = 4 is 26."
