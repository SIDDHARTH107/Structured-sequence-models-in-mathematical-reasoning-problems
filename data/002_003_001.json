    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of one face, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared (s^2). In this case, the side length is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one face = s^2 = 5^2 = 25 square centimeters\n\nSince there are 6 faces on a cube, we can multiply the area of one face by 6 to find the total surface area.\n\nTotal surface area = 6 * 25 = 150 square centimeters"
