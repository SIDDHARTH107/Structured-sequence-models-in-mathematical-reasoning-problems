    "message_2": "To find the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network in a day, we first need to find the average number of DDoS attacks per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the average number of attacks per week by 7:\n\nAverage number of DDoS attacks per day = 4.2 attacks/week / 7 days/week = 0.6 attacks/day\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of a DDoS attack occurring in a day. The formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-位) * 位^x) / x!\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x events occurring in a given time period, 位 is the average number of events in that time period, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and x! is the factorial of x.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one DDoS attack occurring in a day (x = 1), and the average number of attacks per day is 0.6 (位 = 0.6).\n\nP(1) = (e^(-0.6) * 0.6^1) / 1! = (0.54881 * 0.6) / 1 = 0.32929\n\nHowever, this is the probability of exactly one DDoS attack occurring in a day. To find the probability of at least one attack, we need to find the probability of zero attacks and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(0) = (e^(-0.6) * 0.6^0) / 0! = (0.54881 * 1) / 1 = 0.54881\n\nProbability of at least one DDoS attack = 1 - P(0) = 1 - 0.54881 = 0.45119\n\nSo, the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on the network in a day is approximately 0.45119 or 45.12%."
