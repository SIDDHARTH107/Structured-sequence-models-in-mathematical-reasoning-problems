    "message_2": "In a rail fence cipher with a height of 3, the plaintext message is written in a zigzag pattern along three lines, and the encrypted message is formed by reading the letters along each line from left to right. Here's how the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" would be arranged:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A T M T I T C\n  H   A   I\n\nNow, read the letters along each line from left to right to form the encrypted message: MEASATMTITCHAI\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"MEASATMTITCHAI\"."
