Write down the truth values of the following predicate logic statements:\n\n1. ∀x∃y P(x,y)\n2. ∃y∀x P(x,y)\n3. ∃y∀x ¬P(x,y)\n\nWhich statement(s) are true and which statement(s) are false?",
    "message_2": "1. ∀x∃y P(x,y): \"For all x, there exists a y such that x is divisible by y.\"\n\nThis statement is true. For any natural number x in the given universe of discourse (1 to 30), there always exists a y (at least 1 and x itself) such that x is divisible by y.\n\n2. ∃y∀x P(x,y): \"There exists a y such that for all x, x is divisible by y.\"\n\nThis statement is false. There is no single y that divides all natural numbers from 1 to 30. The smallest common multiple of all numbers from 1 to 30 is 232792560, which is not in the given universe of discourse.\n\n3. ∃y∀x ¬P(x,y): \"There exists a y such that for all x, x is not divisible by y.\"\n\nThis statement is true. For example, consider y = 30. For all x in the given universe of discourse (1 to 30), except for x = 30, x is not divisible by y (30).\n\nIn summary:\nStatement 1 is true.\nStatement 2 is false.\nStatement 3 is true."
