    "message_2": "To graph the line y = 3x - 5, we can find two points on the line and connect them.\n\n1. Find the x-intercept:\nTo find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x.\n0 = 3x - 5\n5 = 3x\nx = 5/3\n\nSo, the x-intercept is (5/3, 0).\n\n2. Find the y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y.\ny = 3(0) - 5\ny = -5\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -5).\n\nNow, we can plot these two points on a graph and draw a line through them. The line representing the equation y = 3x - 5 will pass through the points (5/3, 0) and (0, -5)."
