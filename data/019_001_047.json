Alice says, \"If Bob is absent, then Cindy is present.\" Bob says, \"If Alice is present, then Cindy is also present.\" Cindy says, \"If Alice is present, then Bob is present.\" If we know that Alice is present, which of the following statements must be true: (1) Bob is present (2) Bob is absent (3) Cindy is present (4) Cindy is absent?",
    "message_2": "Since we know that Alice is present, we can use the statements made by Bob and Cindy to determine the presence of the other two students.\n\nBob says, \"If Alice is present, then Cindy is also present.\" Since Alice is present, this statement implies that Cindy must be present. Therefore, statement (3) Cindy is present must be true.\n\nCindy says, \"If Alice is present, then Bob is present.\" Since Alice is present, this statement implies that Bob must be present. Therefore, statement (1) Bob is present must be true.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements that must be true are (1) Bob is present and (3) Cindy is present."
