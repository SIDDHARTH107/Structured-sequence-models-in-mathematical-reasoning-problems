    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the point $z = 2$, we first need to find a different representation of $f(z)$ that converges in a larger region, including the point $z = 2$. We can do this by rewriting the given power series as a geometric series.\n\nLet's consider the function $g(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^{n+1}$. Then, we have:\n\n$g(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}} z^{n+1} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n+1) \\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\right)^{n+1}$\n\nNow, let's differentiate $g(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$g'(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n+1)^2 \\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\right)^n$\n\nWe can recognize this as a geometric series with the common ratio $\\frac{z}{2}$ and the first term $1$. Thus, we can find the sum of this geometric series:\n\n$g'(z) = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{2}\\right)^2}$\n\nNow, we need to find $g(z)$ by integrating $g'(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$g(z) = \\int g'(z) dz = \\int \\frac{1}{\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{2}\\right)^2} dz$\n\nUsing substitution, let $u = 1 - \\frac{z}{2}$, then $-2 du = dz$:\n\n$g(z) = -2 \\int \\frac{1}{u^2} du = -2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{u}\\right) + C = \\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{z}{2}} + C$\n\nNow, we can find the constant $C$ by noting that $g(0) = 0$:\n\n$0 = \\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{0}{2}} + C \\Rightarrow C = -2$\n\nSo, $g(z) = \\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{z}{2}} - 2$\n\nFinally, we can find $f(z)$ by subtracting $g(z)$ from the original power series:\n\n$f(z) = g(z) - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n = \\left(\\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{z}{2}} - 2\\right) - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}} z^n$\n\nNow, we can evaluate $f(z)$ at $z = 2$:\n\n$f(2) = \\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{2}{2}} - 2 = \\frac{2}{0} - 2$\n\nThis expression is undefined, which means that the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the point $z = 2$ does not exist."
