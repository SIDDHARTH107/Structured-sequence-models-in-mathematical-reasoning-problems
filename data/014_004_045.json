    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10 over the finite field Z_11, we can use the Hasse's theorem, which states that the number of points on the elliptic curve (including the point at infinity) is in the range:\n\nq + 1 - 2√q ≤ N ≤ q + 1 + 2√q\n\nwhere q is the size of the finite field (in this case, q = 11) and N is the number of points on the elliptic curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the range for N:\n\n11 + 1 - 2√11 ≤ N ≤ 11 + 1 + 2√11\n1.68 ≤ N ≤ 20.32\n\nSince N must be an integer, we have 2 ≤ N ≤ 20.\n\nNow, we can check each x value in Z_11 and see if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the elliptic curve equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10 (mod 11)\n\nFor each x value in Z_11, we can calculate the right side of the equation and check if it is a quadratic residue (i.e., if there is a y value that satisfies the equation).\n\nx = 0: y^2 = 0^3 - 7*0 + 10 = 10 (mod 11) => y = ±1 (mod 11)\nx = 1: y^2 = 1^3 - 7*1 + 10 = 4 (mod 11) => y = ±2 (mod 11)\nx = 2: y^2 = 2^3 - 7*2 + 10 = 6 (mod 11) => no solution\nx = 3: y^2 = 3^3 - 7*3 + 10 = 8 (mod 11) => no solution\nx = 4: y^2 = 4^3 - 7*4 + 10 = 6 (mod 11) => no solution\nx = 5: y^2 = 5^3 - 7*5 + 10 = 5 (mod 11) => y = ±4 (mod 11)\nx = 6: y^2 = 6^3 - 7*6 + 10 = 5 (mod 11) => y = ±4 (mod 11)\nx = 7: y^2 = 7^3 - 7*7 + 10 = 6 (mod 11) => no solution\nx = 8: y^2 = 8^3 - 7*8 + 10 = 8 (mod 11) => no solution\nx = 9: y^2 = 9^3 - 7*9 + 10 = 6 (mod 11) => no solution\nx = 10: y^2 = 10^3 - 7*10 + 10 = 10 (mod 11) => y = ±1 (mod 11)\n\nWe found 7 points on the elliptic curve (including the duplicates) and the point at infinity. Therefore, the order of the elliptic curve is 8."
