    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we first need to understand the topology of the projective closure $X$ of the given algebraic variety.\n\nThe given equation $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$ defines an elliptic curve $E$ over the complex numbers. To find the projective closure, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable $z$ and multiplying each term by the appropriate power of $z$ to make all terms homogeneous of the same degree. In this case, we get the equation $y^2z = x^3 - 2x z^2 + 2z^3$.\n\nNow, we consider the complex points of the projective closure $X$. As an elliptic curve, $X$ is a smooth projective curve of genus 1. It is well-known that the singular cohomology of a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ is given by:\n\n$H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$,\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\nand all other cohomology groups are trivial. In our case, since $g = 1$, we have:\n\n$H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n$H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$,\n$H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\nand all other cohomology groups are trivial, including $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, the dimension of the space $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is 0."
