    "message_1": "Suppose you have $50,000 to invest in a portfolio comprised of stocks A, B, and C. The expected annual return and standard deviation of each stock are as follows:\n\nStock A: Expected annual return = 10%, Standard deviation = 15%\nStock B: Expected annual return = 15%, Standard deviation = 20%\nStock C: Expected annual return = 12%, Standard deviation = 10%\n\nDetermine the optimal allocation of your investment among the three stocks to maximize the expected return while keeping the overall risk (measured by the portfolio standard deviation) below 18%.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal allocation of the investment among the three stocks to maximize the expected return while keeping the overall risk (measured by the portfolio standard deviation) below 18%. Let's denote the proportion of the investment in stocks A, B, and C as x, y, and z, respectively. \n\nSince the total investment is $50,000, we have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z = 1 (The sum of the proportions should be equal to 1)\n2. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0 (The proportions should be non-negative)\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n\nExpected Return = 0.10x + 0.15y + 0.12z\n\nThe variance of the portfolio is given by:\n\nVariance = (0.15^2)x^2 + (0.20^2)y^2 + (0.10^2)z^2 + 2 * Cov(A, B) * x * y + 2 * Cov(A, C) * x * z + 2 * Cov(B, C) * y * z\n\nHowever, we don't have the covariance values between the stocks. In this case, we can't find the exact optimal allocation. But we can still make some observations and suggestions.\n\nSince Stock B has the highest expected return (15%) and Stock C has the lowest standard deviation (10%), it would be reasonable to allocate a significant portion of the investment to these two stocks. Stock A has a lower expected return than Stock B and a higher standard deviation than Stock C, so it might be less attractive in this scenario.\n\nWithout the covariance values, we can't provide the exact optimal allocation. However, we can suggest that the investor should consider allocating a higher proportion of their investment to Stocks B and C, while keeping the overall risk below 18%. The investor can then adjust the allocation based on their risk tolerance and preferences."
