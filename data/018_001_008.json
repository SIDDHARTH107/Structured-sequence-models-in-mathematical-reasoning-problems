    "message_2": "To show that the empty set (denoted as âˆ…) is a subset of both A and B, we need to prove that every element in the empty set is also an element of A and B.\n\nBy definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A or B. Since there are no counterexamples, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of both A and B."
