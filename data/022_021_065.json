For the term 3t^2:\n\nL{3t^2} = 3 * L{t^2}\n\nUsing the formula for the Laplace transform of t^n (where n is a positive integer):\n\nL{t^n} = n! / s^(n+1)\n\nL{t^2} = 2! / s^3 = 2 / s^3\n\nSo, L{3t^2} = 3 * (2 / s^3) = 6 / s^3\n\n2. For the term 10t:\n\nL{10t} = 10 * L{t}\n\nUsing the formula for the Laplace transform of t^n:\n\nL{t} = 1! / s^2 = 1 / s^2\n\nSo, L{10t} = 10 * (1 / s^2) = 10 / s^2\n\n3. For the constant term 2:\n\nL{2} = 2 * L{1}\n\nThe Laplace transform of a constant c is c / s:\n\nL{1} = 1 / s\n\nSo, L{2} = 2 * (1 / s) = 2 / s\n\nNow, we can add the Laplace transforms of each term together:\n\nL{f(t)} = L{3t^2 + 10t + 2} = L{3t^2} + L{10t} + L{2}\n\nL{f(t)} = (6 / s^3) + (10 / s^2) + (2 / s)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 3t^2 + 10t + 2 is F(s) = (6 / s^3) + (10 / s^2) + (2 / s)."
