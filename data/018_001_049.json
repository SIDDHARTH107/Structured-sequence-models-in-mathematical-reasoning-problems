    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set is a subset of S. \n\nTo prove this using the concepts of set theory, we need to understand the definition of a subset. A set A is a subset of another set B (denoted as A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B.\n\nThe empty set, denoted as ∅, is a set that contains no elements. Therefore, it is trivially true that every element of the empty set is also an element of any other set, including S. This is because there are no elements in the empty set to contradict this statement.\n\nIn other words, since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in S, the empty set is a subset of S. Thus, we can conclude that ∅ ⊆ S."
