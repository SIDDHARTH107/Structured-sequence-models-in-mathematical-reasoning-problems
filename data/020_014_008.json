    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2 on the interval [0, 3], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x = 0\nx(3x - 6) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 0 and x = 2. These are our critical points.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 3] and the critical points to determine the minimum value of the function.\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 2 = 2\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2 = 8 - 12 + 2 = -2\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 3(3)^2 + 2 = 27 - 27 + 2 = 2\n\nThe minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2 on the interval [0, 3] is -2, which occurs at x = 2."
