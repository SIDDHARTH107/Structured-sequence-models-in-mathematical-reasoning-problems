    "message_2": "Cholesky decomposition is used to solve linear systems of the form Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. However, the given system of linear equations does not have a symmetric matrix. Therefore, we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or Cramer's rule to solve the system. Let's use Gaussian elimination to solve the given system of linear equations.\n\nFirst, we can write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n|  3   2  -1 |  8  |\n|  2  -4   2 | -14 |\n| -1  1/2 -1 |  0  |\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n\n| -1  1/2 -1 |  0  |\n|  2  -4   2 | -14 |\n|  3   2  -1 |  8  |\n\n2. Add 2 * Row 1 to Row 2, and add 3 * Row 1 to Row 3:\n\n| -1  1/2 -1 |  0  |\n|  0  -3   0 | -14 |\n|  0  5/2 -2 |  8  |\n\n3. Multiply Row 2 by -1/3, and add 5/6 * Row 2 to Row 3:\n\n| -1  1/2 -1 |  0  |\n|  0   1   0 | 14/3|\n|  0   0  -1 |  4  |\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = -4\n2. y = 14/3 - 0 * z = 14/3\n3. x = -1 * (1/2 * y + z) = -1 * (1/2 * 14/3 - 4) = -1 * (7/3 - 12/3) = -1 * (-5/3) = 5/3\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 5/3, y = 14/3, and z = -4."
