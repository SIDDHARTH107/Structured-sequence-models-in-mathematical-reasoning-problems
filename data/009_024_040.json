Let the density of the fluid be 1000 kg/m³ and viscosity be 0.1 Pa·s. Suppose that there is no-slip and no-penetration on the walls of the channel. Assume that at t=0, the velocity profiles in x and y directions are given by:\n\n$$u(x,y,0) = U \\left( 1- \\left( \\frac{y}{H} \\right)^2 \\right) \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{x^2}{2L^2} \\right] $$\n\n$$v(x,y,0) = - \\frac{Uy}{H} \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{x^2}{2L^2} \\right] $$\n\nwhere U = 1 m/s, H = 10 m and L = 1 m. Determine the time required for the fluid particle to travel the distance of 20 m along the channel, and also determine the velocity distribution at that time.",
    "message_2": "To determine the time required for the fluid particle to travel the distance of 20 m along the channel, we can use the average velocity in the x-direction. Since the fluid is flowing along the x-axis, we can assume that the average velocity in the y-direction is negligible.\n\nThe initial average velocity in the x-direction can be calculated by integrating the initial velocity profile u(x, y, 0) over the channel cross-section and dividing by the channel area:\n\n$$\\bar{u}(0) = \\frac{1}{20 \\times 20} \\int_{-10}^{10} \\int_{0}^{20} u(x, y, 0) dy dx$$\n\nSubstitute the given initial velocity profile:\n\n$$\\bar{u}(0) = \\frac{1}{20 \\times 20} \\int_{-10}^{10} \\int_{0}^{20} U \\left( 1- \\left( \\frac{y}{H} \\right)^2 \\right) \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{x^2}{2L^2} \\right] dy dx$$\n\nUsing the given values for U, H, and L:\n\n$$\\bar{u}(0) = \\frac{1}{20 \\times 20} \\int_{-10}^{10} \\int_{0}^{20} 1 \\left( 1- \\left( \\frac{y}{10} \\right)^2 \\right) \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right] dy dx$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals:\n\n$$\\bar{u}(0) \\approx 0.319$$\n\nThe average velocity in the x-direction is approximately 0.319 m/s. To find the time required to travel 20 m along the channel, we can use the formula:\n\n$$t = \\frac{d}{\\bar{u}(0)}$$\n\nWhere d is the distance (20 m) and $\\bar{u}(0)$ is the initial average velocity in the x-direction:\n\n$$t = \\frac{20}{0.319} \\approx 62.7 \\, \\text{s}$$\n\nThe time required for the fluid particle to travel the distance of 20 m along the channel is approximately 62.7 seconds.\n\nTo determine the velocity distribution at that time, we would need to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with the given initial conditions and boundary conditions. This is a complex task and typically requires numerical methods, such as finite difference or finite element methods, to obtain an approximate solution."
