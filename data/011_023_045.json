    "message_1": "Consider a graph G having 8 vertices. We need to color each vertex of the graph either red, green or blue. Also, no two adjacent vertices can have the same color. How many possible colorings are there for the graph G?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible colorings for the graph G, we need more information about the structure of the graph. The number of colorings depends on the connections between the vertices, as the restriction of no two adjacent vertices having the same color applies.\n\nPlease provide more information about the graph G, such as the number of edges and their connections, or any other relevant information about the structure of the graph."
