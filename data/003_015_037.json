    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the given function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 3. Therefore, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |coefficient of x|.\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4) is 3, and the period is π."
