    "message_1": "Let X be an algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. What is the dimension of the cohomology group $H^2(X,\\mathbb{Q})$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that if $X$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ and $H$ is a hyperplane section of $X$, then the restriction map $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^k(H, \\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism for $k < n - 1$ and injective for $k = n - 1$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a smooth cubic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, so it has dimension $n = 2$. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that the restriction map $H^k(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^k(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2 - 1 = 1$ and injective for $k = 2 - 1 = 1$. Since $H^2(\\mathbb{P}^2, \\mathbb{Q})$ is one-dimensional, it follows that $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is also one-dimensional. Therefore, the dimension of the cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is 1."
