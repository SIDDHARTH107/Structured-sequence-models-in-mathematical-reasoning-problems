    "message_2": "To determine the number of zeros of f(z) in the closed unit disk, we can apply the argument principle. The argument principle states that if f(z) is an analytic function inside and on a simple closed contour C, and f(z) has no zeros or poles on C, then the number of zeros minus the number of poles of f(z) inside C is given by:\n\n(1/2π) * ∮[C] (f'(z) / f(z)) dz\n\nIn our case, f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + z + 4, and we want to find the number of zeros inside the closed unit disk, which means our contour C is the circle |z| = 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 4z + 1\n\nNow, let's parameterize the contour C using z(t) = e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π]. Then, we have:\n\ndz/dt = ie^(it)\n\nNow, we can compute f'(z(t)) / f(z(t)):\n\nf'(z(t)) / f(z(t)) = (3e^(2it) - 4e^(it) + 1) / (e^(3it) - 2e^(2it) + e^(it) + 4)\n\nWe can now compute the contour integral:\n\n∮[C] (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = ∫[0, 2π] (f'(z(t)) / f(z(t))) * (dz/dt) dt\n= ∫[0, 2π] (3e^(2it) - 4e^(it) + 1) / (e^(3it) - 2e^(2it) + e^(it) + 4) * ie^(it) dt\n\nThis integral is quite complex, but we can use the residue theorem to simplify the calculation. The residue theorem states that if f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, except for a finite number of singular points inside C, then:\n\n∮[C] f(z) dz = 2πi * (sum of residues of f(z) at the singular points inside C)\n\nIn our case, the singular points are the zeros of f(z) inside the unit disk. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it has no poles, and the singular points are just the zeros of f(z). Let's denote the zeros as z1, z2, and z3. Then, the sum of residues of f'(z) / f(z) at these zeros is:\n\nRes(f'(z) / f(z), z1) + Res(f'(z) / f(z), z2) + Res(f'(z) / f(z), z3)\n\nSince f'(z) / f(z) has a simple pole at each zero of f(z), the residue at each zero is given by:\n\nRes(f'(z) / f(z), zk) = lim_(z -> zk) (z - zk) * (f'(z) / f(z)) = f'(zk) / f'(zk) = 1\n\nThus, the sum of residues is:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to compute the contour integral:\n\n∮[C] (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = 2πi * (sum of residues) = 2πi * 3\n\nFinally, we can apply the argument principle:\n\n(Number of zeros - Number of poles) = (1/2π) * ∮[C] (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = (1/2π) * 2πi * 3 = 3\n\nSince there are no poles of f(z) inside the unit disk, the number of zeros of f(z) inside the closed unit disk is 3."
