    "message_1": "A company is planning to manufacture two products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and for product B it is $15. To manufacture one unit of A, 2 hours of labor is required, and for one unit of B, 3 hours of labor is required. The total labor available for the company is 60 hours. Find the number of units of A and B that the company must produce to maximize profit, considering both products.\n\nWhat is the optimal combination of units of A and B that the company should manufacture to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) is given by:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nThe labor constraint is given by:\n2x + 3y ≤ 60\n\nTo find the optimal combination of units of A and B, we need to maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to the labor constraint.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region for the labor constraint. We can rewrite the labor constraint as:\ny ≤ (60 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (we cannot produce a negative number of units), we have the following constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (60 - 2x) / 3:\nx = 0, y = (60 - 2(0)) / 3\ny = 20\nVertex: (0, 20)\n\n2. Intersection of y = 0 and x = (60 - 3y) / 2:\ny = 0, x = (60 - 3(0)) / 2\nx = 30\nVertex: (30, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\nx = 0, y = 0\nVertex: (0, 0)\n\n4. Intersection of x = (60 - 3y) / 2 and y = (60 - 2x) / 3:\n(60 - 3y) / 2 = (60 - 2x) / 3\nSolving for x and y, we get:\nx = 12, y = 12\nVertex: (12, 12)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 20) = 10(0) + 15(20) = $300\n2. P(30, 0) = 10(30) + 15(0) = $300\n3. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n4. P(12, 12) = 10(12) + 15(12) = $360\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (12, 12), where the company produces 12 units of product A and 12 units of product B. The maximum profit is $360."
