    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext, we first need to find the modulus n and the totient function φ(n).\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\nn = 11 * 17 = 187\n\n2. Compute φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nφ(187) = (11 - 1) * (17 - 1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n\nNow, we can compute the ciphertext using Alice's public key (e = 7) and the message (m = 5).\n\n3. Compute the ciphertext c = m^e mod n\nc = 5^7 mod 187\n\nUsing exponentiation by squaring, we can compute this efficiently:\n\n5^1 mod 187 = 5\n5^2 mod 187 = 25\n5^4 mod 187 = 25^2 mod 187 = 62\n5^7 mod 187 = 5^4 * 5^2 * 5^1 mod 187 = 62 * 25 * 5 mod 187 = 7750 mod 187 = 120\n\nSo, the ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob is 120."
