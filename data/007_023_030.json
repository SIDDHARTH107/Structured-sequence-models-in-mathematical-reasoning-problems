    "message_1": "Let's say we have a cryptographic hash function that takes in a message of length 1000 and produces a hash of length 256. If our hash function is secure, how many different possible hash values can it produce?",
    "message_2": "A cryptographic hash function that produces a hash of length 256 means that the output hash is represented by a 256-bit binary number. Each bit can have 2 possible values: 0 or 1. Therefore, the total number of different possible hash values that the function can produce is 2 raised to the power of 256.\n\nSo, the number of different possible hash values is:\n\n2^256 = 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936"
