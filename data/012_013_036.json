    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph is a polynomial that counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using k colors. A proper coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with three vertices and no edges. Since there are no edges, there are no restrictions on the colors of the vertices, and each vertex can be colored independently.\n\nLet P(k) be the chromatic polynomial of this graph. For each vertex, there are k choices of colors. Since there are three vertices, the total number of colorings is k * k * k = k^3.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic polynomial of a graph with three vertices and no edges is P(k) = k^3."
