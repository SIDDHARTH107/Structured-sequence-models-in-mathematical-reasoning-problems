    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10, and let x be an element of G with order 5. Since the order of x is 5, we know that the subgroup generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩, is of order 5. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the only possible orders of subgroups of G are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is cyclic: In this case, G is generated by a single element, say y, and G = ⟨y⟩. Since the order of y must divide the order of G, the order of y must be 10. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\n2. G is not cyclic: In this case, G cannot be generated by a single element. Since we already have a subgroup of order 5, ⟨x⟩, we need another element, say z, which is not in ⟨x⟩. The order of z must divide the order of G, so the possible orders of z are 1, 2, or 10. If the order of z is 10, then G would be cyclic, which we have already considered. If the order of z is 1, then z is the identity element, which does not help in generating G. So, the order of z must be 2.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup generated by both x and z, denoted as ⟨x, z⟩. Since the orders of x and z are 5 and 2, respectively, and gcd(5, 2) = 1, we have |⟨x, z⟩| = 10. Thus, G = ⟨x, z⟩.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\n2a. G is abelian: In this case, xz = zx. Since the order of x is 5 and the order of z is 2, we have (xz)^2 = x^2z^2, which implies x^2 = e (the identity element), a contradiction to the order of x being 5. Therefore, G cannot be abelian.\n\n2b. G is non-abelian: In this case, xz ≠ zx. We can define a binary operation * on G such that (x^i * z^j) * (x^k * z^l) = x^i * z^j * x^k * z^l, where i, j, k, l are integers modulo 5 and 2, respectively. Since G is non-abelian, we have xz * z = x * z^2, which implies xz = zx^4 (as z^2 = e). Thus, G is generated by x and z with the relations x^5 = z^2 = e and xz = zx^4.\n\nThis is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D5, so G is isomorphic to D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5."
