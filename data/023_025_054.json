    "message_1": "A steel bar is subjected to a temperature change from 20°C to 80°C. Use the Fourier transform to find the frequency spectrum of the resulting thermal expansion of the steel if its initial length was 5 meters and the coefficient of thermal expansion is 11.7 × 10^-6 /°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency spectrum of the resulting thermal expansion of the steel, we first need to determine the change in length of the steel bar due to the temperature change. The formula for the change in length (ΔL) due to thermal expansion is:\n\nΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT\n\nwhere L₀ is the initial length of the steel bar, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and ΔT is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven:\nL₀ = 5 meters\nα = 11.7 × 10^-6 /°C\nΔT = 80°C - 20°C = 60°C\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in length:\n\nΔL = 5 * (11.7 × 10^-6) * 60\nΔL ≈ 0.00351 meters\n\nNow, let's assume that the change in length is a continuous function of time, represented as f(t). Since the change in length is constant over time, we can represent f(t) as a constant function:\n\nf(t) = 0.00351\n\nTo find the frequency spectrum of this constant function, we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a constant function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nSince f(t) is a constant function, the integral simplifies to:\n\nF(ω) = 0.00351 * ∫[e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThe integral of e^(-jωt) is:\n\n∫[e^(-jωt)] dt = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the constant function is:\n\nF(ω) = 0.00351 * (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nSince the change in length is constant over time, the frequency spectrum will be concentrated at ω = 0. Therefore, the Fourier transform of the thermal expansion of the steel bar is a constant function with a magnitude of 0.00351 meters. This means that the thermal expansion does not have any frequency components other than the constant term."
