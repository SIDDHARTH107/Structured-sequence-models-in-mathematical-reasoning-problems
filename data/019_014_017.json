    "message_2": "To prove that the sum of any two even numbers is an even number using higher-order logic, we can use the following definitions and axioms:\n\n1. Definition of an even number: A number is even if it can be expressed as 2 * n, where n is an integer.\n\n2. Axiom of addition: For any two integers a and b, their sum (a + b) is also an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider two even numbers x and y.\n\nBy the definition of even numbers, we can express x as 2 * m and y as 2 * n, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of x and y:\n\nx + y = (2 * m) + (2 * n)\n\nWe can factor out the 2 from both terms:\n\nx + y = 2 * (m + n)\n\nBy the axiom of addition, since m and n are integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Let's call this integer p:\n\nx + y = 2 * p\n\nSince x + y can be expressed as 2 * p, where p is an integer, by the definition of even numbers, the sum of any two even numbers (x + y) is an even number.
