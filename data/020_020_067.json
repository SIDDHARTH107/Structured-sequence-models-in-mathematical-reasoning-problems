    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to produce cylindrical containers of radius 5 cm and height 20 cm using the least amount of material as possible. The material cost is directly proportional to the surface area of the container. What should be the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of material? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of material, we need to minimize the surface area of the cylindrical container. The surface area (SA) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nSA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nThe problem states that the company wants to produce containers with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 20 cm. However, it is not clear if these dimensions are fixed or if they can be adjusted to minimize the cost. Assuming the volume of the container is fixed, we can use the volume formula for a cylinder to find the relationship between the radius and height:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nSince the volume is fixed, we can write the height in terms of the radius:\n\nh = V / (πr^2)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for h back into the surface area formula:\n\nSA = 2πr^2 + 2πr(V / (πr^2))\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nSA = 2πr^2 + 2V/r\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can take the derivative of the surface area with respect to the radius and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(SA)/dr = 4πr - 2V/r^2 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n4πr^3 = 2V\n\nr^3 = V / (2π)\n\nr = (V / (2π))^(1/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the volume of the original container with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 20 cm:\n\nV = π(5^2)(20) = 500π cm^3\n\nPlugging this value back into the formula for r, we get:\n\nr = (500π / (2π))^(1/3) = (250)^(1/3) ≈ 6.30 cm\n\nNow, we can find the height using the formula h = V / (πr^2):\n\nh = 500π / (π(6.30^2)) ≈ 12.59 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of material are approximately a radius of 6.30 cm and a height of 12.59 cm."
