    "message_1": "A force of 20 Newtons moves an object in the positive direction along a straight line from x=0 meters to x=5 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by a force, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫(F * dx) from x_initial to x_final\n\nIn this case, the force (F) is constant at 20 Newtons, and the object moves from x_initial = 0 meters to x_final = 5 meters. So, we can set up the integral as follows:\n\nWork = ∫(20 dx) from 0 to 5\n\nSince the force is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nWork = 20 * ∫(dx) from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can integrate dx:\n\nWork = 20 * (x) from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = 20 * (5 - 0)\n\nWork = 20 * 5\n\nWork = 100 Joules\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 100 Joules."
