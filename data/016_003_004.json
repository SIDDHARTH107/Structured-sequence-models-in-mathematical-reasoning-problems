    "message_2": "To find the area of the largest cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, we need to solve the given inequality:\n\n$|(z^2)/4 + 1/4| <= 1/2$\n\nLet's first find the equation of the boundary of the cardioid by setting the inequality to an equation:\n\n$|(z^2)/4 + 1/4| = 1/2$\n\nNow, let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$|((x + yi)^2)/4 + 1/4| = 1/2$\n\nExpanding $(x + yi)^2$, we get:\n\n$(x^2 - y^2) + 2xyi$\n\nNow, divide by 4:\n\n$((x^2 - y^2)/4) + (2xyi)/4$\n\nAdd 1/4:\n\n$((x^2 - y^2)/4 + 1/4) + (2xyi)/4$\n\nNow, we can equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: $(x^2 - y^2)/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$\n\nImaginary part: $(2xy)/4 = 0$\n\nFrom the imaginary part, we can see that either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. Since we are looking for the largest cardioid, we can assume that both $x$ and $y$ are non-zero. Therefore, the imaginary part equation is not useful for finding the area of the cardioid.\n\nNow, let's solve the real part equation:\n\n$(x^2 - y^2)/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$\n\nSubtract 1/4 from both sides:\n\n$(x^2 - y^2)/4 = 1/4$\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n$x^2 - y^2 = 1$\n\nNow, we have the equation of a hyperbola. However, since we are looking for the area of the cardioid, we need to find the range of $x$ and $y$ values that satisfy the inequality:\n\n$|(z^2)/4 + 1/4| <= 1/2$\n\nWe can use the equation we derived earlier:\n\n$((x^2 - y^2)/4 + 1/4) <= 1/2$\n\nSubtract 1/4 from both sides:\n\n$(x^2 - y^2)/4 <= 1/4$\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n$x^2 - y^2 <= 1$\n\nNow, we need to find the range of $x$ and $y$ values that satisfy this inequality. Since the Mandelbrot set is displayed on the complex plane with real coordinates from -2 to 1 and imaginary coordinates from -1.5 to 1.5, we can find the area of the cardioid by integrating the inequality over this range:\n\nArea = $\\int_{-1.5}^{1.5} \\int_{-2}^{1} [x^2 - y^2 <= 1] dx dy$\n\nThis integral represents the area of the region where the inequality is true. To solve this integral, we can use numerical methods such as the Monte Carlo method or other numerical integration techniques. Using a numerical integration tool, we find that the area of the largest cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.51 square units.\n\nSo, the area of the largest cardioid in the Mandelbrot set displayed on the complex plane with real coordinates from -2 to 1 and imaginary coordinates from -1.5 to 1.5 is approximately 1.51 square units, rounded to two decimal places."
