    "message_2": "To use the RSA Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)\n3. Choose a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\n4. Compute the private key exponent d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n5. Encrypt the message m using the public key (n, e) to get the ciphertext c = m^e (mod n)\n6. Decrypt the ciphertext c using the private key (n, d) to get the original message m = c^d (mod n)\n\nNow, let's perform these steps with the given values:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n   n = 17 * 23\n   n = 391\n\n2. Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)\n   φ(n) = (17-1)*(23-1)\n   φ(n) = 16 * 22\n   φ(n) = 352\n\n3. Choose a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\n   Let's choose e = 3 (it's a common choice and satisfies the conditions)\n\n4. Compute the private key exponent d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n   We need to find d such that 3 * d ≡ 1 (mod 352)\n   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 235\n\nSo, the public key is (n, e) = (391, 3) and the private key is (n, d) = (391, 235).\n\n5. Encrypt the message m = 7 using the public key (n, e) to get the ciphertext c = m^e (mod n)\n   c = 7^3 (mod 391)\n   c = 343 (mod 391)\n   c = 343\n\n6. Decrypt the ciphertext c = 343 using the private key (n, d) to get the original message m = c^d (mod n)\n   m = 343^235 (mod 391)\n   m = 7\n\nThe public key is (391, 3), the private key is (391, 235), and the ciphertext for the message m = 7 is 343."
