The distances (in kilometers) between these locations are given below:\n\n| Location | A | B | C | D | E |\n|----------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A        | 0 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n| B        | 3 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 6 |\n| C        | 5 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 5 |\n| D        | 6 | 5 | 3 | 0 | 2 |\n| E        | 7 | 6 | 5 | 2 | 0 |\n\nThe truck needs to find the optimal route to visit all these locations exactly once and return to the starting point. What is the shortest possible distance that the truck can travel?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate their total distances. Since there are 5 locations, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the order of the locations, but since the route is circular, we can divide this by 5, which gives us 4! = 24 possible routes. Let's list all the possible routes and their distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 3+2+3+2+7 = 17\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 3+2+5+2+6 = 18\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 3+5+3+5+7 = 23\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A: 3+5+2+5+5 = 20\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A: 3+6+5+3+6 = 23\n6. A-B-E-D-C-A: 3+6+2+3+5 = 19\n\n7. A-C-B-D-E-A: 5+2+5+2+7 = 21\n8. A-C-B-E-D-A: 5+2+6+2+6 = 21\n9. A-C-D-B-E-A: 5+3+5+6+7 = 26\n10. A-C-D-E-B-A: 5+3+2+6+3 = 19\n11. A-C-E-B-D-A: 5+5+6+5+6 = 27\n12. A-C-E-D-B-A: 5+5+2+5+3 = 20\n\n13. A-D-B-C-E-A: 6+3+2+5+7 = 23\n14. A-D-B-E-C-A: 6+3+6+5+5 = 25\n15. A-D-C-B-E-A: 6+5+2+6+7 = 26\n16. A-D-C-E-B-A: 6+5+3+5+3 = 22\n17. A-D-E-B-C-A: 6+2+6+2+5 = 21\n18. A-D-E-C-B-A: 6+2+5+3+2 = 18\n\n19. A-E-B-C-D-A: 7+6+2+3+6 = 24\n20. A-E-B-D-C-A: 7+6+5+3+5 = 26\n21. A-E-C-B-D-A: 7+5+2+5+6 = 25\n22. A-E-C-D-B-A: 7+5+3+5+3 = 23\n23. A-E-D-B-C-A: 7+2+5+2+5 = 21\n24. A-E-D-C-B-A: 7+2+3+3+2 = 17\n\nOut of all the possible routes, the shortest distance is 17 km, which can be achieved by following either route 1 (A-B-C-D-E-A) or route 24 (A-E-D-C-B-A)."
