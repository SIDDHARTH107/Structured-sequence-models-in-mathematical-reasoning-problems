Additionally, provide a proof or explanation for why these specific groups are the only ones possible, as stated in the subtopic.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems and some additional group theory concepts. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. We will consider the Sylow p-subgroups for p = 2 and p = 3.\n\nFor p = 2, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. If n_2 = 3, then there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16.\n\nFor p = 3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible group structures based on the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups, which gives us the group structure Z_16 x Z_3.\n\n2. If there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup but no normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then we have a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup by the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible actions of Z_3 on Z_16, which give us two non-isomorphic groups: Z_48 and Z_16 x Z_2 x Z_3.\n\n3. If there is no normal Sylow 2-subgroup but a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then we have a semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup by the Sylow 2-subgroup. There are four possible actions of Z_16 on Z_3, which give us four non-isomorphic groups: Z_48, Z_24 x Z_2, Z_8 x Z_6, and Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3.\n\n4. If there is no normal Sylow 2-subgroup and no normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then we have a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup by the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible actions of Z_3 on Z_16, and four possible actions of Z_16 on Z_3. However, these actions do not yield any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn total, we have found 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. Z_48\n2. Z_16 x Z_3\n3. Z_16 x Z_2 x Z_3\n4. Z_24 x Z_2\n5. Z_8 x Z_6\n6. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3\n7. Z_3 x Q_16 (where Q_16 is the quaternion group of order 16)\n\nThese groups exhaust all possibilities based on the Sylow theorems and the possible actions of the Sylow subgroups on each other. Therefore, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
