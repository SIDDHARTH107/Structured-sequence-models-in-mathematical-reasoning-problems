The distance between each location is shown in the matrix below:\n\n|   | Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 | Location 4 |\n|---|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| 1 |   0        |   10       |   20       |   25       |\n| 2 |   10       |   0        |   15       |   30       |\n| 3 |   20       |   15       |   0        |   12       |\n| 4 |   25       |   30       |   12       |   0        |\n\nIf the company wants to minimize the total distance traveled, what is the optimal order to visit each location? Assume the delivery truck starts and finishes at Location 1.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal order to visit each location, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach. We will find the shortest route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting point (Location 1).\n\nWe can list all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. Route: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1\n   Distance: 10 + 15 + 12 + 25 = 62\n\n2. Route: 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 1\n   Distance: 10 + 30 + 12 + 20 = 72\n\n3. Route: 1 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 1\n   Distance: 20 + 15 + 30 + 25 = 90\n\n4. Route: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 1\n   Distance: 20 + 12 + 30 + 10 = 72\n\n5. Route: 1 → 4 → 2 → 3 → 1\n   Distance: 25 + 30 + 15 + 20 = 90\n\n6. Route: 1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1\n   Distance: 25 + 12 + 15 + 10 = 62\n\nOut of all the possible routes, the shortest distance is 62. There are two routes with this distance:\n\n1. Route: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1\n2. Route: 1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1\n\nSo, the optimal order to visit each location can be either 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 or 1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1."
