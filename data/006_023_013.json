    "message_1": "A market research agency found that 85% of the consumers prefer to purchase items online. If a random sample of 100 consumers is taken, what is the probability that over 90% of them prefer to purchase items online?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 0.85)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we want to find the probability of having over 90% of the consumers prefer to purchase items online, so k > 90)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having over 90% of the consumers prefer to purchase items online, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 91, 92, ..., 100.\n\nP(X > 90) = P(X = 91) + P(X = 92) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(100, k) * 0.85^k * (1-0.85)^(100-k)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for k = 91, 92, ..., 100 and sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X > 90) = Σ [C(100, k) * 0.85^k * 0.15^(100-k)] for k = 91 to 100\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X > 90) ≈ 0.0103\n\nSo, the probability that over 90% of the 100 consumers prefer to purchase items online is approximately 1.03%."
