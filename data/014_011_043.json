    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MEET ME AFTER WORK\" using a rail fence cipher with a key of 5, we will arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 5 rows. First, remove the spaces from the message:\n\nMEETMEAFTERWORK\n\nNow, arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern:\n\nM       A       R\n  E   M F   R W\n    E T   E   O\n      M A T K\n        E\n\nNow, read the letters in each row from left to right to get the encrypted message:\n\nMAR EMFRW ETEO MATK E\n\nThe encrypted message is \"MAR EMFRW ETEO MATK E\"."
