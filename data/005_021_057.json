    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean score using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the original sample.\n2. Generate a large number of bootstrap samples by randomly sampling with replacement from the original sample.\n3. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n4. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap sample means, which will give us the 95% confidence interval.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the original sample:\n\nMean = $(61 + 76 + 83 + 46 + 55 + 68 + 95 + 80 + 72 + 88 + 90 + 74 + 57 + 81 + 69 + 79 + 85 + 93 + 67 + 78) / 20 = 73.5$\n\n2. Generate a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000 samples) by randomly sampling with replacement from the original sample. For the sake of brevity, we will not list all 1000 samples here.\n\n3. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample. Again, we will not list all 1000 means here.\n\n4. Determine the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap sample means. Suppose after calculating the means of all 1000 bootstrap samples, we find that the 2.5th percentile is 68.2 and the 97.5th percentile is 78.9.\n\nThus, the 95% confidence interval for the mean score of all students who took the math test is approximately (68.2, 78.9)."
