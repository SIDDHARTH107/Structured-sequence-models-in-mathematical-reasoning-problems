    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x) at x = 1, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of f(x).\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 2)/dx = 6x^2 + 10x - 3\n\nNow, we find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(6x^2 + 10x - 3)/dx = 12x + 10\n\nFinally, we evaluate f''(x) at x = 1:\n\nf''(1) = 12(1) + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) at x = 1 is 22."
