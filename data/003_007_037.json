    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have a = 7, b = 9, and c = 12. We want to find the largest angle, which is the angle opposite to the longest side, so we want to find angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:\n\n12^2 = 7^2 + 9^2 - 2 * 7 * 9 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 49 + 81 - 126 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 130 - 126 * cos(C)\n\n14 = 126 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 14/126\n\nC = arccos(14/126)\n\nC ≈ 80.41°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 80°."
