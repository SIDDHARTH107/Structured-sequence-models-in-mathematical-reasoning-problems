    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1 / (b - a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = 3sin(x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1 / (π - 0)) * ∫[0, π] 3sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 3sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫3sin(x) dx = -3cos(x) + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral over the interval [0, π]:\n\n-3cos(π) - (-3cos(0)) = -3(-1) - (-3(1)) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1 / π) * 6 = 6/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 3sin(x) over the interval [0, π] is 6/π."
