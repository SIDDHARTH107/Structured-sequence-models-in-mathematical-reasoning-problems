    "message_2": "The Fano variety F_2 of lines on a smooth cubic threefold in ùîΩ^4 is a smooth projective variety of dimension 2. Its degree can be computed using the intersection theory on the Chow ring of the Fano variety. The degree of F_2 is given by the intersection number of the class of a line with the class of the divisor of lines meeting a fixed line. This intersection number is equal to 27. Therefore, the degree of the Fano variety F_2 of lines on a smooth cubic threefold in ùîΩ^4 is 27."
