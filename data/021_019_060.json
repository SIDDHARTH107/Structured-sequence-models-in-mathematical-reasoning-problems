    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to determine the optimal mix of two raw materials A and B to produce a chemical compound that meets specific requirements. Raw material A costs $5 per unit and raw material B costs $7 per unit. The company needs to produce at least 500 units of the compound and wants to minimize the cost of the raw materials while ensuring that the compound meets the necessary requirements. The company has experimented with different proportions of the two materials and has determined that the final product meets the requirements when the proportion of A is between 0.4 and 0.6. \n\nWhat is the optimal mix of materials A and B to minimize the cost of raw materials while ensuring that the required compound specification is met?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of raw material A and y be the number of units of raw material B. The total cost of the raw materials is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 5x + 7y\n\nThe company needs to produce at least 500 units of the compound, so:\n\nx + y ≥ 500\n\nThe proportion of A should be between 0.4 and 0.6:\n\n0.4 ≤ x / (x + y) ≤ 0.6\n\nWe can rewrite the inequalities as:\n\n0.4(x + y) ≤ x ≤ 0.6(x + y)\n\nNow we want to minimize the cost function while satisfying the constraints. Since raw material A is cheaper than raw material B, we should aim to maximize the proportion of A within the given range. Therefore, we should use the upper limit of the proportion range:\n\nx = 0.6(x + y)\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\n0.4x = 0.6y\ny = (2/3)x\n\nSubstitute this back into the constraint equation:\n\nx + (2/3)x ≥ 500\n(5/3)x ≥ 500\nx ≥ 300\n\nSo, the minimum number of units of raw material A is 300. Now we can find the number of units of raw material B:\n\ny = (2/3)(300)\ny = 200\n\nThus, the optimal mix of materials A and B is 300 units of A and 200 units of B. This will minimize the cost of raw materials while ensuring that the required compound specification is met."
