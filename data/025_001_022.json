    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of common points of two curves defined by polynomials of degrees m and n is at most m * n, assuming that the curves do not share a common component.\n\nIn this case, both lines are defined by linear equations, so they are both of degree 1. Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the maximum number of common points is 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nHowever, we need to check if these lines share a common component. To do this, we can check if one equation is a multiple of the other. Dividing the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n$3x + 4y = 3.5$\n\nComparing this to the first equation, we can see that they are not multiples of each other:\n\n$3x + 4y = 4$\n\nSince the lines do not share a common component, Bezout's theorem tells us that they have at most 1 common point. Since these are linear equations, they must either intersect at a single point or be parallel. Since they are not multiples of each other, they cannot be parallel, so they must intersect at a single point. Therefore, the number of common points of these lines is 1."
