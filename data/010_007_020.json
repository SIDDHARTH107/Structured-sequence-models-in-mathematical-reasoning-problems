Let x be the point (1,0) in X. \n\nSuppose that there exists a covering space p:Y→X such that p−1({x})={y1,y2,y3} and the fundamental group of Y with respect to x is the group Z2={0,1} under addition.\n\nDetermine the number of connected components of Y.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components of Y, we can use the fact that the covering space p: Y → X is a local homeomorphism. This means that for each point y in Y, there exists an open neighborhood U_y in Y such that p(U_y) is an open neighborhood in X and p restricted to U_y is a homeomorphism.\n\nSince p^(-1)({x}) = {y1, y2, y3}, there are three distinct points in Y that map to x under p. Let U_1, U_2, and U_3 be open neighborhoods of y1, y2, and y3, respectively, such that p restricted to each U_i is a homeomorphism. Then, p(U_1), p(U_2), and p(U_3) are open neighborhoods in X that contain x.\n\nNow, consider the fundamental group of Y with respect to x, which is given as Z2 = {0, 1}. Since the fundamental group is Z2, there are two distinct nontrivial loops based at x in X. Let L_1 and L_2 be representatives of these loops. Then, there exist lifts of L_1 and L_2 in Y that start at y1, y2, and y3.\n\nSince the fundamental group of Y is Z2, each of these lifts must end at either the same point it started or at another point in p^(-1)({x}). Thus, there are two possibilities for each lift, and since there are three points in p^(-1)({x}), there must be 2^3 = 8 distinct lifts of L_1 and L_2 in Y.\n\nHowever, we also know that p is a covering space, which means that each point in X has an evenly covered neighborhood. In particular, this means that the number of connected components of Y must be a divisor of the number of distinct lifts of L_1 and L_2. Since 8 has divisors 1, 2, 4, and 8, there are four possibilities for the number of connected components of Y.\n\nNow, we can eliminate some of these possibilities. If Y had only one connected component, then the fundamental group of Y would be isomorphic to the fundamental group of X, which is Z (the integers). However, we are given that the fundamental group of Y is Z2, so Y cannot have only one connected component.\n\nIf Y had two connected components, then each component would have one point in p^(-1)({x}), and the other point would be in the other connected component. However, this would mean that the fundamental group of Y would have at least three elements, which contradicts the given information that the fundamental group of Y is Z2.\n\nIf Y had four connected components, then each component would have one point in p^(-1)({x}), and there would be no other points in p^(-1)({x}) in the same connected component. This would mean that the fundamental group of Y would have at least four elements, which again contradicts the given information that the fundamental group of Y is Z2.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that Y has 8 connected components."
