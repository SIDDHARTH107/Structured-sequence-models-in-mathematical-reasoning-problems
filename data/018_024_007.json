The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A∩B = {2, 3}\n\nAΔB = (A - A∩B) ∪ (B - A∩B) = ({1} ∪ {4}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of AΔB, denoted as (AΔB)'.\n\nSince we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in sets A and B. \n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n(AΔB)' = U - AΔB = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 4} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference of (AΔB)' and A, denoted as ((AΔB)'ΔA).\n\n(AΔB)' = {2, 3}\nA = {1, 2, 3}\n\nIntersection of (AΔB)' and A, ((AΔB)'∩A) = {2, 3}\n\n((AΔB)'ΔA) = ((AΔB)' - ((AΔB)'∩A)) ∪ (A - ((AΔB)'∩A)) = ({ } ∪ {1}) = {1}\n\nSo, the result of (AΔB)'ΔA is {1}."
