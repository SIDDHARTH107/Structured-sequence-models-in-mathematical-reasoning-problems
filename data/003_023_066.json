    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nc = |a| * |b| * sin(θ) * n\n\nwhere c is the cross product vector, |a| and |b| are the magnitudes of vectors a and b, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both a and b.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors a and b:\n\n|a| = √(3^2 + 1^2 + (-5)^2) = √(9 + 1 + 25) = √35\n|b| = √((-2)^2 + (-4)^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 16 + 36) = √56\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula:\n\na · b = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere a · b is the dot product of vectors a and b.\n\na · b = (3 * -2) + (1 * -4) + (-5 * 6) = -6 - 4 - 30 = -40\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (a · b) / (|a| * |b|) = -40 / (√35 * √56) ≈ -0.5722\n\nθ = arccos(-0.5722) ≈ 124.96°\n\nNow, we need to find sin(θ):\n\nsin(θ) ≈ sin(124.96°) ≈ 0.8201\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product vector c:\n\nc = |a| * |b| * sin(θ) * n = (√35 * √56 * 0.8201) * n ≈ 29.39 * n\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the cross product formula:\n\nc = a x b = [(a2b3 - a3b2), (a3b1 - a1b3), (a1b2 - a2b1)]\n\nc = [(1 * 6 - (-5) * (-4)), ((-5) * (-2) - 3 * 6), (3 * (-4) - 1 * (-2))]\nc = [(-2), (-4), (-10)]\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of vector c:\n\n|c| = √((-2)^2 + (-4)^2 + (-10)^2) = √(4 + 16 + 100) = √120\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can divide each component of c by its magnitude:\n\nn = (-2/√120, -4/√120, -10/√120) ≈ (-0.1826, -0.3651, -0.9129)\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product vector c:\n\nc = 29.39 * n ≈ (29.39 * -0.1826, 29.39 * -0.3651, 29.39 * -0.9129) ≈ (-5.36, -10.72, -26.81)\n\nSo, the cross product of vector a and vector b is approximately c = [-5.36, -10.72, -26.81]."
