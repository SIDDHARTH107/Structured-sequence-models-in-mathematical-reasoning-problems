    "message_2": "To find the geodesics connecting the points (1, 0, 4) and (4, 2, 28) on the surface z = 4x^2 + y^2, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the surface using a parameter t:\n\nx = x(t)\ny = y(t)\nz = 4x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nNow, let's consider the arc length S of a curve on the surface:\n\nS = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 dt\n\nSince z = 4x^2 + y^2, we have dz/dt = 8x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt). Substituting this into the arc length formula, we get:\n\nS = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (8x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2 dt\n\nTo find the geodesics, we want to minimize the arc length S. We can do this using the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let L = √(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (8x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2. Then, the Euler-Lagrange equations are:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nComputing the partial derivatives and solving the Euler-Lagrange equations is quite involved and requires advanced calculus techniques. However, once the equations are solved, we can obtain the geodesics as functions x(t) and y(t). Finally, we can use the boundary conditions x(0) = 1, y(0) = 0, x(1) = 4, and y(1) = 2 to find the specific geodesic connecting the points (1, 0, 4) and (4, 2, 28) on the surface."
