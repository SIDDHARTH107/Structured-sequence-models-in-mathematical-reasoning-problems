    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which can be written as:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the equilibrium points, we need to set the derivatives equal to zero and solve for x, y, and z:\n\n0 = -y - z\n0 = x + ay\n0 = b + z(x - c)\n\nGiven the parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we can substitute them into the equations:\n\n0 = -y - z\n0 = x + 0.2y\n0 = 0.2 + z(x - 5.7)\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations. From the second equation, we can express x in terms of y:\n\nx = -0.2y\n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the third equation:\n\n0 = 0.2 + z(-0.2y - 5.7)\n0 = 0.2 - 1.14z + 0.2yz\n\nNow, substitute the expression for x into the first equation:\n\n0 = -y - z\n0 = -y - (-0.2y)\n0.8y = 0\n\nFrom this equation, we find that y = 0. Now, we can find x:\n\nx = -0.2(0) = 0\n\nFinally, substitute x and y into the third equation:\n\n0 = 0.2 + z(0 - 5.7)\n0 = 0.2 - 5.7z\n\nSolving for z, we get:\n\nz = 0.2 / 5.7 ≈ 0.0351\n\nSo, the equilibrium point for the given parameters is approximately (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0.0351)."
