Let $p: Y \\rightarrow X$ be a covering space with covering transformation group $G$. If the degree of the covering map $p$ is 2, find the number of elements in $G$.",
    "message_2": "Since the degree of the covering map $p: Y \\rightarrow X$ is 2, we know that for each point $x \\in X$, the preimage $p^{-1}(x)$ contains exactly two points. Now, we are given that the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is a cyclic group of order 6. Let's denote this group as $Z_6 = \\langle a \\rangle$, where $a$ is a generator of the group and $a^6 = e$ (the identity element).\n\nThe covering transformation group $G$ is a subgroup of the group of deck transformations of the covering space $Y$. The group of deck transformations acts on the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$, which has two elements since the degree of the covering map is 2. Let's denote these two elements as $y_1$ and $y_2$.\n\nNow, we use the lifting correspondence theorem, which states that there is a bijection between the subgroups of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ and the connected covering spaces of $X$. In particular, the covering transformation group $G$ is isomorphic to the quotient group $\\pi_1(X, x_0) / p_*(\\pi_1(Y, y_1))$, where $p_*: \\pi_1(Y, y_1) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the induced homomorphism of the covering map.\n\nSince $G$ acts on a set with two elements, it must be a group of order 1 or 2. If $G$ has order 1, then the covering space $Y$ is trivial, which contradicts the fact that the degree of the covering map is 2. Therefore, $G$ must have order 2.\n\nSo, the number of elements in the covering transformation group $G$ is 2."
