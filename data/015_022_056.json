    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = a * x(t-tau) / (1 + x(t-tau)^c) - b * x(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, a, b, and c are positive constants, and tau is the time delay. In this case, the parameters are a = 0.2, b = 0.1, c = 10, and tau = 17.\n\nTo find the equilibrium points, we need to find the values of x(t) for which dx(t)/dt = 0. At equilibrium, x(t) = x(t-tau), so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0 = a * x / (1 + x^c) - b * x\n\nNow, we plug in the given parameter values:\n\n0 = 0.2 * x / (1 + x^10) - 0.1 * x\n\nTo solve for x, we can first factor out x:\n\n0 = x * (0.2 / (1 + x^10) - 0.1)\n\nNow, we have two possible cases for equilibrium:\n\n1) x = 0:\nIn this case, the equation is already satisfied, so x = 0 is an equilibrium point.\n\n2) 0.2 / (1 + x^10) - 0.1 = 0:\nTo find the non-zero equilibrium points, we need to solve this equation:\n\n0.2 / (1 + x^10) = 0.1\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply:\n\n0.2 = 0.1 * (1 + x^10)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.1:\n\n2 = 1 + x^10\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n1 = x^10\n\nTake the 10th root of both sides:\n\nx = 1^(1/10)\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the equilibrium points for the given Mackey-Glass equation with parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.1, c = 10, and tau = 17 are x = 0 and x = 1."
