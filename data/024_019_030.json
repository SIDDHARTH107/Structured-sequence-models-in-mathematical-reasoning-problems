    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a closed surface S, the total Gaussian curvature K integrated over the surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ(S) of the surface:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nIn this case, the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 3 cm^-1 at every point on the surface. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nK * ∫∫_S dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nLet A be the total area of the surface. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nK * A = 2πχ(S)\n\nNow, we can solve for the Euler characteristic χ(S):\n\nχ(S) = (K * A) / (2π)\n\nSince K = 3 cm^-1, we have:\n\nχ(S) = (3 * A) / (2π)\n\nTo find the Euler characteristic, we need to know the total area A of the surface. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the area of the surface. If we had the area, we could plug it into the equation and find the Euler characteristic."
