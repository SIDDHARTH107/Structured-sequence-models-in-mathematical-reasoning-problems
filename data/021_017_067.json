    "message_1": "A company needs to optimize its production process for a particular product. The cost per unit of production can be represented by the function: C(x) = 2000 + 5x + 0.5x^2, where x is the number of units produced. The company wants to find the production level that minimizes the cost per unit. Using the differential evolution algorithm, find the optimal production level and the minimum cost per unit of production. The range of production levels that can be considered is from 0 to 500 units.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production level and the minimum cost per unit of production using the differential evolution algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: In this case, the objective function is the cost per unit of production, which is given by C(x) = 2000 + 5x + 0.5x^2.\n\n2. Define the search space: The search space is the range of production levels that can be considered, which is from 0 to 500 units.\n\n3. Initialize the population: Generate a random initial population of candidate solutions within the search space.\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each candidate solution: Calculate the cost per unit of production for each candidate solution using the objective function.\n\n5. Perform the differential evolution algorithm:\n   a. Select three random candidate solutions from the population.\n   b. Create a mutant solution by combining the selected solutions.\n   c. Perform crossover between the mutant solution and a randomly selected candidate solution to create a trial solution.\n   d. Evaluate the fitness of the trial solution.\n   e. Replace the least fit candidate solution in the population with the trial solution if the trial solution has better fitness.\n\n6. Repeat steps 5a to 5e for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\n7. Select the best candidate solution from the final population as the optimal production level.\n\n8. Calculate the minimum cost per unit of production using the optimal production level.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cost_function(x):\n    return (2000 + 5*x + 0.5*x**2) / x\n\ndef differential_evolution(bounds, pop_size, max_iter, F, CR):\n    # Initialize the population\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], (pop_size, 1))\n\n    # Main loop\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            # Select three random candidate solutions\n            candidates = np.random.choice(np.delete(np.arange(pop_size), i), 3, replace=False)\n            a, b, c = population[candidates]\n\n            # Create a mutant solution\n            mutant = a + F * (b - c)\n\n            # Perform crossover\n            trial = population[i] if np.random.rand() > CR else mutant\n\n            # Evaluate the fitness of the trial solution\n            if cost_function(trial) < cost_function(population[i]):\n                # Replace the least fit candidate solution with the trial solution\n                population[i] = trial\n\n    # Select the best candidate solution as the optimal production level\n    optimal_production_level = population[np.argmin([cost_function(x) for x in population])]\n\n    return optimal_production_level\n\n# Parameters\nbounds = (0, 500)\npop_size = 50\nmax_iter = 1000\nF = 0.8\nCR = 0.9\n\n# Find the optimal production level\noptimal_production_level = differential_evolution(bounds, pop_size, max_iter, F, CR)\n\n# Calculate the minimum cost per unit of production\nmin_cost_per_unit = cost_function(optimal_production_level)\n\nprint(\"Optimal production level:\", optimal_production_level)\nprint(\"Minimum cost per unit of production:\", min_cost_per_unit)\n```\n\nThis code will output the optimal production level and the minimum cost per unit of production. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the differential evolution algorithm."
