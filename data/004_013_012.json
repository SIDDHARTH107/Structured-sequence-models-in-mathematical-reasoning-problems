    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x + 1 on the interval [0, 5], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, let's set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 24 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 4.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 24(0) + 1 = 1\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 24(2) + 1 = 8 - 36 + 48 + 1 = 21\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 24(4) + 1 = 64 - 144 + 96 + 1 = 17\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 9(5)^2 + 24(5) + 1 = 125 - 225 + 120 + 1 = 21\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and endpoints, we find that the maximum value is 21 at x = 2 and x = 5, and the minimum value is 17 at x = 4."
