    "message_1": "A Lévy C curve is created by starting with a line segment of length 1, replacing the middle third with two line segments of length 1/3 and connecting them at a right angle. This process is repeated recursively on each of the two outer line segments.\n\nIf this process is carried out 6 times, what is the total length of the Lévy C curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the total length of the Lévy C curve after 6 iterations, we can use the formula for the length of the curve after n iterations:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2/3)^n * 2^(n+1)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations (n = 6). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2/3)^6 * 2^(6+1)\n\nLength = 1 * (64/729) * 128\n\nLength = 64 * 128 / 729\n\nLength ≈ 11.3145\n\nSo, the total length of the Lévy C curve after 6 iterations is approximately 11.3145."
