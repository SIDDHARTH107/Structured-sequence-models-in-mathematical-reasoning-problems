    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow Theorems to determine the structure of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 125, which is 5^3, we know that G is a p-group for the prime p = 5. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G is equal to 1 mod 5 and divides the order of G. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5^2 = 25.\n\nNow, since H is a normal subgroup of G (as it is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup), we can consider the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 125/25 = 5, which is a prime number. By the classification of groups of prime order, G/H must be cyclic, say G/H = ⟨xH⟩ for some x ∈ G.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup K = ⟨x⟩ of G. Since x has order 5 in G/H, it must have order 5^2 = 25 in G (as the order of an element in a quotient group divides its order in the original group). Thus, K is a cyclic subgroup of G of order 25.\n\nSince H is normal in G, we can form the product HK of H and K in G. We claim that HK = G. To see this, note that |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| by the product formula for subgroups. Since H and K are both cyclic, their intersection must be trivial or equal to one of them. However, since |H| = 25 and |K| = 25, their intersection cannot be equal to one of them, as this would imply that one is a subgroup of the other, which is not possible because they have different generators. Thus, H ∩ K is trivial, and |HK| = |H||K| = 25 * 25 = 125, which implies HK = G.\n\nFinally, we show that G is isomorphic to the direct product H × K. Define a map φ: H × K → G by φ(h, k) = hk for all h ∈ H and k ∈ K. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism: Let (h1, k1), (h2, k2) ∈ H × K. Then\n   φ((h1, k1)(h2, k2)) = φ(h1h2, k1k2) = h1h2k1k2.\n   Since H is normal in G, we have h2k1 = k1h2', for some h2' ∈ H. Thus,\n   h1h2k1k2 = h1(h2k1)k2 = h1(k1h2')k2 = h1k1h2'k2 = φ(h1, k1)φ(h2, k2).\n\n2. φ is injective: Suppose φ(h, k) = e, where e is the identity element in G. Then hk = e, which implies h = k^(-1). Since h ∈ H and k^(-1) ∈ K, their intersection is non-trivial, which contradicts our previous observation that H ∩ K is trivial. Thus, φ(h, k) = e only if h = e and k = e, which means φ is injective.\n\n3. φ is surjective: Since |H × K| = |H||K| = 125 = |G| and φ is injective, it must also be surjective.\n\nThus, φ is an isomorphism between H × K and G, which implies that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
