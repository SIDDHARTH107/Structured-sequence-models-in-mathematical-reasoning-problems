    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors u and v using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu x v = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, θ is the angle between the vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both u and v.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(3² + 5² + 2²) = √(9 + 25 + 4) = √38\n||v|| = √(2² + 4² + 6²) = √(4 + 16 + 36) = √56\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the vectors u and v using the dot product formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\n(3i+5j+2k) · (2i+4j+6k) = 3*2 + 5*4 + 2*6 = 6 + 20 + 12 = 38\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||) = 38 / (√38 * √56) = 38 / (√(38 * 56))\n\nθ = arccos(38 / √(38 * 56))\n\nNow, let's find the unit vector n perpendicular to both u and v. We can use the cross product formula for this:\n\nn = (u x v) / (||u|| ||v|| sin(θ))\n\nWe already have the magnitudes and the angle, so we can find the cross product u x v:\n\nu x v = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) n = (√38 * √56) * sin(θ) n\n\nSince we are asked to find the cross product u x v, we can leave the answer in this form:\n\nu x v = (√38 * √56) * sin(arccos(38 / √(38 * 56))) n"
