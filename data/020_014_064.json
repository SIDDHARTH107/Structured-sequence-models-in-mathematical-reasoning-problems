    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of widgets, Type A and Type B. The profit per unit for Type A is $12 and for Type B is $10. The manufacturer has a total of 800 units of raw material and 650 hours of production time available per week. The production time for one unit of Type A is 2 hours and for Type B is 3 hours. The demand for Type A is at most 250 units per week and the demand for Type B is at most 200 units per week. How many units of each type of widget should the manufacturer produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Type A widgets and y be the number of Type B widgets.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 12x + 10y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material: x + y ≤ 800\n2. Production time: 2x + 3y ≤ 650\n3. Demand for Type A: x ≤ 250\n4. Demand for Type B: y ≤ 200\n5. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will graph the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 800\ny = 800 - x\n\n2. 2x + 3y = 650\ny = (650 - 2x) / 3\n\n3. x = 250\n\n4. y = 200\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and 3: x = 250, y = 800 - 250 = 550 (not feasible because y > 200)\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and 4: x = 800 - 200 = 600, y = 200 (not feasible because x > 250)\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and 3: 2x + 3y = 650, x = 250\ny = (650 - 2 * 250) / 3 = 50\n4. Intersection of constraint 2 and 4: 2x + 3y = 650, y = 200\nx = (650 - 3 * 200) / 2 = 25\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function (profit) at the feasible corner points:\n\n3. P(250, 50) = 12 * 250 + 10 * 50 = 3000 + 500 = 3500\n4. P(25, 200) = 12 * 25 + 10 * 200 = 300 + 2000 = 2300\n\nThe maximum profit is $3500 when the manufacturer produces 250 units of Type A and 50 units of Type B."
