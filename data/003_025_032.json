    "message_2": "To find the resultant velocity of the plane relative to the ground, we need to consider both the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity. Since the plane is flying north-eastward, its velocity can be broken down into two components: north and east. \n\nLet Vp be the velocity of the plane, Vw be the velocity of the wind, and Vr be the resultant velocity.\n\nVp = 300 km/h (north-eastward)\nVw = 50 km/h (southward)\n\nSince north-eastward is a 45-degree angle, we can find the north and east components of the plane's velocity using trigonometry:\n\nVp_north = 300 * cos(45°) = 300 * 0.7071 ≈ 212.13 km/h\nVp_east = 300 * sin(45°) = 300 * 0.7071 ≈ 212.13 km/h\n\nNow, we need to find the north component of the wind's velocity. Since the wind is blowing southward, its north component is negative:\n\nVw_north = -50 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the total north and east components of the resultant velocity:\n\nVr_north = Vp_north + Vw_north = 212.13 - 50 ≈ 162.13 km/h\nVr_east = Vp_east = 212.13 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr = sqrt(Vr_north^2 + Vr_east^2) = sqrt((162.13)^2 + (212.13)^2) ≈ 266.67 km/h\n\nFinally, we can find the direction of the resultant velocity using the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vr_east / Vr_north) = arctan(212.13 / 162.13) ≈ 52.53°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity of the plane relative to the ground is approximately 266.67 km/h, and its direction is approximately 52.53° north of east."
