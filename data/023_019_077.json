    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given linear differential equation. The Fourier transform of a function y(t) is defined as:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given equation, we get:\n\nF{y''(t) + y(t)} = F{3cos(t)}\n\nNow, we know that the Fourier transform of the second derivative y''(t) is (-ω^2)Y(ω) and the Fourier transform of y(t) is Y(ω). Also, the Fourier transform of 3cos(t) is 3[π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))], where δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function. So, we have:\n\n(-ω^2)Y(ω) + Y(ω) = 3[π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))]\n\nNow, we can find the transfer function H(ω) by dividing the output Y(ω) by the input X(ω):\n\nH(ω) = Y(ω) / X(ω)\n\nIn this case, the input X(ω) is 3[π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))]. So, we have:\n\nH(ω) = [(-ω^2 + 1)Y(ω)] / [3π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))]\n\nTo find Y(ω), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nY(ω) = [3π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))] / (-ω^2 + 1)\n\nNow, substituting this back into the transfer function equation:\n\nH(ω) = [(-ω^2 + 1) * [3π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))] / (-ω^2 + 1)] / [3π(δ(ω-1) + δ(ω+1))]\n\nH(ω) = 1 / (-ω^2 + 1)\n\nNow, to determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function. The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator of the transfer function becomes zero:\n\n-ω^2 + 1 = 0\n\nω^2 = 1\n\nω = ±1\n\nSince the poles are real and not in the right-half plane (i.e., their real parts are not positive), the system is stable."
