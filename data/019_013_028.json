    "message_2": "To solve this problem using second-order logic, we will first determine the total number of subsets and then subtract the number of subsets that do not meet the condition of containing at least two even numbers.\n\nThe set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} has 6 elements. The total number of possible subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. In this case, there are 2^6 = 64 possible subsets.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of subsets that do not contain at least two even numbers. There are three cases to consider:\n\n1. Subsets with no even numbers: There are 3 odd numbers in the set (1, 3, and 5). The number of subsets containing only odd numbers is 2^3 = 8 (including the empty set).\n\n2. Subsets with exactly one even number: There are 3 even numbers in the set (2, 4, and 6). For each even number, we can form subsets with any combination of the 3 odd numbers. This gives us 3 even numbers × 2^3 subsets per even number = 3 × 8 = 24 subsets.\n\nAdding the subsets from cases 1 and 2, we have a total of 8 + 24 = 32 subsets that do not contain at least two even numbers.\n\nFinally, to find the number of subsets that contain at least two even numbers, we subtract the number of subsets that do not meet the condition from the total number of subsets:\n\n64 - 32 = 32\n\nThus, there are 32 possible subsets of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} that contain at least two even numbers."
