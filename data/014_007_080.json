    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a key stream of 4-bits to encrypt a plain text message of 8-bits. If the first 4-bits of the plain text message are 1010, what is the corresponding 4-bit cipher text generated using the key stream of 0110?",
    "message_2": "To generate the corresponding 4-bit cipher text, we need to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the plain text message and the key stream.\n\nPlain text:  1010\nKey stream: 0110\n\nXOR operation:\n1 ⊕ 0 = 1\n0 ⊕ 1 = 1\n1 ⊕ 1 = 0\n0 ⊕ 0 = 0\n\nSo, the 4-bit cipher text is 1100."
