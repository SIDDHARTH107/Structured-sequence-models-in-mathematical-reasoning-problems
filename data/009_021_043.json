    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by kXYT:\n\nT'(t)/kT(t) = X''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t)/kT(t) = -λ\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ - Y''(y)/Y(y) = μ\nX''(x) = -μX(x)\nY''(y) = (λ - μ)Y(y)\n\nSolving these equations with the given boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(x) = sin(Πm*x/256)\nY(y) = sin(Πn*y/256)\n\nwhere m and n are integers. Now, we can write the general solution for u(x, y, t) as a sum of these functions:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ΣΣA(m, n)sin(Πm*x/256)sin(Πn*y/256)e^(-kΠ²(m² + n²)t/256²)\n\nTo find the coefficients A(m, n), we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(Πx/256)sin(Πy/256):\n\nsin(Πx/256)sin(Πy/256) = ΣΣA(m, n)sin(Πm*x/256)sin(Πn*y/256)\n\nComparing the terms, we see that A(1, 1) = 1 and all other coefficients A(m, n) are zero. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(Πx/256)sin(Πy/256)e^(-kΠ²(1² + 1²)t/256²)\n\nNow, we can find the intensity distribution at time t = 10 seconds:\n\nu(x, y, 10) = sin(Πx/256)sin(Πy/256)e^(-0.1Π²(1² + 1²)*10/256²)"
