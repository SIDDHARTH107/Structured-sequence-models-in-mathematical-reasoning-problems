    "message_1": "A problem could be: \n\nA company wants to survey its employees about their job satisfaction. They have 100 employees and want a sample size of 30. Using simple random sampling, what is the probability of choosing a sample of 30 employees that is representative of the overall population?",
    "message_2": "In simple random sampling, each employee has an equal chance of being selected. To calculate the probability of choosing a representative sample of 30 employees out of 100, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 30 employees out of 100 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n = 100 (total employees), k = 30 (sample size), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nC(100, 30) = 100! / (30!(100-30)!)\n           = 100! / (30!70!)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the probability of choosing a sample that is representative of the overall population depends on the distribution of job satisfaction among the employees. If the distribution is uniform, then any random sample of 30 employees would be representative. But if the distribution is skewed, the probability of choosing a representative sample would be lower.\n\nIn practice, it's difficult to determine the exact probability of choosing a representative sample without knowing the distribution of job satisfaction among the employees. Simple random sampling is a widely used method because it provides unbiased estimates, but it does not guarantee that the sample will always be representative of the overall population."
