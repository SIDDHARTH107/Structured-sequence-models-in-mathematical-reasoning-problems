    "message_2": "To find the period-3 solution(s) of the given logistic map, we need to find the values of x for which the system repeats itself every three iterations. In other words, we need to find x such that:\n\nx = x_3 = 3.7x_2(1 - x_2) = 3.7(3.7x_1(1 - x_1))(1 - 3.7x_1(1 - x_1))\nx = x_6 = 3.7x_5(1 - x_5) = 3.7(3.7x_4(1 - x_4))(1 - 3.7x_4(1 - x_4))\n\nSince x = x_3 = x_6, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3.7x(1 - x) = 3.7(3.7x(1 - x))(1 - 3.7x(1 - x))\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x. First, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1 - x = (3.7x(1 - x))(1 - 3.7x(1 - x))\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n1 - x = 3.7x(1 - x) - (3.7x(1 - x))^2\n\nNow, let y = 3.7x(1 - x), then the equation becomes:\n\n1 - y/3.7 = y - y^2\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\ny^2 - y + (1 - y/3.7) = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for y, we get two solutions:\n\ny_1 = 0.26894\ny_2 = 1.36439\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding x values for these y values. Recall that y = 3.7x(1 - x). For each y value, we can set up a quadratic equation in x:\n\n3.7x(1 - x) = y_i\n\nSolving these quadratic equations for x, we get the following period-3 solutions:\n\nFor y_1 = 0.26894:\nx_1 = 0.15208\nx_2 = 0.61964\n\nFor y_2 = 1.36439:\nx_3 = 0.83549\nx_4 = 0.29495\n\nSo, the period-3 solutions of the given logistic map are x = 0.15208, 0.61964, 0.83549, and 0.29495."
