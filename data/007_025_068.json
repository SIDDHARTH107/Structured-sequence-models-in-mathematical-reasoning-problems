    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\nAlice and Bob agree to use a prime number $p=23$ and base $g=5$ for their key exchange. Alice chooses a secret key $a=4$, and Bob chooses a secret key $b=3$. Using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, what is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt their messages?\n\nHint: Alice computes $A = g^a \\mod p$, Bob computes $B = g^b \\mod p$, and the shared secret key is $K = B^a \\mod p = A^b \\mod p$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute Alice's public key $A$ and Bob's public key $B$:\n\n$A = g^a \\mod p = 5^4 \\mod 23 = 625 \\mod 23 = 6$\n\n$B = g^b \\mod p = 5^3 \\mod 23 = 125 \\mod 23 = 10$\n\nNow, let's compute the shared secret key $K$:\n\n$K = B^a \\mod p = A^b \\mod p = 10^4 \\mod 23 = 6^3 \\mod 23$\n\n$K = 10000 \\mod 23 = 216 \\mod 23 = 18$\n\nSo, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use to encrypt their messages is $K = 18$."
