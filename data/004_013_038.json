    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 on the interval [0, 4], we need to first find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nLet's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nWe can factor out a 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find:\n\nMinimum value: f(0) = f(3) = 2\nMaximum value: f(1) = f(4) = 6\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is 6, and the minimum value is 2."
