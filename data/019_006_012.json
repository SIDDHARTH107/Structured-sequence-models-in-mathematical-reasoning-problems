    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to write a precise numerical problem for Deontic Logic as it is a branch of logic concerned with obligation, permission, and related concepts. It deals with statements like \"It is obligatory that,\" \"It is permissible that,\" and \"It is forbidden that\" rather than numeric problems.",
    "message_2": "You are correct. Deontic logic is not related to mathematical problems involving numbers or calculations. It is a branch of logic that deals with moral and ethical concepts, such as obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. If you have any other mathematical problems or questions, feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help."
