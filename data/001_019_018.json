    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x - 2| = 8, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x - 2 is positive or zero, so |5x - 2| = 5x - 2\n5x - 2 = 8\n5x = 10\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 5x - 2 is negative, so |5x - 2| = -(5x - 2)\n-(5x - 2) = 8\n-5x + 2 = 8\n-5x = 6\nx = -6/5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 2 and -6/5."
