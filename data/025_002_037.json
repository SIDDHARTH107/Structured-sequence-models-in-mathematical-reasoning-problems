    "message_2": "To find the intersection of X and Y, we need to solve the system of equations given by their defining equations:\n\n1) x² + y² = z²\n2) x + y = z\n\nFirst, we can solve equation (2) for z:\n\nz = x + y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into equation (1):\n\nx² + y² = (x + y)²\n\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\nx² + y² = x² + 2xy + y²\n\nNow, subtract x² and y² from both sides:\n\n0 = 2xy\n\nThis implies that either x = 0 or y = 0. \n\nCase 1: x = 0\nFrom equation (2), we have:\n\n0 + y = z\ny = z\n\nSo, the intersection points in this case are of the form (0, y, y) for any y in ℂ.\n\nCase 2: y = 0\nFrom equation (2), we have:\n\nx + 0 = z\nx = z\n\nSo, the intersection points in this case are of the form (x, 0, x) for any x in ℂ.\n\nThe intersection curve X ∩ Y consists of two lines in ℂℙ³, one with x = 0 and the other with y = 0. The degree of a curve is the number of intersection points with a generic hyperplane. Since a generic hyperplane will intersect each of these lines exactly once, the degree of the intersection curve X ∩ Y is 1 + 1 = 2."
