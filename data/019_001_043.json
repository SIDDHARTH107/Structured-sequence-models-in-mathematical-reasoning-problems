    "message_2": "To evaluate the expression, we will substitute the given values of p and q into the expression and then simplify it step by step.\n\nGiven: p is false and q is true.\n\nExpression: (p AND q) OR (NOT p)\n\nStep 1: Substitute the values of p and q.\n= (false AND true) OR (NOT false)\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the AND operation.\n= (false) OR (NOT false)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the NOT operation.\n= (false) OR (true)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the OR operation.\n= true\n\nSo, the truth value of the expression is true."
