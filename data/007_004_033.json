    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 72 and 96 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by prime factorization. Here, I'll use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 72: 2^3 * 3^2\nPrime factorization of 96: 2^5 * 3^1\n\nNow, compare the exponents of each prime factor and choose the lowest one.\n\nFor 2: In 72, the exponent is 3, and in 96, the exponent is 5. The lowest exponent is 3.\nFor 3: In 72, the exponent is 2, and in 96, the exponent is 1. The lowest exponent is 1.\n\nNow, multiply the prime factors with the chosen exponents: 2^3 * 3^1 = 8 * 3 = 24\n\nSo, the GCD of 72 and 96 is 24."
