Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_3 (direct product of cyclic groups)\n4. Z_6 x Z_4 (direct product of cyclic groups)\n5. Z_12 x Z_2 (direct product of cyclic groups)\n6. Z_2 x S_3 (semi-direct product)\n7. Z_2 x D_12 (semi-direct product)\n8. Z_3 x S_3 (semi-direct product)\n9. Z_3 x D_8 (semi-direct product)\n10. Z_4 x S_3 (semi-direct product)\n11. Z_4 x D_6 (semi-direct product)\n12. Z_6 x D_4 (semi-direct product)\n13. Q_24 (generalized quaternion group)\n14. SL(2, Z_3) (special linear group)\n15. A_4 x Z_2 (direct product of alternating group and cyclic group)\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and considering the possible structures of groups of order 24, which is 2^3 * 3."
