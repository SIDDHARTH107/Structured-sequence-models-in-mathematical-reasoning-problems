    "message_2": "Constructing the Cayley tables for all eight non-abelian groups of order 40 would be quite extensive and not practical in this format. However, I can provide a general approach to finding these groups and explain why they are non-abelian.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems, which are essential in understanding the structure of groups of a given order. For a group G of order 40, we have:\n\n|G| = 40 = 2^3 * 5\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 8) and 5-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide the order of the group and satisfy certain conditions. Let's denote the number of 2-Sylow subgroups as n_2 and the number of 5-Sylow subgroups as n_5. Then:\n\n1. n_2 | 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_5 | 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFrom these conditions, we find that n_2 ∈ {1, 5} and n_5 ∈ {1, 8}. We can now analyze the possible structures of the 2-Sylow and 5-Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8, there are three possibilities: Z_8 (cyclic group), Z_2 × Z_4 (direct product of two cyclic groups), and D_4 (dihedral group).\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups of order 5, there is only one possibility: Z_5 (cyclic group).\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of these subgroups and their semi-direct products. A semi-direct product is a generalization of the direct product, allowing for non-abelian groups. It is denoted as ⋊. We have:\n\n1. Z_8 ⋊ Z_5\n2. Z_2 × Z_4 ⋊ Z_5\n3. D_4 ⋊ Z_5\n\nEach of these semi-direct products can be further analyzed based on the possible homomorphisms between the groups. For example, for the second case (Z_2 × Z_4 ⋊ Z_5), there are two possible homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(Z_2 × Z_4), leading to two distinct non-abelian groups. Similarly, for the third case (D_4 ⋊ Z_5), there are four possible homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(D_4), leading to four distinct non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 2 + 4 = 8 non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nTo show that these groups are non-abelian, we can look at the semi-direct product structure. If the semi-direct product is isomorphic to a direct product, then the group is abelian. However, for the cases we have analyzed, the semi-direct products are not isomorphic to direct products, and thus, the groups are non-abelian."
