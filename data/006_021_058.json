    "message_2": "To find the probability of a severe thunderstorm occurring in the region during the month of May, we can use the historical data provided.\n\nSince a severe thunderstorm hits the region once every 10 years on average during the month of May, the probability of a severe thunderstorm occurring in a given year is 1 in 10 or 1/10.\n\nSo, the probability of a severe thunderstorm occurring in the region during the month of May is 1/10 or 0.1, which is equivalent to 10%."
