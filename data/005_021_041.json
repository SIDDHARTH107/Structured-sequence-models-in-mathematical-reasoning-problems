    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset of 50 heights, and you want to estimate the average height of the population from where the sample was taken. Use bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the average height, assuming that the standard deviation of heights in the population is 5 cm.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the average height using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean height of the original dataset (50 heights).\n2. Resample the dataset with replacement (i.e., randomly draw 50 heights from the original dataset, allowing for the same height to be selected multiple times) to create a new \"bootstrap\" sample.\n3. Calculate the mean height of the bootstrap sample.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 or more) to create a distribution of bootstrap sample means.\n5. Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of bootstrap sample means. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the average height.\n\nNote that without the actual dataset of 50 heights, we cannot provide a specific confidence interval. However, the steps above outline the process for estimating the 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping."
