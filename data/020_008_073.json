The cost of transporting goods from each warehouse to each retail store is given in the following table:\n\n|         | Retail Store 1 | Retail Store 2 | Retail Store 3 | Retail Store 4 | Retail Store 5 |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Warehouse 1 | 5              | 2              | 4              | 1              | 5              |\n| Warehouse 2 | 3              | 1              | 2              | 6              | 1              |\n| Warehouse 3 | 6              | 3              | 1              | 2              | 3              |\n\nThe factory wants to find the cheapest way to transport goods from the warehouses to the retail stores. Find the minimum cost and the optimal transportation plan.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost and the optimal transportation plan, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm. The algorithm consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract the smallest value in each row from all the values in that row.\n2. Subtract the smallest value in each column from all the values in that column.\n3. Cover all zeros in the matrix using the minimum number of horizontal and vertical lines.\n4. If the number of lines is equal to the number of rows or columns, an optimal assignment is possible. If not, go to step 5.\n5. Find the smallest uncovered value and subtract it from all uncovered values. Add this value to the values at the intersection of the lines. Repeat steps 3-5 until an optimal assignment is found.\n\nApplying the algorithm to the given cost matrix:\n\nStep 1:\n|         | Retail Store 1 | Retail Store 2 | Retail Store 3 | Retail Store 4 | Retail Store 5 |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Warehouse 1 | 4              | 1              | 3              | 0              | 4              |\n| Warehouse 2 | 2              | 0              | 1              | 5              | 0              |\n| Warehouse 3 | 4              | 1              | 0              | 0              | 1              |\n\nStep 2:\n|         | Retail Store 1 | Retail Store 2 | Retail Store 3 | Retail Store 4 | Retail Store 5 |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Warehouse 1 | 2              | 1              | 2              | 0              | 4              |\n| Warehouse 2 | 2              | 0              | 0              | 5              | 0              |\n| Warehouse 3 | 3              | 0              | 0              | 0              | 1              |\n\nStep 3: Cover all zeros with a minimum number of lines. In this case, we can cover all zeros with 3 lines.\n\nStep 4: The number of lines (3) is equal to the number of rows, so an optimal assignment is possible.\n\nOptimal transportation plan:\n- Warehouse 1 to Retail Store 4\n- Warehouse 2 to Retail Store 2\n- Warehouse 3 to Retail Store 3\n\nMinimum cost: 1 (W1-RS4) + 1 (W2-RS2) + 1 (W3-RS3) = 3"
