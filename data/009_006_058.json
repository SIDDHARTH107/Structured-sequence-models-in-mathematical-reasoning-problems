    "message_1": "Consider the chemical reaction: A + 2B → C, whose rate is proportional to the concentrations of reactants A and B, and the rate constant is k=0.025 L/(mol*min). If the initial concentrations of A and B are 0.1 and 0.2 moles per liter respectively, and the reaction takes place in a 2 L vessel, what will be the concentration of A and B after 10 minutes of reaction?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction. Since the rate is proportional to the concentrations of A and B, we can write the rate equation as:\n\nrate = k[A][B]\n\nLet x be the amount of A and B that has reacted after 10 minutes. Then, the concentrations of A and B after 10 minutes will be:\n\n[A] = 0.1 - x\n[B] = 0.2 - 2x\n\nNow, we can write the rate equation in terms of x:\n\nrate = k(0.1 - x)(0.2 - 2x)\n\nSince the reaction takes place in a 2 L vessel, the total volume is 2 L. We can now integrate the rate equation with respect to time:\n\n∫(dx/((0.1 - x)(0.2 - 2x))) = ∫(k dt)\n\nWe need to find x after 10 minutes (t = 10 min):\n\n∫(dx/((0.1 - x)(0.2 - 2x))) from 0 to x = ∫(0.025 dt) from 0 to 10\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\nA/(0.1 - x) + B/(0.2 - 2x) = 1/((0.1 - x)(0.2 - 2x))\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator to clear the fractions:\n\nA(0.2 - 2x) + B(0.1 - x) = 1\n\nExpanding and collecting like terms:\n\n(-2A - B)x + (0.2A + 0.1B) = 1\n\nComparing coefficients, we get the following system of linear equations:\n\n-2A - B = 0\n0.2A + 0.1B = 1\n\nSolving this system, we get A = 1/3 and B = -2/3. Now we can rewrite the integral:\n\n∫((1/3)/(0.1 - x) - (2/3)/(0.2 - 2x) dx = ∫(0.025 dt)\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n(-1/3)ln|0.1 - x| + (1/3)ln|0.2 - 2x| = 0.025t + C\n\nNow we need to find the constant of integration, C. At t = 0, x = 0:\n\n(-1/3)ln(0.1) + (1/3)ln(0.2) = C\n\nC = ln(0.1^(-1/3) * 0.2^(1/3))\n\nNow we can plug in t = 10 min:\n\n(-1/3)ln|0.1 - x| + (1/3)ln|0.2 - 2x| = 0.025(10) + ln(0.1^(-1/3) * 0.2^(1/3))\n\nTo solve for x, we can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a root-finding algorithm. Using a calculator or software, we find that x ≈ 0.048.\n\nNow we can find the concentrations of A and B after 10 minutes:\n\n[A] = 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 - 0.048 = 0.052 M\n[B] = 0.2 - 2x ≈ 0.2 - 2(0.048) = 0.104 M\n\nSo, after 10 minutes of reaction, the concentration of A is approximately 0.052 M and the concentration of B is approximately 0.104 M."
