    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure. This property is known as the chromatic number of the graph.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, which is 8.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete, the chromatic number could be lower. For example, if the graph is a cycle with an even number of vertices (like an octagon), the minimum number of colors needed is 2.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors needed."
