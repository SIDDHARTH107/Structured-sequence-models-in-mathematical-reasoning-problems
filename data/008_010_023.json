    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations to transform the given system into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  4 |\n| 2 -1  3 |  7 |\n| 3  1  4 | 10 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2*Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3*Row1\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  4 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -1 |\n| 0 -5  7 | -2 |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - Row2\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  4 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -1 |\n| 0  0  2 | -1 |\n\nStep 4: Normalize the last row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 / 2\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  4 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -1 |\n| 0  0  1 | -0.5 |\n\nStep 5: Back-substitution:\n\nz = -0.5\n\ny = (-1 - 5z) / -5 = (-1 + 2.5) / 5 = 1.5 / 5 = 0.3\n\nx = 4 - 2y + z = 4 - 2(0.3) + (-0.5) = 3.1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3.1, y = 0.3, and z = -0.5."
