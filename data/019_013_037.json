    "message_2": "In second-order logic, the cardinality of the continuum refers to the cardinality of the set of real numbers. This cardinality is represented by the cardinal number ℵ1 (aleph-one) or 2^ℵ0 (2 raised to the power of aleph-null), where ℵ0 is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum is uncountable, meaning that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the set of real numbers and the set of natural numbers. This result was proven by Georg Cantor using his famous diagonalization argument.\n\nIn second-order logic, the cardinality of the continuum remains the same as in first-order logic, as the distinction between the two logics lies in the types of quantification allowed over predicates and relations, rather than in the cardinality of sets."
