    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 7 cm and the height h is 15 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(7)² + 2π(7)(15)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(49) + 2π(105)\n\nSurface Area = 98π + 210π\n\nSurface Area = 308π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.1416:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 308 * 3.1416\n\nSurface Area ≈ 967.04 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 967.04 square centimeters."
