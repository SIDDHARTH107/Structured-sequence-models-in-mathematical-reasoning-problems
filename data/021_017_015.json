    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of machines: Type A and Type B. Type A machines require 5 hours of assembly time and 3 hours of painting time, while Type B machines require 4 hours of assembly time and 6 hours of painting time. The company has 600 hours of assembly time and 900 hours of painting time available per week. The profit for each Type A machine sold is $1500, while the profit for each Type B machine sold is $2000. \nThe company wants to determine the maximum number of machines of each type to produce per week to maximize their profit. \nUsing differential evolution, solve for the maximum profit that the company can make per week and the corresponding production levels for each type of machine.",
    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a numerical optimization algorithm, which is not well-suited for this platform. However, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of Type A machines and y be the number of Type B machines produced per week. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 1500x + 2000y, subject to the constraints:\n\n5x + 4y ≤ 600 (assembly time constraint)\n3x + 6y ≤ 900 (painting time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n5x + 4y = 600 => y = (600 - 5x) / 4\n3x + 6y = 900 => y = (900 - 3x) / 6\n\nIntersection points:\n1. (0, 0) - origin\n2. (0, 150) - intersection of y-axis and painting time constraint\n3. (120, 0) - intersection of x-axis and assembly time constraint\n4. (60, 90) - intersection of assembly and painting time constraints\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 0\n2. P(0, 150) = 0 + 2000 * 150 = $300,000\n3. P(120, 0) = 1500 * 120 + 0 = $180,000\n4. P(60, 90) = 1500 * 60 + 2000 * 90 = $270,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $300,000, which occurs when the company produces 0 Type A machines and 150 Type B machines per week."
