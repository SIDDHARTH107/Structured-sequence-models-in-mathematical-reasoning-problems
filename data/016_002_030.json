    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is created by iteratively adding smaller equilateral triangles to the sides of the previous iteration. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (side length of original triangle) * (3 * (4/3)^n)\n\nIn this case, the original equilateral triangle has a side length of 2 cm, and we want to find the perimeter after 4 iterations.\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (3 * (4/3)^4)\nPerimeter = 2 * (3 * (256/81))\nPerimeter = 2 * (768/81)\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 18.96296 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations is approximately 18.96296 cm."
