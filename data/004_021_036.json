    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d(2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = (3 * 2)x^(3-1) - (2 * 5)x^(2-1) + 3 - 0\nf'(x) = 6x² - 10x + 3\n\nNow, we find the second derivative by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(6x² - 10x + 3)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\nf''(x) = (2 * 6)x^(2-1) - 10\nf''(x) = 12x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x³ - 5x² + 3x - 7 is f''(x) = 12x - 10."
