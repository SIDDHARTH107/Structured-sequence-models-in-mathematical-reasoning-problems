    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's denote the given congruences as:\n\nx ≡ a1 (mod n1)\nx ≡ a2 (mod n2)\nx ≡ a3 (mod n3)\n\nwhere a1 = 3, n1 = 5, a2 = 4, n2 = 7, a3 = 2, and n3 = 9.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique solution modulo N, where N = n1 * n2 * n3 = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315.\n\nNow, we need to find the numbers N1, N2, and N3 such that:\n\nN1 * n1 = N\nN2 * n2 = N\nN3 * n3 = N\n\nSo, N1 = N / n1 = 315 / 5 = 63, N2 = N / n2 = 315 / 7 = 45, and N3 = N / n3 = 315 / 9 = 35.\n\nNext, we need to find the inverses of N1, N2, and N3 modulo n1, n2, and n3, respectively. These inverses are denoted as M1, M2, and M3, and they satisfy:\n\nM1 * N1 ≡ 1 (mod n1)\nM2 * N2 ≡ 1 (mod n2)\nM3 * N3 ≡ 1 (mod n3)\n\nBy inspection or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find:\n\nM1 = 3 (since 3 * 63 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\nM2 = 1 (since 1 * 45 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\nM3 = 2 (since 2 * 35 ≡ 1 (mod 9))\n\nNow, we can find the solution x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * N1 * M1 + a2 * N2 * M2 + a3 * N3 * M3) % N\n\nx = (3 * 63 * 3 + 4 * 45 * 1 + 2 * 35 * 2) % 315\nx = (567 + 180 + 140) % 315\nx = 887 % 315\nx = 257\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this system of congruences is 257."
