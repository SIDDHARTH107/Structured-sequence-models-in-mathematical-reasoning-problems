    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9, we first need to find the first derivative, and then the second derivative.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7\n\nNow, we find the second derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 7)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = -1:\nf''(-1) = 36(-1)^2 - 12(-1) + 10\nf''(-1) = 36 + 12 + 10\nf''(-1) = 58\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 9 at x = -1 is 58."
