Assume that $f(z) = g(z)$ for all $z$ on the real axis. If $f(z) - g(z)$ is bounded in $\\mathbb{H}$, then prove that $f(z) = g(\\bar{z})$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z) = g(\\bar{z})$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, we will use the Schwarz reflection principle.\n\nFirst, let's define a new function $h(z) = f(z) - g(z)$. Since $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$, $h(z)$ is also holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$. Moreover, we are given that $h(z)$ is bounded in $\\mathbb{H}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(\\bar{z})$. Since $h(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$, $h(\\bar{z})$ is holomorphic in the lower half-plane $\\mathbb{L}$. Furthermore, we have $h(\\bar{z}) = f(\\bar{z}) - g(\\bar{z})$.\n\nWe are given that $f(z) = g(z)$ for all $z$ on the real axis. Therefore, $h(z) = 0$ for all $z$ on the real axis. Since $h(z)$ is continuous on the real axis, we have $h(\\bar{z}) = 0$ for all $z$ on the real axis as well.\n\nNow, let's define a new function $H(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$\nH(z) = \\begin{cases}\nh(z) & \\text{if } z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } z \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\\nh(\\bar{z}) & \\text{if } z \\in \\mathbb{L}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$H(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{H}$ and $\\mathbb{L}$, and continuous on the real axis. By the Schwarz reflection principle, $H(z)$ is holomorphic on the whole complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSince $H(z)$ is holomorphic and bounded in $\\mathbb{H}$, by the Riemann extension theorem, $H(z)$ is constant. Since $H(z) = 0$ for all $z$ on the real axis, we have $H(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$, we have $h(z) = H(z) = 0$, which implies $f(z) - g(z) = 0$, so $f(z) = g(z)$. For all $z \\in \\mathbb{L}$, we have $h(\\bar{z}) = H(z) = 0$, which implies $f(\\bar{z}) - g(\\bar{z}) = 0$, so $f(\\bar{z}) = g(\\bar{z})$. Therefore, we have $f(z) = g(\\bar{z})$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$."
