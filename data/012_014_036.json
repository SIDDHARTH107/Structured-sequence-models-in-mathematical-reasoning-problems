An isomorphism between them can be defined as follows:\n\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = 2\nf(3) = 3\nf(4) = 5\nf(5) = 4\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of vertices in both graphs:\n\n- In Graph A, vertices 1, 2, and 3 are connected, and in Graph B, vertices 1, 2, and 3 are also connected.\n- In Graph A, vertices 2 and 4 are connected, and in Graph B, vertices 2 and 5 are connected.\n- In Graph A, vertices 3 and 5 are connected, and in Graph B, vertices 3 and 4 are connected.\n- In Graph A, vertices 4 and 5 are connected, and in Graph B, vertices 5 and 4 are connected.\n\nSince the isomorphism preserves the adjacency of vertices, Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic."
