    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + 4y^2 at the point (1, 2, 9), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the first partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 8v)\n\nNext, we need to find the second partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 8)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 8v) = 16uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 8v) • (0, 1, 8v) = 1 + 64v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 2) • N\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, 0) • N\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 8) • N\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface. To find N, we first find the normal vector by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nn = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 8v) = (-2u, -16v, 1)\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of n:\n\n|n| = √((-2u)^2 + (-16v)^2 + 1^2) = √(4u^2 + 256v^2 + 1)\n\nThe unit normal vector N is then:\n\nN = n/|n| = (-2u, -16v, 1) / √(4u^2 + 256v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find L, M, and N:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u/|n|, -16v/|n|, 1/|n|) = 2/|n|\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, 0) • (-2u/|n|, -16v/|n|, 1/|n|) = 0\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 8) • (-2u/|n|, -16v/|n|, 1/|n|) = 8/|n|\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/(2√(EG - F^2))) * (EN + GL - 2FM)\n\nAt the point (1, 2, 9), we have u = 1 and v = 2:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 16(1)(2) = 32\nG = 1 + 64(2)^2 = 257\n|n| = √(4(1)^2 + 256(2)^2 + 1) = √(1025)\nL = 2/√(1025)\nM = 0\nN = 8/√(1025)\n\nNow, we can find H:\n\nH = (1/(2√(5*257 - 32^2))) * (5*(8/√(1025)) + 257*(2/√(1025)) - 2*0)\nH = (1/(2√(1285))) * (40/√(1025))\nH = 20/√(1285*1025)\n\nTherefore, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + 4y^2 at the point (1, 2, 9) is H = 20/√(1285*1025)."
