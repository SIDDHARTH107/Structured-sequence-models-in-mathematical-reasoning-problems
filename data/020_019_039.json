    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem:\n\nA chemical plant produces a certain chemical at a constant rate of 1000 kg/hour. The chemical is in high demand and can be sold for $5/kg. However, transporting the chemical from the plant to the storage facility incurs a cost of $0.50/kg per kilometer. The storage facility is located 20 km away from the plant. What is the optimal amount of chemical that should be transported to the storage facility?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal amount of chemical to be transported to the storage facility, we need to calculate the profit per kg after accounting for the transportation cost.\n\nThe selling price of the chemical is $5/kg. The transportation cost is $0.50/kg per kilometer, and the storage facility is 20 km away. So, the total transportation cost per kg is:\n\n$0.50/kg * 20 km = $10/kg\n\nSince the transportation cost per kg is higher than the selling price per kg, it is not profitable to transport the chemical to the storage facility. In this case, the optimal amount of chemical to be transported to the storage facility is 0 kg. The plant should find an alternative way to sell the chemical or reduce the transportation cost to make it profitable."
