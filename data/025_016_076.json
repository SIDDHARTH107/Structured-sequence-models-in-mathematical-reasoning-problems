    "message_2": "To find the inverse of the birational transformation $f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{x^2}{y}, \\frac{x}{y}\\right)$, we need to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of the transformed coordinates. Let's denote the transformed coordinates as $(u,v)$, where $u = \\frac{x^2}{y}$ and $v = \\frac{x}{y}$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite these equations as:\n$$x^2 = uy$$\n$$x = vy$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ and $v$:\n$$y = \\frac{x}{v}$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation:\n$$x^2 = u\\left(\\frac{x}{v}\\right)$$\n\nNow, solve for $x$:\n$$x = uv$$\n\nNow that we have $x$ in terms of $u$ and $v$, we can find $y$ by substituting this expression for $x$ back into the equation for $y$:\n$$y = \\frac{uv}{v}$$\n$$y = u$$\n\nThus, the inverse transformation is given by $f^{-1}(u,v) = (uv, u)$."
