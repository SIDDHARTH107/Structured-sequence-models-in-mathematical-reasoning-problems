    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a cosine function, which is A*cos(Bx - C).\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4), so we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function. In this case, A = 2, so the amplitude is 2.\n\nPeriod: The period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the cosine function, which we'll call B. The period is given by the formula (2π)/B. In this case, B = 3, so the period is (2π)/3.\n\nPhase Shift: The phase shift is determined by the constant term inside the cosine function, which we'll call C. The phase shift is given by the formula C/B. In this case, C = π/4, and B = 3, so the phase shift is (π/4)/3 = π/12. Since the term inside the cosine function is (3x - π/4), the phase shift is to the right by π/12.\n\nSo, for the function f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4), the amplitude is 2, the period is (2π)/3, and the phase shift is π/12 to the right."
