    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the network, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of the transfer function H(jω). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) ∫ H(jω) * e^(jωt) dω\n\nwhere h(t) is the impulse response, and the integral is taken over the entire frequency range.\n\nGiven the transfer function H(jω) = 5/(jω + 3), we can now compute the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) ∫ (5/(jω + 3)) * e^(jωt) dω\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the method of complex contour integration. We will consider the integral along a closed contour in the complex plane, which consists of a semi-circle in the upper half-plane. The poles of the integrand are at ω = -3j. Since the pole is in the upper half-plane, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral.\n\nThe residue theorem states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is equal to 2πj times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour.\n\nThe residue of the function 5/(jω + 3) * e^(jωt) at ω = -3j is given by:\n\nResidue = lim (ω -> -3j) [(ω + 3j) * (5/(jω + 3)) * e^(jωt)]\n         = 5 * e^(-3jt)\n\nNow, we can apply the residue theorem:\n\nh(t) = (1/2π) * 2πj * 5 * e^(-3jt)\n\nThe 2π and j terms cancel out, leaving:\n\nh(t) = 5 * e^(-3jt)\n\nThis is the impulse response of the network."
