    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least one isolated vertex or separate the graph into two or more disconnected subgraphs.\n\nLet's consider the minimum degree of a vertex in the graph G. Since G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 12) / 8 = 3. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we have a vertex with a degree of 3. To disconnect the graph, we can remove all 3 edges connected to this vertex, which will make it isolated. In this case, we need to remove a minimum of 3 edges.\n\nIf there is a vertex with a degree of 2 or 1, we can disconnect the graph by removing fewer edges. For a vertex with a degree of 2, we need to remove 2 edges, and for a vertex with a degree of 1, we need to remove only 1 edge.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph G is 1."
