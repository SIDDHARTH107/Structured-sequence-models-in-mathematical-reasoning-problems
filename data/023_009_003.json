    "message_1": "A thin metal plate with dimensions 1 m x 1 m is heated and maintained at a temperature of 100°C. The edges of the plate are kept at a constant temperature of 0°C. Using Fourier Transform, determine the steady-state temperature distribution within the plate. Use the following boundary conditions:\n\n- u(0,y) = u(1,y) = u(x,0) = u(x,1) = 0, where u is the temperature at point (x,y) on the plate.\n\nAssume that the thermal conductivity of the plate is constant and equal to 10 W/mK.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the two-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∇²u = 0\n\nwhere ∇² is the Laplacian operator, and u(x, y) is the temperature distribution within the plate.\n\nWe will use separation of variables to solve this equation. Let u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nDividing by XY, we have:\n\n(X''/X) + (Y''/Y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ². So, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) + λ²Y(y) = 0\n\nNow, we will solve these equations with the given boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = X(1) = 0\nY(0) = Y(1) = 0\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n\nX(x) = A*sin(λx)\nY(y) = B*sin(λy)\n\nwhere A and B are constants.\n\nNow, we will use the boundary conditions to find the values of λ:\n\nsin(λ*0) = sin(λ*1) = 0\n\nThis implies that λ = nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution for u(x, y) is:\n\nu(x, y) = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx) * sin(nπy)]\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A_n. To do this, we will use the initial condition u(x, y) = 100°C when t = 0. Since the plate is heated uniformly, we can represent the initial temperature distribution as a Fourier series:\n\n100 = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx) * sin(nπy)]\n\nTo find A_n, we will multiply both sides by sin(mπx)sin(mπy) and integrate over the domain [0, 1]x[0, 1]:\n\n∫∫[100 * sin(mπx) * sin(mπy)] dx dy = ∫∫[A_n * sin(nπx) * sin(nπy) * sin(mπx) * sin(mπy)] dx dy\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, we get:\n\nA_n = (4 * (1 - (-1)^n)) / (n²π²) for n odd, and 0 for n even.\n\nNow, we have the steady-state temperature distribution within the plate:\n\nu(x, y) = ∑[(4 * (1 - (-1)^n)) / (n²π²) * sin(nπx) * sin(nπy)] for odd n\n\nThis is the temperature distribution within the plate, considering the given boundary conditions and thermal conductivity."
