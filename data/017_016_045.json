    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, we have that P = G. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_9 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 3)\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 3, and 3)\n\nHowever, if G is isomorphic to either C_9 × C_3 or C_3 × C_3 × C_3, then G would have a non-trivial center (Z(G)), since the direct product of non-trivial cyclic groups always has a non-trivial center. This would imply that G is not simple, contradicting the fact that G has a unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C_27.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where n_3 = 27. In this case, there are 27 distinct 3-Sylow subgroups in G, each of order 3^2 = 9. Since each 3-Sylow subgroup has 8 non-identity elements, and these elements cannot be shared among different 3-Sylow subgroups, there are a total of 27 × 8 = 216 non-identity elements in G. This leaves only one element unaccounted for, which must be the identity element of G.\n\nLet P and Q be two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Since P and Q have trivial intersection (only the identity element), the product PQ is a subset of G with |P||Q| = 9 × 9 = 81 elements. However, since G has only 27 elements, we must have PQ = G. This implies that G is a non-abelian group, as the product of two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups generates the entire group.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 27 must be isomorphic either to the cyclic group C_27 or to a non-abelian group of order 27."
