    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology groups of X, we will use the fact that X is a smooth manifold and that the De Rham cohomology groups of a sphere are well-known.\n\nFirst, recall that the De Rham cohomology groups are given by the quotient of closed k-forms by exact k-forms on a smooth manifold. In other words, H^k(X) = Z^k(X) / B^k(X), where Z^k(X) denotes the space of closed k-forms and B^k(X) denotes the space of exact k-forms.\n\nNow, let's consider the sphere X of radius 2 centered at the origin in R^3. This is a 2-dimensional smooth manifold, so we only need to compute H^k(X) for k = 0, 1, 2.\n\n1. For k = 0, H^0(X) represents the space of constant functions on X. Since any constant function is closed and not exact, H^0(X) is isomorphic to R. Thus, H^0(X) = R.\n\n2. For k = 1, we know that H^1(X) is isomorphic to the first homology group H_1(X) by Poincaré duality. Since X is a sphere, its first homology group is trivial, i.e., H_1(X) = 0. Therefore, H^1(X) = 0.\n\n3. For k = 2, we know that H^2(X) is isomorphic to the second homology group H_2(X) by Poincaré duality. Since X is a sphere, its second homology group is isomorphic to R, i.e., H_2(X) = R. Therefore, H^2(X) = R.\n\nIn summary, the De Rham cohomology groups of X are:\n\nH^0(X) = R\nH^1(X) = 0\nH^2(X) = R"
