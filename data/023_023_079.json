    "message_2": "To compute the voltage amplitudes for each node, we will use the Laplacian matrix and the current vector. The current vector is given as:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{I} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe relationship between the Laplacian matrix (L), the voltage vector (V), and the current vector (I) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{L} \\cdot \\textbf{V} = \\textbf{I}\n$$\n\nWe want to find the voltage vector (V). To do this, we can invert the Laplacian matrix and multiply it by the current vector:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{V} = \\textbf{L}^{-1} \\cdot \\textbf{I}\n$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of the Laplacian matrix. Using a matrix calculator or software like Wolfram Alpha, we find that the inverse of the Laplacian matrix is:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{L}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.2 & 0.4 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we can multiply the inverse Laplacian matrix by the current vector to find the voltage vector:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{V} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.2 & 0.4 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.8 \\\\\n0.4 \\\\\n0.2 \\\\\n0.2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSo, the voltage amplitudes for each node when a current of 2 amps is applied to the first node are:\n\n$$\n\\textbf{V} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.8 \\\\\n0.4 \\\\\n0.2 \\\\\n0.2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$"
