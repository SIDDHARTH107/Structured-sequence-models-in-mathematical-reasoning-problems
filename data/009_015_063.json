    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on radioactive decay and half-life equations:\n\nA sample of radon-222 has an initial mass of 64 grams. If the half-life of radon-222 is 3.823 days, how much of the sample will remain after 10 days? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a gram.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 64 grams, the half-life is 3.823 days, and the time elapsed is 10 days.\n\nFinal mass = 64 * (1/2)^(10 / 3.823)\n\nFinal mass = 64 * (1/2)^(2.615)\n\nFinal mass = 64 * 0.191\n\nFinal mass â‰ˆ 12.2 grams\n\nAfter 10 days, approximately 12.2 grams of the radon-222 sample will remain."
