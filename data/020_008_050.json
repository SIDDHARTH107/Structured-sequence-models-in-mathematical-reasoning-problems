Each connection between two cities has a cost associated with it as shown in the table. \n\n|City|City A|City B|City C|City D|City E|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|City A|0|10|6|12|8|\n|City B|10|0|13|16|15|\n|City C|6|13|0|20|7|\n|City D|12|16|20|0|14|\n|City E|8|15|7|14|0|\n\nIf the objective is to connect all five cities at the minimum cost: \n\nWhat is the optimal network design or route that connects all five cities and what is the total cost of this network?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal network design or route that connects all five cities at the minimum cost, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Here, we will use Kruskal's algorithm.\n\nKruskal's algorithm sorts all the edges in the graph in ascending order of their weights and then adds edges to the minimum spanning tree, ensuring that adding the new edge doesn't form a cycle.\n\nFirst, let's list all the edges and their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. City A - City C: 6\n2. City C - City E: 7\n3. City A - City E: 8\n4. City A - City B: 10\n5. City D - City E: 14\n6. City B - City E: 15\n7. City B - City C: 13\n8. City C - City D: 20\n9. City B - City D: 16\n\nNow, let's apply Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Add the edge City A - City C with a weight of 6.\n2. Add the edge City C - City E with a weight of 7.\n3. Add the edge City A - City E with a weight of 8 would form a cycle (A-C-E-A), so skip it.\n4. Add the edge City A - City B with a weight of 10.\n5. Add the edge City D - City E with a weight of 14.\n\nAt this point, all five cities are connected, and adding any more edges would create cycles. The optimal network design is:\n\n- City A - City C\n- City C - City E\n- City A - City B\n- City D - City E\n\nThe total cost of this network is 6 + 7 + 10 + 14 = 37."
