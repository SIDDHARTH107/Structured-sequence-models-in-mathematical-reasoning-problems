    "message_2": "This is a 30-60-90 triangle, which has special properties for the side lengths. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the middle length, and the side opposite the 90-degree angle is the longest (hypotenuse).\n\nWe are given that the side opposite the 60-degree angle is 8 cm. To find the lengths of the other two sides, we can use the ratio 1:√3:2.\n\nLet the side opposite the 30-degree angle be x cm and the side opposite the 90-degree angle (hypotenuse) be y cm. Then, we have the following proportion:\n\nx / 8 = 1 / √3\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 8:\n\nx = 8 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nx = (8 * √3) / (√3 * √3)\nx = 8√3 / 3\n\nSo, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is (8√3) / 3 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the length of the hypotenuse (y):\n\nx / y = 1 / 2\n\nWe know that x = (8√3) / 3, so we can substitute that into the equation:\n\n(8√3) / 3y = 1 / 2\n\nTo solve for y, we can cross-multiply:\n\n2(8√3) = 3y\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n(16√3) / 3 = y\n\nSo, the hypotenuse (side opposite the 90-degree angle) is (16√3) / 3 cm.\n\nIn summary, the side lengths of the 30-60-90 triangle are:\n\n- Side opposite 30-degree angle: (8√3) / 3 cm\n- Side opposite 60-degree angle: 8 cm\n- Side opposite 90-degree angle (hypotenuse): (16√3) / 3 cm"
