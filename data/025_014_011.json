    "message_2": "To determine the value of $\\Theta(\\pi P)$, we first need to find the period map $\\pi$ of the elliptic curve $E$. The period map $\\pi$ is a function that maps points on the elliptic curve to the complex plane, and it is related to the periods of the curve. The periods of an elliptic curve are the integrals of the holomorphic differential $\\omega = \\frac{dx}{2y}$ over a basis of the homology of the curve.\n\nFor the given elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 1$, we can compute the periods by integrating $\\omega$ over the basis of the homology. The basis of the homology can be chosen as the cycles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ around the two non-trivial loops of the curve. The periods are then given by the integrals:\n\n$$\\omega_1 = \\int_\\alpha \\omega, \\quad \\omega_2 = \\int_\\beta \\omega$$\n\nThese integrals can be computed numerically, but it is generally difficult to find closed-form expressions for them. Once we have the periods, we can define the period map $\\pi$ as:\n\n$$\\pi(P) = \\int_O^P \\omega$$\n\nwhere $O$ is the identity element of the elliptic curve, and the integral is taken over a path from $O$ to $P$. The complex period ratio $\\tau$ is then given by the ratio of the periods:\n\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}$$\n\nNow that we have the period map $\\pi$ and the complex period ratio $\\tau$, we can compute the Riemann theta function $\\Theta(\\pi P)$ as:\n\n$$\\Theta(\\pi P) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\exp(\\pi i(n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi(P)+ \\pi i(n+\\frac{1}{2})^2\\tau)$$\n\nThis is an infinite sum, but it converges rapidly, and we can approximate it by taking a finite number of terms. The value of $\\Theta(\\pi P)$ will be a complex number, which encodes information about the elliptic curve and the point $P$.\n\nIn summary, to determine the value of $\\Theta(\\pi P)$, we need to compute the period map $\\pi$ and the complex period ratio $\\tau$ for the given elliptic curve $E$. This generally involves computing integrals of the holomorphic differential $\\omega$ over a basis of the homology of the curve. Once we have $\\pi$ and $\\tau$, we can compute the Riemann theta function $\\Theta(\\pi P)$ as an infinite sum, which converges rapidly and can be approximated by taking a finite number of terms."
