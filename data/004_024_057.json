    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will first implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^3) + d/dx(3xy) + d/dx(y^3) = d/dx(27)\n\nUsing the chain rule and product rule, we get:\n\n3x^2 + 3(dy/dx)x + 3y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\n(dy/dx)(3x + 3y) = -3x^2\n\ndy/dx = -3x^2 / (3x + 3y)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 2. Plug x = 2 into the original equation:\n\n(2)^3 + 3(2)y + y^3 = 27\n\n8 + 6y + y^3 = 27\n\ny^3 + 6y - 19 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is not straightforward. However, using numerical methods or graphing, we can approximate the value of y ≈ 1.817.\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of y with respect to x at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx = -3(2)^2 / (3(2) + 3(1.817))\n\ndy/dx ≈ -12 / (6 + 5.451)\n\ndy/dx ≈ -12 / 11.451\n\ndy/dx ≈ -1.048\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at x = 2 is approximately -1.048."
