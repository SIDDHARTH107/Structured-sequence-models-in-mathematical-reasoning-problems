    "message_1": "Suppose you have 10 distinguishable balls, and you want to distribute them equally among 4 boxes numbered 1 to 4 such that each box contains at least 2 balls. How many ways are there to do this?",
    "message_2": "To distribute 10 distinguishable balls among 4 boxes such that each box contains at least 2 balls, we can use the stars and bars method.\n\nFirst, we put 2 balls in each of the 4 boxes to satisfy the condition that each box must have at least 2 balls. Now we have 2 balls left to distribute.\n\nWe can think of the remaining 2 balls as \"stars\" and the 3 spaces between the 4 boxes as \"bars\". We need to place these 2 stars among the 3 bars. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange the 2 stars and 3 bars in a row.\n\nThere are a total of 5 positions (2 stars + 3 bars), and we need to choose 2 of these positions for the stars. This can be done in C(5, 2) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 10\n\nSo there are 10 ways to distribute the 10 distinguishable balls among the 4 boxes such that each box contains at least 2 balls."
