    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find the prime factorization of 96. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by the product of one more than each of the prime factors in the prime factorization. In this case, the formula is (5+1)(1+1) = 6 * 2 = 12. However, this formula gives us the total number of groups, including both abelian and non-abelian groups.\n\nTo find the number of abelian groups, we can use the formula p(n) = p(n-1) + p(n-2), where p(n) is the number of abelian groups of order n. In this case, p(5) = p(4) + p(3) = 5 + 3 = 8. Since there is only one abelian group of order 3, there are 8 abelian groups of order 96.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct non-abelian groups of order 96 is 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nAn explicit example of a non-abelian group of order 96 is the semidirect product of Z_32 and Z_3, denoted as Z_32 ⋊ Z_3. This group is formed by taking the direct product of Z_32 and Z_3 and then adding a non-trivial action of Z_3 on Z_32. The group operation is defined as (a, b) * (c, d) = (a + ϕ(b)(c), b + d), where ϕ is a non-trivial homomorphism from Z_3 to the automorphism group of Z_32."
