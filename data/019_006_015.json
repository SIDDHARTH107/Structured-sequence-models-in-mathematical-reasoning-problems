    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for the topic Deontic Logic. Deontic logic is a branch of logic that deals with concepts related to obligation, permission, and prohibition. It deals with the study of norms, values, and rules. It is not a field where numerical problems are often encountered. If you can provide more information about what specifically you're looking for, maybe I can provide a better answer.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a problem related to Deontic Logic. While it is true that Deontic Logic does not typically involve numerical problems, I can provide you with a simple example of a Deontic Logic problem to help illustrate the concepts involved.\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. If a person is a doctor, they are obligated to help a patient in need.\n2. If a person is not a doctor, they are not obligated to help a patient in need, but they are permitted to do so.\n3. John is a doctor.\n\nUsing Deontic Logic, we can determine the obligations and permissions for John regarding helping a patient in need. Since John is a doctor (statement 3), we can apply statement 1 to conclude that John is obligated to help a patient in need. If John were not a doctor, statement 2 would apply, and he would not be obligated to help, but would be permitted to do so.\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic concepts of Deontic Logic, such as obligation and permission, without involving numerical calculations. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask."
