Show that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: \n- C10, the cyclic group of order 10\n- D5, the dihedral group of order 10\n- A group that is non-abelian and has order 10.\n\nUse this information to determine which of the above groups G is isomorphic to, and provide an explanation for your answer.",
    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 10, which is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 2 and 5. By the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 2.\n\nSince 5 is prime, P is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5, C5, by the classification of groups of prime order. Similarly, Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, C2.\n\nNow, we consider the normality of P and Q in G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 2 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 = 1, which implies that P is a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 = 1 or 5.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then Q is also a normal subgroup of G. In this case, since P and Q are both normal and their intersection is trivial (only the identity element), G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C5 Ã— C2 = C10, the cyclic group of order 10.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, then Q is not a normal subgroup of G. In this case, we can use the semi-direct product of P and Q to construct a non-abelian group of order 10. Since there is only one non-trivial automorphism of P (inversion), the semi-direct product is unique up to isomorphism. This non-abelian group of order 10 is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 10, D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C10 or D5. If G is abelian, it is isomorphic to C10. If G is non-abelian, it is isomorphic to D5."
