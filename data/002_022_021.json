    "message_1": "A metal ring is bent to form a torus such that the radius of the circular cross-section is 8 cm and the distance from the center of the ring to the center of the circular cross-section is 18 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * r^2) * (2 * π * R)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circular cross-section (8 cm) and R is the distance from the center of the ring to the center of the circular cross-section (18 cm).\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nVolume = (π * 8^2) * (2 * π * 18)\nVolume = (π * 64) * (36 * π)\nVolume = 2304 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 2304π^2 cubic centimeters."
