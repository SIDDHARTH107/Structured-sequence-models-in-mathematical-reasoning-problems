    "message_2": "If a = 25 and b = 9, the expression √(a/b) can be simplified as follows:\n\n√(a/b) = √(25/9)\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root of the fraction by taking the square root of the numerator and the square root of the denominator:\n\n√(25/9) = √25 / √9\n\n√25 = 5 (since 5 * 5 = 25)\n√9 = 3 (since 3 * 3 = 9)\n\nSo, √(25/9) = 5/3."
