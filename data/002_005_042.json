    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 7 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism:\nLength = 10 cm\nWidth = 7 cm\nHeight = 6 cm\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nDiagonal length = √(10² + 7² + 6²)\nDiagonal length = √(100 + 49 + 36)\nDiagonal length = √185\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √185 cm, which is approximately 13.60 cm."
