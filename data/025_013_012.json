    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we will use the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible $x$ values in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ (i.e., from 0 to 6).\n2. For each $x$ value, compute the right-hand side of the equation, $x^3 + 2x + 1$.\n3. Check if the result is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_7$. If it is, there are two corresponding $y$ values; if not, there are no corresponding $y$ values.\n4.
