    "message_2": "The closure of a set A in a topological space (X, T) is the smallest closed set containing A. A closed set is a set whose complement in X is open.\n\nIn this case, A = {a}. Let's find the closure of A.\n\nFirst, we need to find the open sets containing A. From the given topology T, the open sets containing A are {a}, {a, b}, {a, c}, and {a, b, c}.\n\nNow, let's find the complements of these open sets in X:\n\n- X \\ {a} = {b, c}\n- X \\ {a, b} = {c}\n- X \\ {a, c} = {b}\n- X \\ {a, b, c} = {}\n\nOnly {b, c} is an open set in the topology T. Therefore, the closure of {a} is the complement of {b, c} in X, which is {a}. So, the closure of {a} in X is {a}."
