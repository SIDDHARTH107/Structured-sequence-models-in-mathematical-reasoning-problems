    "message_2": "To determine if the topological space X satisfies the Hausdorff separation axiom (T2), we need to check if for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nLet's consider the different cases for distinct points x and y:\n\n1. x ∈ {1, 2, 3} and y ∈ {4, 5}:\n   In this case, we can choose U = {1, 2, 3} and V = {4, 5}, which are disjoint open sets containing x and y, respectively.\n\n2. x ∈ {4, 5} and y ∈ {1, 2, 3}:\n   This case is symmetric to the first one, and we can choose U = {4, 5} and V = {1, 2, 3}.\n\n3. x, y ∈ {1, 2, 3} and x ≠ y:\n   In this case, we can choose U = {x} and V = {y}, as singletons of elements in {1, 2, 3} are open sets in the given topology.\n\n4. x, y ∈ {4, 5} and x ≠ y:\n   In this case, we cannot find disjoint open sets containing x and y, because any open set containing 4 or 5 must also contain the other one (since {4, 5} is the only open set containing them).\n\nThus, we found that for the case where x and y are both in {4, 5}, we cannot find disjoint open sets containing x and y. Therefore, the topological space X does not satisfy the Hausdorff separation axiom (T2)."
