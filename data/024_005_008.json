    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1, -1, 5), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, 2u^2 + 3v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 4u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 6v)\n\nThe first fundamental form coefficients are:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 16u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 24uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 36v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 4)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 6)\n\nThe unit normal vector N is given by:\n\nN = (r_u × r_v) / |r_u × r_v| = (-4u, -6v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 16u^2 + 36v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • r_uu = -4 / sqrt(1 + 16u^2 + 36v^2)\nM = N • r_uv = 0\nN = N • r_vv = -6 / sqrt(1 + 16u^2 + 36v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet( (L - k)E - FM, -FE + (G - k)M ) = 0\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\nk^2 - (L + N)k + (LG - 2MF + NE) = 0\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 5), we have:\n\nE = 17, F = -24, G = 37\nL = -4 / sqrt(53), M = 0, N = -6 / sqrt(53)\n\nPlugging these values into the characteristic equation, we get:\n\nk^2 + (4/√53 + 6/√53)k - (4*37/53 - 6*17/53) = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for k, we find the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 ≈ 0.1693\nk2 ≈ -2.1693"
