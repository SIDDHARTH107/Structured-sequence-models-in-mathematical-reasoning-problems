    "message_2": "The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54 and 144 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (144) by the smaller number (54) and find the remainder.\n   144 รท 54 = 2 with a remainder of 36.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (144) with the smaller number (54) and the smaller number with the remainder (36), then repeat step 1.\n   54 รท 36 = 1 with a remainder of 18.\n\n3. Replace the larger number (54) with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (18), then repeat step 1.\n   36 รท 18 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 18. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 54 and 144 is 18."
