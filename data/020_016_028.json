    "message_1": "A mechanical engineer has to design a cantilever beam with a length of 30 cm and a height of 7 cm using a material with a Young's modulus of 2 x 10^5 MPa. The beam must withstand a uniformly distributed load of 1000 N at the free end. \n\nThe cross-section of the beam is a rectangle with a variable width (w) and a constant thickness of 2.5 cm. What is the minimum width of the beam required to withstand the load while minimizing the total material cost? Assume the cost of the material is proportional to its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum width of the beam, we need to analyze the stress and deflection in the beam. For a cantilever beam with a uniformly distributed load, the maximum bending stress and deflection can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nBending stress (σ) = (M * c) / I\nDeflection (δ) = (q * L^4) / (8 * E * I)\n\nwhere:\nM = maximum bending moment = (q * L^2) / 2\nc = distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber = h / 2\nI = moment of inertia of the cross-section = (w * h^3) / 12\nq = uniformly distributed load = 1000 N\nL = length of the beam = 30 cm\nE = Young's modulus = 2 x 10^5 MPa = 2 x 10^8 N/cm^2\nh = height of the beam = 7 cm\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum allowable bending stress (σ_allow) using the given Young's modulus and the safety factor. Let's assume a safety factor of 2:\n\nσ_allow = E / (2 * safety factor) = (2 x 10^8 N/cm^2) / (2 * 2) = 5 x 10^7 N/cm^2\n\nNow, we can use the bending stress formula to find the minimum width (w) required:\n\nσ_allow = (M * c) / I\n5 x 10^7 N/cm^2 = ((1000 N * 30 cm^2) / 2 * (7 cm / 2)) / ((w * 7 cm^3) / 12)\n\nSolving for w:\n\nw = (1000 N * 30 cm^2 * 7 cm^3) / (2 * 5 x 10^7 N/cm^2 * 7 cm * 12) = 3.5 cm\n\nSo, the minimum width of the beam required to withstand the load while minimizing the total material cost is 3.5 cm."
