    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 6y$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x + 2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2y + 6\n$$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n$$\n2x + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -1\n$$\n\n$$\n-2y + 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 3\n$$\n\nSo, there is one critical point at $(-1, 3)$.\n\nNext, we need to classify this critical point as a maximum, minimum, or saddle point. To do this, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix, which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{det}(H) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= \\begin{vmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -2\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= (2)(-2) - (0)(0) = -4\n$$\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is negative, the critical point $(-1, 3)$ is a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 6y$ has one critical point at $(-1, 3)$, which is a saddle point."
