    "message_2": "To generate a Barnsley fern with a total of 1,000,000 points using the classic iterative algorithm, we need to determine the number of iterations required to reach this point count. The classic iterative algorithm consists of four affine transformations with the following probabilities:\n\n1. Transformation 1: 1% (0.01)\n2. Transformation 2: 85% (0.85)\n3. Transformation 3: 7% (0.07)\n4. Transformation 4: 7% (0.07)\n\nSince each transformation generates one point, we can calculate the expected number of points generated by each transformation in a single iteration. To do this, we multiply the probability of each transformation by the number of points it generates:\n\n1. Transformation 1: 0.01 * 1 = 0.01 points\n2. Transformation 2: 0.85 * 1 = 0.85 points\n3. Transformation 3: 0.07 * 1 = 0.07 points\n4. Transformation 4: 0.07 * 1 = 0.07 points\n\nNow, we sum up the expected points generated by each transformation:\n\nTotal expected points per iteration = 0.01 + 0.85 + 0.07 + 0.07 = 1 point\n\nSince each iteration generates 1 point on average, we need 1,000,000 iterations to generate a Barnsley fern with a total of 1,000,000 points."
