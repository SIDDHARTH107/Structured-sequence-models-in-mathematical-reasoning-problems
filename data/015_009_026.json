    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent of the given equation, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nf(x) = 4x(1-x)\nf'(x) = 4(1 - 2x)\n\nNow, we will iterate the function 100 times for both initial conditions x1(0) = 0.5 and x2(0) = 0.5001, and calculate the sum of the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative at each step.\n\nLet's denote the Lyapunov exponent as L. Initialize L = 0.\n\nFor i = 1 to 100:\n  1. Update x1 and x2 using the equation: x_next = 4x(1-x)\n  2. Calculate the derivative at x1: f'(x1) = 4(1 - 2x1)\n  3. Add the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative to L: L += log(abs(f'(x1)))\n\nAfter 100 iterations, divide L by 100 to get the average divergence:\n\nL = L / 100\n\nNow, let's calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the given initial conditions:\n\nx1 = 0.5\nx2 = 0.5001\nL = 0\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    x1 = 4 * x1 * (1 - x1)\n    x2 = 4 * x2 * (1 - x2)\n    f_prime_x1 = 4 * (1 - 2 * x1)\n    L += math.log(abs(f_prime_x1))\n\nL = L / 100\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent L â‰ˆ 0.6931. This positive value indicates that the two trajectories are diverging on average, and the system is chaotic."
