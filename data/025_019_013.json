    "message_2": "In the given problem, we have a Fano variety $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^n$ of dimension $k$ and index $r$. The equation relating these quantities is given by $2d - r + k < n$, where $d$ is the degree of the anticanonical divisor of $X$.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific example of a smooth Fano surface $X$ of degree $d$, written as a hypersurface of degree $2d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. In this case, we are given that the index of $X$ is $1$. We are asked to determine the dimension $k$ of $X$.\n\nSince $X$ is a surface, its dimension is $k = 2$. Now, we can use the given equation to find the degree $d$ of the anticanonical divisor of $X$. Plugging in the values for $k$, $r$, and $n$, we get:\n\n$2d - 1 + 2 < 3$\n\nSolving for $d$, we get:\n\n$2d < 2$\n\n$d < 1$\n\nHowever, since the degree $d$ must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $d$ is $1$. Therefore, the degree of the anticanonical divisor of $X$ is $d = 1$."
