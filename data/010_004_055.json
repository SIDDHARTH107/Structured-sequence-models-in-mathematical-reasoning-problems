    "message_2": "In the context of real numbers, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points, and it is bounded if there exists a real number M such that all elements of the set are within the interval [-M, M].\n\n1. [0,1]: This is a closed interval, as it contains all its limit points (0 and 1 are included), and it is bounded since all elements are within the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, [0,1] is compact.\n\n2. (0,1): This is an open interval, as it does not contain its limit points (0 and 1 are not included). Although it is bounded, it is not closed. Therefore, (0,1) is not compact.\n\n3. [0,1): This is a half-open interval, as it contains one of its limit points (0 is included, but 1 is not). Although it is bounded, it is not closed. Therefore, [0,1) is not compact.\n\n4. (0,1]: This is another half-open interval, as it contains one of its limit points (1 is included, but 0 is not). Although it is bounded, it is not closed. Therefore, (0,1] is not compact.\n\n5. {0, 1}: This is a set containing two points, which are also its limit points. It is closed and bounded since all elements are within the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, {0, 1} is compact."
