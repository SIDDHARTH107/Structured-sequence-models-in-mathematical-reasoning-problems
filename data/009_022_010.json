    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem on reaction-diffusion equations for pattern formation:\n\nA bacterium colony starts growing on a petri dish of radius 5 cm. The concentration of nutrients follows the reaction-diffusion equation: \n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 u + f(u)$ \n\nwhere $u$ is the concentration of nutrients, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $f(u)$ is a nonlinear reaction term that represents the growth rate of the bacteria. The initial nutrient concentration is $u(r,0) = 1$ when $r < 2.5$ cm and $u(r,0) = 0$ when $r \\ge 2.5$ cm. The boundary condition is $u(5,t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$, which means that the edge of the dish is a nutrient sink. \n\nWhat is the radius $R$ of the bacterial colony at time $t=100$ hours if the diffusion coefficient is $D=0.01$ cm$^2$/hour and $f(u) = u(1-u)$?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the concentration of nutrients $u(r,t)$ at time $t=100$ hours and then determine the radius $R$ of the bacterial colony at that time.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the reaction-diffusion equation in polar coordinates:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right) + f(u)$\n\nNow, we need to solve this partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions. This is a challenging task that typically requires numerical methods, such as finite difference or finite element methods. However, we can try to get an estimate of the radius $R$ by considering the diffusion and reaction terms separately.\n\nLet's first consider the diffusion term. For a constant diffusion coefficient $D$, the diffusion equation in polar coordinates is:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right)$\n\nThe solution to this equation can be found using separation of variables, and it is given by:\n\n$u(r,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\int_0^5 e^{-\\frac{(r-r')^2}{4Dt}} u(r',0) r' dr'$\n\nNow, let's consider the reaction term. The logistic growth equation is:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = f(u) = u(1-u)$\n\nThe solution to this equation can be found using separation of variables, and it is given by:\n\n$u(r,t) = \\frac{e^{rt}}{1 + e^{rt}}$\n\nTo find the radius $R$ of the bacterial colony at time $t=100$ hours, we need to find the value of $r$ for which $u(r,100) = 0.5$. This is because the bacteria will grow where the nutrient concentration is above a certain threshold, which we can assume to be $0.5$ for simplicity.\n\nSince solving the full reaction-diffusion equation is difficult, we can try to estimate the radius $R$ by considering the diffusion and reaction terms separately. Let's first find the radius $R_D$ for the diffusion term:\n\n$u(r,100) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}} \\int_0^5 e^{-\\frac{(r-r')^2}{4Dt}} u(r',0) r' dr' = 0.5$\n\nNow, let's find the radius $R_R$ for the reaction term:\n\n$u(r,100) = \\frac{e^{rt}}{1 + e^{rt}} = 0.5$\n\nBy considering the diffusion and reaction terms separately, we can estimate the radius $R$ of the bacterial colony at time $t=100$ hours as the average of $R_D$ and $R_R$:\n\n$R \\approx \\frac{R_D + R_R}{2}$\n\nTo find the exact value of $R$, we would need to solve the full reaction-diffusion equation numerically. However, this estimate should give us a reasonable approximation of the bacterial colony's radius at time $t=100$ hours."
