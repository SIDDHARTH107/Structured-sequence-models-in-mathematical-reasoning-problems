    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 5| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 5 = 7\nIn this case, we simply solve for x:\n3x - 5 + 5 = 7 + 5\n3x = 12\nx = 12/3\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 3x - 5 = -7\nIn this case, we also solve for x:\n3x - 5 + 5 = -7 + 5\n3x = -2\nx = -2/3\n\nSo, the possible values of x that satisfy the equation |3x - 5| = 7 are x = 4 and x = -2/3."
