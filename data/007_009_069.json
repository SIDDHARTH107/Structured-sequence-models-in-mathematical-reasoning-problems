    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To compute φ(120), we first find the prime factorization of 120.\n\n120 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1\n\nNow, we apply the formula for the Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor 120, we have:\n\nφ(120) = 120 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(120) = 120 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(120) = 120 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(120) = 120 * (1/3) * (4/5)\nφ(120) = 120 * (4/15)\nφ(120) = 32\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(120) is 32."
