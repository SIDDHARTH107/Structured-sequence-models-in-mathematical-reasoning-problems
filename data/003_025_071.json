    "message_1": "A student is standing at point A (2,3) on a coordinate grid and wants to get to point B (5, -4). Calculate the magnitude and direction of the vector that the student needs to take to get to point B using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the vector that the student needs to take, we first need to find the change in the x and y coordinates.\n\nChange in x: Δx = x2 - x1 = 5 - 2 = 3\nChange in y: Δy = y2 - y1 = -4 - 3 = -7\n\nSo, the vector is (3, -7).\n\nNow, we will find the magnitude and direction of this vector.\n\nMagnitude: ||(3, -7)|| = √(3^2 + (-7)^2) = √(9 + 49) = √58\n\nTo find the direction, we will use the arctangent function (tan^(-1)).\n\nDirection: θ = tan^(-1)(Δy/Δx) = tan^(-1)(-7/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that θ ≈ -66.8°. Since the angle is negative, it means the direction is clockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the vector is √58, and the direction is approximately -66.8°."
