    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is determined by the graph's chromatic number. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nFor a complete graph with 6 vertices, the chromatic number is 6, because each vertex is connected to every other vertex, and thus each vertex must have a different color. However, if the graph is not complete, the chromatic number could be lower.\n\nIn general, the minimum number of colors needed for a graph with 6 vertices can range from 2 to 6, depending on the structure of the graph."
