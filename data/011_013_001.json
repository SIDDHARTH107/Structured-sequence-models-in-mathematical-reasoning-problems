    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Polya's Enumeration Theorem (also known as Burnside's Lemma). Let's consider the group of symmetries of a regular tetrahedron, which has 12 elements: the identity (no rotation), 8 rotations about the axes through the midpoints of opposite edges (3 pairs of axes, each with 3 rotations), and 3 rotations about the axes through the vertices and the centers of the opposite faces (each with 2 rotations).\n\nNow, let's count the number of colorings fixed by each symmetry:\n\n1. Identity: All 4^4 = 256 colorings are fixed.\n2. Rotations about the axes through the midpoints of opposite edges: There are 8 such rotations (3 pairs of axes, each with 3 rotations). Each of these rotations swaps two pairs of opposite faces, so the colorings fixed by these rotations must have the same color on each pair of opposite faces. There are 4 choices for the color of the first pair of opposite faces and 4 choices for the color of the second pair of opposite faces, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 colorings fixed by each of these rotations. In total, there are 8 * 16 = 128 colorings fixed by these rotations.\n3. Rotations about the axes through the vertices and the centers of the opposite faces: There are 3 such axes (each with 2 rotations). Each of these rotations cycles the three faces adjacent to one vertex, so the colorings fixed by these rotations must have the same color on these three faces. There are 4 choices for the color of these three faces and 4 choices for the color of the remaining face, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 colorings fixed by each of these rotations. In total, there are 3 * 16 = 48 colorings fixed by these rotations.\n\nAccording to Polya's Enumeration Theorem, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by the symmetries:\n\n(256 + 128 + 48) / 12 = 432 / 12 = 36\n\nSo there are 36 distinct ways to color the faces of a regular tetrahedron with 4 colors."
