    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and an opposite side of length 6 cm. What is the length of the adjacent side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm) and the length of the opposite side (a = 6 cm). We need to find the length of the adjacent side (b).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem is written as:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe can plug in the given values and solve for b:\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the length of the adjacent side (b):\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the adjacent side is 8 cm."
