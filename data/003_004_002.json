    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation sin(3x) + cos(3x) = 1, we can use the following substitution:\n\nLet t = cos(3x), then sin(3x) = √(1 - t^2) (using the Pythagorean identity sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1).\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n√(1 - t^2) + t = 1\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(1 - t^2) + t)^2 = 1^2\n1 - t^2 + 2t√(1 - t^2) + t^2 = 1\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2t√(1 - t^2) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions is true:\n\n1) t = 0\n2) √(1 - t^2) = 0\n\nFor condition 1:\n\nt = cos(3x) = 0\n\n3x = π/2, 3x = 3π/2 (since x is between 0 and 2π)\n\nx = π/6, x = π/2\n\nFor condition 2:\n\n√(1 - t^2) = 0\n1 - t^2 = 0\nt^2 = 1\nt = ±1\n\nt = cos(3x) = 1\n3x = 0, 3x = 2π (since x is between 0 and 2π)\nx = 0, x = 2π/3\n\nt = cos(3x) = -1\n3x = π (since x is between 0 and 2π)\nx = π/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 2π are:\n\nx = 0, π/6, π/3, π/2, 2π/3"
