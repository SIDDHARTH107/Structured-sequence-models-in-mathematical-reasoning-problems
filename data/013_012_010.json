    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg competition, a leader firm determines its quantity first and a follower firm determines its quantity second, given the leader's decision. The inverse demand function is given by p(Q) = 10 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced by both firms in a market. The leader's cost function is C1(q1) = 2q1 and the follower's cost function is C2(q2) = 4q2, where q1 and q2 are the quantities produced by the leader and follower respectively. What is the optimal quantity produced by each firm in this Stackelberg competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity produced by each firm in this Stackelberg competition, we first need to find the reaction function of the follower firm. The follower firm maximizes its profit, which is given by:\n\nπ2(q2) = p(Q) * q2 - C2(q2)\n\nSince Q = q1 + q2, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nπ2(q2) = (10 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - 4q2\n\nNow, we can find the first-order condition (FOC) by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to q2 and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = -q1 - 2q2 + 6 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get the reaction function of the follower firm:\n\nq2 = (6 - q1) / 2\n\nNow, we can find the optimal quantity for the leader firm by maximizing its profit, which is given by:\n\nπ1(q1) = p(Q) * q1 - C1(q1)\n\nSubstituting the reaction function of the follower firm into the profit function, we get:\n\nπ1(q1) = (10 - (q1 + (6 - q1) / 2)) * q1 - 2q1\n\nSimplifying the profit function, we get:\n\nπ1(q1) = (4 - q1/2) * q1 - 2q1\n\nNow, we can find the FOC by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to q1 and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndπ1/dq1 = -q1/2 + 2 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get the optimal quantity for the leader firm:\n\nq1 = 4\n\nNow, we can find the optimal quantity for the follower firm by substituting q1 into its reaction function:\n\nq2 = (6 - 4) / 2 = 1\n\nSo, the optimal quantity produced by the leader firm is 4, and the optimal quantity produced by the follower firm is 1."
