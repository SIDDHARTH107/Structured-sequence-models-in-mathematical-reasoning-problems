    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 individuals having the condition, we can first find the probability of 0 or 1 individual having the condition and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet p = probability of having the condition = 0.05\nLet q = probability of not having the condition = 1 - p = 0.95\nLet n = sample size = 40\n\nWe will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * q^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x individuals having the condition, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time.\n\nFirst, we find the probability of 0 individuals having the condition:\n\nP(0) = C(40, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (0.95)^40\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^40 ≈ 0.1296\n\nNext, we find the probability of 1 individual having the condition:\n\nP(1) = C(40, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^39\nP(1) = 40 * 0.05 * (0.95)^39 ≈ 0.3374\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least 2 individuals having the condition:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.1296 - 0.3374\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.5330\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 individuals out of a sample size of 40 will have the condition is approximately 0.5330 or 53.30%."
