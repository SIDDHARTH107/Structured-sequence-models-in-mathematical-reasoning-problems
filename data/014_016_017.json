    "message_2": "To encode the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Caesar cipher technique with a key of 5, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the alphabet and the corresponding shifted alphabet with a key of 5:\n\n   Original:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n   Shifted:   F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E\n\n2. Replace each letter in the plaintext message with the corresponding letter in the shifted alphabet:\n\n   M -> R\n   A -> F\n   T -> Y\n   H -> M\n   E -> J\n   M -> R\n   A -> F\n   T -> Y\n   I -> N\n   C -> H\n   S -> X\n\n3. Combine the encrypted letters to form the ciphertext:\n\n   Ciphertext: RFYMJRFYNHX\n\nSo, the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encoded as \"RFYMJRFYNHX\" using the Caesar cipher technique with a key of 5."
