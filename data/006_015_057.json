    "message_1": "A company's IT department has identified that the probability of a cyber attack on their network is 0.35 per month. What is the probability that the company will experience a cyber attack in the next 3 months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. The complementary probability of an event is the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the complementary probability of a cyber attack not happening in a month is 1 - 0.35 = 0.65.\n\nTo find the probability of no cyber attack happening in the next 3 months, we can multiply the complementary probabilities for each month:\n\nP(No cyber attack in 3 months) = P(No cyber attack in 1st month) * P(No cyber attack in 2nd month) * P(No cyber attack in 3rd month)\nP(No cyber attack in 3 months) = 0.65 * 0.65 * 0.65 ≈ 0.274625\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one cyber attack happening in the next 3 months, we can find the complementary probability of no cyber attack happening in the next 3 months:\n\nP(At least one cyber attack in 3 months) = 1 - P(No cyber attack in 3 months)\nP(At least one cyber attack in 3 months) = 1 - 0.274625 ≈ 0.725375\n\nSo, the probability that the company will experience a cyber attack in the next 3 months is approximately 0.725 or 72.54%."
