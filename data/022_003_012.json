Using Cauchy's integral theorem, what is the value of this integral?",
    "message_2": "To compute the contour integral $\\int_C f(z) dz$ using Cauchy's integral theorem, we first need to check if the function $f(z)$ is analytic within and on the contour $C$. The function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2-1}$ has singularities at $z = \\pm 1$. Since the contour $C$ is the unit circle with $|z| = 1$, it encloses the singularity at $z = 1$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is not analytic within the contour $C$, we cannot directly apply Cauchy's integral theorem. Instead, we can use the Cauchy's residue theorem to compute the contour integral. The residue theorem states that for a function with isolated singularities inside a closed contour, the contour integral is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of the function at those singularities.\n\nIn this case, we have only one singularity inside the contour $C$, which is at $z = 1$. To find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = 1$, we can rewrite $f(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{(z-1)(z+1)}$$\n\nNow, we can find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z = 1$:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = \\lim_{z \\to 1} (z-1) \\frac{1}{(z-1)(z+1)} = \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\frac{1}{z+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can apply the residue theorem to compute the contour integral:\n\n$$\\int_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\pi i$$\n\nSo, the value of the contour integral $\\int_C f(z) dz$ is $\\pi i$."
