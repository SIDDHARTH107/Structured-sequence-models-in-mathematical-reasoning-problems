    "message_2": "Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension 2 with a nontrivial tangent bundle TM and a nonvanishing global section s: M → TM. We want to show that the Euler characteristic of M is zero.\n\nRecall that the Euler characteristic of a smooth manifold M is given by the alternating sum of the dimensions of its de Rham cohomology groups:\n\nχ(M) = dim H^0(M) - dim H^1(M) + dim H^2(M).\n\nSince M is a smooth manifold of dimension 2, we know that H^0(M) is isomorphic to the space of smooth functions on M, which has dimension 1. Also, H^2(M) is isomorphic to the space of smooth 2-forms on M, which also has dimension 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the nonvanishing global section s: M → TM. Since s is nonvanishing, it defines a nowhere-zero vector field on M. By the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the index of a nowhere-zero vector field on a compact manifold is zero. In other words, the sum of the indices of the zeros of the vector field is zero. Since s is nonvanishing, it has no zeros, so the sum of the indices is zero.\n\nNow, recall that the Euler characteristic of a smooth manifold M can also be computed as the sum of the indices of a generic vector field on M. Since the sum of the indices of the zeros of the vector field defined by s is zero, we have:\n\nχ(M) = 0.\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of M is zero."
