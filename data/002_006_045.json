    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 10 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 10\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 10\n\nC ≈ 31.4159 meters\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 31.4159 meters."
