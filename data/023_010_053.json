    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum and minimum value of the magnitude spectrum, we first need to apply the 2D Fourier transform to the grayscale image. The 2D Fourier transform is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ Σ f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))\n\nwhere f(x, y) is the grayscale image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (256 x 256 in this case), and u and v are the frequency variables.\n\nAfter applying the 2D Fourier transform, we obtain the complex-valued frequency representation of the image. To get the magnitude spectrum, we compute the magnitude of each complex value:\n\nmagnitude_spectrum(u, v) = |F(u, v)|\n\nNow, to find the maximum and minimum values of the magnitude spectrum, we need to analyze the values of the magnitude_spectrum(u, v) for all possible combinations of u and v. However, without any specific information about the grayscale image, we cannot determine the exact maximum and minimum values of the magnitude spectrum.\n\nIn general, the maximum value of the magnitude spectrum will be at the origin (u = 0, v = 0), which corresponds to the DC component (average intensity) of the image. The minimum value will depend on the specific image content and can be anywhere in the spectrum."
