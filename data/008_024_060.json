    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. Let's divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n1) x + 2y - 3z = 1\n2) x + 2y - 3z = 1 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\n3) x + 2y - 3z = 1 (after dividing the third equation by 3)\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, and they all lie on the same plane in 3D space.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the other two. Let's express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = 1 - 2y + 3z\n\nNow we have a parametric representation of the solutions:\n\nx = 1 - 2y + 3z\ny = y\nz = z\n\nHere, y and z can be any real numbers, and x will be determined by the equation x = 1 - 2y + 3z."
