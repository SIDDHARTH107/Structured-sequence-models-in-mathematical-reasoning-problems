    "message_1": "An encrypted message was created using a transposition cipher method, in which letters from the original message are rearranged according to a certain pattern. The key used to decrypt the message is a 3-digit number. If the message has 90 characters, how many possible keys could be used to create the encryption?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with a 3-digit key means that the key can have values from 100 to 999. However, since the message has 90 characters, the key must be a factor of 90 to ensure that the message can be evenly divided into segments for rearrangement.\n\nThe factors of 90 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. However, we are only interested in the factors that are 3-digit numbers. In this case, there is only one such factor: 090.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 possible key that could be used to create the encryption for a 90-character message using a 3-digit transposition cipher."
