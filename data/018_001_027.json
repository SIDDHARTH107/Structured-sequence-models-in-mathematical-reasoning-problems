    "message_2": "To prove that B is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in set B is also an element in set A. In other words, if x is an element of B, then x must also be an element of A.\n\nSet B is given as the empty set, which means it has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in B that are not in A. \n\nBy definition, the empty set is a subset of every set, including set A. So, B is a subset of A."
