Round your answer to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite the given differential equation as a state-space representation:\n\ndy/dt = Ay + Bu + f(t)\n\nwhere A = 3t, B = 1, and f(t) = -2t^3 + 3.\n\nNow, let's define the Lagrangian L:\n\nL = u^2 + y^2 + λ(Ay + Bu + f(t))\n\nWe want to minimize L with respect to u and y, so we take the partial derivatives with respect to u and y and set them to zero:\n\n∂L/∂u = 2u + Bλ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 2y + Aλ = 0\n\nNow we can solve for u and λ:\n\nu = -Bλ/2\ny = -Aλ/2\n\nSubstitute u and y back into the state-space representation:\n\ndy/dt = A(-Aλ/2) + B(-Bλ/2) + f(t)\n\nNow we can solve for λ:\n\nλ = -2(dy/dt - f(t))/(A^2 + B^2)\n\nNow we can substitute λ back into the expression for u:\n\nu(t) = -Bλ/2 = B(dy/dt - f(t))/(A^2 + B^2)\n\nNow we can plug in the values for A, B, and f(t):\n\nu(t) = (3ty - 2t^3 + 3)/(9t^2 + 1)\n\nNow we need to find the optimal control input u(t) over the time interval [0, 1] and subject to the initial condition y(0) = 2. To do this, we can integrate u(t) over the time interval [0, 1]:\n\nu_optimal = ∫(3ty - 2t^3 + 3)/(9t^2 + 1) dt from 0 to 1\n\nUsing a numerical integration method (e.g., Simpson's rule or a computer software), we can find the value of the integral:\n\nu_optimal ≈ -0.373\n\nTherefore, the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the cost function J over the time interval [0, 1] and subject to the initial condition y(0) = 2 is approximately -0.373."
