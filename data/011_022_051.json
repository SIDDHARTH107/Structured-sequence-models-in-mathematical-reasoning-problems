    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 15 kg. You have 5 items to choose from, each with a weight and a value as follows:\n\nItem 1: weight = 2 kg, value = $10\nItem 2: weight = 3 kg, value = $15\nItem 3: weight = 5 kg, value = $20\nItem 4: weight = 7 kg, value = $25\nItem 5: weight = 9 kg, value = $30\n\nYou cannot take a fraction of an item, meaning you either take the item in full or not at all. What is the maximum value that you can carry in the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack, we need to determine the combination of items that provides the highest value without exceeding the 15 kg weight limit. We can do this by examining different combinations of items:\n\n1. Items 1, 2, and 3: weight = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 kg, value = $10 + $15 + $20 = $45\n2. Items 1, 2, and 4: weight = 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 kg, value = $10 + $15 + $25 = $50\n3. Items 1, 2, and 5: weight = 2 + 3 + 9 = 14 kg, value = $10 + $15 + $30 = $55\n4. Items 1, 3, and 4: weight = 2 + 5 + 7 = 14 kg, value = $10 + $20 + $25 = $55\n5. Items 1, 3, and 5: weight = 2 + 5 + 9 = 16 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n6. Items 1, 4, and 5: weight = 2 + 7 + 9 = 18 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n7. Items 2, 3, and 4: weight = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 kg, value = $15 + $20 + $25 = $60\n8. Items 2, 3, and 5: weight = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n9. Items 2, 4, and 5: weight = 3 + 7 + 9 = 19 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n10. Items 3, 4, and 5: weight = 5 + 7 + 9 = 21 kg (exceeds the weight limit)\n\nThe combination with the highest value without exceeding the weight limit is items 2, 3, and 4, with a total weight of 15 kg and a total value of $60. Therefore, the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack is $60."
