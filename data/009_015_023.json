    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material has a half-life of 10 days. If the initial amount of the material is 100 grams, what will be the amount of material remaining after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the remaining amount of radioactive material after a certain number of days, we can use the formula:\n\nRemaining amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nRemaining amount = 100 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\nRemaining amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\nRemaining amount = 100 * (1/8)\nRemaining amount = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be 12.5 grams of the radioactive material remaining."
