The distances between the cities are as follows: \n- City 1 to City 2: 10 km \n- City 1 to City 3: 8 km \n- City 1 to City 4: 15 km \n- City 1 to City 5: 9 km \n- City 2 to City 3: 12 km \n- City 2 to City 4: 10 km \n- City 2 to City 5: 14 km \n- City 3 to City 4: 11 km \n- City 3 to City 5: 7 km \n- City 4 to City 5: 16 km \n\nWhat is the minimum distance that the salesman must travel to visit all 5 cities and return to the starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum distance that the salesman must travel to visit all 5 cities and return to the starting point, we can use the brute force method to find the shortest route. There are 4! (factorial) or 24 possible routes since the salesman can start at City 1 and visit the other cities in any order before returning to City 1.\n\nHere are all the possible routes and their distances:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5-1: 10+12+11+16+9 = 58 km\n2. 1-2-3-5-4-1: 10+12+7+16+15 = 60 km\n3. 1-2-4-3-5-1: 10+10+11+7+9 = 47 km\n4. 1-2-4-5-3-1: 10+10+16+7+8 = 51 km\n5. 1-2-5-3-4-1: 10+14+7+11+15 = 57 km\n6. 1-2-5-4-3-1: 10+14+16+11+8 = 59 km\n7. 1-3-2-4-5-1: 8+12+10+16+9 = 55 km\n8. 1-3-2-5-4-1: 8+12+14+16+15 = 65 km\n9. 1-3-4-2-5-1: 8+11+10+14+9 = 52 km\n10. 1-3-4-5-2-1: 8+11+16+14+10 = 59 km\n11. 1-3-5-2-4-1: 8+7+14+10+15 = 54 km\n12. 1-3-5-4-2-1: 8+7+16+10+10 = 51 km\n13. 1-4-2-3-5-1: 15+10+12+7+9 = 53 km\n14. 1-4-2-5-3-1: 15+10+14+7+8 = 54 km\n15. 1-4-3-2-5-1: 15+11+12+14+9 = 61 km\n16. 1-4-3-5-2-1: 15+11+7+14+10 = 57 km\n17. 1-4-5-2-3-1: 15+16+14+12+8 = 65 km\n18. 1-4-5-3-2-1: 15+16+7+12+10 = 60 km\n19. 1-5-2-3-4-1: 9+14+12+11+15 = 61 km\n20. 1-5-2-4-3-1: 9+14+10+11+8 = 52 km\n21. 1-5-3-2-4-1: 9+7+12+10+15 = 53 km\n22. 1-5-3-4-2-1: 9+7+11+10+10 = 47 km\n23. 1-5-4-2-3-1: 9+16+10+12+8 = 55 km\n24. 1-5-4-3-2-1: 9+16+11+12+10 = 58 km\n\nThe shortest route is 1-2-4-3-5-1 with a distance of 47 km. So, the minimum distance that the salesman must travel to visit all 5 cities and return to the starting point is 47 km."
