    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 7x + 12) / (x - 3) as x approaches 3, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator.\n\nThe numerator can be factored as follows:\n\nx^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4)\n\nNow, the function can be written as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 3)(x - 4)) / (x - 3)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 3) terms:\n\nf(x) = x - 4\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x -> 3) (x - 4) = 3 - 4 = -1\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 3 is -1."
