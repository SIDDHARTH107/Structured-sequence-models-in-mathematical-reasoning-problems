    "message_1": "A factory produces 4 different components. Each component has a production cost of 2, 4, 6, and 8 units, respectively. The factory has a budget of 30 units to produce the components. What is the maximum number of components that the factory can produce within budget?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of components produced as x1, x2, x3, and x4 for components with costs 2, 4, 6, and 8 units, respectively. The total cost of production should not exceed 30 units. Therefore, we have the following inequality:\n\n2x1 + 4x2 + 6x3 + 8x4 â‰¤ 30\n\nTo maximize the number of components produced, the factory should prioritize producing the components with the lowest cost. In this case, the component with a cost of 2 units should be produced first.\n\nLet's assume the factory only produces the component with a cost of 2 units. The maximum number of this component that can be produced is:\n\nx1 = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nNow let's assume the factory produces both components with costs of 2 and 4 units. The maximum number of components that can be produced is:\n\nx1 + x2 = 30 / (2 + 4) = 5\n\nHowever, this would mean producing 5 of each component, which is not possible within the budget. The factory can produce 4 of the 4-unit components and use the remaining 14 units to produce 7 of the 2-unit components. In this case, the total number of components produced is:\n\nx1 + x2 = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nNow let's assume the factory produces components with costs of 2, 4, and 6 units. The maximum number of components that can be produced is:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 30 / (2 + 4 + 6) = 3\n\nHowever, this would mean producing 3 of each component, which is not possible within the budget. The factory can produce 1 of the 6-unit components and use the remaining 24 units to produce 4 of the 4-unit components and 4 of the 2-unit components. In this case, the total number of components produced is:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9\n\nFinally, let's assume the factory produces components with costs of 2, 4, 6, and 8 units. The maximum number of components that can be produced is:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 30 / (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) = 1.875\n\nThis would mean producing 1 of each component, which is not possible within the budget. The factory can produce 1 of the 8-unit components and use the remaining 22 units to produce 3 of the 4-unit components and 4 of the 2-unit components. In this case, the total number of components produced is:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 4 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 8\n\nComparing the different scenarios, the maximum number of components that the factory can produce within the budget is 11 components, which consists of 7 components with a cost of 2 units and 4 components with a cost of 4 units."
