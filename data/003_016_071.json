    "message_1": "A sound wave can be modeled by the trigonometric function y = 2cos(3x - π/4), where y represents the amplitude (in decibels) of the sound wave at time x (in seconds). What is the phase shift of this function?",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2cos(3x - π/4). In general, a cosine function can be written as y = A*cos(B(x - C)) where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn this case, the function is already in the desired form, with A = 2, B = 3, and C = π/4. The phase shift of the function is C, which is π/4."
