    "message_1": "Consider the heat equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the temperature at position $x$ and time $t$, and $k$ is a constant.\n\nSuppose we have a metal rod of length $L=10$ cm that is initially at a temperature of $u(x,0)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq L$. The ends of the rod are insulated, so that heat cannot escape through them.\n\nWhat is the temperature of the rod after 1 minute, if the thermal diffusivity of the metal is $k=0.1$ cm$^2$/min?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$\nX(x) \\frac{dT}{dt} = k T(t) \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $XT$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{k}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}\n$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{k}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2\n$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2 T\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\lambda^2}{k} X\n$$\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions $X(0) = X(L) = 0$ due to the insulation at the ends of the rod. The solutions are:\n\n$$\nX_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}\n$$\n\nThe first equation can be solved by integrating:\n\n$$\nT_n(t) = e^{-\\lambda_n^2 k t}\n$$\n\nThe general solution is a sum of these solutions:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)e^{-\\lambda_n^2 k t}\n$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$:\n\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $A_1 = 1$ and $A_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)e^{-\\lambda_1^2 k t}\n$$\n\nNow we can find the temperature of the rod after 1 minute:\n\n$$\nu(x,1) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{10}\\right)e^{-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{10}\\right)^2 (0.1)(1)}\n$$\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod after 1 minute."
