    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHS,\" we use the formula for permutations of distinct objects, which is n! (n factorial) where n is the number of distinct objects.\n\nIn this case, there are 5 distinct letters (M, A, T, H, and S), so n = 5.\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHS.\""
