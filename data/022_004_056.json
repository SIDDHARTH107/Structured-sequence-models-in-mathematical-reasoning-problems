    "message_2": "To find the singularities of $f(z)$, we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation $z^4 - 1 = 0$. We can factor the denominator as follows:\n\n$z^4 - 1 = (z^2 + 1)(z^2 - 1) = (z^2 + 1)(z + 1)(z - 1)$\n\nNow, we can see that the denominator is equal to zero when $z = 1$, $z = -1$, and $z = \\pm i$. These are the locations of the singularities.\n\nNext, we need to determine the type of singularities at these points. We can do this by examining the order of the poles. The order of a pole is the number of times a factor appears in the denominator. In this case, each factor appears only once in the denominator, so each singularity is a simple pole.\n\nIn summary, $f(z)$ has simple poles at $z = 1$, $z = -1$, and $z = \\pm i$."
