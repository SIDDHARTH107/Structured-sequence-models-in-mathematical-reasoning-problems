    "message_2": "When arranging people around a circular table, we usually consider one person as a reference point to avoid counting the same arrangement multiple times due to rotation. So, we have 7 remaining friends to arrange around the table.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 7 friends is 7! (7 factorial), which is:\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040\n\nSo, there are 5,040 different ways to seat the 8 friends around a circular table."
