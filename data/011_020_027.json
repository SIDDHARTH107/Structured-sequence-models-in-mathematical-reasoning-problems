    "message_1": "A company needs to hire 5 new employees from a pool of 15 qualified candidates. How many different ways can the company make their selection if they must choose 3 men and 2 women?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the number of men and women among the 15 qualified candidates. Let's assume there are M men and W women in the pool, where M + W = 15.\n\nThe company needs to choose 3 men out of M and 2 women out of W. We can use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose these employees:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 3 men = C(M, 3) = M! / (3! * (M - 3)!)\nNumber of ways to choose 2 women = C(W, 2) = W! / (2! * (W - 2)!)\n\nSince these two selections are independent, we can multiply the number of ways to choose 3 men and 2 women to get the total number of ways to make the selection:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(M, 3) * C(W, 2)\n\nWithout knowing the exact values of M and W, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, this formula can be used to calculate the number of ways once the number of men and women among the 15 qualified candidates is known."
