What is the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from Node A to Node D?\n\n```\n      6\n A ------ B\n | \\      |  \\\n |   \\10  |   \\9\n |     \\  |     \\\n C-------D     E\n     7      4\n```\n \nWrite your answer in numerical form.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we will use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Path A -> B -> D: Flow = 6 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Residual capacities:\n   ```\n   A --6/6--> B --6/9--> D\n   A --0/10-> D\n   A --0/7--> C --0/7--> D\n   B --0/4--> E\n   ```\n\n2. Path A -> D: Flow = 4 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Residual capacities:\n   ```\n   A --6/6--> B --6/9--> D\n   A --4/10-> D\n   A --0/7--> C --0/7--> D\n   B --0/4--> E\n   ```\n\n3. Path A -> C -> D: Flow = 7 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Residual capacities:\n   ```\n   A --6/6--> B --6/9--> D\n   A --4/10-> D\n   A --7/7--> C --7/7--> D\n   B --0/4--> E\n   ```\n\nNow, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows found in each step: 6 + 4 + 7 = 17.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from Node A to Node D is 17."
