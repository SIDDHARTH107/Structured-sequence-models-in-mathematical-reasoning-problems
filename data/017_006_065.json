    "message_2": "By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order 15 can be expressed as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Let's find the Sylow subgroups of the group.\n\nLet G be a group of order 15. The order of G is 15 = 3^1 * 5^1, so we have two prime factors, 3 and 5.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is n_3 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Let H be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and K be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Then, H has order 3 and K has order 5. Since both 3 and 5 are prime, H and K are cyclic.\n\nNow, we have |H| = 3, |K| = 5, and |H ∩ K| = 1 (since the intersection of H and K is just the identity element). By the product formula for the order of a group, we have:\n\n|HK| = |H| * |K| / |H ∩ K| = 3 * 5 / 1 = 15\n\nSince |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G. Thus, G is the direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5, respectively. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5."
