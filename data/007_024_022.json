    "message_2": "To find the value of x in the equation 3^x ≡ 8 (mod 17), we can use the method of successive squaring and modular exponentiation.\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 3 modulo 17:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3^6 ≡ 729 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n3^7 ≡ 2187 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n3^8 ≡ 6561 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n3^9 ≡ 19683 ≡ 18 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we can see that 3^9 ≡ 1 (mod 17). This means that the powers of 3 will start repeating after every 9 powers. So, we can write:\n\n3^x ≡ 3^(9k + x) (mod 17) for some integer k.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer x such that 3^x ≡ 8 (mod 17). We can check the powers of 3 that we have calculated:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^3 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^4 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^5 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3^6 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n3^7 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n3^8 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n\nNone of these powers are congruent to 8 modulo 17. However, since 3^9 ≡ 1 (mod 17), we can multiply both sides of the equation 3^x ≡ 8 (mod 17) by 3^9:\n\n3^(x+9) ≡ 8 * 3^9 (mod 17)\n\nNow, let's check the powers of 3 again, but this time starting from 3^10:\n\n3^10 ≡ 3^1 * 3^9 ≡ 3 * 1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^11 ≡ 3^2 * 3^9 ≡ 9 * 1 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^12 ≡ 3^3 * 3^9 ≡ 10 * 1 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^13 ≡ 3^4 * 3^9 ≡ 13 * 1 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^14 ≡ 3^5 * 3^9 ≡ 4 * 1 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3^15 ≡ 3^6 * 3^9 ≡ 12 * 1 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n3^16 ≡ 3^7 * 3^9 ≡ 2 * 1 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n3^17 ≡ 3^8 * 3^9 ≡ 6 * 1 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n3^18 ≡ 3^9 * 3^9 ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nAgain, none of these powers are congruent to 8 modulo 17. However, we can multiply both sides of the equation 3^(x+9) ≡ 8 * 3^9 (mod 17) by 3^9 once more:\n\n3^(x+18) ≡ 8 * 3^18 (mod 17)\n\nLet's check the powers of 3 again, but this time starting from 3^19:\n\n3^19 ≡ 3^1 * 3^18 ≡ 3 * 1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^20 ≡ 3^2 * 3^18 ≡ 9 * 1 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^21 ≡ 3^3 * 3^18 ≡ 10 * 1 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^22 ≡ 3^4 * 3^18 ≡ 13 * 1 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^23 ≡ 3^5 * 3^18 ≡ 4 * 1 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3^24 ≡ 3^6 * 3^18 ≡ 12 * 1 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n3^25 ≡ 3^7 * 3^18 ≡ 2 * 1 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n3^26 ≡ 3^8 * 3^18 ≡ 6 * 1 ≡ 6 (mod 17)\n3^27 ≡ 3^9 * 3^18 ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nWe can see that 3^21 ≡ 10 (mod 17), and since 8 * 3^18 ≡ 8 * 1 ≡ 8 (mod 17), we have:\n\n3^(x+18) ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n\nSo, x + 18 = 21, and therefore x = 21 - 18 = 3.\n\nThus, the value of x in the equation 3^x ≡ 8 (mod 17) is x = 3."
