    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 120.\n2. Analyze the possible structures of groups based on the prime factorization.\n3. Count the number of non-isomorphic groups for each structure.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorization of 120\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze possible group structures\nUsing the Sylow theorems, we can analyze the possible structures of groups of order 120. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\n- For the 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2 must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n- For the 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3 must divide 2^3 * 5 = 40, and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 10.\n- For the 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5 must divide 2^3 * 3 = 24, and n_5 must be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6.\n\nStep 3: Count non-isomorphic groups\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and count the non-isomorphic groups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G is isomorphic to Z_2^3 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_120. There is only 1 group in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 × Z_3 and Z_5. There are 4 possible semi-direct products, but only 2 of them are non-isomorphic. So, there are 2 groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 × Z_5 and Z_3. There are 2 possible semi-direct products, and both are non-isomorphic. So, there are 2 groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 × Z_5 and Z_3. There are 2 possible semi-direct products, and both are non-isomorphic. So, there are 2 groups in this case.\n\nCase 5: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 and Z_3 × Z_5. There are 2 possible semi-direct products, and both are non-isomorphic. So, there are 2 groups in this case.\n\nCase 6: n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 and Z_3 × Z_5. There are 2 possible semi-direct products, and both are non-isomorphic. So, there are 2 groups in this case.\n\nCase 7: n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G is a semi-direct product of Z_2^3 and Z_3 × Z_5. There are 2 possible semi-direct products, and both are non-isomorphic. So, there are 2 groups in this case.\n\nAdding up the groups from each case, we have a total of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
