The company collected data on the ages of its cars and found that the average age of the fleet is 6 years with a standard deviation of 1.5 years. \n\nIf a customer rents a car, what is the probability that the car they will rent from the fleet is less than 5 years old?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a car is less than 5 years old, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the age and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (in this case, 5 years old), μ is the mean (average age of the fleet, which is 6 years), and σ is the standard deviation (1.5 years).\n\nz = (5 - 6) / 1.5\nz = -1 / 1.5\nz = -0.67\n\nNow, we look up the z-score of -0.67 in the z-table to find the probability. The z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than the given z-score. In this case, the probability for a z-score of -0.67 is approximately 0.2514.\n\nSo, the probability that a customer rents a car less than 5 years old from the fleet is approximately 25.14%."
