    "message_1": "A certain electronic system has four critical components, each with a failure rate of 0.05. What is the probability that there is no failure within the next 100 hours of operation of this system?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that there is no failure within the next 100 hours of operation for this system, we need to find the probability that each of the four critical components does not fail.\n\nThe probability of a single component not failing is 1 minus the failure rate:\n\nP(not failing) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n\nSince the components are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each component not failing to find the overall probability that there is no failure within the next 100 hours of operation for the entire system:\n\nP(all components not failing) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145\n\nSo, the probability that there is no failure within the next 100 hours of operation of this system is approximately 81.45%."
