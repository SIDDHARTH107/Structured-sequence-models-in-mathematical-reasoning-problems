    "message_1": "Consider an auction in which bidders have private values for an item being auctioned. The value ci of bidder i's private value for the item is drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100 independently for each bidder. The mechanism is such that the highest bidder wins and pays his bid. However, if there is a tie between two or more bidders, the item is allocated randomly among them and each of them pays half of the highest bid.\n\nSuppose there are three bidders (i.e., n=3). What is the expected revenue generated from the auction mechanism described above?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected revenue generated from the auction mechanism, we need to consider the probability distribution of the highest bid and the expected payment in case of a tie. Let's denote the bids of the three bidders as b1, b2, and b3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability that a bidder i has the highest bid. Since the values are drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100, the probability density function (pdf) for each bidder's value is:\n\nf(ci) = 1/100 for ci in [0, 100]\n\nNow, let's find the probability that bidder i has the highest bid. This occurs when the other two bidders have values less than ci. The probability of this happening is:\n\nP(bj < ci and bk < ci) = P(bj < ci) * P(bk < ci) = (ci/100) * (ci/100) = (ci^2)/10000, for j ≠ i and k ≠ i, j ≠ k\n\nNow, we need to find the expected payment in case of a tie. In case of a tie, the item is allocated randomly among the tied bidders, and each of them pays half of the highest bid. The probability of a tie between two bidders is:\n\nP(bj = ci and bk < ci) = P(bj = ci) * P(bk < ci) = (1/100) * (ci/100) = ci/10000, for j ≠ i and k ≠ i, j ≠ k\n\nThe expected payment in case of a tie between two bidders is half of the highest bid, which is ci/2. \n\nNow, we can find the expected revenue generated from the auction mechanism by integrating the product of the probability of the highest bid and the expected payment over the range of possible values:\n\nExpected revenue = ∫[0,100] [(ci^2)/10000 * ci + ci/10000 * (ci/2)] dci\n\nExpected revenue = ∫[0,100] [(ci^3)/10000 + (ci^2)/20000] dci\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nExpected revenue = [(ci^4)/40000 + (ci^3)/60000] evaluated from 0 to 100\n\nExpected revenue = [(100^4)/40000 + (100^3)/60000] - [(0^4)/40000 + (0^3)/60000]\n\nExpected revenue = [100000000/40000 + 1000000/60000]\n\nExpected revenue = 2500 + 500/3\n\nExpected revenue ≈ 2500 + 166.67\n\nExpected revenue ≈ 2666.67\n\nSo, the expected revenue generated from the auction mechanism described above is approximately 2666.67."
