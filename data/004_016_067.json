    "message_2": "To use the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to understand the problem and the theorem itself. The problem states that a car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, and we need to find at least one point on the route where the instantaneous speed of the car was equal to the average speed over the entire trip.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at point c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, let's consider the function f(t) to represent the position of the car at time t. We know that the car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, so the average speed of the car is:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) = 100 miles / 2 hours = 50 miles/hour\n\nNow, we need to find a point where the instantaneous speed (the derivative of the position function, f'(t)) is equal to the average speed (50 miles/hour).\n\nSince the car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, we can consider the closed interval [0, 2] for time t. We can assume that the position function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 2] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 2), which are the conditions for the Mean Value Theorem to apply.\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nWe know that f(2) - f(0) represents the total distance traveled, which is 100 miles. So,\n\nf'(c) = 100 miles / 2 hours = 50 miles/hour\n\nThus, there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) where the instantaneous speed of the car (f'(c)) is equal to the average speed over the entire trip (50 miles/hour)."
