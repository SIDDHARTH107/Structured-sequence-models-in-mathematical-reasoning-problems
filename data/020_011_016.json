    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products, A and B. The production of product A requires 4 units of raw material and 2 units of labor, while the production of product B requires 3 units of raw material and 6 units of labor. The company has 40 units of raw material and 30 units of labor available for the production process. The profit per unit of product A is $10, and the profit per unit of product B is $12. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw material and labor can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 40 (raw material constraint)\n2x + 6y ≤ 30 (labor constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 12y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - 4x) / 3\n\n2x + 6y ≤ 30\ny ≤ (30 - 2x) / 6\ny ≤ (5 - x / 3)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We can find these points by solving the equations:\n\n1) Intersection of the raw material constraint and the x-axis (y = 0):\n4x + 3(0) = 40\nx = 10\n\n2) Intersection of the labor constraint and the x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 6(0) = 30\nx = 15\n\n3) Intersection of the raw material constraint and the y-axis (x = 0):\n4(0) + 3y = 40\ny = 40/3 ≈ 13.33\n\n4) Intersection of the labor constraint and the y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 6y = 30\ny = 5\n\n5) Intersection of the raw material constraint and the labor constraint:\n4x + 3y = 40\n2x + 6y = 30\n\nMultiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate x:\n8x + 6y = 80\n2x + 6y = 30\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n6x = 50\nx = 50/6 ≈ 8.33\n\nNow substitute x back into one of the equations to find y:\n4(50/6) + 3y = 40\n200/6 + 3y = 40\n3y = 40 - 200/6\n3y = 40 - 100/3\n3y = 20/3\ny = 20/9 ≈ 2.22\n\nNow we have the vertices of the feasible region: (10, 0), (15, 0), (0, 40/3), (0, 5), and (50/6, 20/9).\n\nWe can now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 12y at each of these vertices:\n\nP(10, 0) = 10(10) + 12(0) = 100\nP(15, 0) = 10(15) + 12(0) = 150\nP(0, 40/3) = 10(0) + 12(40/3) = 160\nP(0, 5) = 10(0) + 12(5) = 60\nP(50/6, 20/9) = 10(50/6) + 12(20/9) ≈ 116.67\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 40/3), with a profit of $160. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 40/3 ≈ 13.33 units of product B to maximize its profit. Since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, it should produce 13 units of product B and leave some raw materials unused."
