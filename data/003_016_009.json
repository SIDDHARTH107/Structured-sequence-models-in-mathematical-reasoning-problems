    "message_2": "The phase shift of a function is the horizontal shift of the function from its standard position. In the given function f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4), we can identify the phase shift by looking at the argument of the cosine function.\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is A*cos(B(x - C)) where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 2, B = 3, and the argument of the cosine function is (3x - π/4). To find the phase shift, we can rewrite the argument in the form B(x - C):\n\n3x - π/4 = 3(x - π/12)\n\nComparing this to the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is π/12.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x - π/4) is π/12."
