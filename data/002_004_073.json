    "message_1": "A rectangular-shaped basketball court measures 28 meters in length and 15 meters in width. What is the perimeter of the basketball court?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 28 meters and the width (W) is 15 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(28 + 15)\nP = 2(43)\nP = 86\n\nThe perimeter of the basketball court is 86 meters."
