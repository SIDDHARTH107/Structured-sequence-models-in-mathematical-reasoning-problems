    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 18 = 2 × 3^2.\n2. Determine the number of abelian groups of order 18: There are two abelian groups of order 18, namely Z_18 and Z_2 × Z_9.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 18: Since 18 = 2 × 3^2, there is only one non-abelian group of order 18, which is the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_2.\n\nThus, there are a total of 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z_18, Z_2 × Z_9, and the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_2."
