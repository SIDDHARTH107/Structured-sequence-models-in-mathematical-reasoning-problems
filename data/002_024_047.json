    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and parallel sides of length 10 cm and 15 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b. Since the trapezium is symmetrical, we can divide it into two right triangles by drawing a line perpendicular to the parallel sides from one vertex to the other parallel side.\n\nIn one of the right triangles, the height is 8 cm, and the base is half the difference between the parallel sides (15 - 10) / 2 = 2.5 cm. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + 2.5^2\na^2 = 64 + 6.25\na^2 = 70.25\na = √70.25\na ≈ 8.38 cm\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, the length of side b is also approximately 8.38 cm.\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 15 + 8.38 + 8.38\nPerimeter ≈ 41.76 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 41.76 cm."
