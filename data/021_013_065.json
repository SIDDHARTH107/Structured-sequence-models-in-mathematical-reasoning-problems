    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $5 and for product B is $8. The company has a daily production capacity of 100 units and the raw material cost for each unit of product A is $4 and for product B is $5. The company wants to maximize its daily profit using simulated annealing method. \nWhat is the optimal production quantity for each product type that maximizes the company's daily profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and the cooling schedule. The objective function is the total profit, which we want to maximize.\n\nObjective function: Total Profit = 5 * Quantity_A + 8 * Quantity_B\n\nConstraints:\n1. Quantity_A + Quantity_B <= 100 (daily production capacity)\n2. Quantity_A >= 0\n3. Quantity_B >= 0\n\nNow, we will implement the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal production quantity for each product type.\n\n1. Initialize the solution randomly, for example, Quantity_A = 50 and Quantity_B = 50.\n2. Set the initial temperature T and the cooling rate alpha.\n3. Repeat the following steps until the stopping criteria are met:\n   a. Generate a random neighboring solution by slightly changing the current solution.\n   b. Calculate the change in the objective function (delta_profit) between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n   c. If delta_profit > 0, accept the neighboring solution as the new current solution.\n   d. If delta_profit <= 0, accept the neighboring solution with a probability of exp(delta_profit / T).\n   e. Update the temperature T = alpha * T.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain the optimal production quantity for each product type that maximizes the company's daily profit. Note that the result may vary depending on the initial solution, temperature, cooling rate, and stopping criteria. The simulated annealing method is a heuristic optimization technique, and it may not always guarantee the global optimum. However, it is useful for solving complex optimization problems with a large search space."
