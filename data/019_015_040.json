    "message_2": "In type theory, we can represent numbers using the Peano axioms. The successor of a number is represented as S(n), where n is the number. So, the successor of 7 would be S(7).\n\nNow, to find the square of the successor of 7, we need to multiply S(7) by itself:\n\nS(7) * S(7)\n\nHowever, type theory is not well-suited for arithmetic operations like multiplication. It is more focused on the logical and structural aspects of mathematics. To find the square of the successor of 7, it would be more appropriate to use standard arithmetic:\n\nThe successor of 7 is 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nThe square of 8 is 8 * 8 = 64.\n\nSo, the square of the successor of 7 is 64."
