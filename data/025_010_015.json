    "message_2": "To find the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials on X that have a pole of order at most 3 at P, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, we are interested in holomorphic differentials with a pole of order at most 3 at P. Let D = 3P, so deg(D) = 3. The canonical divisor K is associated with the space of holomorphic differentials on X, and since X has genus 3, we know that deg(K) = 2g - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, we want to find l(D), the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of D. We can use the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(K - 3P) = 3 + 1 - 3\nl(D) - l(4P - 3P) = 1\nl(D) - l(P) = 1\n\nTo find l(P), we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem again with D = P:\n\nl(P) - l(K - P) = deg(P) + 1 - g\nl(P) - l(4P - P) = 1 + 1 - 3\nl(P) - l(3P) = -1\n\nSince l(P) and l(3P) are non-negative integers (dimensions of vector spaces), the only possibility is that l(P) = 0 and l(3P) = 1. This means that there are no non-constant meromorphic functions with a pole of order at most 1 at P.\n\nNow, we can find l(D):\n\nl(D) = l(3P) = 1\n\nSo, there is only 1 linearly independent holomorphic differential on X that has a pole of order at most 3 at P."
