We'll start with λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ1 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n[[3 - (7 + √65)/2, 2], [5, 2 - (7 + √65)/2]]\n\nSimplify the matrix:\n\n[[-(√65 - 1)/2, 2], [5, -(√65 - 1)/2]]\n\nNow we need to solve the system of linear equations:\n\n-(√65 - 1)/2 * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\n5 * x1 - (√65 - 1)/2 * x2 = 0\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 5 and add the two equations:\n\n5 * (-(√65 - 1)/2 * x1 + 2 * x2) = 0\n-(5√65 - 5)/2 * x1 + 10 * x2 = 0\n\nAdding the equations:\n\n(5√65 - 5)/2 * x1 = 0\n\nSince x1 cannot be zero (otherwise it would not be an eigenvector), we have:\n\nx1 = 2\nx2 = (√65 - 1)/2\n\nSo the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 is:\n\nv1 = [2, (√65 - 1)/2]\n\nNow we'll find the eigenvector for λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n\nSubstitute λ2 into the matrix A - λI:\n\n[[3 - (7 - √65)/2, 2], [5, 2 - (7 - √65)/2]]\n\nSimplify the matrix:\n\n[[(√65 + 1)/2, 2], [5, (√65 + 1)/2]]\n\nNow we need to solve the system of linear equations:\n\n(√65 + 1)/2 * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\n5 * x1 + (√65 + 1)/2 * x2 = 0\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 5 and subtract the two equations:\n\n5 * ((√65 + 1)/2 * x1 + 2 * x2) = 0\n(5√65 + 5)/2 * x1 + 10 * x2 = 0\n\nSubtracting the equations:\n\n(5√65 + 5)/2 * x1 = 0\n\nSince x1 cannot be zero (otherwise it would not be an eigenvector), we have:\n\nx1 = -2\nx2 = (√65 + 1)/2\n\nSo the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 is:\n\nv2 = [-2, (√65 + 1)/2]\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = (7 + √65)/2, Eigenvector v1 = [2, (√65 - 1)/2]\nEigenvalue λ2 = (7 - √65)/2, Eigenvector v2 = [-2, (√65 + 1)/2]"
