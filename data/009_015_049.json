    "message_1": "If a radioactive sample has an initial mass of 400 g and a half-life of 5.5 years, what will be the mass of the sample after 16.5 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 400 g, the half-life is 5.5 years, and the time elapsed is 16.5 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/2)^(16.5 / 5.5)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the exponent:\n\n16.5 / 5.5 = 3\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/2)^3\n\nNext, we need to calculate (1/2)^3:\n\n(1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nFinally, we can multiply the initial mass by this value:\n\nFinal mass = 400 * 1/8 = 50\n\nSo, the mass of the radioactive sample after 16.5 years will be 50 grams."
