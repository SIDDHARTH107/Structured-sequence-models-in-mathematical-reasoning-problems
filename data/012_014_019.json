    "message_2": "To determine if the two graphs are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the first graph as A, B, C, D, E, and F, and the vertices of the second graph as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nFirst, we can observe that both graphs have the same number of vertices (6) and the same number of edges (7). Now, let's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nGraph 1:\n- Degree of A: 2\n- Degree of B: 3\n- Degree of C: 3\n- Degree of D: 2\n- Degree of E: 3\n- Degree of F: 2\n\nGraph 2:\n- Degree of 1: 2\n- Degree of 2: 3\n- Degree of 3: 3\n- Degree of 4: 2\n- Degree of 5: 3\n- Degree of 6: 2\n\nThe degree sequences of both graphs are the same, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism. Now, let's try to find an isomorphism between the two graphs.\n\nWe can start by mapping the vertices with degree 3 in both graphs. Let's map vertex B in graph 1 to vertex 2 in graph 2, vertex C to vertex 3, and vertex E to vertex 5. Now, we need to find a mapping for the remaining vertices (A, D, and F) that preserves adjacency.\n\nWe can map vertex A in graph 1 to vertex 1 in graph 2 since both have degree 2 and are connected to vertices with degree 3 (B and E in graph 1, and 2 and 5 in graph 2). Similarly, we can map vertex D in graph 1 to vertex 4 in graph 2, and vertex F in graph 1 to vertex 6 in graph 2.\n\nSo, the isomorphism between the two graphs can be represented as follows:\n\nA -> 1\nB -> 2\nC -> 3\nD -> 4\nE -> 5\nF -> 6\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency between the vertices, and therefore, the two graphs are isomorphic."
