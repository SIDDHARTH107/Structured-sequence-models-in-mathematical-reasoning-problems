    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 84 and 36 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (84) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n   84 รท 36 = 2 with a remainder of 12.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (84) with the smaller number (36), and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\n3. Repeat step 1 with the new numbers.\n   36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, we have found the GCD. The greatest common divisor of 84 and 36 is 12."
