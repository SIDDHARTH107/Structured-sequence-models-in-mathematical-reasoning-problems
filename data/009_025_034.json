Find the price of a European call option with a strike price of $55 and an expiration date of one year, using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we need to calculate the following variables:\n\n1. d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ^2/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\n2. d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n3. Call option price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nWhere:\nS = current stock price ($50)\nK = strike price ($55)\nr = risk-free interest rate (0.04)\nσ = volatility (0.25)\nT = time to expiration in years (1)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nln(x) = natural logarithm of x\n\nLet's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(50/55) + (0.04 + (0.25^2)/2) * 1) / (0.25 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (ln(0.9091) + (0.04 + 0.03125) * 1) / (0.25 * 1)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.07125) / 0.25\nd1 = -0.02405 / 0.25\nd1 = -0.0962\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.0962 - 0.25 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.0962 - 0.25\nd2 = -0.3462\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). We can use a standard normal distribution table or an online calculator to find these values:\n\nN(d1) = N(-0.0962) = 0.4617\nN(d2) = N(-0.3462) = 0.3645\n\nFinally, let's calculate the call option price:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\nCall option price = 50 * 0.4617 - 55 * e^(-0.04 * 1) * 0.3645\nCall option price = 23.085 - 55 * e^(-0.04) * 0.3645\nCall option price = 23.085 - 55 * 0.9608 * 0.3645\nCall option price = 23.085 - 19.3121\nCall option price = $3.7729\n\nTherefore, the price of a European call option with a strike price of $55 and an expiration date of one year is approximately $3.77."
