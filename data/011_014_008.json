    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve in the field of Graph Theory:\n\n\"Suppose there are 5 vertices in a graph, labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. How many different ways can you connect these vertices with edges if every vertex must be connected to every other vertex exactly once?\" \n\nThe answer is 5 because there are only 5 possible edges in this scenario.",
    "message_2": "The given answer is incorrect. The problem is asking for the number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex exactly once.\n\nTo find the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, n = 5, so the number of edges is:\n\nNumber of edges = 5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different ways to connect the 5 vertices with edges if every vertex must be connected to every other vertex exactly once."
