    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (Laplace's equation) with the given boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nSubstitute this into the Laplace's equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $x$ and the right side is a function of $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n2) $Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0$\n\nSolve the first equation for $X(x)$:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(0, y) = 0$ and $u(\\pi, y) = 0$:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n$X(\\pi) = A\\cos(k\\pi) + B\\sin(k\\pi) = B\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $B\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$, we have non-trivial solutions when $k = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Thus, $X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(nx)$.\n\nNow, solve the second equation for $Y(y)$:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(ny) + D\\sinh(ny)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(x, 0) = 1$ and $u(x, \\pi) = 0$:\n\n$Y(0) = C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = C = 1$\n$Y(\\pi) = \\cosh(n\\pi) + D\\sinh(n\\pi) = 0$\n\nSolve for $D$:\n\n$D = -\\frac{\\cosh(n\\pi)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(nx)\\left(\\cosh(ny) - \\frac{\\cosh(n\\pi)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}\\sinh(ny)\\right)$\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = 1$, we need to find the coefficients $B_n$:\n\n$1 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(nx)$\n\nWe can use the Fourier sine series to find $B_n$:\n\n$B_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(nx) dx = \\begin{cases} 2 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\end{cases}$\n\nFinally, the solution to the partial differential equation for $u(x, y)$ is:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n \\text{ odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n}\\sin(nx)\\left(\\cosh(ny) - \\frac{\\cosh(n\\pi)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}\\sinh(ny)\\right)$"
