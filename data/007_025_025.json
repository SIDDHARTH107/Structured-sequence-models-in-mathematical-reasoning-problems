    "message_1": "Suppose the prime number `p` is `23` and the base `g` is `5`. If Alice chooses a secret number `a` as `6` and Bob's secret number is `15`, what is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use to encrypt and decrypt their communication using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the base, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If the algorithm works correctly, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nNow, let's compute the shared secret key using the given values:\n\n1. A = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\n2. B = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n3. K_A = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\n4. K_B = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 2. Alice and Bob will use this key to encrypt and decrypt their communication."
