    "message_2": "To solve the equation $3^{2x+1} = 27$, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 27 as a power of 3. Since $3^3 = 27$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$3^{2x+1} = 3^3$\n\nStep 2: Since the bases are equal (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n$2x+1 = 3$\n\nStep 3: Solve for x. Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$2x = 2$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\n$x = 1$\n\nSo, the solution for x is 1."
