    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to estimate the average age of their employees. They have a total of 500 employees, but they cannot survey all of them due to resource constraints. How many employees should they survey if they want a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 2 years?",
    "message_2": "To determine the sample size needed for a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 2 years, we can use the formula:\n\nn = (Z^2 * σ^2) / E^2\n\nwhere:\nn = sample size\nZ = Z-score (1.96 for a 95% confidence interval)\nσ = population standard deviation (unknown)\nE = margin of error (2 years)\n\nSince we don't know the population standard deviation (σ), we can use an estimate or a conservative approach by assuming the maximum possible standard deviation. In this case, let's assume a conservative standard deviation of half the range of possible ages. If we assume the age range of employees is between 18 and 65 years, the range is 47 years, and half of that is 23.5 years.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 23.5^2) / 2^2\nn = (3.8416 * 552.25) / 4\nn = 2119.1044 / 4\nn = 529.7761\n\nSince we cannot survey a fraction of an employee, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company should survey at least 530 employees to achieve a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 2 years."
