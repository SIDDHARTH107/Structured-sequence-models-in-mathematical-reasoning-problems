    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, specifically in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and 131071, corresponding to n values of 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, and 17.\n\nThe 7th Mersenne prime number corresponds to the next prime value of n. That prime number is 19. Therefore, the 7th Mersenne prime is:\n\nM_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524288 - 1 = 524287\n\nSo, the 7th Mersenne prime number is 524,287."
