    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x-4) - log(x+4) = 1, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b) to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation:\n\nlog((x-4)/(x+4)) = 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form to eliminate the logarithm:\n\n10^1 = (x-4)/(x+4)\n\n10 = (x-4)/(x+4)\n\nNext, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (x+4) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n10(x+4) = x-4\n\nNow, distribute the 10 on the left side:\n\n10x + 40 = x - 4\n\nNow, subtract x from both sides to isolate the x terms:\n\n9x + 40 = -4\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides to isolate the x term:\n\n9x = -44\n\nFinally, divide by 9 to solve for x:\n\nx = -44/9"
