    "message_1": "A hot-air balloon is flying at a height of 500 feet above the ground. A person on the ground is looking up at the balloon at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. What is the horizontal distance between the person and the hot-air balloon?",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation, the horizontal distance (x), and the vertical distance (500 feet) in a right triangle.\n\ntan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and the opposite side is the height of the hot-air balloon (500 feet). We want to find the adjacent side, which is the horizontal distance between the person and the hot-air balloon.\n\ntan(60) = 500 / x\n\nTo find x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 500 / tan(60)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of the tangent of 60 degrees. The tangent of 60 degrees is √3 (approximately 1.732).\n\nx = 500 / 1.732\n\nx ≈ 288.68 feet\n\nSo, the horizontal distance between the person and the hot-air balloon is approximately 288.68 feet."
