    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the properties:\n\n1. log_a(x) + log_a(y) = log_a(xy)\n2. log_a(x) - log_a(y) = log_a(x/y)\n\nApplying these properties, we get:\n\nlog base 4 (64) + log base 4 (16) - log base 4 (2) = log base 4 (64 * 16 / 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\n64 * 16 / 2 = 1024\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\nlog base 4 (1024)\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which we need to raise 4 to get 1024:\n\n4^x = 1024\n\n4^x = 4^5 (since 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 1024)\n\nSo, x = 5.\n\nTherefore, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog base 4 (1024) = 5"
