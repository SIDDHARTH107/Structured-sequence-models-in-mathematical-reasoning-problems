    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the implicit function y^2 + 2x^3 = 5xy, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using implicit differentiation. \n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n2y(dy/dx) + 6x^2 = 5x(dy/dx) + 5y\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n2y(dy/dx) - 5x(dy/dx) = 5y - 6x^2\n(dy/dx)(2y - 5x) = 5y - 6x^2\n\nNow, divide both sides by (2y - 5x) to isolate dy/dx:\ndy/dx = (5y - 6x^2) / (2y - 5x)\n\nNow, we will plug in the given values of x = 2 and y = 3 into the equation:\ndy/dx = (5(3) - 6(2)^2) / (2(3) - 5(2))\ndy/dx = (15 - 24) / (6 - 10)\ndy/dx = (-9) / (-4)\n\nSo, the derivative of the implicit function when x = 2 and y = 3 is:\ndy/dx = 9/4"
