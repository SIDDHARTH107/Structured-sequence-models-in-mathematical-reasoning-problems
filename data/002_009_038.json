    "message_2": "To calculate the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe surface area of one circular base can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nFor our cylinder, the radius is 4 cm. So, the area of one circular base is:\n\nArea = π * (4 cm)^2 = π * 16 cm^2 ≈ 50.27 cm^2\n\nSince there are two circular bases, we need to multiply this area by 2:\n\nTotal area of circular bases = 2 * 50.27 cm^2 ≈ 100.53 cm^2\n\nNext, we need to calculate the lateral surface area of the cylinder. The lateral surface area can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLateral surface area = 2 * π * r * h\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nFor our cylinder, the radius is 4 cm and the height is 7 cm. So, the lateral surface area is:\n\nLateral surface area = 2 * π * (4 cm) * (7 cm) = 56π cm^2 ≈ 175.93 cm^2\n\nNow, we can add the total area of the circular bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cylinder:\n\nTotal surface area = 100.53 cm^2 + 175.93 cm^2 ≈ 276.46 cm^2\n\nThe total surface area of the cylinder is approximately 276.46 square centimeters."
