    "message_2": "To find the cross product of vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nC = A x B = [(A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y), (A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z), (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)]\n\nwhere A_x, A_y, and A_z are the components of vector A, and B_x, B_y, and B_z are the components of vector B.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nC = [(4 * -2 - 1 * 2), (1 * 1 - 3 * -2), (3 * 2 - 4 * 1)]\nC = [-8 - 2, 1 + 6, 6 - 4]\nC = [-10, 7, 2]\n\nSo, the cross product C = [-10, 7, 2].\n\nNow, to find the magnitude of the cross product, we use the formula:\n\n|C| = sqrt(C_x^2 + C_y^2 + C_z^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n|C| = sqrt((-10)^2 + 7^2 + 2^2)\n|C| = sqrt(100 + 49 + 4)\n|C| = sqrt(153)\n\nThe magnitude of the cross product is |C| = sqrt(153).\n\nFor the direction, the cross product is already represented as a vector C = [-10, 7, 2]."
