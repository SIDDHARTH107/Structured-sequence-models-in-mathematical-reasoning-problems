    "message_1": "A landscaping company needs to purchase fertilizer and weed killer for its clients' lawns. The company has a budget of $500 and wants to cover at least 10 lawns. The cost of fertilizing each lawn is $30 and the cost of applying weed killer to each lawn is $25. The effectiveness of the weed killer is at least 80% if it is applied with the fertilizer, and at most 50% if it is applied separately. The effectiveness of the fertilizer is not affected by the weed killer. What is the minimum amount of fertilizer and weed killer the company should purchase to meet the requirements and minimize cost?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of lawns treated with both fertilizer and weed killer as x and the number of lawns treated with only weed killer as y. We need to minimize the cost while meeting the requirements.\n\nThe cost equation is:\nCost = 30x + 25y\n\nThe budget constraint is:\n30x + 25y ≤ 500\n\nThe requirement to cover at least 10 lawns is:\nx + y ≥ 10\n\nThe effectiveness constraint for weed killer is:\n0.8x + 0.5y ≥ 0.8(10) = 8\n\nNow we need to minimize the cost equation while satisfying these constraints.\n\nFirst, let's solve the budget constraint for y:\ny ≤ (500 - 30x) / 25\n\nNow, let's solve the effectiveness constraint for y:\ny ≥ (8 - 0.8x) / 0.5\n\nSince we want to minimize the cost, we will start by checking the minimum value of x that satisfies the constraints. If x = 0, then from the effectiveness constraint, y ≥ 16, which is not possible within the budget constraint. Therefore, x cannot be 0.\n\nNow let's try x = 1:\ny ≤ (500 - 30) / 25 = 18.8\ny ≥ (8 - 0.8) / 0.5 = 14.4\n\nIn this case, we can choose y = 14.4 (rounded up to 15) to satisfy the constraints. The cost will be:\nCost = 30(1) + 25(15) = 30 + 375 = $405\n\nSince we have found a solution that meets the requirements and is within the budget, the minimum amount of fertilizer and weed killer the company should purchase is for 1 lawn with both fertilizer and weed killer and 15 lawns with only weed killer, with a total cost of $405."
