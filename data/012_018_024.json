    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. In a complete graph with n vertices, like the one described, there are n-1 edges connected to each vertex.\n\nIn this case, the graph has 10 vertices, so each vertex has 9 edges connected to it. To disconnect the graph, we need to remove at least 9 edges, which will isolate one vertex from the rest of the graph. Therefore, the edge connectivity of this graph is 9."
