    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation sqrt(4x+1) = 7, follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n(sqrt(4x+1))^2 = 7^2\n\n2. Simplify the equation.\n4x + 1 = 49\n\n3. Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation.\n4x = 48\n\n4. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x.\nx = 12\n\nSo, the solution is x = 12."
