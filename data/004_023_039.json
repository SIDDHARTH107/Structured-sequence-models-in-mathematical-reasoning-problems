    "message_2": "First, we need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 - 2x = 0\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions: x = 0 and x = 2. These are the x-coordinates of the intersection points. We can find the corresponding y-coordinates by plugging these values back into either of the original equations. Let's use y = 2x:\n\ny = 2(0) = 0\ny = 2(2) = 4\n\nSo, the points of intersection are (0, 0) and (2, 4).\n\nNow, we can find the area bounded by these curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we first find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n∫(2x - x^2) dx = x^2 - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n\nArea = (x^2 - (1/3)x^3)| from 0 to 2\nArea = [(2^2 - (1/3)(2^3)) - (0^2 - (1/3)(0^3))]\nArea = [(4 - (8/3)) - (0)]\nArea = (4 - 8/3)\nArea = (4/3)\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x till their intersection point is 4/3 square units."
