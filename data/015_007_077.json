    "message_2": "To find the value of x₆₈, we need to iterate the logistic map equation 68 times, starting with x₀ = 0.4 and r = 3.7. We can do this using a loop:\n\nx = 0.4\nr = 3.7\n\nfor i in range(68):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nAfter 68 iterations, the value of x will be x₆₈. Calculating this, we get:\n\nx₆₈ ≈ 0.368216"
