    "message_1": "A substitution cipher is created by exchanging each letter in the alphabet with another letter. In a particular cipher, the letter \"C\" is replaced with \"R\" and the letter \"H\" is replaced with \"M\". If the message \"CIPHER TEXT\" is encrypted using this cipher, what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"CIPHER TEXT\" using the given substitution cipher, we need to replace each letter with its corresponding letter in the cipher. However, we only have information about the substitution of the letters \"C\" and \"H\". Without knowing the substitutions for the other letters in the message, it is impossible to provide the complete encrypted message."
