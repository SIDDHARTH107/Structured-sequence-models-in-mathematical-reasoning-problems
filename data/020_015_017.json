    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular field be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we have 200 meters of fencing, we can write the equation as:\n\n200 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum area of the field. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nOur goal is to maximize this area. To do this, we can first solve the perimeter equation for one of the variables, say L:\n\nL = (200 - 2W) / 2\nL = 100 - W\n\nNow, substitute this expression for L into the area equation:\n\nArea = (100 - W) * W\nArea = 100W - W^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dW = 100 - 2W = 0\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\n2W = 100\nW = 50\n\nNow, substitute this value of W back into the expression for L:\n\nL = 100 - 50\nL = 50\n\nSo, the maximum area occurs when the length and width are both 50 meters. The maximum area of the field is:\n\nArea = L * W\nArea = 50 * 50\nArea = 2500 square meters"
