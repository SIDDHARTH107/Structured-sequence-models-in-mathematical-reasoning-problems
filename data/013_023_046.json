If Player B reciprocates the trust, the entire amount is doubled and split equally between the two players. However, if Player B does not reciprocate the trust, Player A loses the 10 dollars and Player B gains it. What is the expected value of the game for Player A if Player B reciprocates trust with a probability of 0.6?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value for Player A, we need to consider both possible outcomes: Player B reciprocating trust and Player B not reciprocating trust.\n\n1. If Player B reciprocates trust (probability = 0.6):\nPlayer A and Player B will each receive half of the doubled amount (10 dollars * 2 = 20 dollars). So, Player A will have their initial 10 dollars plus the additional 10 dollars from the split, totaling 20 dollars.\n\n2. If Player B does not reciprocate trust (probability = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4):\nPlayer A will lose the 10 dollars they trusted to Player B, leaving them with only 10 dollars.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value for Player A:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of reciprocating trust * Value if trust is reciprocated) + (Probability of not reciprocating trust * Value if trust is not reciprocated)\n\nExpected Value = (0.6 * 20) + (0.4 * 10)\n\nExpected Value = 12 + 4 = 16\n\nThe expected value of the game for Player A is 16 dollars."
