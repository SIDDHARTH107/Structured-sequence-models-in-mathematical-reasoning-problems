    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |      x = | x |      b = | 14 |\n    | 2  5  5 |          | y |          | 32 |\n    | 3  5  8 |          | z |          | 46 |\n\nNow, we will perform the Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The goal is to find a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T such that A = LL^T.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the elements of the first row and column of L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 3 / 1 = 3\n\nStep 2: Calculate the elements of the second row and column of L:\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(5 - 2^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (5 - 3 * 2) / 1 = -1\n\nStep 3: Calculate the elements of the third row and column of L:\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(8 - 3^2 - (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)\n\nNow we have the lower triangular matrix L:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 3 -1  sqrt(2) |\n\nAnd its transpose L^T:\n\nL^T = | 1  2  3       |\n      | 0  1 -1       |\n      | 0  0  sqrt(2) |\n\nNow we need to solve the system of equations LL^Tx = b.\n\nStep 4: Solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 14 |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 32 |\n| 3 -1  sqrt(2) | | y3 |   | 46 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 14\ny2 = 32 - 2 * 14 = 4\ny3 = (46 - 3 * 14 + 1 * 4) / sqrt(2) = 2 * sqrt(2)\n\nStep 5: Solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n| 1  2  3       | | x |   | 14       |\n| 0  1 -1       | | y | = |  4       |\n| 0  0  sqrt(2) | | z |   | 2*sqrt(2) |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nz = 2 * sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) = 2\ny = 4 + 1 * 2 = 6\nx = 14 - 2 * 6 - 3 * 2 = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2\ny = 6\nz = 2"
