    "message_1": "A 1 meter long iron rod is initially at a temperature of 100°C. The left end of the rod is then immersed in an ice bath at 0°C, while the right end is maintained at a constant temperature of 200°C. Use Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform to determine the temperature at any point along the rod after 60 seconds, given that the thermal diffusivity of iron is 0.835 x 10^-5 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material (0.835 x 10^-5 m²/s for iron).\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. T(0,t) = 0°C (left end in ice bath)\n2. T(1,t) = 200°C (right end maintained at 200°C)\n3. T(x,0) = 100°C (initial temperature of the rod)\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume a solution of the form T(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) ∂T(t) / ∂t = α T(t) ∂²X(x) / ∂x²\n\nDivide both sides by αXT:\n\n(1/α) (∂T(t) / ∂t) / T(t) = (∂²X(x) / ∂x²) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/α) (∂T(t) / ∂t) / T(t) = -λ²\n(∂²X(x) / ∂x²) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. (1/α) ∂T(t) / ∂t = -λ²T(t)\n2. ∂²X(x) / ∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nSolve the second equation for X(x):\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx)\n\nApply the boundary conditions T(0,t) = 0 and T(1,t) = 200:\n\nX(0) = B = 0\nX(1) = A sin(λ) = 200\n\nThe solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = 200 sin(λx) / sin(λ)\n\nNow, solve the first equation for T(t):\n\nT(t) = C exp(-αλ²t)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ (200 sin(λn x) / sin(λn)) Cn exp(-αλn²t)\n\nApply the initial condition T(x,0) = 100:\n\n100 = Σ (200 sin(λn x) / sin(λn)) Cn\n\nTo find the coefficients Cn, we can use Fourier sine series:\n\nCn = (2/L) ∫[0,L] T(x,0) sin(λn x) dx\n\nwhere L = 1 m is the length of the rod. Calculate Cn:\n\nCn = 2 ∫[0,1] 100 sin(λn x) dx\n\nIntegrate and simplify:\n\nCn = (200/λn) (1 - cos(λn))\n\nNow, we have the temperature distribution along the rod after 60 seconds:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ (200 sin(λn x) / sin(λn)) ((200/λn) (1 - cos(λn))) exp(-αλn²t)\n\nPlug in the values for α and t:\n\nT(x,60) = Σ (200 sin(λn x) / sin(λn)) ((200/λn) (1 - cos(λn))) exp(-0.835 x 10^-5 λn² * 60)\n\nThis infinite series will give the temperature at any point x along the rod after 60 seconds. To get an approximate value, you can truncate the series after a few terms."
