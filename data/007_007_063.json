    "message_2": "We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the solution to the equation 5x + 7y = 73.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 1 * 5 + 2\n5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n\nThe GCD of 5 and 7 is 1. Now we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients x and y:\n\n1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n1 = 5 - 2 * (7 - 1 * 5)\n1 = 3 * 5 - 2 * 7\n\nSo, x = 3 and y = -2 is a solution to the equation 5x + 7y = 73.\n\nHowever, since we are looking for integer solutions, we can find other solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of the LCM(5, 7) to x and y:\n\nLCM(5, 7) = 35\n\nAdding 35 to x and subtracting 35 from y:\n\nx = 3 + 35 = 38\ny = -2 - 35 = -37\n\nSo, another integer solution is x = 38 and y = -37."
