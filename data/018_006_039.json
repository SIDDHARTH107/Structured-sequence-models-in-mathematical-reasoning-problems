    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set consisting of integers between -10 and 10 (inclusive). Let A be the set of even numbers between -10 and 0 (inclusive). What is the complement of set A and what is the set obtained by taking the union of set A and its complement? Show that this union is equal to the set U.",
    "message_2": "First, let's list the elements of the sets.\n\nU = {-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nA = {-10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 0}\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nA' = {-9, -7, -5, -3, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either of the two sets.\n\nA ∪ A' = {-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A' contains all the elements of the universal set U. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\nA ∪ A' = U"
