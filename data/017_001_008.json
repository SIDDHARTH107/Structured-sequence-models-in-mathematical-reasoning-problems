    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider two cases: G has an element of order 4, or G does not have an element of order 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet g be an element in G with order 4. Then, the powers of g are {g^0, g^1, g^2, g^3}, which are all distinct since g has order 4. Since G has 4 elements, G = {g^0, g^1, g^2, g^3}. Thus, G is generated by g, and G is a cyclic group of order 4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 4.\nSince G has order 4 and does not have an element of order 4, all non-identity elements in G must have order 2. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are distinct elements of order 2. Then, a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. Since a and b are distinct and have order 2, ab â‰  e, a, or b. Therefore, ab = c. Similarly, we can show that bc = a and ac = b. Thus, G has the following operation table:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a e c b\nb b c e a\nc c b a e\n```\n\nThis operation table corresponds to the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
