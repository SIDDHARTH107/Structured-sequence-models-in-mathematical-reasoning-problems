    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the law of cosines and the law of sines. First, let's represent the given information in a triangle. Let A be the starting point (the dock), B be the point after the first 4 km, and C be the final position of the boat. The angle at A is 110° - 35° = 75°. The side AB is 4 km, and the side BC is 6 km.\n\nWe want to find the distance AC and the bearing of the boat from the dock.\n\nStep 1: Find the angle at B.\nWe can use the law of sines to find the angle at B.\n\nsin(A) / a = sin(B) / b\nsin(75°) / 6 = sin(B) / 4\n\nsin(B) = (4 * sin(75°)) / 6\nsin(B) ≈ 0.896\nB ≈ sin^(-1)(0.896)\nB ≈ 64.1°\n\nStep 2: Find the angle at C.\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we can find the angle at C.\n\nC = 180° - A - B\nC = 180° - 75° - 64.1°\nC ≈ 40.9°\n\nStep 3: Find the distance AC.\nNow we can use the law of cosines to find the distance AC.\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\nc^2 = 4^2 + 6^2 - 2 * 4 * 6 * cos(40.9°)\nc^2 ≈ 52.96\nc ≈ √52.96\nc ≈ 7.28 km\n\nSo, the distance of the boat from the dock is approximately 7.28 km.\n\nStep 4: Find the bearing of the boat from the dock.\nTo find the bearing, we can use the angle at A and the angle at B.\n\nBearing = 35° + (180° - (A + B))\nBearing = 35° + (180° - (75° + 64.1°))\nBearing ≈ 35° + 40.9°\nBearing ≈ 75.9°\n\nThe bearing of the boat from the dock is approximately 75.9°.\n\nIn conclusion, the boat is approximately 7.28 km away from the dock, and its bearing from the dock is approximately 75.9°."
