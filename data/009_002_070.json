    "message_1": "Consider a population of 5000 individuals where a contagious disease is spreading at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals. The disease started with 10 infected individuals and the rate of transmission is estimated to be 0.05. Assuming no one recovers or dies, write a differential equation to model this scenario and determine the total number of infected individuals after 5 days.",
    "message_2": "Let I(t) be the number of infected individuals at time t (in days). Since the rate of transmission is proportional to the number of infected individuals, we can write the differential equation as:\n\ndI/dt = k * I(t)\n\nwhere k is the rate of transmission, which is given as 0.05.\n\nNow, we need to solve this differential equation with the initial condition I(0) = 10 (since there were initially 10 infected individuals).\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution is given by:\n\nI(t) = I(0) * e^(kt)\n\nPlugging in the initial condition and the rate of transmission:\n\nI(t) = 10 * e^(0.05t)\n\nNow, we want to find the total number of infected individuals after 5 days, so we need to evaluate I(5):\n\nI(5) = 10 * e^(0.05 * 5)\nI(5) = 10 * e^(0.25)\nI(5) ≈ 10 * 1.284\nI(5) ≈ 12.84\n\nAfter 5 days, there will be approximately 12.84 infected individuals. Since we cannot have a fraction of an individual, we can round up to 13 infected individuals."
