    "message_1": "A math student is trying to determine the relationship between the number of hours they studied for a statistics exam and their resulting score. They collected the following data: \n\nHours studied (X): 5, 7, 3, 10, 8, 6, 2, 9 \nExam score (Y): 80, 85, 70, 93, 87, 81, 68, 92 \n\nUsing correlation analysis, what is the correlation coefficient between the hours studied and exam scores? Is there a positive or negative correlation between the two variables?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the hours studied and exam scores, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)] / sqrt(Σ(Xi - X_mean)^2 * Σ(Yi - Y_mean)^2)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of X (hours studied) and Y (exam scores).\n\nX_mean = (5 + 7 + 3 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 2 + 9) / 8 = 50 / 8 = 6.25\nY_mean = (80 + 85 + 70 + 93 + 87 + 81 + 68 + 92) / 8 = 656 / 8 = 82\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula.\n\nNumerator:\nΣ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)] = (5-6.25)(80-82) + (7-6.25)(85-82) + (3-6.25)(70-82) + (10-6.25)(93-82) + (8-6.25)(87-82) + (6-6.25)(81-82) + (2-6.25)(68-82) + (9-6.25)(92-82)\n= (-1.25)(-2) + (0.75)(3) + (-3.25)(-12) + (3.75)(11) + (1.75)(5) + (-0.25)(-1) + (-4.25)(-14) + (2.75)(10)\n= 2.5 + 2.25 + 39 + 41.25 + 8.75 + 0.25 + 59.5 + 27.5\n= 180.5\n\nDenominator:\nΣ(Xi - X_mean)^2 = (-1.25)^2 + (0.75)^2 + (-3.25)^2 + (3.75)^2 + (1.75)^2 + (-0.25)^2 + (-4.25)^2 + (2.75)^2\n= 1.5625 + 0.5625 + 10.5625 + 14.0625 + 3.0625 + 0.0625 + 18.0625 + 7.5625\n= 55.5\n\nΣ(Yi - Y_mean)^2 = (-2)^2 + (3)^2 + (-12)^2 + (11)^2 + (5)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-14)^2 + (10)^2\n= 4 + 9 + 144 + 121 + 25 + 1 + 196 + 100\n= 600\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = 180.5 / sqrt(55.5 * 600) = 180.5 / sqrt(33300) = 180.5 / 182.48 ≈ 0.989\n\nThe correlation coefficient is approximately 0.989, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the hours studied and exam scores."
