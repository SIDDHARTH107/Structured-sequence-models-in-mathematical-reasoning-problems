    "message_2": "To prove that the cardinality of the power set of A is greater than the cardinality of set A itself, we first need to find the power set of A and then compare the cardinalities.\n\nA power set is the set of all possible subsets of a given set, including the empty set and the set itself. In this case, the set A = {1, 2}. Let's find the power set of A, denoted as P(A):\n\nP(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}\n\nNow, let's find the cardinalities of A and P(A). The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.\n\n|A| = 2 (since A has two elements: 1 and 2)\n|P(A)| = 4 (since P(A) has four elements: ∅, {1}, {2}, and {1, 2})\n\nNow, we can compare the cardinalities:\n\n|P(A)| > |A|\n4 > 2\n\nSince 4 is greater than 2, we have proven that the cardinality of the power set of A is greater than the cardinality of set A itself."
