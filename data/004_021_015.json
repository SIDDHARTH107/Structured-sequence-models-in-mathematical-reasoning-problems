    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the particle at time t = 3 seconds, we need to find the second derivative of the position function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, which represents the velocity of the particle:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (4x^4 - 5x^3 + 2x - 7)\nf'(x) = 16x^3 - 15x^2 + 2\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, which represents the acceleration of the particle:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (16x^3 - 15x^2 + 2)\nf''(x) = 48x^2 - 30x\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the acceleration function at x = 3:\n\nf''(3) = 48(3)^2 - 30(3)\nf''(3) = 48(9) - 90\nf''(3) = 432 - 90\nf''(3) = 342\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at time t = 3 seconds is 342 units per second squared."
