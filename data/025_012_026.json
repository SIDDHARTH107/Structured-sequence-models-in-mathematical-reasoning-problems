    "message_2": "An elliptic curve over the field of rational numbers is defined by an equation of the form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B\n\nwhere A and B are rational numbers. We are given three points on the curve: (0, 0), (2, 3), and (5, 1). We can use these points to find the coefficients A and B.\n\n1. For the point (0, 0):\n0^2 = 0^3 + A*0 + B\n0 = B\n\n2. For the point (2, 3):\n3^2 = 2^3 + A*2 + 0\n9 = 8 + 2A\nA = 1/2\n\n3. For the point (5, 1):\n1^2 = 5^3 + (1/2)*5 + 0\n1 = 125 + 5/2\n1/2 = 120\nThis contradicts the given point (5, 1). Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement, as the given points and conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nHowever, if we ignore the point (5, 1) and only consider the points (0, 0) and (2, 3), we can find an elliptic curve equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + (1/2)x\n\nNow, we need to find a point of order 6 on this curve. Let's call this point P. Since the order of P is 6, the following properties hold:\n\n2P ≠ O (O is the point at infinity)\n3P ≠ O\n6P = O\n\nFinding a point of order 6 on an elliptic curve is not a straightforward process and usually requires trial and error or more advanced techniques. However, without the correct points and conditions, we cannot proceed further.\n\nIn conclusion, the given problem statement seems to have an error, and it is not possible to find an elliptic curve satisfying all the given conditions."
