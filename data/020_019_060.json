    "message_1": "A car travels along a straight road with a velocity given by the function $v(t) = 3 t^2 - 12 t + 15$, where $t$ is measured in seconds and $v$ is measured in meters per second. The car uses fuel at a rate proportional to the cube of its speed, that is, $f(v) = k v^3$, where $k$ is a positive constant. Find the time at which the car consumes the least amount of fuel, and the amount of fuel consumed during this time.",
    "message_2": "To find the time at which the car consumes the least amount of fuel, we need to find the minimum of the fuel consumption function. First, we need to express the fuel consumption function in terms of time, $t$. Since $v(t) = 3t^2 - 12t + 15$, we can write the fuel consumption function as:\n\n$f(t) = k(3t^2 - 12t + 15)^3$\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of this function by taking its derivative with respect to time, $t$, and setting it equal to zero:\n\n$f'(t) = k \\cdot 3(3t^2 - 12t + 15)^2 \\cdot (6t - 12)$\n\nSetting $f'(t) = 0$, we get:\n\n$k \\cdot 3(3t^2 - 12t + 15)^2 \\cdot (6t - 12) = 0$\n\nSince $k$ is a positive constant, it does not affect the critical points. Thus, we can ignore it and focus on the other factors:\n\n$(3t^2 - 12t + 15)^2 \\cdot (6t - 12) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two factors. The first factor, $(3t^2 - 12t + 15)^2$, is always non-negative, so it does not affect the critical points. We can focus on the second factor:\n\n$6t - 12 = 0$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t = \\frac{12}{6} = 2$\n\nSo, the car consumes the least amount of fuel at $t = 2$ seconds.\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of fuel consumed at this time. We can use the fuel consumption function, $f(t)$:\n\n$f(2) = k(3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 15)^3$\n\n$f(2) = k(3(4) - 24 + 15)^3$\n\n$f(2) = k(-3)^3$\n\n$f(2) = -27k$\n\nSince $k$ is a positive constant, the amount of fuel consumed at $t = 2$ seconds is $-27k$. However, fuel consumption cannot be negative, so the minimum fuel consumption is actually 0. This means that at $t = 2$ seconds, the car is momentarily at rest and not consuming any fuel."
