    "message_1": "In a school, the probability of a student passing the math exam is 0.75 and the probability of a student passing the science exam is 0.85. If a student is selected at random from the school, what is the probability that the student will pass both math and science exams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a student passing both math and science exams, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of passing each exam. \n\nProbability of passing both exams = Probability of passing math exam × Probability of passing science exam\n\nProbability of passing both exams = 0.75 × 0.85 = 0.6375\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student will pass both math and science exams is 0.6375 or 63.75%."
