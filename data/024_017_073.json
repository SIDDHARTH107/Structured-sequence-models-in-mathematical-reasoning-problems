    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 2t) when t = pi/3, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve at any time t. This can be found by taking the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2)\n\nNow, we need to normalize the tangent vector T(t) to get the unit tangent vector:\n\n|T(t)| = sqrt((-sin(t))^2 + (cos(t))^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5)\n\nThe unit tangent vector is then:\n\nT_hat(t) = (1/sqrt(5))(-sin(t), cos(t), 2)\n\nAt t = pi/3, the unit tangent vector is:\n\nT_hat(pi/3) = (1/sqrt(5))(-sin(pi/3), cos(pi/3), 2) = (1/sqrt(5))(-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the component of the vector v that is orthogonal to the tangent vector T_hat(pi/3). We can do this by projecting v onto T_hat(pi/3) and then subtracting the result from v:\n\nv_parallel = (v Â· T_hat(pi/3)) * T_hat(pi/3)\n\nv_parallel = ((-1)(-sqrt(3)/2) + (-2)(1/2) + (3)(2)) * (1/sqrt(5))(-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 2)\n\nv_parallel = (sqrt(3)/2 - 1 + 6) * (1/sqrt(5))(-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 2)\n\nv_parallel = (5.5 + sqrt(3)/2) * (1/sqrt(5))(-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 2)\n\nNow, we have the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 2t) when t = pi/3:\n\nv_parallel = (5.5 + sqrt(3)/2) * (1/sqrt(5))(-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2, 2)"
