    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In this graph, we can find a Hamiltonian cycle as follows:\n\n1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex 1, so it is a Hamiltonian cycle."
