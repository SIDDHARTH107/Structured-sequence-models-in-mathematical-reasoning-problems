    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the elimination method, we will first eliminate one variable from two of the equations. Let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 10, then subtract the first equation from the second equation.\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n20x + 10y + 6z = 140\n\nSecond equation * 10:\n20x + 100y + 50z = 500\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n90y + 44z = 360  (1)\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from the third equation. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\nFirst equation * 3:\n30x + 15y + 9z = 210\n\nSubtract the first equation from the third equation:\n-12y + z = -135  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n90y + 44z = 360  (1)\n-12y + z = -135  (2)\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 90 and add it to the first equation.\n\nSecond equation * 90:\n-1080y + 90z = -12150\n\nAdd the first equation to the second equation:\n134z = -11790\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\nz = -11790 / 134\nz = -88\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into equation (2) to find the value of y:\n\n-12y + (-88) = -135\n-12y = -47\ny = 47 / 12\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\n10x + 5(47/12) - 3(88) = 70\n10x + 235/12 - 264 = 70\n10x = 70 + 264 - 235/12\n10x = 344/12\nx = 344/120\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 344/120\ny = 47/12\nz = -88"
