    "message_2": "To solve the equation 9x ≡ 1 (mod 7), we first need to simplify the equation using modular arithmetic. \n\n9 ≡ 2 (mod 7) because 9 - 2 = 7, which is divisible by 7.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2x ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 2 (mod 7). In other words, we need to find a number x such that the product of 2 and x is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nSince 7 is a prime number, we can use Wilson's theorem to find the factorial of (7-1) modulo 7:\n\n(7-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 7)\n6! ≡ -1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 6! as the product of the numbers from 1 to 6:\n\n6! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6\n\nSince we are looking for the modular inverse of 2 (mod 7), we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n(1 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6) ≡ -1/2 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of -1/2 (mod 7). Since -1 is congruent to 6 (mod 7), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6) ≡ 6/2 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n(1 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6) ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can see that the product of the numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is congruent to 3 modulo 7. Since we are looking for the modular inverse of 2 (mod 7), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2x ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n2x × 3 ≡ 1 × 3 (mod 7)\n6x ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nSince 6 is congruent to -1 (mod 7), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n-1x ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:\n\nx ≡ -3 (mod 7)\n\nSince -3 is congruent to 4 (mod 7), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 9x ≡ 1 (mod 7) is x ≡ 4 (mod 7)."
