    "message_1": "A company hires an agent to sell a product. The agent's effort has a positive effect on sales, but the agent's payoff also depends on their personal cost (effort). The agent's cost is given by C(e) = e^2/2, where e is the effort level in hours. The company's revenue is given by R(x) = 100x, where x is the number of units sold. The agent can choose an effort level of e = {0,1,2,3} hours. The agent gets to keep 10% of the revenue generated by their effort. What effort level should the agent choose to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the effort level that maximizes the agent's expected profit, we need to consider the relationship between effort and the number of units sold. Let's assume that the number of units sold is directly proportional to the effort level, i.e., x = ke, where k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nNow, the agent's profit (P) can be calculated as the difference between their share of the revenue and their cost:\n\nP(e) = 0.1 * R(x) - C(e)\n\nSubstituting R(x) = 100x and x = ke, we get:\n\nP(e) = 0.1 * 100 * ke - e^2/2\nP(e) = 10ke - e^2/2\n\nNow, we need to find the effort level e that maximizes P(e) for e = {0, 1, 2, 3}. We will calculate the profit for each effort level and compare them.\n\n1. For e = 0:\nP(0) = 10k * 0 - 0^2/2 = 0\n\n2. For e = 1:\nP(1) = 10k * 1 - 1^2/2 = 10k - 1/2\n\n3. For e = 2:\nP(2) = 10k * 2 - 2^2/2 = 20k - 4/2 = 20k - 2\n\n4. For e = 3:\nP(3) = 10k * 3 - 3^2/2 = 30k - 9/2\n\nNow, we need to compare these profits. Since k is a positive constant, the profit increases with the effort level. Therefore, the agent should choose the maximum effort level e = 3 to maximize their expected profit."
