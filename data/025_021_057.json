    "message_1": "Consider a polynomial equation in the two variables $x$ and $y$ given by $xy^3 - 5x^2y - 3x^3 + 15y = 0$. Find the coordinates of the points on the curve where $x = 2$.",
    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the points on the curve where $x = 2$, we substitute $x = 2$ into the given equation:\n\n$(2)y^3 - 5(2)^2y - 3(2)^3 + 15y = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$2y^3 - 20y - 24 + 15y = 0$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n$2y^3 - 5y - 24 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $y$ that satisfy this equation. This is a cubic equation, and finding its roots may not be straightforward. However, we can try to find integer roots by using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient, in this case, the factors of 24 divided by the factors of 2.\n\nThe factors of 24 are: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24\nThe factors of 2 are: ±1, ±2\n\nNow, we test these possible rational roots in the equation:\n\nFor $y = 1$, we have $2(1)^3 - 5(1) - 24 = -27$, which is not zero.\nFor $y = -1$, we have $2(-1)^3 - 5(-1) - 24 = -21$, which is not zero.\nFor $y = 2$, we have $2(2)^3 - 5(2) - 24 = 8$, which is not zero.\nFor $y = -2$, we have $2(-2)^3 - 5(-2) - 24 = 0$, which is zero.\n\nSo, we have found one root: $y = -2$. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining roots. We divide the polynomial $2y^3 - 5y - 24$ by $(y + 2)$:\n\n```\n       2y^2 - 4y + 8\n      __________________\ny + 2 | 2y^3      - 5y - 24\n         - (2y^3 + 4y^2)\n      __________________\n                 - 4y^2 - 5y\n                   + (4y^2 + 8y)\n      __________________\n                          -13y - 24\n                            + (13y + 26)\n      __________________\n                                   - 2\n```\n\nThe quotient is $2y^2 - 4y + 8$. Since this is a quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots:\n\n$y = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(2)(8)}}{2(2)}$\n\n$y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 64}}{4}$\n\n$y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{-48}}{4}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots for the quadratic equation. Therefore, the only real root for the original cubic equation is $y = -2$.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the point on the curve where $x = 2$ are $(2, -2)$."
