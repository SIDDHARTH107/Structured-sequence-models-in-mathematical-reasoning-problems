    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function fog(x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(u) = (6u + 5)³ and the inner function is g(x) = 2x - 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x):\n\nf'(u) = d(6u + 5)³/du = 3(6u + 5)² * 6 = 18(6u + 5)²\ng'(x) = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of fog(x) using the chain rule:\n\n(fog)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute g(x) into f'(u):\n\nf'(g(x)) = 18(6(2x - 1) + 5)²\n\nNow, multiply f'(g(x)) by g'(x):\n\n(fog)'(x) = 18(6(2x - 1) + 5)² * 2\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n(fog)'(x) = 36(12x - 6 + 5)²\n(fog)'(x) = 36(12x - 1)²\n\nSo, the derivative of the composite function fog(x) is:\n\n(fog)'(x) = 36(12x - 1)²"
