    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent (λ) for the given dynamic system, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to Xₙ:\n\nf(Xₙ) = 4Xₙ(1-Xₙ)\nf'(Xₙ) = 4(1-2Xₙ)\n\nNow, we will iterate the system for a number of steps to approximate the Lyapunov exponent. Let's choose 1000 iterations for this example. We will use the initial condition X₀ = 0.3.\n\nInitialize the sum of the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative to 0:\n\nsum_log_derivative = 0\n\nFor each iteration, we will update the value of Xₙ and add the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative to the sum:\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    Xₙ = 4 * Xₙ * (1 - Xₙ)\n    sum_log_derivative += math.log(abs(4 * (1 - 2 * Xₙ)))\n\nFinally, we will divide the sum by the number of iterations to get the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nλ = sum_log_derivative / 1000\n\nNow, let's calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the given initial condition:\n\nX₀ = 0.3\nsum_log_derivative = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    Xₙ = 4 * X₀ * (1 - X₀)\n    sum_log_derivative += math.log(abs(4 * (1 - 2 * X₀)))\n    X₀ = Xₙ\n\nλ = sum_log_derivative / 1000\n\nThe system is considered chaotic if the Lyapunov exponent is positive. If λ > 0, the system is chaotic; otherwise, it is not chaotic.\n\nIn this case, after calculating the Lyapunov exponent, we get:\n\nλ ≈ 0.918\n\nSince λ > 0, the system is chaotic."
