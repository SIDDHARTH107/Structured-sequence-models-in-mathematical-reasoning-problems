    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a dataset of 1000 students and your task is to find out the average height of male students in the dataset. Among these 1000 students, 600 are male and their heights range between 5 feet 2 inches to 6 feet 5 inches. What is the average height of male students in this dataset?",
    "message_2": "To find the average height of male students in the dataset, we need to know the sum of their heights and then divide it by the number of male students (600). However, the given information only provides the range of heights (5 feet 2 inches to 6 feet 5 inches) and not the individual heights of each male student.\n\nWithout the individual heights or any additional information about the distribution of heights, it is impossible to accurately calculate the average height of male students in this dataset."
