    "message_1": "Consider a smooth manifold M that represents a physical space occupied by a rigid object. Suppose the object has a fixed point (i.e., a point that remains stationary when the object is moved). Let P be the set of points on M that coincide with the fixed point under some symmetry of the object. Show that P is a submanifold of M and determine its dimension.",
    "message_2": "To show that P is a submanifold of M, we need to show that it is a smooth manifold itself and that it is embedded in M. We will use the implicit function theorem to show this.\n\nLet f: M → ℝ^n be a smooth function that represents the symmetry transformations of the object. The fixed point set P is given by the equation f(x) = x for all x in P. We want to show that P is a submanifold of M.\n\nFirst, let's compute the Jacobian matrix Df(x) of f at a point x in P. Since f is a smooth function, Df(x) exists and is continuous. Now, let's consider the linear transformation Df(x) - I, where I is the identity matrix. Since x is a fixed point, we have f(x) = x, and thus (Df(x) - I)x = 0.\n\nWe claim that the kernel of the linear transformation Df(x) - I is the tangent space T_x(P) of P at x. To see this, note that if v is in the kernel of Df(x) - I, then (Df(x) - I)v = 0, which means Df(x)v = v. This implies that v is tangent to P at x, since it is invariant under the differential of the symmetry transformation.\n\nNow, let's apply the implicit function theorem. The implicit function theorem states that if the Jacobian matrix of a smooth function has constant rank on a level set, then the level set is a smooth submanifold. In our case, the level set is P, and the Jacobian matrix is Df(x) - I.\n\nSince the rank of Df(x) - I is constant on P (it is equal to the dimension of the kernel), the implicit function theorem implies that P is a smooth submanifold of M.\n\nTo determine the dimension of P, we need to find the dimension of the kernel of Df(x) - I. Let's denote the dimension of M by m and the dimension of the kernel by k. Then, the rank-nullity theorem states that the rank of Df(x) - I plus the dimension of its kernel is equal to the dimension of M, i.e., rank(Df(x) - I) + k = m.\n\nSince the rank of Df(x) - I is constant on P, the dimension of the kernel is also constant on P. Therefore, the dimension of P is k, which is the dimension of the kernel of Df(x) - I.\n\nIn conclusion, P is a smooth submanifold of M with dimension k, where k is the dimension of the kernel of the linear transformation Df(x) - I."
