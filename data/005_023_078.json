    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve related to outlier detection in statistics:\n\nA set of 10 numbers has an average of 25.5. Upon reviewing the data, there appears to be one outlier. When the outlier is removed, the average of the remaining 9 numbers is 24. What is the value of the outlier?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sum of the 10 numbers as S and the outlier as x. We know that the average of the 10 numbers is 25.5, so we can write:\n\nS / 10 = 25.5\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by 10 to find the sum of the 10 numbers:\n\nS = 255\n\nWhen the outlier is removed, the average of the remaining 9 numbers is 24. Let's denote the sum of the remaining 9 numbers as S'. We can write:\n\nS' / 9 = 24\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by 9 to find the sum of the remaining 9 numbers:\n\nS' = 216\n\nSince the outlier is the difference between the sum of the 10 numbers and the sum of the remaining 9 numbers, we can find the value of the outlier by subtracting S' from S:\n\nx = S - S'\nx = 255 - 216\nx = 39\n\nThe value of the outlier is 39."
