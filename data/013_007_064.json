    "message_1": "In a fishing village, there are 10 fishermen who have access to a common fishing ground. The total fish population in the fishing ground is 100. Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 20 fish per day. If all the fishermen fish at their maximum capacity every day, the fishing ground would be depleted in 5 days. However, if the fishermen abide by a cooperative agreement and limit their catch to 10 fish per day, how many days would it take for the fishing ground to be depleted?",
    "message_2": "If the fishermen limit their catch to 10 fish per day, they would collectively catch 10 fishermen * 10 fish/day = 100 fish/day. Since there are 100 fish in the fishing ground, it would take 100 fish / 100 fish/day = 1 day for the fishing ground to be depleted."
