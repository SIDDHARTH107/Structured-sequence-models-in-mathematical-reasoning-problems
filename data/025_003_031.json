    "message_2": "To find the degree of the projective variety X, we need to find the number of intersection points of X with a generic hyperplane in P^3. A generic hyperplane in P^3 can be represented by the equation ax + by + cz + dw = 0, where a, b, c, and d are constants.\n\nLet's first eliminate the variable w from the equations of X using the equation of the generic hyperplane. We can do this by solving the second equation of X for w and substituting it into the hyperplane equation:\n\nw^3 = x^3 + y^3 + z^3\nw = (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)^(1/3)\n\nNow substitute this into the hyperplane equation:\n\na*x + b*y + c*z + d*(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)^(1/3) = 0\n\nNow we have a new equation involving only x, y, and z. Let's substitute this equation into the first equation of X:\n\nx^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0\nx^2 = y^2 + z^2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) a*x + b*y + c*z + d*(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)^(1/3) = 0\n2) x^2 = y^2 + z^2\n\nWe want to find the number of intersection points of these two equations, which will give us the degree of the variety X.\n\nTo do this, let's eliminate one more variable, say z, by solving the second equation for z and substituting it into the first equation:\n\nz^2 = x^2 - y^2\nz = ±sqrt(x^2 - y^2)\n\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\na*x + b*y + c*±sqrt(x^2 - y^2) + d*(x^3 + y^3 + (±sqrt(x^2 - y^2))^3)^(1/3) = 0\n\nNow we have a single equation involving x and y. To find the degree of the variety X, we need to find the number of intersection points of this equation with a generic curve in P^2. The degree of this equation is the maximum degree of its terms, which is 3 (from the term (x^3 + y^3 + (±sqrt(x^2 - y^2))^3)^(1/3)). Therefore, the degree of the variety X is 3."
