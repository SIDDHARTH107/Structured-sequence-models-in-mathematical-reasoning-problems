    "message_2": "To find the product AB, we perform the following matrix multiplication:\n\nAB = [1 1; 0 1] * [-2 0; 0 3]\n   = [(1 * -2 + 1 * 0)  (1 * 0 + 1 * 3);\n      (0 * -2 + 1 * 0)  (0 * 0 + 1 * 3)]\n   = [-2  3;\n       0  3]\n\nNow, let's find the product BA:\n\nBA = [-2 0; 0 3] * [1 1; 0 1]\n   = [(-2 * 1 + 0 * 0)  (-2 * 1 + 0 * 1);\n      (0 * 1 + 3 * 0)  (0 * 1 + 3 * 1)]\n   = [-2 -2;\n       0  3]\n\nComparing the two products, we can see that AB ≠ BA:\n\nAB = [-2  3;\n       0  3]\n\nBA = [-2 -2;\n       0  3]\n\nSince AB ≠ BA, the algebra is not commutative in this case."
