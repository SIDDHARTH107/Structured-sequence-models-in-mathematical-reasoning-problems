    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific problem for the student to solve:\n\nSolve for x: \n\n(5/x) + (2/(x+1)) = 3/2",
    "message_2": "To solve the equation (5/x) + (2/(x+1)) = 3/2, we will first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for x and (x+1) is x(x+1). \n\nNow, we will rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(5/x) * ((x+1)/(x+1)) + (2/(x+1)) * (x/x) = 3/2\n(5(x+1) + 2x) / (x(x+1)) = 3/2\n\nNow, we will cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n2(5(x+1) + 2x) = 3x(x+1)\n\nDistribute the numbers:\n\n10(x+1) + 4x = 3x^2 + 3x\n\nExpand the equation:\n\n10x + 10 + 4x = 3x^2 + 3x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n14x + 10 = 3x^2 + 3x\n\nRearrange the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 11x - 10\n\nNow, we will factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(3x + 2)(x - 5) = 0\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n3x + 2 = 0 or x - 5 = 0\n\nFor 3x + 2 = 0:\n\n3x = -2\nx = -2/3\n\nFor x - 5 = 0:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are -2/3 and 5."
