    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, we have three types of terms: x^2 terms, x terms, and the constant term.\n\n1. Combine the x^2 terms:\n2x^2 + 5x^2 = (2 + 5)x^2 = 7x^2\n\n2. Combine the x terms:\n-3x + 4x = (-3 + 4)x = 1x = x\n\n3. The constant term is -6.\n\nNow, put all the simplified terms together:\n\n7x^2 + x - 6"
