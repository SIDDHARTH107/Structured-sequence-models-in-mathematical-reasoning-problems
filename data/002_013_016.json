    "message_1": "What is the volume of a rectangular pyramid with a base of length 6 cm and width 4 cm, and a height of 8 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid is given by the product of its length and width:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height = (1/3) * 24 cm² * 8 cm = (1/3) * 192 cm³ = 64 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 64 cubic centimeters."
