    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients (6, 27, and 105), which is 3:\n\n(6x + 27y) / 3 = 105 / 3\n2x + 9y = 35\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for x and y. To do this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of the Bezout's identity for 2 and 9.\n\nThe extended Euclidean algorithm gives us:\n\n1 * 9 - 4 * 2 = 1\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 35:\n\n35 * (1 * 9 - 4 * 2) = 35 * 1\n35 * 9 - 35 * 4 * 2 = 35\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation in terms of x and y:\n\n2x + 9y = 35\n2(-35 * 4) + 9(35) = 35\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\nx = -35 * 4 = -140\ny = 35\n\nSo, one solution for the Diophantine equation is x = -140 and y = 35.\n\nHowever, this is not the only solution. We can find the general solution by adding a multiple of the least common multiple of the coefficients of x and y (in this case, 2 and 9) to one variable and subtracting the same multiple from the other variable.\n\nThe least common multiple of 2 and 9 is 18. So, the general solution is:\n\nx = -140 + 9k\ny = 35 - 2k\n\nwhere k is any integer."
