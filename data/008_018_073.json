    "message_1": "A shipping company charges $5 per pound up to the first 5 pounds and $2 for each additional pound for a shipment. If a customer ships two boxes, one weighing 7 pounds and the other weighing 12 pounds, what is the total cost of shipping using the block matrix method?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the block matrix method, we can set up a matrix equation to represent the shipping costs for each box. Let's represent the shipping costs as a matrix C, the weights of the boxes as a matrix W, and the charges per pound as a matrix P.\n\nC = W * P\n\nFirst, we need to determine the charges per pound for each box. For the first box weighing 7 pounds, the first 5 pounds are charged at $5 per pound, and the remaining 2 pounds are charged at $2 per pound. For the second box weighing 12 pounds, the first 5 pounds are charged at $5 per pound, and the remaining 7 pounds are charged at $2 per pound.\n\nNow, we can set up the matrices:\n\nW = | 5  2 |   (weights of the boxes)\n       | 5  7 |\n\nP = | 5 |   (charges per pound)\n       | 2 |\n\nNow, we can multiply the matrices:\n\nC = W * P\nC = | 5  2 | * | 5 |\n          | 5  7 |   * | 2 |\n\nC = | (5*5) + (2*2) |\n          | (5*5) + (7*2) |\n\nC = | 25 + 4 |\n          | 25 + 14 |\n\nC = | 29 |\n          | 39 |\n\nSo, the total cost of shipping is $29 for the first box and $39 for the second box. The total cost for both boxes is:\n\nTotal cost = $29 + $39 = $68"
