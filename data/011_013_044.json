    "message_1": "In how many ways can you color the vertices of a square using three colors, such that two colorings are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or reflection of the square?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry. In this case, we have 8 symmetries: the identity (no change), 3 rotations (90, 180, and 270 degrees), and 4 reflections (horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal).\n\n1. Identity: All vertices can be any of the 3 colors, so there are 3^4 = 81 colorings fixed by the identity.\n\n2. 90-degree rotation: No colorings are fixed by a 90-degree rotation, as all vertices must be the same color, which would also be fixed by the 180-degree and 270-degree rotations. So, there are 0 colorings fixed by a 90-degree rotation.\n\n3. 180-degree rotation: There are two cases:\n   a) Both pairs of opposite vertices have the same color, which gives 3 choices for each pair, resulting in 3^2 = 9 colorings.\n   b) Adjacent vertices have the same color, which gives 3 choices for the first pair and 2 choices for the second pair, resulting in 3*2 = 6 colorings.\n   In total, there are 9 + 6 = 15 colorings fixed by a 180-degree rotation.\n\n4. 270-degree rotation: Same as the 90-degree rotation, there are 0 colorings fixed by a 270-degree rotation.\n\n5. Reflections: For each of the 4 reflections, we have two cases:\n   a) All vertices have the same color, which gives 3 colorings.\n   b) Two vertices have one color, and the other two vertices have another color, which gives 3 choices for the first color and 2 choices for the second color, resulting in 3*2 = 6 colorings.\n   In total, there are 3 + 6 = 9 colorings fixed by each reflection.\n\nNow, we can apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\n(81 + 0 + 15 + 0 + 9*4) / 8 = (81 + 15 + 36) / 8 = 132 / 8 = 16.5\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we round up to 17. Therefore, there are 17 distinct ways to color the vertices of a square using three colors, considering rotations and reflections."
