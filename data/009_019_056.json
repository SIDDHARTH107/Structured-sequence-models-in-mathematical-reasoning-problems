    "message_2": "To solve this stochastic differential equation (SDE), we will first find an equivalent deterministic equation by applying the Ito's formula. Let Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Then, we have:\n\ndY = (dX/X) - (1/2)(2/X^2)dX^2\n\nNow, we substitute the given SDE into this equation:\n\ndY = ((3X - 4)dt + 2dW)/X - (1/2)(2/X^2)(2^2)dt\ndY = (3 - 4/X)dt + 2/X dW - 2dt\n\nNow, we have a linear SDE for Y(t):\n\ndY = (1 - 4/X)dt + 2/X dW\n\nWe can solve this SDE using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is e^(-∫(1/X)dt) = e^(-ln(X)) = 1/X. Multiplying the SDE by the integrating factor, we get:\n\n(1/X)dY - (1/X^2)dX = -2dt + (2/X^2)dW\n\nIntegrating both sides from 0 to t, we have:\n\nln(X(t)/X(0)) = -2t + ∫(2/X(s))dW(s) from 0 to t\n\nSince X(0) = 2, we have:\n\nln(X(t)/2) = -2t + ∫(2/X(s))dW(s) from 0 to t\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that X(t) < 0.5 for t = 1. Let Z(t) = ∫(2/X(s))dW(s) from 0 to t. Then, Z(t) is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance ∫(4/X(s)^2)ds from 0 to t. We have:\n\nP(X(1) < 0.5) = P(ln(X(1)/2) < ln(0.5/2)) = P(-2 + Z(1) < -ln(4)) = P(Z(1) < ln(4) - 2)\n\nSince Z(1) is normally distributed, we can standardize it:\n\nP(Z(1) < ln(4) - 2) = P(Z(1)/√Var(Z(1)) < (ln(4) - 2)/√Var(Z(1)))\n\nLet Φ denote the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Then, the probability we seek is:\n\nP(X(1) < 0.5) = Φ((ln(4) - 2)/√Var(Z(1)))\n\nTo find Var(Z(1)), we need to compute the integral:\n\nVar(Z(1)) = ∫(4/X(s)^2)ds from 0 to 1\n\nSince X(s) is a random process, we cannot compute this integral directly. However, we can approximate it using the expected value of X(s) or by simulating the process X(s) and computing the sample variance. Once we have an estimate for Var(Z(1)), we can plug it into the expression for the probability and compute the desired probability."
