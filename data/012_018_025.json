    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λ(G), is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in at least one vertex being disconnected from the rest of the graph.\n\nTo determine the edge connectivity of G, we can use the following fact:\n\nFact: For any graph G, λ(G) ≤ δ(G), where δ(G) is the minimum degree of the vertices in G.\n\nProof: Consider any vertex v with the minimum degree δ(G). If we remove all the edges incident to v, then v will be disconnected from the rest of the graph. Since we removed δ(G) edges, λ(G) must be less than or equal to δ(G).\n\nNow, let's apply this fact to the given graph G with 9 vertices and 15 edges. By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\n∑(degree of vertices) = 2 * 15 = 30\n\nSince there are 9 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in G is 30/9 ≈ 3.33. Since the average degree is greater than 3, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or more. However, there cannot be a vertex with a degree less than 2, because that would mean there is a vertex with a degree of 1 or 0, which would make the graph disconnected or trivial, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the minimum degree of the vertices in G, δ(G), is at least 2. By the fact mentioned earlier, λ(G) ≤ δ(G), so the edge connectivity of G is at most 2. Since we know that G is connected, λ(G) must be at least 1.\n\nThus, the edge connectivity of G is either 1 or 2. To determine which it is, we need to check if there is a cut set of size 1 in the graph. If there is, then λ(G) = 1; otherwise, λ(G) = 2.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information about the specific structure of G to determine if there is a cut set of size 1. Therefore, we can only conclude that the edge connectivity of G is either 1 or 2."
