    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A × B and B × C.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB × C = {(b, c) | b ∈ B, c ∈ C} = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow let's find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C).\n\n(A × B) × C = {((a, b), c) | (a, b) ∈ A × B, c ∈ C} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(a, (b, c)) | a ∈ A, (b, c) ∈ B × C} = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nNow, let's verify if the Cartesian product of two sets is associative. The Cartesian product is associative if (A × B) × C = A × (B × C). However, as we can see from the results above, (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are not equal:\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nThe elements of the two sets are different in structure. In (A × B) × C, the elements are of the form ((a, b), c), while in A × (B × C), the elements are of the form (a, (b, c)). Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative."
