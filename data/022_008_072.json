    "message_2": "We will use the following fact: If $g(z)$ is an entire function and $g(z)$ has a zero at $z = a$ of order $k$, then there exists an entire function $h(z)$ such that $g(z) = (z - a)^k h(z)$, where $h(a) \\neq 0$.\n\nLet $f(z)$ be an entire function such that $|f(z)| = 1$ whenever $|z| = 1$. Let $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, \\dots$ be the zeros of $f(z)$, and let $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n, \\dots$ be their respective orders. Then, we can write\n\n$$f(z) = (z - a_1)^{k_1} (z - a_2)^{k_2} \\cdots (z - a_n)^{k_n} \\cdots h(z),$$\n\nwhere $h(z)$ is an entire function with no zeros and $h(a_i) \\neq 0$ for all $i$.\n\nNow, consider the function $g(z) = f(z) \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$. Note that $g(z)$ is also an entire function. Moreover, if $|z| = 1$, then $|f(z)| = 1$, so $g(z) = 1$. Thus, $g(z)$ is an entire function that is constant on the unit circle.\n\nWe claim that $g(z)$ has no zeros. Suppose for contradiction that $g(z_0) = 0$ for some $z_0$. Then, $f(z_0) \\overline{f(\\bar{z_0})} = 0$, which implies that $f(z_0) = 0$ or $f(\\bar{z_0}) = 0$. Without loss of generality, assume that $f(z_0) = 0$. Then, $z_0 = a_i$ for some $i$, and $f(z) = (z - a_i)^{k_i} \\tilde{f}(z)$ for some entire function $\\tilde{f}(z)$.\n\nNow, consider the function $g_i(z) = (z - a_i)^{k_i} \\tilde{f}(z) \\overline{(z - \\bar{a_i})^{k_i} \\tilde{f}(\\bar{z})}$. Note that $g_i(z)$ is also an entire function, and $g_i(z) = g(z)$ for all $z \\neq a_i$. Moreover, $g_i(a_i) = 0$, so $g_i(z)$ has a zero at $z = a_i$. But this contradicts the fact that $g(z)$ has no zeros. Therefore, our assumption that $g(z_0) = 0$ was incorrect, and $g(z)$ has no zeros.\n\nSince $g(z)$ is an entire function with no zeros and is constant on the unit circle, it must be constant everywhere by the Identity Theorem. Thus, $g(z) = c$ for some constant $c \\neq 0$. Then, $f(z) \\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = c$, and we can define a new entire function $F(z) = \\sqrt{c} f(z)$. Then, $F(z) \\overline{F(\\bar{z})} = 1$, so $F(z)$ is a function that maps the complex conjugate of its argument to its reciprocal.\n\nNow, consider the function $G(z) = F(z) F(\\bar{z})$. Note that $G(z)$ is also an entire function, and $G(z) = 1$ for all $z$. Thus, $G(z)$ is a constant function, so $F(z) = \\frac{1}{F(\\bar{z})}$ for all $z$. In particular, this implies that $F(0) = \\frac{1}{F(0)}$, so $F(0) = \\pm 1$.\n\nFinally, we can write $F(z) = e^{i \\theta} f(z)$, where $\\theta = \\arg(\\sqrt{c})$. Then, $f(z) = e^{-i \\theta} F(z)$, and $|f(z)| = 1$ whenever $|z| = 1$. Thus, the entire functions $f(z)$ that satisfy the given condition are of the form $f(z) = e^{-i \\theta} F(z)$, where $F(z)$ is an entire function that maps the complex conjugate of its argument to its reciprocal and $F(0) = \\pm 1$."
