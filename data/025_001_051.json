    "message_1": "Consider the two algebraic curves:\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0\nC2: x^3 - y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nDetermine the number of points of intersection of C1 and C2 over the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by C1 and C2. We can do this by eliminating one of the variables, say y, and then solving for x.\n\nFrom C1, we can express y^2 as:\n\ny^2 = 4 - x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y^2 into C2:\n\nx^3 - (4 - x^2) + 2 = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx^3 - 4 + x^2 + 2 = 0\nx^3 + x^2 - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the divisors of the constant term (-2) divided by the divisors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±2.\n\nTesting these roots, we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\n(1)^3 + (1)^2 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 + x^2 - 2) ÷ (x - 1) = x^2 + 2x + 2\n\nNow, we have the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 2 = 0\n\nTo find the remaining complex roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 2:\n\nx = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nx = (-2 ± √(-4)) / 2\nx = -1 ± i√(1)\n\nSo, the remaining roots are x = -1 + i and x = -1 - i.\n\nNow, we have three x-values for the points of intersection: x = 1, x = -1 + i, and x = -1 - i. For each x-value, we can find the corresponding y-value using the expression for y^2 from C1:\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 4 - (1)^2 = 3\ny = ±√3\n\nFor x = -1 + i:\ny^2 = 4 - (-1 + i)^2 = 4 - (1 - 2i + i^2) = 4 - (1 - 2i - 1) = 4 + 2i\ny = ±√(4 + 2i)\n\nFor x = -1 - i:\ny^2 = 4 - (-1 - i)^2 = 4 - (1 + 2i + i^2) = 4 - (1 + 2i - 1) = 4 - 2i\ny = ±√(4 - 2i)\n\nSo, there are six points of intersection in the complex plane:\n\n1. (1, √3)\n2. (1, -√3)\n3. (-1 + i, √(4 + 2i))\n4. (-1 + i, -√(4 + 2i))\n5. (-1 - i, √(4 - 2i))\n6. (-1 - i, -√(4 - 2i))"
