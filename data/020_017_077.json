    "message_1": "A steel manufacturer wants to produce steel bars with a length of 10 meters using a raw steel block that measures 12 meters. The manufacturer wants to minimize the amount of steel waste by determining the optimal cut length of each bar. The cost of cutting the steel is $1 per cut. What is the optimal cut length for each steel bar to minimize the amount of steel waste and the cost of cutting?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of steel waste and the cost of cutting, the manufacturer should cut the raw steel block into one 10-meter steel bar and one 2-meter leftover piece. This way, there will only be one cut, costing $1, and only 2 meters of steel waste. The optimal cut length for each steel bar is 10 meters."
