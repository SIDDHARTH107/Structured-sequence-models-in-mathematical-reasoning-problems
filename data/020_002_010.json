    "message_1": "A company needs to determine the optimal mix of two products, Product A and Product B, to maximize their profit. The production process for each product requires a certain amount of time and raw materials. It takes 2 hours of machine time and 3 pounds of raw material to produce a unit of Product A, and 3 hours of machine time and 2 pounds of raw material to produce a unit of Product B. The company has 125 hours of machine time and 100 pounds of raw material available each week. The profit is $50 for each unit of Product A and $60 for each unit of Product B. What is the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machine time and raw materials are as follows:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 125 (machine time constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 100 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\n\nP = 50x + 60y\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of each product, we need to find the feasible region defined by the constraints and then evaluate the objective function at the vertices of this region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 125\ny ≤ (125 - 2x) / 3\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We'll find these intersection points:\n\nIntersection of 2x + 3y = 125 and 3x + 2y = 100:\n\n2x + 3((100 - 3x) / 2) = 125\n2x + 150 - 9x / 2 = 125\n(4 - 9) x / 2 = -25\n-5x = -50\nx = 10\n\ny = (100 - 3 * 10) / 2\ny = (100 - 30) / 2\ny = 70 / 2\ny = 35\n\nSo, the intersection point is (10, 35).\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of the constraint lines with the axes:\n\nFor 2x + 3y = 125:\nx = 0, y = 125 / 3 ≈ 41.67\ny = 0, x = 125 / 2 = 62.5\n\nFor 3x + 2y = 100:\nx = 0, y = 100 / 2 = 50\ny = 0, x = 100 / 3 ≈ 33.33\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (0, 41.67), (0, 50), (10, 35), (33.33, 0), and (62.5, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 41.67) = 50 * 0 + 60 * 41.67 = 2500.2\nP(0, 50) = 50 * 0 + 60 * 50 = 3000\nP(10, 35) = 50 * 10 + 60 * 35 = 500 + 2100 = 2600\nP(33.33, 0) = 50 * 33.33 + 60 * 0 = 1666.5\nP(62.5, 0) = 50 * 62.5 + 60 * 0 = 3125\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 50) with a profit of $3000.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 0 units of Product A and 50 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
