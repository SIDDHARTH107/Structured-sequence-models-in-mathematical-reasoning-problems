    "message_2": "To find the number of intersection points of the two curves using Bezout's theorem, we first need to express the given equations as polynomial equations in two variables. The given equations are:\n\n1) 𝑦 = 2𝑥^2 + 3𝑥 - 1\n2) 𝑦 = -3𝑥^2 - 5𝑥 + 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite these equations as:\n\n1) 2𝑥^2 + 3𝑥 - 𝑦 - 1 = 0\n2) -3𝑥^2 - 5𝑥 + 𝑦 + 2 = 0\n\nLet's denote the first equation as F(x, y) and the second equation as G(x, y). Now, we need to find the total degree of the polynomial equations. The total degree of F(x, y) is 2 (since the highest degree term is 2𝑥^2) and the total degree of G(x, y) is also 2 (since the highest degree term is -3𝑥^2).\n\nAccording to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two curves defined by polynomial equations F(x, y) and G(x, y) is equal to the product of their total degrees, assuming that the intersection points are finite and non-degenerate.\n\nIn this case, the total degree of F(x, y) is 2 and the total degree of G(x, y) is 2. Therefore, the number of intersection points of the two curves is:\n\n2 * 2 = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 intersection points of the two curves defined by the given equations, according to Bezout's theorem."
