    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = |x - 3| - 2\n\nNow, we need to consider two cases: when (x - 3) is positive or zero, and when (x - 3) is negative.\n\nCase 1: (x - 3) â‰¥ 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = x - 3. So, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = (x - 3) - 2\n2 = x - 3\nx = 5\n\nCase 2: (x - 3) < 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = -(x - 3). So, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = -(x - 3) - 2\n2 = x - 3\nx = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 1 and x = 5."
