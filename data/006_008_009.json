    "message_1": "A meteorologist predicts that the probability of rain on a particular day is 0.25. If 2000 people plan to attend an outdoor event on that day, how many people do you expect to bring an umbrella assuming that each person makes an independent decision whether to bring an umbrella or not?",
    "message_2": "If the probability of rain is 0.25, we can assume that 25% of the people attending the event will bring an umbrella. To find out how many people will bring an umbrella, we can multiply the total number of attendees (2000) by the probability of rain (0.25).\n\nExpected number of people with umbrellas = 2000 * 0.25 = 500\n\nSo, we can expect 500 people to bring an umbrella to the outdoor event."
