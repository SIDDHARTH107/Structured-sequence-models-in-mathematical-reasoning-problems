    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems and some group theory.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 30: 30 = 2 × 3 × 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor:\n\n1. For the prime factor 2, there is one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. Let's denote it as P2.\n2. For the prime factor 3, there is one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Let's denote it as P3.\n3. For the prime factor 5, there is one Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Let's denote it as P5.\n\nNow, we can use the Sylow theorems to find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30:\n\n1. P2 is normal in the group, as there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup.\n2. P3 is normal in the group, as there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup.\n3. P5 is normal in the group, as there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nSince all three Sylow subgroups are normal, the group is a direct product of these subgroups. Therefore, the group is isomorphic to the direct product P2 × P3 × P5.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of distinct isomorphism classes for each Sylow subgroup:\n\n1. There is only one group of order 2, which is the cyclic group Z2.\n2. There is only one group of order 3, which is the cyclic group Z3.\n3. There is only one group of order 5, which is the cyclic group Z5.\n\nTherefore, there is only one distinct isomorphism class for each Sylow subgroup, and the group is isomorphic to Z2 × Z3 × Z5, which is the cyclic group Z30.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one distinct isomorphism class of groups of order 30."
