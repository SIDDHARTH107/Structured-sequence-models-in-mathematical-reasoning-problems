    "message_2": "1. P(4): This statement is saying that 4 is a square number. Since 4 = 2^2, it is indeed a square number. Therefore, the truth value is True.\n\n2. ¬P(4): This statement is saying that 4 is not a square number. Since we already established that 4 is a square number, this statement is False.\n\n3. ∀xP(x): This statement is saying that every number x is a square number. This is not true, as there are many numbers that are not square numbers (e.g., 3, 5, 6, etc.). Therefore, the truth value is False.\n\n4. ∃xP(x): This statement is saying that there exists at least one number x that is a square number. This is true, as there are many square numbers (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.). Therefore, the truth value is True."
