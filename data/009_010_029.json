    "message_1": "Suppose the current price of a stock is $100 and the risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum. The volatility of the stock price is 20% per annum. A European call option with a strike price of $110 and a maturity of 6 months is trading at $5.\n\nWhat is the price of a European put option with a strike price of $110 and a maturity of 6 months, using the Black-Scholes formula?",
    "message_2": "To find the price of a European put option using the Black-Scholes formula, we first need to calculate the values of d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price = $100\nK = strike price = $110\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.05\nσ = volatility = 0.20\nT = time to maturity (in years) = 0.5 (6 months)\n\nCalculating d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = -0.0953\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.20 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 = -0.2953\n\nNow, we can calculate the price of the European put option using the Black-Scholes formula:\n\nPut price = K * e^(-r * T) * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(-d1) = N(-0.0953) = 0.4621\nN(-d2) = N(-0.2953) = 0.3840\n\nNow, we can calculate the put price:\n\nPut price = 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * 0.3840 - 100 * 0.4621\nPut price = 110 * 0.9753 * 0.3840 - 100 * 0.4621\nPut price = 41.2744 - 46.21\nPut price = $-4.9356\n\nHowever, the put price cannot be negative. In this case, we can use the put-call parity to find the put price:\n\nPut price = Call price - S + K * e^(-r * T)\n\nGiven that the call price is $5:\n\nPut price = 5 - 100 + 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5)\nPut price = 5 - 100 + 110 * 0.9753\nPut price = 5 - 100 + 107.283\nPut price = $12.283\n\nSo, the price of the European put option with a strike price of $110 and a maturity of 6 months is $12.283."
