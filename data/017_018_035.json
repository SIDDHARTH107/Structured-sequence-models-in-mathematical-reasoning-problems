    "message_2": "To determine the type of group G that is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32, we can use the Sylow theorems and the classification of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer.\n\nSince the order of G is 32, we have p = 2 and n = 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is equal to 1 modulo 2 and divides the order of G. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is 1, which implies that G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, we can use the classification of groups of order p^n. There are 51 groups of order 32 up to isomorphism, and they can be classified into the following types:\n\n1. Cyclic group C32\n2. Dihedral group D16\n3. Six non-abelian groups of order 32\n\nSince G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be isomorphic to one of these types of groups.\n\nTo determine which type of group G is isomorphic to, we can analyze its properties:\n\n- If G is abelian and has an element of order 32, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C32.\n- If G is non-abelian and has an element of order 16, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16.\n- If G is non-abelian and has no element of order 16, then G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nBy examining the properties of G, we can determine which type of group it is isomorphic to."
