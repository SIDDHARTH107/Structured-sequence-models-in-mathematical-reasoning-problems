    "message_1": "One classic problem in Geometric Invariant Theory involves computing the Hilbert polynomial of a projective variety. Here is a specific problem that a math student could solve:\n\nLet X be the projective variety in P3 defined by the equations \n\nx^4 - y^4 - z^4 = 0 and x^3 y + x^2 y^2 + x y^3 - z^4 = 0.\n\nCompute the degree and the Hilbert polynomial of X.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree and Hilbert polynomial of the projective variety X, we first need to find a suitable resolution of singularities. We can do this by considering the ideal I(X) generated by the given equations:\n\nI(X) = <x^4 - y^4 - z^4, x^3 y + x^2 y^2 + x y^3 - z^4>.\n\nNow, we can compute a Gröbner basis for I(X) using the lexicographic order with x > y > z > w (where w is the homogeneous coordinate for P^3). Using a computer algebra system like Macaulay2, we find that the Gröbner basis is:\n\nG = {x^4 - y^4 - z^4, x^3 y + x^2 y^2 + x y^3 - z^4, x^2 z^2 - y^2 z^2 - y^4 w^2, x z^3 - y z^3 - y^3 w^2}.\n\nNow, we can compute the degree of X by finding the degree of the leading monomial in the last element of the Gröbner basis:\n\ndeg(x z^3 - y z^3 - y^3 w^2) = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the degree of X is 4.\n\nNext, we need to compute the Hilbert polynomial of X. We can do this by finding the Hilbert series of the quotient ring R/I(X), where R = k[x, y, z, w] is the homogeneous coordinate ring of P^3. The Hilbert series is given by:\n\nH(t) = (1 - t^4)^2 / (1 - t)^4.\n\nNow, we can find the Hilbert polynomial P(t) by taking the first few terms of the Taylor expansion of H(t) around t = 1:\n\nP(t) = 4t^3 - 6t^2 + 4t - 1.\n\nSo, the Hilbert polynomial of X is P(t) = 4t^3 - 6t^2 + 4t - 1."
