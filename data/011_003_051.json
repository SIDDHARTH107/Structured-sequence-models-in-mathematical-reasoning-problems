    "message_2": "To choose 4 different items from a set of 10 distinct items, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 4. So, we have:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / (24 × 720)\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / 17,280\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to choose 4 different items from a set of 10 distinct items when the order of selection does not matter."
