    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nIn a certain manufacturing plant, the probability of a certain type of technological failure occurring in a system is 0.05. If the plant has 300 systems installed, what is the probability that at least 15 systems will fail due to this type of technological failure?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (failures in this case) in n trials (systems), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (failure), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (success).\n\nIn this case, n = 300, p = 0.05, and we want to find the probability of at least 15 failures, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities from k = 15 to k = 300.\n\nTo find the probability of at least 15 failures, we can also find the probability of 0 to 14 failures and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(at least 15 failures) = 1 - P(0 to 14 failures)\n\nSo, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities from k = 0 to k = 14:\n\nP(0 to 14 failures) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 14\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the sum:\n\nP(0 to 14 failures) = Σ [C(300, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(300-k)] for k = 0 to 14\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(0 to 14 failures) ≈ 0.571\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 15 failures:\n\nP(at least 15 failures) = 1 - P(0 to 14 failures) = 1 - 0.571 ≈ 0.429\n\nSo, the probability that at least 15 systems will fail due to this type of technological failure is approximately 0.429 or 42.9%."
