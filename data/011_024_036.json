    "message_1": "A company needs to transport 120 units of goods from its warehouse to a distribution center located 900 km away. There are three transportation options available: truck, train, and ship. The cost of transporting one unit of good by truck is Php 75, by train is Php 50, and by ship is Php 30. The capacity of the truck is 20 units, while the train and ship can transport 50 and 30 units, respectively. What is the minimum cost of transportation, and how many units of goods should be transported by each option to meet the transportation requirements?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of transportation, we should prioritize using the cheapest transportation option available, which is the ship. However, we must also consider the capacity constraints of each transportation option.\n\nFirst, let's use the ship to transport as many units as possible. The ship can transport 30 units, and we need to transport 120 units in total. We can use 4 ships to transport 120 units (4 x 30 = 120). The cost of using 4 ships would be 4 x 30 x Php 30 = Php 3,600.\n\nHowever, we can also try to use a combination of train and ship to transport the goods. Since the train is cheaper than the truck, we should prioritize using the train over the truck. The train can transport 50 units, so we can use 2 trains to transport 100 units (2 x 50 = 100). The cost of using 2 trains would be 2 x 50 x Php 50 = Php 5,000.\n\nNow, we still need to transport the remaining 20 units. We can use 1 truck to transport these 20 units. The cost of using 1 truck would be 1 x 20 x Php 75 = Php 1,500.\n\nThe total cost of using 2 trains and 1 truck would be Php 5,000 + Php 1,500 = Php 6,500.\n\nComparing the two options, using 4 ships (Php 3,600) is cheaper than using 2 trains and 1 truck (Php 6,500). Therefore, the minimum cost of transportation is Php 3,600, and the company should transport all 120 units of goods using 4 ships."
