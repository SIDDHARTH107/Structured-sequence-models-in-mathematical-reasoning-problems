    "message_2": "Domain for x and y: Let x and y be integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10.\n\nQuantified statement using P(x, y): ∀x∃y (P(x, y))\n\nThis statement reads: \"For all x, there exists a y such that x is divisible by y.\"\n\nSolving the statement for a specific value of x and y from the domain:\n\nLet's choose x = 6. We need to find a value of y such that 6 is divisible by y.\n\nWe can choose y = 1, 2, 3, or 6, as 6 is divisible by all of these values. For example, if we choose y = 3, then P(6, 3) is true because 6 is divisible by 3 (6 ÷ 3 = 2)."
