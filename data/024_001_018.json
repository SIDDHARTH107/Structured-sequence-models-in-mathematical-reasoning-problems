    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the curve with respect to t.\n\nr(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 2t)\n\nFirst derivative:\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2)\n\nSecond derivative:\nr''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nwhere x denotes the cross product.\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\n\nr'(π/4) = (-sin(π/4), cos(π/4), 2) = (-1/√2, 1/√2, 2)\nr''(π/4) = (-cos(π/4), -sin(π/4), 0) = (-1/√2, -1/√2, 0)\n\nNow, we compute the cross product:\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (0, 2, 1)\n\nAnd the magnitudes:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = √(0^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = √5\n||r'(t)|| = √((-1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + 2^2) = √3\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk(π/4) = (√5) / (√3)^3 = √5 / 9√3\n\nNext, we need to find the torsion (τ). We can use the formula:\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nwhere • denotes the dot product.\n\nFirst, we need to find the third derivative of r(t):\n\nr'''(t) = (sin(t), -cos(t), 0)\n\nAt t = π/4:\n\nr'''(π/4) = (sin(π/4), -cos(π/4), 0) = (1/√2, -1/√2, 0)\n\nNow, we compute the dot product:\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) = (0, 2, 1) • (1/√2, -1/√2, 0) = -2/√2\n\nAnd the magnitude squared:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2 = (0^2 + 2^2 + 1^2)^2 = 25\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion:\n\nτ(π/4) = (-2/√2) / 25 = -√2 / 25\n\nSo, the curvature at t = π/4 is k(π/4) = √5 / 9√3, and the torsion at t = π/4 is τ(π/4) = -√2 / 25."
