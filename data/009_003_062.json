    "message_1": "Sure! \n\nA metal rod of length 2 meters and cross-sectional area 0.1 $\\text{m}^2$ initially has a temperature of 150 degrees Celsius. The ends of the rod are maintained at constant temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is known to be 0.01 $\\text{m}^2$/s. \n\nFind the temperature distribution along the metal rod at a given time t = 1000 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the metal rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, also known as the heat equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}$$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the temperature at position $x$ and time $t$, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nSince the ends of the rod are maintained at constant temperatures, we have the boundary conditions:\n\n$$u(0,t) = 50^\\circ C$$\n$$u(2,t) = 50^\\circ C$$\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\n$$u(x,0) = 150^\\circ C$$\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation and dividing by $u(x,t)$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a separation constant. Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$$\n$$T'(t) - \\alpha \\lambda T(t) = 0$$\n\nSolving the equation for $X(x)$ with the boundary conditions, we get the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions:\n\n$$\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right)^2$$\n$$X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $n$ is an odd integer.\n\nSolving the equation for $T(t)$, we get:\n\n$$T_n(t) = e^{-\\alpha \\lambda_n t}$$\n\nThe temperature distribution can be represented as a sum of these eigenfunctions:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right) e^{-\\alpha \\lambda_n t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition and Fourier's sine series:\n\n$$150 = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThe coefficients can be calculated as:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2}{2}\\int_0^2 150 \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right) dx$$\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{300}{n\\pi} \\left[1 - (-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}\\right]$$\n\nNow we can write the temperature distribution as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{300}{n\\pi} \\left[1 - (-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}\\right] \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right) e^{-\\alpha \\lambda_n t}$$\n\nFinally, we can plug in the given values for $t$ and $\\alpha$:\n\n$$u(x,1000) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{300}{n\\pi} \\left[1 - (-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}\\right] \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2}\\right) e^{-0.01 \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot 1000}$$\n\nThis infinite series represents the temperature distribution along the metal rod at time $t = 1000$ seconds. To get an approximate solution, you can truncate the series after a few terms."
