    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\n1. Antiderivative of 3x^2:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of -6x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the antiderivative is (-6x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-6x^2)/2 = -3x^2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of 4:\nSince 4 is a constant, its antiderivative is 4x (as the derivative of 4x with respect to x is 4).\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
