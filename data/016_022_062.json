    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal that is formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of triangles in the 10th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = (4^n - 1) / (4 - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 10th iteration:\n\nTotal number of triangles = (4^10 - 1) / (4 - 1)\nTotal number of triangles = (1,048,576 - 1) / 3\nTotal number of triangles = 1,048,575 / 3\nTotal number of triangles = 349,525\n\nSo, there are 349,525 triangles in the 10th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid. Note that the edge length of the base triangle does not affect the total number of triangles in the pyramid."
