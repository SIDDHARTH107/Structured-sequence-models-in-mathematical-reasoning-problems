    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's denote the base as a, the height as b, and the hypotenuse as c. \n\na = 8 cm\nb = 6 cm\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = (8 cm)^2 + (6 cm)^2\nc^2 = 64 cm^2 + 36 cm^2\nc^2 = 100 cm^2\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = âˆš(100 cm^2)\nc = 10 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
