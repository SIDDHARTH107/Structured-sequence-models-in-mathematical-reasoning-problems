    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier Transform, we first need to find the Fourier Transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier Transform of y''(x) + 9y(x) = 0 is:\n\n(ik)^2Y(k) + 9Y(k) = 0\n\nwhere Y(k) is the Fourier Transform of y(x) and ik is the imaginary unit times the wave number k. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nY(k)(k^2 - 9) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier Transform of Y(k) to get the solution y(x). Since Y(k) = 0 when k^2 â‰  9, the inverse Fourier Transform will only have non-zero values when k^2 = 9. So, we can write:\n\ny(x) = A * e^(3ix) + B * e^(-3ix)\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined using the given boundary conditions.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, y(0) = 0:\n\n0 = A * e^(0) + B * e^(0)\n0 = A + B\n\nApplying the second boundary condition, y(5) + y'(5) = 2:\n\ny(5) = A * e^(15i) + B * e^(-15i)\ny'(x) = 3iA * e^(3ix) - 3iB * e^(-3ix)\ny'(5) = 3iA * e^(15i) - 3iB * e^(-15i)\n\nAdding y(5) and y'(5):\n\n2 = (A + 3iA) * e^(15i) + (B - 3iB) * e^(-15i)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, A and B:\n\n1) A + B = 0\n2) (A + 3iA) * e^(15i) + (B - 3iB) * e^(-15i) = 2\n\nSolving for A and B:\n\nFrom equation (1), B = -A. Substituting this into equation (2):\n\n(A + 3iA) * e^(15i) - (A + 3iA) * e^(-15i) = 2\n\nFactoring out A:\n\nA * [(1 + 3i) * e^(15i) - (1 + 3i) * e^(-15i)] = 2\n\nNow, we can find the value of A:\n\nA = 2 / [(1 + 3i) * e^(15i) - (1 + 3i) * e^(-15i)]\n\nSince B = -A:\n\nB = -2 / [(1 + 3i) * e^(15i) - (1 + 3i) * e^(-15i)]\n\nNow we have the values of A and B, and we can write the solution y(x) as:\n\ny(x) = (2 / [(1 + 3i) * e^(15i) - (1 + 3i) * e^(-15i)]) * e^(3ix) - (2 / [(1 + 3i) * e^(15i) - (1 + 3i) * e^(-15i)]) * e^(-3ix)"
