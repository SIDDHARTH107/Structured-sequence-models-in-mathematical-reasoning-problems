    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 24, 36, and 60, we first find the prime factors of each number:\n\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:\n\n2^3, 3^2, and 5\n\nFinally, we multiply these prime factors together:\n\n2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 8 * 9 * 5 = 72 * 5 = 360\n\nSo, the LCM of 24, 36, and 60 is 360."
