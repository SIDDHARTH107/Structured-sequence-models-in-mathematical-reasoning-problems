    "message_1": "A company has three factories that produce the same product, and four distribution centers that must be supplied with this product. The cost of transporting one unit of the product from each factory to each distribution center is given in the table below. Determine the optimal shipping pattern that minimizes the total transportation cost, assuming that each factory must supply all four distribution centers.\n\n| Transport Costs | DC 1 | DC 2 | DC 3 | DC 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Factory 1 | $20 | $30 | $10 | $25 |\n| Factory 2 | $25 | $40 | $30 | $20 |\n| Factory 3 | $35 | $25 | $20 | $30 | \n\nThe student must determine how many units of the product to ship from each factory to each distribution center in order to minimize the total cost of transportation, and showcase their solution method with proper calculations.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal shipping pattern that minimizes the total transportation cost, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the lowest cost in each row (factory) and each column (distribution center).\n\n| Transport Costs | DC 1 | DC 2 | DC 3 | DC 4 | Lowest Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Factory 1 | $20 | $30 | $10 | $25 | $10 |\n| Factory 2 | $25 | $40 | $30 | $20 | $20 |\n| Factory 3 | $35 | $25 | $20 | $30 | $20 |\n\n| Lowest Cost | DC 1 | DC 2 | DC 3 | DC 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | $20 | $25 | $10 | $20 |\n\nStep 2: Assign the maximum possible units to the lowest cost cell in each row and column.\n\n| Units Assigned | DC 1 | DC 2 | DC 3 | DC 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Factory 1 |  |  | x |  |\n| Factory 2 | x |  |  | x |\n| Factory 3 |  | x | x |  |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total transportation cost.\n\nTotal cost = (Factory 1 to DC 3) + (Factory 2 to DC 1) + (Factory 2 to DC 4) + (Factory 3 to DC 2) + (Factory 3 to DC 3)\nTotal cost = ($10 * x) + ($25 * x) + ($20 * x) + ($25 * x) + ($20 * x)\n\nTotal cost = 10x + 25x + 20x + 25x + 20x = 100x\n\nThe total transportation cost is minimized when 100x is minimized. Since x represents the number of units shipped, the optimal shipping pattern is as follows:\n\n- Factory 1 ships x units to DC 3\n- Factory 2 ships x units to DC 1 and x units to DC 4\n- Factory 3 ships x units to DC 2 and x units to DC 3\n\nThis shipping pattern minimizes the total transportation cost while ensuring that each factory supplies all four distribution centers."
