    "message_2": "Using modular arithmetic, we can simplify the expression before performing the exponentiation. Since we are dividing by 7, we can find the remainder of 35 when divided by 7:\n\n35 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nNow, raise both sides to the power of 4:\n\n(35^4) ≡ (0^4) (mod 7)\n\n0^4 = 0\n\nSo, the remainder when 35^4 is divided by 7 is 0."
