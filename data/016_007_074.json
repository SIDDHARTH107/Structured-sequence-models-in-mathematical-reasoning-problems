    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the volume of the Menger sponge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (initial volume) * (20/27)^iterations\n\nThe initial volume of the cube with side length 3 is:\n\nInitial volume = 3^3 = 27\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume after 4 iterations:\n\nVolume = 27 * (20/27)^4\nVolume ≈ 27 * 0.1602\nVolume ≈ 4.3254\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge with side length 3 after 4 iterations is approximately 4.3254 cubic units."
