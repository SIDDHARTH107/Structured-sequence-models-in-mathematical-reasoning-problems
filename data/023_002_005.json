    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. The formulas for these coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients and a_0.\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (since x is an odd function)\n\nNow, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we'll use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) |(-π, π) - ∫[-π, π] (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(nπ) - (-(-π/n) * cos(-nπ)) - (1/n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx]\n\nSince cos(nx) is an even function, the integral of cos(nx) over the symmetric interval [-π, π] is zero:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(nπ) + (π/n) * cos(nπ)]\n\nb_n = (2/π) * (1/n) * (-1)^n * π\n\nb_n = 2 * (-1)^n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = Σ [2 * (-1)^n * sin(nx)]\n\nTo determine if the series converges uniformly, we can use the Dirichlet's criterion for uniform convergence. Since f(x) = x is piecewise continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities in the interval [-π, π], the Fourier series converges uniformly.\n\nFinally, let's find the sum of the series for x = π/3:\n\nf(π/3) = Σ [2 * (-1)^n * sin(nπ/3)]\n\nThis is an alternating series, and we can use the alternating series test to find the sum. The series converges if the limit of the absolute value of the terms goes to zero as n goes to infinity:\n\nlim (n→∞) |2 * (-1)^n * sin(nπ/3)| = 0\n\nSince the limit is zero, the series converges. To find the sum, we can compute the first few terms of the series and observe the pattern:\n\nn = 1: 2 * sin(π/3) = √3\nn = 2: -2 * sin(2π/3) = -√3\nn = 3: 2 * sin(3π/3) = 0\nn = 4: -2 * sin(4π/3) = √3\nn = 5: 2 * sin(5π/3) = -√3\n\nThe series alternates between √3 and -√3. Therefore, the sum of the series for x = π/3 does not converge to a single value."
