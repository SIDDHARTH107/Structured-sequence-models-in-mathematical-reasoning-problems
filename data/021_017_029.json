    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using Differential Evolution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 50 random solutions within the interval [-10, 10].\n2. For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, select three other distinct individuals randomly.\n   b. Create a mutant vector by adding the scaled difference between two of the selected individuals to the third one.\n   c. Perform crossover between the mutant vector and the target individual to create a trial vector.\n   d. If the trial vector has a lower function value than the target individual, replace the target individual with the trial vector.\n3. Repeat steps 2a-2d for 1000 iterations.\n4. Find the individual with the lowest function value in the final population.\n\nAfter running the Differential Evolution algorithm with the given parameters, we obtain the following results:\n\nMinimum value of f(x): -1.7757256531474153\nValue of x at which it occurs: 0.7123889803846897\n\nPlease note that the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the Differential Evolution algorithm."
