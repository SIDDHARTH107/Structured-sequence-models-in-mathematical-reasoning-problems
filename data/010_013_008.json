    "message_2": "To find the rank and determinant of the complex line bundle E over the unit circle X with Chern class c1(E) = 2, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. For a complex line bundle E over a space X, the first Chern class c1(E) is an integer that measures the twisting of the bundle. In our case, c1(E) = 2.\n\n2. The rank of a complex line bundle is the dimension of the fibers. Since E is a line bundle, its fibers are one-dimensional complex vector spaces, so the rank of E is 1.\n\n3. The determinant of a complex line bundle is the complex line bundle formed by taking the highest exterior power of the fibers. Since the fibers of E are one-dimensional, the determinant of E is just E itself.\n\nSo, the rank of E is 1, and the determinant of E is E."
