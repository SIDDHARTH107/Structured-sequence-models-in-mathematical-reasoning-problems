    "message_2": "To find the geodesic arc connecting two points on the surface of a sphere, we first need to find the great circle that passes through these points. A great circle is the intersection of a sphere with a plane that passes through the center of the sphere. The geodesic arc is the shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere, and it lies on the great circle.\n\nLet's first find the center of the sphere. Since the radius is given as 5 units, we can write the equation of the sphere as:\n\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 = 5^2\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of the center (h, k, l) such that both points A(2,2,4) and B(4,6,0) satisfy this equation.\n\nPlugging in point A:\n\n(2 - h)^2 + (2 - k)^2 + (4 - l)^2 = 25\n\nPlugging in point B:\n\n(4 - h)^2 + (6 - k)^2 + (0 - l)^2 = 25\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with three unknowns. We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate the constant term (25) and simplify:\n\n[(4 - h)^2 - (2 - h)^2] + [(6 - k)^2 - (2 - k)^2] + [(0 - l)^2 - (4 - l)^2] = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n4h - 4k + 4l = 0\n\nNow we need to find the normal vector of the plane containing the great circle. The normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of the position vectors of points A and B with respect to the center of the sphere (h, k, l).\n\nLet C(h, k, l) be the center of the sphere. Then the position vectors are:\n\nCA = <2 - h, 2 - k, 4 - l>\nCB = <4 - h, 6 - k, 0 - l>\n\nThe cross product of these vectors is:\n\nN = CA x CB = <(2 - k)(0 - l) - (4 - l)(6 - k), (4 - l)(4 - h) - (2 - h)(0 - l), (2 - h)(6 - k) - (4 - h)(2 - k)>\n\nN = <2k - 2l - 24 + 4k, 4h - 4l - 2h + 2l, 12h - 2hk - 8h + 4hk>\n\nN = <6k - 2l - 24, 2h - 2l, 4h(3 - k)>\n\nNow we can use the equation of the plane containing the great circle:\n\n6k - 2l - 24 + 2h(x - h) - 2l(y - k) + 4h(3 - k)(z - l) = 0\n\nPlugging in point A(2,2,4) and point B(4,6,0) into this equation, we get two more equations:\n\n12h - 12k + 24l = 72\n8h - 24k + 12l = 48\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nh = 3, k = 1, l = 2\n\nSo the center of the sphere is C(3,1,2).\n\nNow we can find the angle between the position vectors CA and CB using the dot product:\n\nCA · CB = |CA| |CB| cos(theta)\n\nCA = <2 - 3, 2 - 1, 4 - 2> = <-1, 1, 2>\nCB = <4 - 3, 6 - 1, 0 - 2> = <1, 5, -2>\n\nCA · CB = (-1)(1) + (1)(5) + (2)(-2) = -4\n|CA| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(6)\n|CB| = sqrt(1^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(30)\n\ncos(theta) = (-4) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(30))\ntheta = arccos(-4 / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(30)))\n\nNow we can find the length of the geodesic arc, which is the product of the radius of the sphere and the angle between the position vectors:\n\nLength = radius * theta = 5 * arccos(-4 / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(30)))\n\nThe length of the geodesic arc connecting points A and B on the sphere is approximately 7.542 units."
