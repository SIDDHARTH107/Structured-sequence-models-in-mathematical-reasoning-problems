    "message_1": "A software company is testing a new program and wants to know how many tests they need to run to test all possible combinations of 4 features, where each feature has 3 possible settings. Using the theory of orthogonal arrays, how many tests are required to test all possible combinations?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of tests required to test all possible combinations of 4 features with 3 possible settings each, we can use the formula for orthogonal arrays:\n\nNumber of tests = L^(k-1)\n\nwhere L is the number of levels (settings) and k is the number of factors (features).\n\nIn this case, L = 3 (3 possible settings) and k = 4 (4 features).\n\nNumber of tests = 3^(4-1) = 3^3 = 27\n\nSo, 27 tests are required to test all possible combinations of the 4 features with 3 possible settings each."
