    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the graph G, we first need to determine the structure of the graph. Since there are 5 vertices with degrees 2, 2, 3, 3, and 1, we can deduce the following structure:\n\n1. The vertex with degree 1 must be connected to one of the vertices with degree 3.\n2. The two vertices with degree 2 must be connected to the other vertex with degree 3.\n3. The two vertices with degree 3 must be connected to each other.\n\nThis structure forms a \"claw\" graph with an additional edge between the two vertices of degree 3. The graph can be represented as follows:\n\nVertices: {A, B, C, D, E}\nEdges: {AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, DE}\n\nNow, we can find the Tutte polynomial using the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a loop,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a bridge.\n\nHere, G - e represents the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e represents the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nIn our graph, there are no loops or bridges, so we can use the first part of the formula. We will use edge DE as our starting point:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - DE; x, y) + T(G/DE; x, y)\n\nG - DE is a claw graph, and G/DE is a graph with 4 vertices and 6 edges, where one vertex has degree 4 and the other three vertices have degree 2.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial of a claw graph is (x - 1)(y - 1)^3. To find the Tutte polynomial of G/DE, we can use the same recursive formula:\n\nT(G/DE; x, y) = T(G/DE - CD; x, y) + T(G/DE/CD; x, y)\n\nG/DE - CD is a path graph with 4 vertices, and G/DE/CD is a triangle graph with an additional edge.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial of a path graph with 4 vertices is (x - 1)(y - 1)(x - 2). The Tutte polynomial of a triangle graph with an additional edge is (x - 1)(y - 1)(y - 2).\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the original equation:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)^3 + (x - 1)(y - 1)((x - 2) + (y - 2))\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)((y - 1)^2 + (x - 2) + (y - 2))\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph G is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)((y - 1)^2 + (x - 2) + (y - 2))"
