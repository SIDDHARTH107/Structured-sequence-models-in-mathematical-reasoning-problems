    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information and use some properties of covering spaces and fundamental groups to solve the problem.\n\n1. X is a topological space with fundamental group π(X, x) isomorphic to ℤ/3ℤ.\n2. p: Y → X is a covering map.\n3. Y is path connected and has 20 points which cover a single point x in X.\n\nWe want to find the number of connected components of Y.\n\nSince Y is path connected, it has only one connected component. This is because, by definition, a path connected space is a space where any two points can be connected by a continuous path. In other words, there are no disconnected parts in Y.\n\nSo, the number of connected components of Y is 1."
