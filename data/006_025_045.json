    "message_1": "A magician has nine cards, three of which are red and six of which are black. If the magician shuffles the cards and draws two cards at random, what is the probability that both cards drawn will be red?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both cards being red, we can use the formula for probability: P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two cards from a deck of nine cards. This can be calculated using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 9 (total cards) and r = 2 (cards to be drawn). So, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!) = 9! / (2!7!) = (9 × 8) / (2 × 1) = 36\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw two red cards from the three available. Here, n = 3 (total red cards) and r = 2 (red cards to be drawn). So, the number of favorable outcomes is:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3! / (2!1!) = (3 × 2) / (2 × 1) = 3\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of both cards being red:\n\nP(Both cards are red) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 3 / 36 = 1/12\n\nSo, the probability that both cards drawn will be red is 1/12."
