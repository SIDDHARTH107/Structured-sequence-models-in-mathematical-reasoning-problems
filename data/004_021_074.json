    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 1, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (5x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = 15x^2 + 4x - 3\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative by differentiating f'(x):\n\nSecond derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (15x^2 + 4x - 3)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\nf''(x) = 30x + 4\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 1 is f''(x) = 30x + 4."
