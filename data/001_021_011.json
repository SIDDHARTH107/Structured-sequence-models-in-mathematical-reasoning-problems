    "message_2": "To find the real roots of the equation x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = 0, we can first try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, -2) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nThe factors of -2 are ±1 and ±2, and the factors of 1 are ±1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±2. We can test these values in the equation:\n\nFor x = 1:\n(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - (1) - 2 = 1 + 2 - 1 - 2 = 0, so x = 1 is a root.\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor. We will divide the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 by (x - 1):\n\n                 x^2 + 3x + 2\n               ____________________\n(x - 1) | x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2\n                 - (x^3 - x^2)\n               ____________________\n                          3x^2 - x\n                          - (3x^2 - 3x)\n               ____________________\n                                   2x - 2\n                                   - (2x - 2)\n               ____________________\n                                          0\n\nSo, x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x + 2).\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0. We can factor this equation:\n\nx^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2).\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nSo, the real roots of the equation x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = 0 are x = 1, x = -1, and x = -2."
