Let T be the theory of (N, +) in the language L, where N is the standard model of arithmetic. Show that every model of T is isomorphic to (N, +). \n\nUsing this information, prove that there is no first-order sentence that is true in N but false in some proper substructure of N.",
    "message_2": "To show that every model of T is isomorphic to (N, +), we will first show that every model of T is elementarily equivalent to (N, +). Then, we will use the fact that every countable model elementarily equivalent to (N, +) is isomorphic to (N, +).\n\nLet M be a model of T. Since T is the theory of (N, +), this means that M satisfies all the first-order sentences that are true in (N, +). By the definition of elementary equivalence, this means that M is elementarily equivalent to (N, +).\n\nNow, we will use the fact that every countable model elementarily equivalent to (N, +) is isomorphic to (N, +). This fact is known as the Upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. Since M is elementarily equivalent to (N, +), by the Upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, M is isomorphic to (N, +). Therefore, every model of T is isomorphic to (N, +).\n\nNow, we will prove that there is no first-order sentence that is true in N but false in some proper substructure of N. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a first-order sentence φ that is true in N but false in some proper substructure M of N. Since M is a proper substructure of N, there exists an element n in N that is not in M.\n\nConsider the structure M' obtained by adding the element n to M and extending the function \"+\" in a way that is consistent with the axioms of T. Since M is a proper substructure of N, M' is also a model of T. Therefore, by our previous result, M' is isomorphic to (N, +). This means that there exists an isomorphism f: M' → N.\n\nNow, consider the sentence φ in M'. Since M' is isomorphic to N, and φ is true in N, φ must also be true in M'. However, this contradicts our assumption that φ is false in M, since M is a substructure of M'. Therefore, there cannot exist a first-order sentence that is true in N but false in some proper substructure of N."
