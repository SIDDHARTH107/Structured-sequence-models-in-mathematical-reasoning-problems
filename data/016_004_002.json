    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. In other words, the sequence {0, f(0), f(f(0)), f(f(f(0))), ...} remains bounded.\n\nGiven the complex number c = (0.2, 0.5), we can represent it as c = 0.2 + 0.5i. To check if this point belongs to the Mandelbrot set, we need to iterate the function f(z) = z^2 + c starting from z = 0 and see if the sequence remains bounded.\n\nLet's perform a few iterations:\n\n1. z = 0: f(0) = 0^2 + (0.2 + 0.5i) = 0.2 + 0.5i\n2. z = 0.2 + 0.5i: f(0.2 + 0.5i) = (0.2 + 0.5i)^2 + (0.2 + 0.5i) = -0.03 + 0.7i\n3. z = -0.03 + 0.7i: f(-0.03 + 0.7i) = (-0.03 + 0.7i)^2 + (0.2 + 0.5i) = -0.5091 + 0.493i\n4. z = -0.5091 + 0.493i: f(-0.5091 + 0.493i) = (-0.5091 + 0.493i)^2 + (0.2 + 0.5i) = 0.31810299 + 0.006102i\n\nWe can continue iterating, but it's not guaranteed that we will reach a definitive conclusion. In practice, we usually set a maximum number of iterations and a threshold for the magnitude of z. If the magnitude of z exceeds the threshold before reaching the maximum number of iterations, we consider the point to be outside the Mandelbrot set.\n\nFor example, if we set the maximum number of iterations to 1000 and the threshold to 2, we can continue iterating the function f(z) and check if the magnitude of z ever exceeds 2. If it does, the point (0.2, 0.5) is not in the Mandelbrot set. If it doesn't, we consider the point to be in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nIn this case, after a few more iterations, the magnitude of z exceeds 2, so the point (0.2, 0.5) is not in the Mandelbrot set."
