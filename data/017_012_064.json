    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is either 1 or 16. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G.\n\nCase 1: There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup (i.e., P is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup).\nIn this case, P is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 16, P must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 x C2, C4 x C4, or C2 x C2 x C2 x C2. We will show that G is isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\n1. If P is isomorphic to C16, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16.\n2. If P is isomorphic to C8 x C2, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n3. If P is isomorphic to C4 x C4, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, which is an abelian group.\n4. If P is isomorphic to C2 x C2 x C2 x C2, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of four cyclic groups of order 2, which is also an abelian group.\n\nIn all cases, G is isomorphic to an abelian group. However, we are given that G is non-abelian. Therefore, this case cannot occur.\n\nCase 2: There are 16 Sylow 2-subgroups.\nIn this case, let H be another Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the intersection of P and H is a subgroup of both P and H, the order of P ∩ H must be a power of 2. Moreover, since P and H are distinct, the order of P ∩ H must be less than 16. Therefore, the order of P ∩ H is either 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\n1. If the order of P ∩ H is 1, then P and H have trivial intersection. In this case, the product of their orders is 16 * 16 = 256, which is greater than the order of G. This is a contradiction.\n2. If the order of P ∩ H is 2, then P and H have an intersection of order 2. In this case, the product of their orders is 16 * 16 / 2 = 128, which is still greater than the order of G. This is also a contradiction.\n3. If the order of P ∩ H is 4, then P and H have an intersection of order 4. In this case, the product of their orders is 16 * 16 / 4 = 64, which is still greater than the order of G. This is also a contradiction.\n4. If the order of P ∩ H is 8, then P and H have an intersection of order 8. In this case, the product of their orders is 16 * 16 / 8 = 32, which is exactly twice the order of G. This is the only possibility that does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, G must have 16 Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 16, and any two of them have an intersection of order 8. In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16."
