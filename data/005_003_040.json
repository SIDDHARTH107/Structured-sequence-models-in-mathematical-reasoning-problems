You want to predict the test score of an 11th student who studies for 5 hours a day. \n\nUsing simple linear regression analysis, find the equation of the regression line that relates the number of hours studied to the test scores. Use this equation to predict the test score of the 11th student. \n\nHere is the data: \n\nHours studied: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16\nTest scores: 55, 65, 72, 69, 75, 85, 90, 92, 94, 97",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) using the given data. The equation of the regression line will be in the form y = mx + b, where y is the test score and x is the number of hours studied.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the hours studied (x) and the test scores (y):\n\nMean of hours studied (x̄) = (3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 13 + 15 + 16) / 10 = 94 / 10 = 9.4\nMean of test scores (ȳ) = (55 + 65 + 72 + 69 + 75 + 85 + 90 + 92 + 94 + 97) / 10 = 794 / 10 = 79.4\n\nNext, we'll calculate the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / Σ(x - x̄)^2\n\nFor each data point, we'll calculate (x - x̄)(y - ȳ) and (x - x̄)^2:\n\n(3 - 9.4)(55 - 79.4) = -6.4 * -24.4 = 156.16\n(4 - 9.4)(65 - 79.4) = -5.4 * -14.4 = 77.76\n(6 - 9.4)(72 - 79.4) = -3.4 * -7.4 = 25.16\n(7 - 9.4)(69 - 79.4) = -2.4 * -10.4 = 24.96\n(8 - 9.4)(75 - 79.4) = -1.4 * -4.4 = 6.16\n(10 - 9.4)(85 - 79.4) = 0.6 * 5.6 = 3.36\n(12 - 9.4)(90 - 79.4) = 2.6 * 10.6 = 27.56\n(13 - 9.4)(92 - 79.4) = 3.6 * 12.6 = 45.36\n(15 - 9.4)(94 - 79.4) = 5.6 * 14.6 = 81.76\n(16 - 9.4)(97 - 79.4) = 6.6 * 17.6 = 116.16\n\nNow, we'll sum up these values:\n\nΣ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ) = 156.16 + 77.76 + 25.16 + 24.96 + 6.16 + 3.36 + 27.56 + 45.36 + 81.76 + 116.16 = 564.4\nΣ(x - x̄)^2 = 40.96 + 29.16 + 11.56 + 5.76 + 1.96 + 0.36 + 6.76 + 12.96 + 31.36 + 43.56 = 184.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = 564.4 / 184.4 = 3.06\n\nNext, we'll calculate the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄ = 79.4 - 3.06 * 9.4 = 79.4 - 28.764 = 50.636\n\nNow we have the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = 3.06x + 50.636\n\nTo predict the test score of the 11th student who studies for 5 hours a day, we'll plug in x = 5:\n\ny = 3.06 * 5 + 50.636 = 15.3 + 50.636 = 65.936\n\nThe predicted test score for the 11th student who studies for 5 hours a day is approximately 65.94."
