    "message_1": "What is the probability of a severe earthquake of magnitude 6 or higher occurring in a particular region in the next 5 years if the historical data shows that on average such an earthquake occurs once every 25 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, severe earthquakes) occurring in a fixed interval of time (5 years) given a known average rate (1 earthquake every 25 years).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval, λ is the average rate of events, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least one severe earthquake (magnitude 6 or higher) occurring in the next 5 years. To do this, we can find the probability of no earthquakes occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of severe earthquakes in a 5-year interval. Since the historical data shows that on average, such an earthquake occurs once every 25 years, the average rate λ for a 5-year interval is:\n\nλ = (1 earthquake / 25 years) * 5 years = 1/5\n\nNow, we can find the probability of no earthquakes (k = 0) occurring in the next 5 years:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-1/5) * (1/5)^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-1/5) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.8197\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least one severe earthquake occurring in the next 5 years by subtracting the probability of no earthquakes from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - 0.8197\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.1803\n\nSo, the probability of a severe earthquake of magnitude 6 or higher occurring in the particular region in the next 5 years is approximately 18.03%."
