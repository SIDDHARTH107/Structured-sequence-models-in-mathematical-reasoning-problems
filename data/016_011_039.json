    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-similar fractal, which means that each iteration is formed by scaling down the previous iteration and arranging multiple copies of it. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, each iteration is formed by placing 5 smaller copies of the previous iteration, with each smaller copy being 1/3 the size of the previous one.\n\nLet P(n) be the perimeter of the nth iteration of the Vicsek fractal. Since each iteration is formed by placing 5 smaller copies of the previous iteration, the perimeter of the nth iteration is 5 times the perimeter of the (n-1)th iteration, scaled down by a factor of 3:\n\nP(n) = 5 * (1/3) * P(n-1)\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the perimeter of the fourth iteration to the perimeter of the third iteration:\n\nRatio = P(4) / P(3)\n\nUsing the formula for P(n), we can write this as:\n\nRatio = (5 * (1/3) * P(3)) / P(3)\n\nThe P(3) terms cancel out, leaving:\n\nRatio = 5 * (1/3)\n\nRatio = 5/3 â‰ˆ 1.67\n\nSo, the ratio of the perimeter of the fourth iteration of the Vicsek fractal to the perimeter of the third iteration is approximately 1.67."
