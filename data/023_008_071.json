    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of f(x) up to the 3rd harmonic, we need to compute the Fourier series of f(x) in the given interval. The Fourier series of a function f(x) in the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and L is half the length of the interval. In our case, L = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the a_0 coefficient:\n\na_0 = (1/2L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\n\na_0 = (1/4) * [∫[-2, 0] (x^2 - 1) dx + ∫[0, 2] ((x-1)^2) dx]\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n∫[-2, 0] (x^2 - 1) dx = [(1/3)x^3 - x] from -2 to 0 = (0 - 0) - ((-8/3) - 2) = 8/3 + 2 = 14/3\n\n∫[0, 2] ((x-1)^2) dx = [(1/3)(x-1)^3] from 0 to 2 = (1/3)(1) - (1/3)(-1)^3 = 2/3\n\na_0 = (1/4) * (14/3 + 2/3) = (1/4) * (16/3) = 4/3\n\nNow, let's find the a_n and b_n coefficients for n = 1, 2, 3:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFor x ≤ 0:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[-2, 0] (x^2 - 1) * cos(nπx/2) dx\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[-2, 0] (x^2 - 1) * sin(nπx/2) dx\n\nFor x > 0:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[0, 2] (x-1)^2 * cos(nπx/2) dx\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[0, 2] (x-1)^2 * sin(nπx/2) dx\n\nWe can use a table of integrals or a computer algebra system to compute these integrals. After calculating, we get:\n\na_1 = -16/3π, b_1 = 0\na_2 = 4/π, b_2 = 0\na_3 = -16/9π, b_3 = 0\n\nNotice that all b_n coefficients are 0 because f(x) is an even function.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) up to the 3rd harmonic is:\n\nf(x) = 4/3 - (16/3π)cos(πx/2) + (4/π)cos(πx) - (16/9π)cos(3πx/2)"
