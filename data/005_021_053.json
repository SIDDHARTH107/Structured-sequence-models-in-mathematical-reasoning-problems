    "message_1": "Here is a possible numerical problem for a math student studying bootstrapping in statistics:\n\nSuppose you have a sample of 25 observations of a normally distributed variable with a mean of 12 and a standard deviation of 3. Use bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.\n\nTo solve this problem, the student would need to simulate multiple resamples from the original sample, calculate the mean for each resample, and use the resulting distribution of means to estimate the confidence interval. The student would need to determine how many resamples to use and how to calculate the standard error of the mean from the resampled means.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of resamples: A common choice is to use 1,000 or more resamples for bootstrapping. In this example, we will use 1,000 resamples.\n\n2. Generate the resamples: For each of the 1,000 resamples, randomly select 25 observations with replacement from the original sample. This means that some observations may be selected more than once, and some may not be selected at all.\n\n3. Calculate the mean for each resample: For each of the 1,000 resamples, calculate the mean of the 25 observations.\n\n4. Calculate the standard error of the mean from the resampled means: The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the 1,000 resampled means. Calculate the standard deviation of these means.\n\n5. Estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean: To estimate the 95% confidence interval, find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the 1,000 resampled means. This means that 2.5% of the resampled means are below the lower bound of the confidence interval, and 2.5% are above the upper bound.\n\nLet's assume we have generated the 1,000 resampled means and calculated the standard error of the mean to be 0.6. To find the 95% confidence interval, we can use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the critical value is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table). So, the confidence interval is:\n\nConfidence Interval = 12 ± (1.96 * 0.6) = 12 ± 1.176\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (10.824, 13.176)."
