    "message_2": "First, let's find the values of 𝑥 for the first ten iterations with 𝑟 = 4 and 𝑥₀ = 0.25:\n\n1. 𝑥₁ = 4 * 0.25 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.75\n2. 𝑥₂ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n3. 𝑥₃ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n4. 𝑥₄ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n5. 𝑥₅ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n6. 𝑥₆ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n7. 𝑥₇ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n8. 𝑥₈ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n9. 𝑥₉ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n10. 𝑥₁₀ = 4 * 0.75 * (1 - 0.75) = 0.75\n\nNow, let's plot the bifurcation diagram for values of 𝑟 from 2.4 to 4.0. To do this, we will iterate the logistic map equation for each value of 𝑟 in the specified range and plot the stable values of 𝑥.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot create a visual plot as a text-based AI. However, I can guide you on how to create the bifurcation diagram:\n\n1. Choose a range of 𝑟 values from 2.4 to 4.0 with a small increment (e.g., 0.001).\n2. For each value of 𝑟, iterate the logistic map equation for a large number of iterations (e.g., 1000) to allow the system to reach a stable state.\n3. After the initial iterations, continue iterating the equation for a few hundred more iterations and record the values of 𝑥.\n4. Plot the recorded 𝑥 values against their corresponding 𝑟 values.\n\nThe resulting bifurcation diagram will show the stable values of 𝑥 for each value of 𝑟 in the specified range. As 𝑟 increases, you will observe period-doubling bifurcations, leading to chaos when 𝑟 is close to 4."
