    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg of length 6 cm and another leg of length 8 cm. What is the length of its hypotenuse, according to the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, the length of one leg (a) is 6 cm, and the length of the other leg (b) is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc^2 = 6^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = 36 + 64\nc^2 = 100\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = âˆš100\nc = 10\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
