    "message_1": "In a trust game, Player A is given $100 and instructed to send some amount of it to Player B. Any amount sent is tripled by the experimenter, and Player B then decides how much, if any, to return to Player A. If Player A trusts Player B to return the maximal amount possible, what amount should Player A send to Player B to maximize their own earnings?\n\nWhat is the optimal amount that Player A should send to Player B?",
    "message_2": "If Player A trusts Player B to return the maximal amount possible, Player A should send the entire $100 to Player B. The experimenter will then triple the amount, giving Player B $300. If Player B returns half of the $300, both players will end up with $150 each, which maximizes their earnings."
