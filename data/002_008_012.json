    "message_2": "The volume V of a right circular cone can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π(5 cm)²(10 cm)\n\nV = (1/3)π(25 cm²)(10 cm)\n\nV = (1/3)(3.14159)(250 cm³)\n\nV ≈ 261.80 cm³\n\nThe volume of the right circular cone is approximately 261.80 cubic centimeters."
