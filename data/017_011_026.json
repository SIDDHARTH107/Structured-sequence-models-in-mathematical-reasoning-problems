    "message_2": "To prove that there does not exist a group of order 12 which is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q, we will first describe the quaternion group Q and its properties, and then show that no group of order 12 can have these properties.\n\nThe quaternion group Q is a group of order 8 with elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} and the following multiplication rules:\n\n1. i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1\n2. ij = k, jk = i, ki = j\n3. ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j\n\nSome important properties of the quaternion group Q are:\n\n1. It is non-abelian: The group is not commutative, as can be seen from the multiplication rules (e.g., ij = k â‰  -k = ji).\n2. It has a unique element of order 2: The element -1 is the only element of order 2 in Q, as all other non-identity elements have order 4 (e.g., i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1).\n\nNow, let's assume there exists a group G of order 12 that is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q. Then, G must also have the properties listed above. However, we will show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. G is non-abelian: Since G is isomorphic to Q, it must also be non-abelian.\n2. G has a unique element of order 2: Since G is isomorphic to Q, it must also have a unique element of order 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 12 = 2^2 * 3^1. By the first Sylow theorem, G must have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nThe Sylow 3-subgroup is cyclic, as all groups of prime order are cyclic. Thus, it has two elements of order 3.\n\nThe Sylow 2-subgroup has order 4. There are two possibilities for its structure: either it is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_4 or the Klein four-group V_4. \n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_4, it has one element of order 2 and two elements of order 4. However, this contradicts the property that G has a unique element of order 2.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to V_4, it has three elements of order 2. This also contradicts the property that G has a unique element of order 2.\n\nIn both cases, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, there cannot exist a group of order 12 which is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q."
