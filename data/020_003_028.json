    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 7 over the interval [0, 1], we can first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (5x^2 - 4x + 7) = 10x - 4\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n10x - 4 = 0\n10x = 4\nx = 4/10 = 2/5\n\nNow we have a critical point at x = 2/5. We need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 1] as well to determine the minimum value of the function.\n\nf(0) = 5(0)^2 - 4(0) + 7 = 7\nf(2/5) = 5(2/5)^2 - 4(2/5) + 7 = 5(4/25) - 8/5 + 7 = 20/25 - 8/5 + 7 = 4/5 + 7 = 39/5\nf(1) = 5(1)^2 - 4(1) + 7 = 5 - 4 + 7 = 8\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical point and the endpoints, we find that the minimum value of the function over the interval [0, 1] is f(2/5) = 39/5."
