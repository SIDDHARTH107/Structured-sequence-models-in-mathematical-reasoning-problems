    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x^2 - x for -π < x < π, we need to compute the Fourier series representation of the function. The Fourier series of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x^2 - x) dx\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3)x^3 - (1/2)x^2] | from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3)π^3 - (1/2)π^2 - (1/3)(-π)^3 + (1/2)(-π)^2]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3)π^3 - (1/2)π^2 + (1/3)π^3 + (1/2)π^2]\na_0 = (1/π) * (2/3)π^3\na_0 = (2/3)π^2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x^2 - x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSince the function (x^2 - x) * cos(n * x) is an odd function, its integral over the symmetric interval [-π, π] will be zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (x^2 - x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts twice:\n\nu = x^2 - x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = (2x - 1) dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\n∫[-π, π] (x^2 - x) * sin(n * x) dx = uv | from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] (2x - 1) * (-(1/n) * cos(n * x)) dx\n\nThe first term uv | from -π to π is zero because sin(n * x) is zero at x = -π and x = π.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term:\n\nu = 2x - 1, dv = -(1/n) * cos(n * x) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = -(1/n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\n∫[-π, π] (2x - 1) * (-(1/n) * cos(n * x)) dx = uv | from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] 2 * (-(1/n^2) * sin(n * x)) dx\n\nThe first term uv | from -π to π is zero because cos(n * x) is zero at x = -π and x = π.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (1/n^2) * ∫[-π, π] 2 * sin(n * x) dx\n\nSince the function 2 * sin(n * x) is an odd function, its integral over the symmetric interval [-π, π] will be zero. Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x^2 - x for -π < x < π are:\n\na_0 = (2/3)π^2\na_n = 0 for all n\nb_n = 0 for all n\n\nThe Fourier series representation of the function is:\n\nf(x) = (2/3)π^2"
