    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we need to find the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to obtain the row echelon form of the matrix.\n\nMatrix A:\n[1 2 3]\n[4 5 6]\n[7 8 9]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row.\n\n[1  2  3]\n[0 -3 -6]\n[0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3.\n\n[1  2   3]\n[0  1   2]\n[0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row.\n\n[1 2 3]\n[0 1 2]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThe row echelon form of matrix A is:\n\n[1 2 3]\n[0 1 2]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThere are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 2."
