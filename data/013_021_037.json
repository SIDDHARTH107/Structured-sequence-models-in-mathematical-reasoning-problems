    "message_1": "In a Centipede game, two players take turns to choose between two options: either to take the current pot (payoff) or to pass it to the other player. The pot starts at $1 and doubles each time a player passes it. If a player takes the pot, the game ends and that player gets the accumulated pot. For example, if the pot is $32 and player one takes it, they receive $32. If the pot is $64 and player two takes it, they receive $64.\n\nSuppose the Centipede game is played with two players, Alice and Bob. Alice moves first. What is the optimal strategy for Alice if Bob always takes the pot on his turn, and the game ends when either player takes the pot or the pot reaches $256? Give your answer as a sequence of actions, where \"P\" stands for pass and \"T\" stands for take.",
    "message_2": "Since Bob always takes the pot on his turn, Alice should take the pot on her first turn to maximize her payoff. If she passes, Bob will take the pot, and Alice will receive nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy for Alice is to take the pot on her first turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions for Alice is: T"
