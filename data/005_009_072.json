    "message_1": "A group of 10 students took a math quiz and the scores (out of 10) are as follows: {8, 6, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7, 6, 9}. Test the hypothesis that the median score in the group is 7 using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Use a significant level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the median score in the group is 7 using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the differences between the observed scores and the hypothesized median (7).\n2. Rank the absolute differences, ignoring the signs.\n3. Calculate the sum of the ranks for positive differences (T+) and the sum of the ranks for negative differences (T-).\n4. Find the smaller of T+ and T-.\n5. Compare the smaller value to the critical value from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test table.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the differences:\n   {8-7, 6-7, 7-7, 9-7, 5-7, 7-7, 8-7, 7-7, 6-7, 9-7}\n   {1, -1, 0, 2, -2, 0, 1, 0, -1, 2}\n\n2. Rank the absolute differences (ignoring zeros):\n   {|1|, |-1|, |2|, |-2|, |-1|, |2|}\n   {1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2}\n   Ranks: {1.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5, 3.5}\n\n3. Calculate the sum of the ranks for positive differences (T+) and the sum of the ranks for negative differences (T-):\n   T+ (positive differences): 1.5 (8-7) + 3.5 (9-7) + 1.5 (8-7) + 3.5 (9-7) = 10\n   T- (negative differences): 1.5 (6-7) + 3.5 (5-7) + 1.5 (6-7) = 6.5\n\n4. Find the smaller of T+ and T-:\n   The smaller value is T- = 6.5.\n\n5. Compare the smaller value to the critical value from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test table:\n   For a sample size of 10 (ignoring zeros) and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is 8.\n\nSince the smaller value (6.5) is less than the critical value (8), we reject the null hypothesis that the median score in the group is 7. There is evidence to suggest that the median score is different from 7 at a 0.05 significance level."
