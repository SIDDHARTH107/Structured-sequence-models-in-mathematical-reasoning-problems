    "message_2": "To solve the equation $3\\sin(x) = 2\\cos(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by $\\cos(x)$:\n$$\\frac{3\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} = \\frac{2\\cos(x)}{\\cos(x)}$$\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\n$$3\\tan(x) = 2$$\n\n3. Solve for $\\tan(x)$:\n$$\\tan(x) = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\n4. Find the value of $x$ using the inverse tangent function:\n$$x = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n\nSince $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the value of $x$ is in the first quadrant, and the arctangent function will give us the correct value for $x$. Therefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\n$$x = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$"
