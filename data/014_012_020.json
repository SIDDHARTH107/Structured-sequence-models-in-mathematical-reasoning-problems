    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"HFNLP\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we need to reverse the encryption process. The Vigenere cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down the alphabet, determined by the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n\nFirst, let's write down the ciphertext and the keyword below it, repeating the keyword as many times as needed to match the length of the ciphertext:\n\nHFNLP\nMATHM\n\nNow, for each pair of letters, we will subtract the position of the keyword letter from the position of the ciphertext letter (mod 26) to get the position of the plaintext letter:\n\nH - M = 7 - 12 = -5 (mod 26) = 21 -> V\nF - A = 5 - 0 = 5 -> F\nN - T = 13 - 19 = -6 (mod 26) = 20 -> U\nL - H = 11 - 7 = 4 -> E\nP - M = 15 - 12 = 3 -> D\n\nThe decrypted plaintext is \"VFUED\"."
