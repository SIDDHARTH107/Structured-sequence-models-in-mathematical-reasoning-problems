    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to use ElGamal encryption to send a message to Bob. Alice selects a prime number p = 23 and a primitive root g = 5. Alice also chooses a private key a = 7. Her public key is then (p, g, ga mod p) = (23, 5, 3). Alice wants to encrypt the message M = 11 using Bob's public key (p, g, gb mod p) = (23, 5, 4). \n\nWhat are the ciphertext values (C1 and C2) that Alice sends to Bob? How can Bob use his private key (b = 10) to decrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M = 11 using ElGamal encryption, Alice needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random number k (1 < k < p-1). Let's say k = 6.\n2. Compute C1 = g^k mod p. In this case, C1 = 5^6 mod 23 = 15.\n3. Compute C2 = (gb^k * M) mod p. In this case, C2 = (4^6 * 11) mod 23 = 9.\n\nSo, the ciphertext values that Alice sends to Bob are (C1, C2) = (15, 9).\n\nNow, to decrypt the message, Bob needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the shared secret s = C1^b mod p. In this case, s = 15^10 mod 23 = 19.\n2. Compute the inverse of s, denoted as s_inv. In this case, s_inv = 19^(-1) mod 23 = 12. (Since 19 * 12 mod 23 = 1)\n3. Compute the original message M = (C2 * s_inv) mod p. In this case, M = (9 * 12) mod 23 = 11.\n\nSo, Bob successfully decrypts the message and gets the original message M = 11."
