    "message_2": "To determine the number of differentiably independent vector fields on a compact, connected 3-dimensional manifold with a nonempty boundary, we can use the Frobenius theorem. The Frobenius theorem states that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of k differentiably independent vector fields on a manifold of dimension n is that the Euler characteristic of the manifold, χ(M), is equal to zero.\n\nFor a compact, connected 3-dimensional manifold with a nonempty boundary, the Euler characteristic is not well-defined. However, we can still analyze the problem using the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which relates the Euler characteristic to the index of vector fields.\n\nThe Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that the sum of the indices of a vector field on a compact, connected manifold with a nonempty boundary is equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold. Since the Euler characteristic is not well-defined for our manifold, we cannot use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem directly.\n\nHowever, we can consider the double of the manifold, which is obtained by gluing two copies of the manifold along their boundaries. The double of the manifold is a closed, compact, connected 3-dimensional manifold without boundary. For such a manifold, the Euler characteristic is well-defined, and we can use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\n\nLet M be our original manifold and D(M) be its double. Then, the Euler characteristic of D(M) is twice the Euler characteristic of M, i.e., χ(D(M)) = 2χ(M). Since D(M) is a closed, compact, connected 3-dimensional manifold, its Euler characteristic is zero. Therefore, χ(D(M)) = 0, and χ(M) = 0.\n\nNow, we can use the Frobenius theorem to determine the number of differentiably independent vector fields on M. Since the Euler characteristic of M is zero, there can be k differentiably independent vector fields on M, where k is the dimension of the manifold, which is 3 in our case.\n\nSo, there can be 3 differentiably independent vector fields on a compact, connected 3-dimensional manifold with a nonempty boundary."
