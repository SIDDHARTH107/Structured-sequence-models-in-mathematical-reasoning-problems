    "message_2": "To prove that the group G of order 30 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we will use Sylow's Theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or 10. We are given that n_3 = 1. \n\nSince there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, G has a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 3. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, and G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to C5 x C3.\n\nNow, we consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. We are given that there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2 = 3). Let R be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since n_2 > 1, R is not normal in G. The action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of R in G, which has index 3 in G. Since the index of the normalizer is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, the kernel is a maximal normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. If the homomorphism from G to S_3 is surjective, then G has a normal subgroup of index 2, which implies that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\n2. If the homomorphism from G to S_3 is not surjective, then G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nNow, we determine the number of automorphisms of G. Since G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, any automorphism of G must send these subgroups to themselves. Thus, the automorphism group of G is a subgroup of Aut(C5 x C3). Since C5 x C3 is isomorphic to C15, Aut(C15) is isomorphic to C8 x C2. The order of Aut(C15) is 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the number of automorphisms of G is 16."
