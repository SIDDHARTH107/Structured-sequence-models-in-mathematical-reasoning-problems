    "message_2": "To find out how many students passed the assessment, we need to find 40% of 300 students.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of students passed = (Percentage of students passed / 100) * Total number of students\n\nNumber of students passed = (40 / 100) * 300\n\nNumber of students passed = 0.4 * 300\n\nNumber of students passed = 120\n\nSo, 120 students passed the assessment."
