    "message_1": "A student is going on a hiking trip and has a backpack with a capacity of 20 kilograms. They can take only 5 items from the list below, which have the weights and values listed in the table. Determine which 5 items should the student take to maximize the total value of the backpack.\n\nItem | Weight (kg) | Value (USD)\n--- | --- | ---\nTent | 6 | 100\nSleeping bag | 4 | 80\nWater bottle | 2 | 20\nFood ration pack | 5 | 70\nCamera | 3 | 50",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value of the backpack, we should calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then select the items with the highest ratios, while keeping the total weight within the 20 kg limit.\n\nItem | Weight (kg) | Value (USD) | Value-to-Weight Ratio\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nTent | 6 | 100 | 16.67\nSleeping bag | 4 | 80 | 20\nWater bottle | 2 | 20 | 10\nFood ration pack | 5 | 70 | 14\nCamera | 3 | 50 | 16.67\n\nNow, let's sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio:\n\n1. Sleeping bag (20)\n2. Tent (16.67)\n3. Camera (16.67)\n4. Food ration pack (14)\n5. Water bottle (10)\n\nWe can now select the items with the highest ratios while keeping the total weight within the 20 kg limit:\n\n1. Sleeping bag (4 kg, $80)\n2. Tent (6 kg, $100)\n3. Camera (3 kg, $50)\n4. Food ration pack (5 kg, $70)\n\nTotal weight: 4 + 6 + 3 + 5 = 18 kg (within the 20 kg limit)\nTotal value: $80 + $100 + $50 + $70 = $300\n\nThe student should take the sleeping bag, tent, camera, and food ration pack to maximize the total value of the backpack at $300. The water bottle is not included as it has the lowest value-to-weight ratio and including it would exceed the 20 kg limit."
