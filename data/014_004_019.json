Let P = (13, 16) and Q = (9, 17) be points on this curve. Calculate the coordinates of the point P + Q on this curve using the addition formula for elliptic curves.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the coordinates of the point P + Q on the elliptic curve, we will use the addition formula for elliptic curves. The formula for the slope (λ) and the resulting point (x₃, y₃) is as follows:\n\nIf P ≠ Q:\nλ = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)\nx₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁\n\nIf P = Q:\nλ = (3x₁² + a) / (2y₁)\nx₃ = λ² - 2x₁\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁\n\nHere, P = (13, 16), Q = (9, 17), and the curve is defined by the equation Y² = X³ + 5X + 8 over the field Zp where p = 23.\n\nSince P ≠ Q, we will use the first set of formulas:\n\nλ = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁) = (17 - 16) / (9 - 13) = 1 / (-4)\n\nTo compute the inverse of -4 modulo 23, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or simply try different numbers until we find the inverse. In this case, the inverse of -4 modulo 23 is 6 because (-4 * 6) % 23 = 1.\n\nSo, λ = 1 * 6 = 6\n\nNow, we can compute the coordinates of the resulting point (x₃, y₃):\n\nx₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂ = 6² - 13 - 9 = 36 - 13 - 9 = 14 (mod 23)\ny₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁ = 6(13 - 14) - 16 = -6 - 16 = -22 = 1 (mod 23)\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the point P + Q on the elliptic curve are (14, 1)."
