    "message_2": "To set up the Playfair cipher matrix, we first need to create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the letters of the alphabet, excluding \"J\" (since it's a 25-letter grid). We start by placing the key \"MATHS\" in the grid and then filling the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet in order.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS (no duplicates)\n2. Fill the grid:\n\n   M  A  T  H  S\n   B  C  D  E  F\n   G  I  K  L  N\n   O  P  Q  R  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\nNow, let's encode the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. Break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters): HE LL O\n2. If a digraph has the same letter twice, insert an \"X\" between them (not needed in this case)\n3. If the number of letters is odd, add an \"X\" at the end (not needed in this case)\n4. For each digraph, apply the following rules:\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed)\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed)\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row and the other letter's column\n\nEncoding the digraphs:\n\nHE -> (same row) -> IF\nLL -> (same column) -> LN\nO -> (since it's a single letter, we add an \"X\" to make it a digraph) -> OX -> (rectangle) -> RV\n\nThe encrypted message is: \"IFLN RV\"."
