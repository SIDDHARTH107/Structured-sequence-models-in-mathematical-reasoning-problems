    "message_1": "Suppose that in a particular market, 70% of consumers prefer to buy Product A and 30% prefer to buy Product B. Further analysis shows that 10% of consumers who buy Product A will also buy Product B, but only 5% of consumers who buy Product B will also buy Product A. What is the probability that a consumer who buys both Product A and Product B was initially a Product A buyer?",
    "message_2": "Let's use conditional probability to solve this problem. We want to find the probability that a consumer who buys both Product A and Product B was initially a Product A buyer, which can be written as P(A|A∩B).\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n\nP(A|A∩B) = P(A∩B) / P(A∩B + B∩A)\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities of the intersections:\n\nP(A∩B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\nP(B∩A) = P(B) * P(A|B) = 0.3 * 0.05 = 0.015\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a consumer who buys both Product A and Product B being initially a Product A buyer:\n\nP(A|A∩B) = P(A∩B) / (P(A∩B) + P(B∩A)) = 0.07 / (0.07 + 0.015) = 0.07 / 0.085 ≈ 0.8235\n\nSo, the probability that a consumer who buys both Product A and Product B was initially a Product A buyer is approximately 82.35%."
