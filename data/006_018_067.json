    "message_1": "In a given year, the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.05. If there are 100 companies in a specific industry, what is the probability that at least 5 companies will experience this type of fraud in that year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (frauds) in n trials (companies), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (fraud), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no fraud).\n\nIn this case, n = 100, p = 0.05, and we want to find the probability of at least 5 companies experiencing fraud, which means we need to find the probability of 5, 6, 7, ..., 100 companies experiencing fraud and sum them up.\n\nHowever, calculating the probability for each of these cases and summing them up can be time-consuming. Instead, we can find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., the probability that fewer than 5 companies experience fraud) and subtract it from 1.\n\nThe complementary event includes the cases where 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 companies experience fraud. We can calculate the probabilities for these cases using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nNow, we can calculate each probability:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (0.95)^100 ≈ 0.00592\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^99 ≈ 0.03116\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (0.95)^98 ≈ 0.08118\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^97 ≈ 0.13956\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * (0.05)^4 * (0.95)^96 ≈ 0.17837\n\nNow, sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13956 + 0.17837 ≈ 0.43619\n\nFinally, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 companies experiencing fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) ≈ 1 - 0.43619 ≈ 0.56381\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 companies will experience this type of fraud in that year is approximately 0.56381 or 56.381%."
