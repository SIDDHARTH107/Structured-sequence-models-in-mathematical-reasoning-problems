    "message_1": "In a factory, the probability of an electrical accident occurring is 0.04 and the probability of a machinery accident occurring is 0.09. If the probability of both electrical and machinery accidents occurring is 0.015, what is the probability of either an electrical or machinery accident occurring in the factory?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either an electrical or machinery accident occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of an electrical accident, P(B) is the probability of a machinery accident, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both electrical and machinery accidents occurring.\n\nGiven:\nP(A) = 0.04\nP(B) = 0.09\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.015\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.04 + 0.09 - 0.015 = 0.115\n\nSo, the probability of either an electrical or machinery accident occurring in the factory is 0.115 or 11.5%."
