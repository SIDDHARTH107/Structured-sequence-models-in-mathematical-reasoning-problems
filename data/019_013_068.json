Determine the truth value of the following statement in second-order logic:\n\n\"For every prime number p and every rational number q between 0 and 1, either p or 1-p is not in Q.\" \n\nIn other words, prove or disprove whether for all primes and rationals between 0 and 1, at least one of the numbers p or 1-p is not in the set of rationals between 0 and 1.",
    "message_2": "The statement is true. To prove this, we will show that for every prime number p and every rational number q between 0 and 1, either p or 1-p is not in Q.\n\nFirst, let's consider the prime number p. Since p is a prime number, it must be greater than 1 (as the smallest prime number is 2). Therefore, p cannot be in the set Q, as Q contains only rational numbers between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the number 1-p. Since p is greater than 1, 1-p will be a negative number. As Q contains only rational numbers between 0 and 1, 1-p cannot be in the set Q either.\n\nThus, for every prime number p and every rational number q between 0 and 1, either p or 1-p is not in Q. This proves the statement is true."
