    "message_2": "Since all the fruits John has are also in the collection of Mary, we can say that Mary has at least as many fruits as John in each category. In this case, Mary has 5 apples and 3 oranges, which is more apples and equal number of oranges as John. Therefore, the total number of different fruits Mary and John possess together is still just 2 types of fruits: apples and oranges."
