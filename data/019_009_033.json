    "message_2": "To prove or disprove that (A + B) is irrational using the principles of intuitionistic logic, we need to first define what it means for a number to be irrational. A number is considered irrational if it cannot be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of A and B:\n\nA + B = 5 + 7 = 12\n\nWe can express 12 as a fraction with integers p and q:\n\n12 = 12/1\n\nHere, p = 12 and q = 1, both of which are integers, and q ≠ 0.\n\nSince we can express (A + B) as a fraction with integers p and q, it is not an irrational number. Therefore, we have disproved the claim that (A + B) is irrational using the principles of intuitionistic logic."
