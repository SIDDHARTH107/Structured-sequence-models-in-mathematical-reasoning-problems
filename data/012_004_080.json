    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (1-2, 1), (2-4, 2), (2-3, 3), (1-3, 4), (3-4, 5), (1-5, 6), (3-5, 7), (4-5, 8)\n\nNow, let's add the edges one by one:\n\n1. Add edge (1-2, 1) to the tree. Current tree: {(1-2, 1)}\n2. Add edge (2-4, 2) to the tree. Current tree: {(1-2, 1), (2-4, 2)}\n3. Add edge (2-3, 3) to the tree. Current tree: {(1-2, 1), (2-4, 2), (2-3, 3)}\n4. Skip edge (1-3, 4) as it would form a cycle.\n5. Skip edge (3-4, 5) as it would form a cycle.\n6. Add edge (1-5, 6) to the tree. Current tree: {(1-2, 1), (2-4, 2), (2-3, 3), (1-5, 6)}\n7. Skip edge (3-5, 7) as it would form a cycle.\n8. Skip edge (4-5, 8) as it would form a cycle.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete, and it consists of the edges: {(1-2, 1), (2-4, 2), (2-3, 3), (1-5, 6)}\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12."
