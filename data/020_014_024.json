Find the first and second derivatives of the function with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 16x\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 16\n\n2. Find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for x.\n\n4x^3 - 16x = 0\nx(4x^2 - 16) = 0\n\nx = 0, x = ±2√2\n\n3. Determine the nature of the critical points by analyzing the second derivative at these points.\n\nf''(0) = -16 (negative, so it's a local maximum)\nf''(2√2) = 32 - 16 = 16 (positive, so it's a local minimum)\nf''(-2√2) = 32 - 16 = 16 (positive, so it's a local minimum)\n\n4. Evaluate the function at the local minimum points.\n\nf(2√2) = (2√2)^4 - 8(2√2)^2 + 3 = 48 - 32 + 3 = 19\nf(-2√2) = (-2√2)^4 - 8(-2√2)^2 + 3 = 48 - 32 + 3 = 19\n\nThe minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 8x^2 + 3 using non-convex optimization techniques is 19, which occurs at x = ±2√2."
