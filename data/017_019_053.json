    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nWe will consider the cases for n_2 and n_3 separately.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G since they are unique. Then G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, and G is isomorphic to C4 × C9, which is the cyclic group C36.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, which is normal in G. The group G acts on P_3 by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P_3). Since |P_3| = 9, Aut(P_3) is isomorphic to C6. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G, and since G is non-abelian, the kernel is not G itself. Thus, the kernel must be a subgroup of order 6, which is isomorphic to either C6 or S3. If the kernel is isomorphic to C6, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and C6, which is the alternating group A4 × C3. If the kernel is isomorphic to S3, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3 and S3, which is a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, which is normal in G. The group G acts on P_2 by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P_2). Since |P_2| = 4, Aut(P_2) is isomorphic to C2. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G, and since G is non-abelian, the kernel is not G itself. Thus, the kernel must be a subgroup of order 18, which is isomorphic to either C18 or C3 × C3 × C2. In either case, G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups in G. Thus, G is a non-abelian group.\n\nIn summary, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. The cyclic group C36.\n2. The alternating group A4 × C3.\n3. Two non-abelian groups, one from Case 2 and one from Case 3.\n\nEvery group of order 36 is isomorphic to one of these four groups."
