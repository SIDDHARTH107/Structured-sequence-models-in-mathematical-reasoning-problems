    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Cholesky decomposition method, we first need to express the given system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable matrix, and b is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 3  2  4 |\n    | 2  8  2 |\n    | 4  2  6 |\n\nb = | 20 |\n    | 16 |\n    | 28 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T.\n\nL = | l11  0   0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nL^T = | l11 l21 l31 |\n      |  0  l22 l32 |\n      |  0   0  l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition method, we can find the elements of the L matrix:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1.732 ≈ 1.155\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 4 / 1.732 ≈ 2.309\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(8 - 1.155^2) ≈ 2.683\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (2 - 2.309 * 1.155) / 2.683 ≈ 0.258\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(6 - 2.309^2 - 0.258^2) ≈ 1.600\n\nSo, the L matrix is:\n\nL = | 1.732  0      0    |\n    | 1.155  2.683  0    |\n    | 2.309  0.258  1.600 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n1.732y1 = 20 => y1 ≈ 11.547\n1.155y1 + 2.683y2 = 16 => y2 ≈ -2.672\n2.309y1 + 0.258y2 + 1.600y3 = 28 => y3 ≈ 3.000\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n1.732x1 + 1.155x2 + 2.309x3 ≈ 11.547\n2.683x2 + 0.258x3 ≈ -2.672\n1.600x3 ≈ 3.000\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx1 ≈ 2.000\nx2 ≈ 1.000\nx3 ≈ 1.875\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x ≈ 2, y ≈ 1, and z ≈ 1.875."
