    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of y = 3x^2 + 4x - 2 between x = 1 and x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral between the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's integrate the function:\n\n∫(3x^2 + 4x - 2)dx = ∫(3x^2)dx + ∫(4x)dx - ∫(2)dx\n\nNow, integrate each term:\n\n∫(3x^2)dx = x^3 + C1\n∫(4x)dx = 2x^2 + C2\n∫(2)dx = 2x + C3\n\nCombine the integrated terms:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + (C1 + C2 + C3) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral between x = 1 and x = 4:\n\nArea = [x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + C] (from x = 1 to x = 4)\n\nArea = (4^3 + 2(4^2) + 2(4) + C) - (1^3 + 2(1^2) + 2(1) + C)\n\nArea = (64 + 32 + 8) - (1 + 2 + 2)\n\nArea = 104 - 5\n\nArea = 99\n\nSo, the area under the curve of y = 3x^2 + 4x - 2 between x = 1 and x = 4 is 99 square units."
