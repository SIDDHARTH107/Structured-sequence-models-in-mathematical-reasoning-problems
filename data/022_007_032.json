    "message_1": "A precise numerical question related to Liouville's theorem and fundamental theorem of algebra in Complex analysis topic is:\n\nFind the number of roots of the polynomial $p(z)= z^6 - 15z^4 + 36z^2 + 200$ inside the disc $|z| \\leq 2$ (including boundary) using Liouville's Theorem and Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of the polynomial $p(z) = z^6 - 15z^4 + 36z^2 + 200$ inside the disc $|z| \\leq 2$, we will use the argument principle, which is a consequence of Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nThe argument principle states that the number of zeros minus the number of poles of a meromorphic function inside a closed contour is equal to the change in the argument of the function along the contour, divided by $2\\pi i$.\n\nFirst, we need to find an upper bound for $|p(z)|$ on the boundary of the disc $|z| = 2$. We have:\n\n$|p(z)| = |z^6 - 15z^4 + 36z^2 + 200| \\leq |z^6| + 15|z^4| + 36|z^2| + 200$\n\nSince $|z| = 2$, we have:\n\n$|p(z)| \\leq 2^6 + 15(2^4) + 36(2^2) + 200 = 64 + 240 + 144 + 200 = 648$\n\nNow, consider the function $g(z) = \\frac{p(z)}{z^3}$. We have:\n\n$g(z) = z^3 - 15z + 36\\frac{1}{z} + 200\\frac{1}{z^3}$\n\nOn the boundary of the disc $|z| = 2$, we have:\n\n$|g(z)| = |z^3 - 15z + 36\\frac{1}{z} + 200\\frac{1}{z^3}| \\geq |z^3| - 15|z| - 36\\frac{1}{|z|} - 200\\frac{1}{|z|^3}$\n\nSince $|z| = 2$, we have:\n\n$|g(z)| \\geq 2^3 - 15(2) - 36\\frac{1}{2} - 200\\frac{1}{2^3} = 8 - 30 - 18 - 25 = -65$\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in the inequality sign. The correct inequality should be:\n\n$|g(z)| \\leq |z^3| + 15|z| + 36\\frac{1}{|z|} + 200\\frac{1}{|z|^3} = 8 + 30 + 18 + 25 = 81$\n\nNow, we can apply the argument principle to the function $g(z)$. Since $g(z)$ has no poles inside the disc $|z| \\leq 2$, the number of zeros of $g(z)$ inside the disc is equal to the change in the argument of $g(z)$ along the boundary, divided by $2\\pi i$.\n\nWe can compute the change in the argument of $g(z)$ along the boundary by integrating the logarithmic derivative of $g(z)$:\n\n$\\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{g'(z)}{g(z)} dz = \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{3z^2 - 15 + 36\\frac{1}{z^2} - 600\\frac{1}{z^4}}{z^3 - 15z + 36\\frac{1}{z} + 200\\frac{1}{z^3}} dz$\n\nBy Cauchy's integral formula, this integral is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the number of zeros of $g(z)$ inside the disc. Since $g(z)$ has the same zeros as $p(z)$ inside the disc, this integral is also equal to $2\\pi i$ times the number of zeros of $p(z)$ inside the disc.\n\nNow, we can estimate the integral using the bounds we found for $|p(z)|$ and $|g(z)|$:\n\n$2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{number of zeros} \\leq \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{648}{81} dz = \\frac{648}{81} \\oint_{|z|=2} dz$\n\nThe integral on the right-hand side is equal to the length of the boundary times the maximum value of the integrand, which is:\n\n$\\frac{648}{81} \\cdot 2\\pi (2) = 16\\pi$\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros of $p(z)$ inside the disc $|z| \\leq 2$ is at most $\\frac{16\\pi}{2\\pi} = 8$.\n\nSince $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree 6, it has exactly 6 zeros in the complex plane by the fundamental theorem of algebra. Therefore, there are at most 6 zeros inside the disc $|z| \\leq 2$, and since we have found an upper bound of 8, there must be exactly 6 zeros inside the disc."
