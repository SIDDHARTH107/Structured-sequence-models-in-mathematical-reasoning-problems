    "message_1": "A metal rod has a length of 1 meter and its temperature is given by the function T(x) = sin(2πx/1) where x is the distance in meters along the rod. Use the Fourier transform to find the frequency components and their amplitudes, and determine the maximum and minimum temperatures on the rod.",
    "message_2": "Since the temperature function T(x) is already given as a sine function, we don't need to perform a Fourier transform to find the frequency components and their amplitudes. The given function is already in the frequency domain.\n\nThe function T(x) = sin(2πx) represents a single frequency component with an angular frequency of ω = 2π and a spatial frequency of f = ω / (2π) = 1 cycle per meter. The amplitude of this frequency component is 1, as there is no coefficient in front of the sine function.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum and minimum temperatures on the rod:\n\nThe maximum value of the sine function is 1, and the minimum value is -1. Therefore, the maximum temperature on the rod is 1, and the minimum temperature is -1."
