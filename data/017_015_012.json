    "message_2": "There are 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 24. We will prove that every group of order 24 is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A4, the dihedral group D12, the direct product of C2 and S3 (C2 x S3), or one of the 11 non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nFirst, let G be a group of order 24. Since 24 = 2^3 * 3, by the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8 and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3 in G. Let n_2 and n_3 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let Q be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, we can consider the action of P on Q by conjugation. Since Q is normal, this action is well-defined, and we get a homomorphism φ: P → Aut(Q). Since Q is cyclic of order 3, Aut(Q) is isomorphic to C2. Thus, φ maps P into a group of order 2, so the image of φ is either trivial or the entire group C2.\n\nIf the image of φ is trivial, then P and Q commute, and G is the direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to C8 x C3 or C4 x C2 x C3. In the first case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24. In the second case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of C2 and S3 (C2 x S3).\n\nIf the image of φ is the entire group C2, then G is a semidirect product of P and Q. Since P is a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, P is isomorphic to either C8, C4 x C2, or D4. There are 3 possible semidirect products for each of these cases, giving a total of 9 non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, so G acts on the set of these subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism ψ: G → S4. The kernel of ψ is the intersection of the normalizers of all Sylow 3-subgroups, which is a subgroup of index 4 in G. Since there is no subgroup of index 2 in G, the kernel of ψ is a normal subgroup of order 6 in G. Thus, G is an extension of a group of order 6 by a group of order 4.\n\nIf the extension is trivial, then G is isomorphic to C6 x C4 or C6 x C2 x C2. In the first case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D12. In the second case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nIf the extension is non-trivial, then G is one of the 2 non-abelian groups of order 24 that are not covered in Case 1.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 24 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A4, the dihedral group D12, the direct product of C2 and S3 (C2 x S3), or one of the 11 non-abelian groups of order 24. This gives a total of 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
