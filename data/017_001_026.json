This group has elements {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n\n2. The cyclic group (Z/4Z, +4) is the same group as (Z/4Z, +4) since it is the group of integers modulo 4 with addition modulo 4 as the operation.\n\n3. The Klein four-group is a group with four elements, in which every non-identity element has order 2. In this case, we can represent it as {0, 1, 2, 3} under addition modulo 4, where 0 is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's prove that (Z/4Z, +4) is isomorphic to either the cyclic group (Z/4Z, +4) or the Klein four-group {0,1,2,3} under addition modulo 4.\n\nSince (Z/4Z, +4) and the cyclic group (Z/4Z, +4) are the same group, they are trivially isomorphic. We can define the isomorphism φ: (Z/4Z, +4) → (Z/4Z, +4) as φ(x) = x for all x in (Z/4Z, +4). This is a bijective homomorphism, so the two groups are isomorphic.\n\nNow, let's check if (Z/4Z, +4) is isomorphic to the Klein four-group {0,1,2,3} under addition modulo 4. To be isomorphic, there must exist a bijective homomorphism between the two groups. The Klein four-group has the property that every non-identity element has order 2. In (Z/4Z, +4), the elements 1 and 3 have order 4, while the elements 0 and 2 have order 1 and 2, respectively. Since the orders of the elements in the two groups do not match, there cannot exist an isomorphism between (Z/4Z, +4) and the Klein four-group under addition modulo 4.\n\nTherefore, the group (Z/4Z, +4) is isomorphic to the cyclic group (Z/4Z, +4) but not to the Klein four-group {0,1,2,3} under addition modulo 4."
