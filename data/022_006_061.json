    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| and |g(z)| on the unit circle, we can use the polar form of complex numbers. Let z = e^(iθ) where θ is the angle and |z| = 1 since we are considering the unit circle.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|:\n\nf(z) = 3z + 1 = 3e^(iθ) + 1\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |3e^(iθ) + 1|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|, we can use the triangle inequality:\n\n||a| - |b|| ≤ |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|\n\nIn our case, a = 3e^(iθ) and b = 1:\n\n||3 - 1| ≤ |3e^(iθ) + 1| ≤ |3 + 1|\n\n|2| ≤ |f(z)| ≤ |4|\n\nSo, the minimum value of |f(z)| is 2, and the maximum value is 4.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum and minimum values of |g(z)|:\n\ng(z) = z^2 - 3z + 2 = (e^(iθ))^2 - 3e^(iθ) + 2\n\ng(z) = e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of g(z):\n\n|g(z)| = |e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ) + 2|\n\nAgain, we can use the triangle inequality. However, this time it's a bit more complicated. Let a = e^(2iθ), b = -3e^(iθ), and c = 2:\n\n||a + b| - |c|| ≤ |a + b + c| ≤ |a + b| + |c|\n\n||e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ)| - 2| ≤ |g(z)| ≤ |e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ)| + 2|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |g(z)|, we can analyze the function |e^(2iθ) - 3e^(iθ)|. This function represents the distance between two points on the unit circle with angles 2θ and θ. The maximum distance between these two points is when they are diametrically opposite, which occurs when θ = π/3. In this case, the distance is 2. The minimum distance is 0, which occurs when the points coincide (θ = 0 or θ = 2π/3).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n|2 - 2| ≤ |g(z)| ≤ |2 + 2|\n\n|0| ≤ |g(z)| ≤ |4|\n\nSo, the minimum value of |g(z)| is 0, and the maximum value is 4."
