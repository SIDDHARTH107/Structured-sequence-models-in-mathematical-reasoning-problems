    "message_2": "A meromorphic function is a function that is holomorphic (analytic) on its domain except for a finite number of isolated singularities, which are poles. In this problem, we are asked to find all meromorphic functions on the complex plane that have a simple pole at $z=3i$ and whose residue at that pole is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nLet $f(z)$ be a meromorphic function with a simple pole at $z=3i$. Since the pole is simple, we can write $f(z)$ in the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{A}{z-3i} + g(z),$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a constant and $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function on the entire complex plane.\n\nThe residue of $f(z)$ at the pole $z=3i$ is given by the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{z-3i}$ term in the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ around $z=3i$. In this case, the residue is simply the constant $A$, since $g(z)$ is holomorphic and has no singularities.\n\nWe are given that the residue at the pole $z=3i$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so we have:\n\n$$A = \\frac{2}{3}.$$\n\nThus, the meromorphic function $f(z)$ can be written as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{2/3}{z-3i} + g(z),$$\n\nwhere $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function on the entire complex plane.\n\nThere are infinitely many holomorphic functions $g(z)$, and for each choice of $g(z)$, we obtain a different meromorphic function $f(z)$. Therefore, there are infinitely many meromorphic functions on the complex plane that have a simple pole at $z=3i$ and whose residue at that pole is $\\frac{2}{3}$."
