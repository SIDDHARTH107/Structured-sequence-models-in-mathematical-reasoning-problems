    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_{3,4}$, we will use the following formula:\n\n$$\\dim \\mathcal{M}_{g,n}(C, d) = n + 3d - 3 + (g-1)(d-1)$$\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus of the curve $C$, $n$ is the number of marked points, and $d$ is the degree of the maps. In our case, we have $g = 3$, $n = 4$, and $d = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$\\dim \\mathcal{M}_{3,4}(C, 5) = 4 + 3(5) - 3 + (3-1)(5-1)$$\n\n$$= 4 + 15 - 3 + 2(4)$$\n\n$$= 19 + 8$$\n\n$$= 27$$\n\nSo the dimension of the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_{3,4}$ of stable maps from rational curves to $C$ with degree $d=5$ is $27$."
