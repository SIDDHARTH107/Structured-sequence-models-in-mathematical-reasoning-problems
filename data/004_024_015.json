    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the given point (1, 3), we need to find the derivative dy/dx. We can do this by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x and then solving for dy/dx.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 + y^3 = 10xy\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^3) + d/dx(y^3) = d/dx(10xy)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n3x^2 + 3y^2(dy/dx) = 10(dy/dx)x + 10y\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx. First, isolate the terms with dy/dx on one side of the equation:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) - 10x(dy/dx) = 10y - 3x^2\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx(3y^2 - 10x) = 10y - 3x^2\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3y^2 - 10x) to solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (10y - 3x^2) / (3y^2 - 10x)\n\nWe are given that y = 3 when x = 1. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = (10(3) - 3(1)^2) / (3(3)^2 - 10(1))\n\ndy/dx = (30 - 3) / (27 - 10)\n\ndy/dx = 27 / 17\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, 3) is 27/17."
