    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that their soda can contain 400ml of liquid. To test this claim, 50 cans of soda are randomly sampled and the volumes of liquid in them are measured. The mean of the sample is 397ml and the standard deviation is 20ml. Using the central limit theorem, what is the probability that the average volume of liquid in a randomly selected can is at least 398ml?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the z-score formula. The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\nSample mean (x̄) = 397 ml\nPopulation mean (μ) = 400 ml (manufacturer's claim)\nSample size (n) = 50 cans\nSample standard deviation (s) = 20 ml\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSE = s / √n\n\nSE = 20 ml / √50\nSE ≈ 2.83 ml\n\nNow, we will calculate the z-score for the sample mean of 398 ml. The z-score represents the number of standard errors a particular value is from the population mean. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nz = (398 ml - 400 ml) / 2.83 ml\nz ≈ -0.71\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the average volume of liquid in a randomly selected can is at least 398 ml. Since we are looking for the probability of a value greater than or equal to 398 ml, we will find the area to the right of the z-score -0.71 in the standard normal distribution table (z-table).\n\nUsing the z-table, we find that the area to the left of z = -0.71 is approximately 0.2389. Since we want the area to the right, we subtract this value from 1:\n\nArea to the right of z = -0.71 = 1 - 0.2389\nArea to the right of z = -0.71 ≈ 0.7611\n\nTherefore, the probability that the average volume of liquid in a randomly selected can is at least 398 ml is approximately 0.7611 or 76.11%."
