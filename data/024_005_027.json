    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the tangent plane at the given point (1,1,2).\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^2 + y^2, we can define the position vector r as:\n\nr(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 + y^2).\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of r with respect to x and y:\n\nr_x = (∂r/∂x) = (1, 0, 2x),\nr_y = (∂r/∂y) = (0, 1, 2y).\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nr_x(1,1) = (1, 0, 2),\nr_y(1,1) = (0, 1, 2).\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_xx = (∂²r/∂x²) = (0, 0, 2),\nr_yy = (∂²r/∂y²) = (0, 0, 2),\nr_xy = (∂²r/∂x∂y) = (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we need to compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms. The first fundamental form coefficients are:\n\nE = r_x • r_x = (1, 0, 2) • (1, 0, 2) = 1 + 4 = 5,\nF = r_x • r_y = (1, 0, 2) • (0, 1, 2) = 0 + 0 + 4 = 4,\nG = r_y • r_y = (0, 1, 2) • (0, 1, 2) = 0 + 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nThe second fundamental form coefficients are:\n\nL = r_xx • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, -2, 2) = 0 + 0 - 4 = -4,\nM = r_xy • N = (0, 0, 0) • (0, -2, 2) = 0,\nN = r_yy • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, -2, 2) = 0 + 0 - 4 = -4.\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface at the given point, which can be computed as the cross product of r_x and r_y:\n\nN = r_x × r_y = (1, 0, 2) × (0, 1, 2) = (0, -2, 2).\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the following equation:\n\n(EG - F²)k1k2 = LN - M².\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n(5*5 - 4*4)k1k2 = (-4)*(-4) - 0.\n\nSolving for k1k2:\n\n(25 - 16)k1k2 = 16,\n9k1k2 = 16.\n\nThus, k1k2 = 16/9.\n\nNow, we need to find the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (L + N) / 2(EG - F²).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nH = (-4 - 4) / 2(9) = -8 / 18 = -4/9.\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 using the following equations:\n\nk1 = H + sqrt(H² - k1k2),\nk2 = H - sqrt(H² - k1k2).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk1 = -4/9 + sqrt((-4/9)² - 16/9) = -4/9 + sqrt(16/81 - 16/9),\nk2 = -4/9 - sqrt((-4/9)² - 16/9) = -4/9 - sqrt(16/81 - 16/9).\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nk1 = -4/9 + sqrt(16/81 - 144/81) = -4/9 + sqrt(-128/81),\nk2 = -4/9 - sqrt(16/81 - 144/81) = -4/9 - sqrt(-128/81).\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is imaginary, the principal curvatures k1 and k2 are complex numbers:\n\nk1 = -4/9 + (8i/9),\nk2 = -4/9 - (8i/9)."
