    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix of the system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (row-echelon form).\n3. Use back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write down the augmented matrix of the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n|  3  2 -1 |  7 |\n|  1 -3  2 | -11|\n|  2  1  4 |  5 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (row-echelon form).\n\nFirst, let's eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows:\n\nR2 = R2 - (1/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (2/3)R1\n\n|  3   2  -1 |   7  |\n|  0  -7  5/3| -34/3|\n|  0  -1  10/3| -1/3 |\n\nNext, let's eliminate the y terms in the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/7)R2\n\n|  3   2  -1  |   7   |\n|  0  -7  5/3 | -34/3 |\n|  0   0  3   |   3   |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n3z = 3\nz = 1\n\nNow, substitute z back into the second row:\n\n-7y + 5/3(1) = -34/3\n-7y = -36/3\ny = 2\n\nFinally, substitute y and z back into the first row:\n\n3x + 2(2) - 1 = 7\n3x = 3\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
