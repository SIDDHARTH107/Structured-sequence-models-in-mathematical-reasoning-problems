    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the statement ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x) → R(x)), we need to check if the implication holds true for all x that satisfy the conditions P(x) and Q(x).\n\nLet's find the numbers that are both even and multiples of 3. The smallest such number is 6 (2 * 3), and the next one is 12 (2 * 6). Since we are looking for positive integers less than 10, we only need to consider 6.\n\nNow, let's check if R(x) holds true for x = 6. Since 6 is a positive integer less than 10, R(6) is true.\n\nTherefore, the statement ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x) → R(x)) holds true, as the implication is true for the only value of x that satisfies both P(x) and Q(x) conditions. The truth value of the statement is True."
