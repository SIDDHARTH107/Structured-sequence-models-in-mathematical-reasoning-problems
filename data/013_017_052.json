    "message_1": "Consider a market where buyers and sellers engage in transactions of a good. There are two types of sellers: low-quality and high-quality ones. A buyer cannot observe the quality of the seller's product before purchasing it. The market price is fixed at $50. The cost of production for low-quality sellers is $30, and $40 for high-quality ones. Assume that the fraction of low-quality sellers in the market is 0.6.\n\nWhat is the average profit of a seller in the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the average profit of a seller in the market, we need to calculate the profit for each type of seller and then find the weighted average based on the fraction of each type of seller in the market.\n\nProfit for low-quality sellers:\nMarket price - Cost of production = $50 - $30 = $20\n\nProfit for high-quality sellers:\nMarket price - Cost of production = $50 - $40 = $10\n\nNow, we find the weighted average profit based on the fraction of each type of seller in the market:\n\nAverage profit = (Fraction of low-quality sellers * Profit for low-quality sellers) + (Fraction of high-quality sellers * Profit for high-quality sellers)\n\nFraction of high-quality sellers = 1 - Fraction of low-quality sellers = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nAverage profit = (0.6 * $20) + (0.4 * $10) = $12 + $4 = $16\n\nSo, the average profit of a seller in the market is $16."
