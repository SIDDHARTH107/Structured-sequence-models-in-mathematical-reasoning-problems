    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group of order 15 generated by 3, we have G = {1, 3, 3^2, ..., 3^14}. Now, let's find the elements of H, which is a subgroup of G with order 5.\n\nRecall that the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = 1, where a is the element. Since H has order 5, its generator must have order 5 as well. Let's denote the generator of H as h.\n\nWe know that the order of 3 in G is 15, which means 3^15 = 1. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup (in this case, H) must divide the order of the group (G). Since the order of H is 5, we have:\n\n15 = 3 * 5\n\nNow, let's find the generator h of H. We need to find an element in G that has order 5. Since 3^15 = 1, we can try raising 3 to the power of 15 divided by 5:\n\nh = 3^(15/5) = 3^3 = 27\n\nHowever, 27 is not in G because it is greater than the largest element in G (3^14). To find the corresponding element in G, we can take the remainder when 27 is divided by 15:\n\n27 mod 15 = 12\n\nSo, h = 12 is the generator of H, and H = {1, 12, 12^2, 12^3, 12^4}."
