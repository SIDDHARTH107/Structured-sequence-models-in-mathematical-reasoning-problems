    "message_2": "The first three Sophie Germain primes are 2, 3, and 5. These are primes such that if you double them and add 1, the result is also a prime number. For example:\n\n2 is a Sophie Germain prime because 2 * 2 + 1 = 5, which is prime.\n3 is a Sophie Germain prime because 2 * 3 + 1 = 7, which is prime.\n5 is a Sophie Germain prime because 2 * 5 + 1 = 11, which is prime."
