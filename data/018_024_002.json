    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\nA △ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow let's find the complement of A, denoted as A':\n\nA' = {x | x ∉ A}\nSince we are not given a universal set, we can assume it to be the set of all elements in A and B.\nUniversal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA' = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow we can find (A △ B) ∩ A':\n\n(A △ B) ∩ A' = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\nNext, let's find the complement of B, denoted as B':\n\nB' = {x | x ∉ B}\nB' = {1}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B', denoted as A' △ B':\n\nA' △ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B')\nA' ∪ B' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA' ∩ B' = {}\nA' △ B' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow let's find the union of (A' △ B') and (A △ B):\n\n(A' △ B') ∪ (A △ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {1, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow we have all the necessary sets to show that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement. We need to show that (A △ B) ∩ A' ≠ [(A' △ B') ∪ (A △ B)].\n\n(A △ B) ∩ A' = {5}\n[(A' △ B') ∪ (A △ B)] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince {5} ≠ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
