    "message_1": "In a particular neighborhood, the probability of a burglary occurring on any given day is 0.15. If there are 30 days in a month, what is the probability that at least 3 burglaries occur in that month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 3 burglaries occurring in a month, we can use the complementary probability, which means we will find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (burglaries) in n trials (days), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.15), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.85).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 burglaries:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(30, 0) * (0.15)^0 * (0.85)^30\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.85^30 ≈ 0.000139\n\nNext, let's find the probability of 1 burglary:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(30, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (0.85)^29\nP(X = 1) = 30 * 0.15 * 0.85^29 ≈ 0.001875\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of 2 burglaries:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(30, 2) * (0.15)^2 * (0.85)^28\nP(X = 2) = 435 * 0.0225 * 0.85^28 ≈ 0.010556\n\nNow, let's find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 3 burglaries) = 1 - P(0 burglaries) - P(1 burglary) - P(2 burglaries)\nP(at least 3 burglaries) = 1 - 0.000139 - 0.001875 - 0.010556\nP(at least 3 burglaries) ≈ 1 - 0.01257\nP(at least 3 burglaries) ≈ 0.98743\n\nSo, the probability of at least 3 burglaries occurring in that month is approximately 0.98743 or 98.74%."
