    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle/360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 9 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (45/360) × π × 9²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 81\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × 81π\n\nArea of sector = 10.125π\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector is approximately 31.81 square centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)."
