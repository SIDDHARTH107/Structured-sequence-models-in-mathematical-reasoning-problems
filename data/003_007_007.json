    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 9 cm in this case. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and c = 9 cm, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. We want to find angle C.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c:\n\n9² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos(C)\n\n7 = 74 - 70 * cos(C)\n\nNow, isolate cos(C):\n\n70 * cos(C) = 67\n\ncos(C) = 67 / 70\n\nNow, find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nC = arccos(67 / 70)\n\nC ≈ 26.4°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 26.4°."
