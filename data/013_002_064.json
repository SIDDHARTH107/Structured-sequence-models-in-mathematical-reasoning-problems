    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium(s) of this game, we need to identify the strategies where no player can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nLet's analyze the best responses for each player:\n\nFor Firm A:\n- If Firm B produces 10 units, Firm A's best response is to produce 20 units (payoff of 3).\n- If Firm B produces 20 units, Firm A's best response is to produce 10 units (payoff of 0) or 20 units (payoff of 1).\n- If Firm B produces 30 units, Firm A's best response is to produce 10 units (payoff of -1) or 20 units (payoff of 0).\n\nFor Firm B:\n- If Firm A produces 10 units, Firm B's best response is to produce 20 units (payoff of 3).\n- If Firm A produces 20 units, Firm B's best response is to produce 10 units (payoff of 0) or 20 units (payoff of 1).\n- If Firm A produces 30 units, Firm B's best response is to produce 30 units (payoff of -2).\n\nNow, let's find the strategies where both players have no incentive to deviate:\n\n- If Firm A produces 10 units and Firm B produces 20 units, neither player has an incentive to deviate (Firm A's payoff is 0, and Firm B's payoff is 3).\n- If Firm A produces 20 units and Firm B produces 10 units, neither player has an incentive to deviate (Firm A's payoff is 3, and Firm B's payoff is 0).\n- If Firm A produces 20 units and Firm B produces 20 units, neither player has an incentive to deviate (Firm A's payoff is 1, and Firm B's payoff is 1).\n\nThus, there are three Nash Equilibria in this game:\n\n1. Firm A produces 10 units, and Firm B produces 20 units.\n2. Firm A produces 20 units, and Firm B produces 10 units.\n3. Firm A produces 20 units, and Firm B produces 20 units."
