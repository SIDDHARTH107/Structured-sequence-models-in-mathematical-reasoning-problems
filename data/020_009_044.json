    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, X and Y, with profit per unit of $3 and $5 respectively. Each product requires two different types of raw materials. The number of units of each raw material varies stochastically each month, with an expectation of 100 units of material 1 and 50 units of material 2. Each unit of product X requires 2 units of material 1 and 1 unit of material 2. Each unit of product Y requires 1 unit of material 1 and 3 units of material 2. The company wants to optimize its monthly profit by deciding how many units of each product to manufacture. Using stochastic optimization, what should be the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming with stochastic constraints. Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nP = 3x + 5y\n\nThe constraints are given by the availability of raw materials:\n\n2x + y <= 100 (constraint for material 1)\nx + 3y <= 50 (constraint for material 2)\n\nSince the availability of raw materials varies stochastically, we can use the expected values of the constraints:\n\nE[2x + y] <= E[100]\nE[x + 3y] <= E[50]\n\nAssuming the expected values of the constraints are equal to the deterministic values, we can solve the linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize P = 3x + 5y\nSubject to:\n2x + y <= 100\nx + 3y <= 50\nx, y >= 0\n\nSolving this linear programming problem, we find the optimal solution to be x = 20 units of product X and y = 10 units of product Y. This will result in a maximum expected profit of P = 3(20) + 5(10) = 60 + 50 = $110 per month."
