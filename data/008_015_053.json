    "message_2": "Cholesky decomposition is a method used to solve linear systems of the form Ax = b, where A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. However, the given system of linear equations does not have a symmetric positive-definite matrix. Therefore, Cholesky decomposition cannot be applied to this problem.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve the system of linear equations. Let's use Gaussian elimination:\n\nFirst, write the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  1 -4 | -4 |\n|  0  1 -3 |  0 |\n| -4  4  5 | 10 |\n\nStep 1: Add 2 times the first row to the third row to eliminate the -4 in the third row:\n\n|  2  1 -4 | -4 |\n|  0  1 -3 |  0 |\n|  0  6 -3 |  2 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the third row by 6:\n\n|  2  1 -4 | -4 |\n|  0  1 -3 |  0 |\n|  0  1 -1/2 | 1/3 |\n\nStep 3: Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n|  2  1 -4 | -4 |\n|  0  1 -3 |  0 |\n|  0  0  5/2 | 1/3 |\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 5/2:\n\n|  2  1 -4 | -4 |\n|  0  1 -3 |  0 |\n|  0  0  1 | 1/5 |\n\nStep 5: Add 3 times the third row to the second row:\n\n|  2  1 -4 | -4 |\n|  0  1  0 |  3/5 |\n|  0  0  1 | 1/5 |\n\nStep 6: Add 4 times the third row to the first row:\n\n|  2  1  0 | -16/5 |\n|  0  1  0 |  3/5  |\n|  0  0  1 | 1/5   |\n\nStep 7: Divide the first row by 2:\n\n|  1  1/2  0 | -8/5  |\n|  0  1   0  |  3/5  |\n|  0  0   1  | 1/5   |\n\nStep 8: Subtract 1/2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n|  1  0  0 | -3/5  |\n|  0  1  0 |  3/5  |\n|  0  0  1 | 1/5   |\n\nNow we have the solution:\n\nx = -3/5\ny = 3/5\nz = 1/5"
