    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of v along the curve r(t), we need to solve the following differential equation:\n\ndv/dt + (v • T)T = 0,\n\nwhere T is the unit tangent vector of the curve r(t), and v is the vector we want to parallel transport.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector T. To do this, we need to find the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\ndr/dt = <-sin(t), cos(t), 2>.\n\nNow, we need to normalize this vector to get the unit tangent vector T:\n\n|dr/dt| = sqrt((-sin(t))^2 + (cos(t))^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5).\n\nSo, T = (1/sqrt(5))<-sin(t), cos(t), 2>.\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of v and T:\n\nv • T = (1/sqrt(5))<1, -1, 0> • <-sin(t), cos(t), 2> = (1/sqrt(5))(-sin(t) - cos(t)).\n\nNow, we can plug this into the differential equation:\n\ndv/dt + (1/sqrt(5))(-sin(t) - cos(t)) (1/sqrt(5))<-sin(t), cos(t), 2> = 0.\n\nLet v(t) = <a(t), b(t), c(t)>. Then, we have the following system of equations:\n\nda/dt + (1/5)(-sin(t) - cos(t))(-sin(t)) = 0,\ndb/dt + (1/5)(-sin(t) - cos(t))(cos(t)) = 0,\ndc/dt + (1/5)(-sin(t) - cos(t))(2) = 0.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. Since v(0) = <1, -1, 0>, we have the initial conditions a(0) = 1, b(0) = -1, and c(0) = 0.\n\nSolving the first equation:\n\nda/dt = (1/5)(sin^2(t) + sin(t)cos(t)),\na(t) = (1/5)(-cos(t)sin(t) - 1/2cos^2(t)) + A,\na(0) = 1 => A = 1.\n\nSo, a(t) = (1/5)(-cos(t)sin(t) - 1/2cos^2(t)) + 1.\n\nSolving the second equation:\n\ndb/dt = (1/5)(sin(t)cos(t) + cos^2(t)),\nb(t) = (1/5)(1/2sin^2(t) - cos(t)sin(t)) + B,\nb(0) = -1 => B = -1.\n\nSo, b(t) = (1/5)(1/2sin^2(t) - cos(t)sin(t)) - 1.\n\nSolving the third equation:\n\ndc/dt = (1/5)(2sin(t) + 2cos(t)),\nc(t) = (1/5)(-2cos(t) - 2sin(t)) + C,\nc(0) = 0 => C = 0.\n\nSo, c(t) = (1/5)(-2cos(t) - 2sin(t)).\n\nFinally, the parallel transport of v along the curve r(t) for 0≤t≤π/2 is given by:\n\nv(t) = <(1/5)(-cos(t)sin(t) - 1/2cos^2(t)) + 1, (1/5)(1/2sin^2(t) - cos(t)sin(t)) - 1, (1/5)(-2cos(t) - 2sin(t))>."
