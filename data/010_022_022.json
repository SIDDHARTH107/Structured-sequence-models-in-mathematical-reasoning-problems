Find the smallest non-negative integer $n$ such that there is a continuous map from $D$ to $S^2 - C$ that misses at least $n$ points of $S^2 - C$.",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the continuous map $f: D \\to S^2 - C$. Since $D$ is a closed disk, it is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional ball $B^2$. Therefore, we can think of the map as $f: B^2 \\to S^2 - C$. \n\nNow, let's consider the boundary of $B^2$, which is a circle $S^1$. Since $f$ is continuous, the image of the boundary $f(S^1)$ must be a closed curve in $S^2 - C$. Notice that $S^2 - C$ is homeomorphic to a cylinder, and any closed curve in a cylinder can be continuously deformed to a curve that wraps around the cylinder $k$ times for some integer $k$. This integer $k$ is called the winding number of the curve.\n\nIf the winding number $k = 0$, then the curve can be continuously deformed to a point, and the map $f$ can be extended to a continuous map from $B^2$ to $S^2 - C - \\{p\\}$, where $p$ is the point to which the curve is deformed. In this case, the map misses at least 1 point, so $n = 1$.\n\nIf the winding number $k \\neq 0$, then the curve cannot be continuously deformed to a point without passing through the equatorial circle $C$. In this case, the map $f$ cannot be extended to a continuous map from $B^2$ to $S^2 - C - \\{p\\}$ for any point $p$ in $S^2 - C$. Therefore, the map misses 0 points, so $n = 0$.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest non-negative integer $n$, we have $n = \\boxed{0}$."
