    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the continuity of the function f(x) over the interval [0, 2]. The function is defined piecewise, and we can see that it is continuous over the intervals (-1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 2). However, at the point x = 1, there is a jump discontinuity, since the function jumps from 1 to -1. Therefore, the function is not continuous over the entire interval [0, 2].\n\nNow, let's determine if the function has a Fourier series that converges pointwise to the original function over the interval [0, 2]. Since the function is piecewise continuous and has a finite number of jump discontinuities, it does have a Fourier series representation. The Fourier series converges pointwise to the original function at all points of continuity, and to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity.\n\nTo find the Fourier series for the function, we will use the formula for the Fourier series of a 2π-periodic function:\n\nf(x) = a₀/2 + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)], where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nHere, a₀ = (1/π)∫(f(x)dx) from -π to π, aₙ = (1/π)∫(f(x)cos(nx)dx) from -π to π, and bₙ = (1/π)∫(f(x)sin(nx)dx) from -π to π.\n\nHowever, since our function is defined over the interval [0, 2], we need to extend it to a 2π-periodic function. We can do this by defining f(x) = f(x + 2π) for all x. Now, we can compute the Fourier coefficients:\n\na₀ = 0, because the function is odd.\n\naₙ = 0, because the function is odd.\n\nbₙ = (1/π)∫(f(x)sin(nx)dx) from -π to π.\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, ..., we have:\n\nbₙ = (1/π)[∫(sin(nx)dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(-sin(nx)dx) from 0 to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π)[(-cos(nx)/n)| from -π to 0 + (cos(nx)/n)| from 0 to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π)[(2/n)(1 - cos(nπ))]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n, we have:\n\nbₙ = (1/π)[(2/n)(1 - (-1)^n)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the function:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(1/π)(2/n)(1 - (-1)^n)sin(nx)], where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThis Fourier series converges pointwise to the original function at all points of continuity, and to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity."
