    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 500 liters of water and 10 kg of salt. Assume that water containing 0.02 kg of salt per liter is pouring into the tank at a rate of 10 liters per minute, and the well-stirred mixture is flowing out of the tank at a rate of 8 liters per minute. Write and solve the differential equation giving the salt quantity S in the tank at any time t. What will be the salt quantity in the tank after 20 minutes?",
    "message_2": "Let S(t) be the amount of salt in the tank at time t. We want to find the rate of change of salt in the tank, which is given by the derivative dS/dt. The salt is entering the tank at a rate of 10 liters per minute, with a concentration of 0.02 kg of salt per liter, so the rate of salt entering the tank is 10 * 0.02 = 0.2 kg/min.\n\nThe salt is leaving the tank at a rate of 8 liters per minute. Since the mixture is well-stirred, the concentration of salt in the tank is uniform and equal to S(t) / (500 + 2t), where 500 + 2t is the total volume of the mixture in the tank at time t. So, the rate of salt leaving the tank is 8 * (S(t) / (500 + 2t)).\n\nNow we can write the differential equation for the rate of change of salt in the tank:\n\ndS/dt = 0.2 - 8 * (S(t) / (500 + 2t))\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt):\n\ne^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt) * dS/dt + e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt) * (-8 * (S(t) / (500 + 2t))) = 0.2 * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt)\n\nNow the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product S(t) * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt):\n\nd(S(t) * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt))/dt = 0.2 * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\nS(t) * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt) = ∫(0.2 * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt))dt + C\n\nNow we need to find the constant C using the initial condition S(0) = 10 kg:\n\n10 = C * e^0 => C = 10\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nS(t) * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt) = ∫(0.2 * e^(∫(-8/(500+2t))dt))dt + 10\n\nNow we need to find S(t) after 20 minutes:\n\nS(20) = (1 / e^(∫(-8/(500+2*20))dt)) * (∫(0.2 * e^(∫(-8/(500+2*20))dt))dt + 10)\n\nS(20) ≈ 10.96 kg\n\nSo, after 20 minutes, there will be approximately 10.96 kg of salt in the tank."
