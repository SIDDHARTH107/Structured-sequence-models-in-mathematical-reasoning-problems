    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(125)\n\nV = (500/3)π\n\nV ≈ (500/3) * 3.14159\n\nV ≈ 523.59878 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
