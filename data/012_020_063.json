    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph G is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of G, denoted Aut(G), is the set of all such automorphisms.\n\nTo find the automorphism group of G, we will look for all possible permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency. We can start by identifying the orbits of the graph, which are the sets of vertices that can be mapped to each other by an automorphism.\n\nFrom the adjacency matrix, we can see that the graph has the following orbits:\n\n1. {1, 5, 7}\n2. {2, 6}\n3. {3, 4}\n\nNow, we will look for automorphisms that map vertices within their orbits. We can represent an automorphism as a permutation in cycle notation. For example, (1 5 7) represents an automorphism that maps vertex 1 to vertex 5, vertex 5 to vertex 7, and vertex 7 back to vertex 1.\n\nHere are the possible automorphisms for each orbit:\n\n1. Orbit {1, 5, 7}: (1 5 7), (1 7 5)\n2. Orbit {2, 6}: (2 6), (6 2)\n3. Orbit {3, 4}: (3 4), (4 3)\n\nNow, we can combine these automorphisms to find all possible automorphisms of G. There are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible combinations:\n\n1. (1)(2)(3) = identity automorphism\n2. (1 5 7)(2)(3)\n3. (1 7 5)(2)(3)\n4. (1)(2 6)(3)\n5. (1 5 7)(2 6)(3)\n6. (1 7 5)(2 6)(3)\n7. (1)(2)(3 4)\n8. (1 5 7)(2)(3 4)\n9. (1 7 5)(2)(3 4)\n10. (1)(2 6)(3 4)\n11. (1 5 7)(2 6)(3 4)\n12. (1 7 5)(2 6)(3 4)\n\nSo, the automorphism group of G is:\n\nAut(G) = {(1)(2)(3), (1 5 7)(2)(3), (1 7 5)(2)(3), (1)(2 6)(3), (1 5 7)(2 6)(3), (1 7 5)(2 6)(3), (1)(2)(3 4), (1 5 7)(2)(3 4), (1 7 5)(2)(3 4), (1)(2 6)(3 4), (1 5 7)(2 6)(3 4), (1 7 5)(2 6)(3 4)}"
