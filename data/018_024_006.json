Find the symmetric difference between the complement of A and B, and compare it to the symmetric difference of the complement of A with the complement of B. Does the result demonstrate that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the complement of A, which we'll call A'. Since A = {1, 3, 5}, A' will be the set of all elements that are not in A. Let's assume the universal set U contains all elements from 1 to 6, so U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Then, A' = U - A = {2, 4, 6}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A' and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. So, (A' Δ B) = {x: x ∈ A' or x ∈ B, but not both}.\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6}\nB = {2, 4, 6}\n\nSince A' and B are identical, their symmetric difference (A' Δ B) is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNext, let's find the complement of B, which we'll call B'. Since B = {2, 4, 6}, B' will be the set of all elements that are not in B. So, B' = U - B = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A' and B'. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. So, (A' Δ B') = {x: x ∈ A' or x ∈ B', but not both}.\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6}\nB' = {1, 3, 5}\n\n(A' Δ B') = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's compare the symmetric difference between the complement of A and B (∅) to the symmetric difference of the complement of A with the complement of B ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}). These two results are not equal.\n\nThis demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement, as (A' Δ B) ≠ (A' Δ B')."
