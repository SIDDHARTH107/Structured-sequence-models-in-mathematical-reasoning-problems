    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: three pairs of opposite faces.\n\n1. The area of the front and back faces: 5cm x 8cm = 40cm² (each), so 40cm² x 2 = 80cm² (for both)\n2. The area of the top and bottom faces: 5cm x 10cm = 50cm² (each), so 50cm² x 2 = 100cm² (for both)\n3. The area of the left and right faces: 8cm x 10cm = 80cm² (each), so 80cm² x 2 = 160cm² (for both)\n\nNow, add the areas of all six faces together:\n80cm² (front and back) + 100cm² (top and bottom) + 160cm² (left and right) = 340cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 340cm²."
