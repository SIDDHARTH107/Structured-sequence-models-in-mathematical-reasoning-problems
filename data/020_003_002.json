    "message_1": "A manufacturing company can produce two products: chairs and tables. The manufacturing process for each product requires the use of two machines: machine A and machine B. The time required to produce one chair is 2 hours in machine A and 1 hour in machine B. The time required to produce one table is 3 hours in machine A and 1 hour in machine B. The company has 600 hours available on machine A and 200 hours available on machine B each week. If the profit per chair is $20 and the profit per table is $40, how many chairs and tables should the company produce each week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced each week. The constraints for the available hours on machines A and B can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 600 (Machine A)\nx + y ≤ 200 (Machine B)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 40y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the inequality x + y ≤ 200 for y:\n\ny ≤ 200 - x\n\nNow, we will graph the inequalities on the xy-plane:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 600\n2. y ≤ 200 - x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. To find the vertices of the feasible region, we will find the points where the inequalities intersect:\n\nIntersection of inequality 1 and 2:\n2x + 3(200 - x) = 600\n2x + 600 - 3x = 600\n-x = -600 + 600\nx = 0\ny = 200 - 0 = 200\nVertex 1: (0, 200)\n\nIntersection of inequality 1 and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 3(0) = 600\n2x = 600\nx = 300\nVertex 2: (300, 0)\n\nIntersection of inequality 2 and y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + y = 200\ny = 200\nVertex 3: (0, 200)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 40y at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 200) = 20(0) + 40(200) = $8,000\nP(300, 0) = 20(300) + 40(0) = $6,000\nP(0, 200) = 20(0) + 40(200) = $8,000\n\nThe maximum profit of $8,000 occurs when the company produces 0 chairs and 200 tables each week."
