    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product at a cost of $50 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by the equation: \n\n    p = 200 - 0.5q \n\nwhere p is the price in dollars and q is the quantity demanded in units. What price should the company set to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "To maximize revenue, we need to find the price (p) that maximizes the product of price (p) and quantity demanded (q). Revenue (R) can be expressed as:\n\nR = p * q\n\nWe are given the demand function:\n\np = 200 - 0.5q\n\nWe can rewrite the revenue function in terms of q:\n\nR(q) = (200 - 0.5q) * q\n\nR(q) = 200q - 0.5q^2\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the revenue function with respect to q and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndR(q)/dq = 200 - q\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for q:\n\n0 = 200 - q\nq = 200\n\nNow, plug the value of q back into the demand function to find the price:\n\np = 200 - 0.5(200)\np = 200 - 100\np = 100\n\nSo, the company should set the price at $100 per unit to maximize their revenue."
