    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion for f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - i)^2 centered at z = i, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z - i). Let w = z - i, so z = w + i. Then, the function becomes:\n\nf(w) = ((w + i)^2 - 1) / w^2\n\nNow, we expand the numerator:\n\nf(w) = (w^2 + 2iw - 1) / w^2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as a sum of simpler functions:\n\nf(w) = (w^2 / w^2) + (2iw / w^2) - (1 / w^2)\n\nf(w) = 1 + 2i/w - 1/w^2\n\nNow, we can write the Laurent series expansion for f(w) centered at w = 0:\n\nf(w) = 1 + 2iΣ(w^n / n!) - Σ(w^n / n!^2)\n\nSince the function is already in the form of a Laurent series, we can write it as:\n\nf(w) = 1 + 2i/w - 1/w^2\n\nNow, we substitute back z = w + i:\n\nf(z) = 1 + 2i/(z - i) - 1/(z - i)^2\n\nThe radius of convergence for a Laurent series is determined by the nearest singularity to the center of the expansion. In this case, the center is z = i, and the only singularity is also at z = i. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 0."
