    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's introduce the Hamiltonian H, which is given by:\n\nH(y, p, u) = (y - 1)^2 + u^2 + p(u - 2y - 2y')\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for the optimal control are given by:\n\n1. The state equation: y''(t) + 2y'(t) + 2y(t) = u(t)\n2. The costate equation: -p'(t) = ∂H/∂y = 2(y - 1) - 2p\n3. The transversality condition: p(1) = 0\n4. The optimality condition: ∂H/∂u = 0\n\nNow, let's solve the optimality condition:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u + p = 0 => u(t) = -p(t)/2\n\nNow, we need to solve the costate equation:\n\n-p'(t) = 2(y - 1) - 2p => p'(t) = 2p - 2(y - 1)\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor. Let's multiply both sides by e^(2t):\n\ne^(2t)p'(t) + 2e^(2t)p(t) = 2e^(2t)(y(t) - 1)\n\nNow, the left side is the derivative of the product e^(2t)p(t):\n\nd/dt (e^(2t)p(t)) = 2e^(2t)(y(t) - 1)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(e^(2t)p(t)) = ∫2(y(t) - 1)e^(2t) dt\n\ne^(2t)p(t) = ∫2(y(t) - 1)e^(2t) dt + C\n\nNow, we use the transversality condition p(1) = 0:\n\ne^(2)p(1) = ∫2(y(t) - 1)e^(2t) dt + C => C = -e^(2)p(1) = 0\n\nSo, we have:\n\np(t) = (1/e^(2t)) ∫2(y(t) - 1)e^(2t) dt\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for u(t) back into the state equation:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + 2y(t) = -p(t)/2\n\nThis is a second-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation. We can solve it using the method of variation of parameters. First, let's find the complementary solution yc(t) by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + 2y(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 2r + 2 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = -1 ± i\n\nSo, the complementary solution is:\n\nyc(t) = e^(-t)(Acos(t) + Bsin(t))\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution yp(t). Since the right-hand side of the inhomogeneous equation is -p(t)/2, we can write:\n\nyp(t) = -1/2 ∫p(t) dt = -1/2 ∫(1/e^(2t)) ∫2(y(t) - 1)e^(2t) dt dt\n\nNow, we can find the general solution y(t) = yc(t) + yp(t) and apply the boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(1) = 0 to find the constants A and B.\n\nFinally, we can find the optimal control u(t) = -p(t)/2 and the corresponding optimal state y(t) by substituting the values of A and B back into the expressions for y(t) and p(t)."
