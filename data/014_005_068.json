    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using the RSA encryption scheme with a public key (e, n) = (11, 55). The plaintext message is represented as a number m = 6. Calculate the corresponding ciphertext c.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the ciphertext c using the RSA encryption scheme, we use the formula:\n\nc ≡ m^e (mod n)\n\nwhere m is the plaintext message, e is the public exponent, and n is the modulus.\n\nIn this case, m = 6, e = 11, and n = 55. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nc ≡ 6^11 (mod 55)\n\nCalculating 6^11, we get:\n\n6^11 = 362797056\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 362797056 is divided by 55:\n\n362797056 (mod 55) = 51\n\nSo, the ciphertext c is 51."
