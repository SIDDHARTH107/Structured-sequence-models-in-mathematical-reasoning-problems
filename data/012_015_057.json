    "message_2": "To determine whether a graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 6, so a connected graph must have at least 5 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 7 edges, which is more than the minimum required for a connected graph, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as it is also possible to have a disconnected graph with more than the minimum required edges.\n\nTo conclusively determine whether the graph is connected or disconnected, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges."
