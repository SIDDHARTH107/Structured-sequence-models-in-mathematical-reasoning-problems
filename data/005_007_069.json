    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r), we can use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / [(n - 1) * s_x * s_y]\n\nwhere xi and yi are the individual data points, x_mean and y_mean are the means of the respective variables, n is the number of data points, and s_x and s_y are the standard deviations of the respective variables.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerator of the formula:\n\nΣ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] = (3 - 4)(75 - 82) + (3.5 - 4)(78 - 82) + (4 - 4)(80 - 82) + (4.5 - 4)(83 - 82) + (5 - 4)(85 - 82) + (5.5 - 4)(88 - 82) + (6 - 4)(90 - 82) + (6.5 - 4)(92 - 82) + (7 - 4)(95 - 82) + (7.5 - 4)(97 - 82)\n\n= (-1)(-7) + (-0.5)(-4) + (0)(-2) + (0.5)(1) + (1)(3) + (1.5)(6) + (2)(8) + (2.5)(10) + (3)(13) + (3.5)(15)\n\n= 7 + 2 + 0 + 0.5 + 3 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 39 + 52.5\n\n= 154\n\nNow, let's calculate the denominator of the formula:\n\n(n - 1) * s_x * s_y = (10 - 1) * 1.5 * 5 = 9 * 7.5 = 67.5\n\nFinally, let's calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 154 / 67.5 ≈ 2.2815\n\nHowever, the correlation coefficient should be between -1 and 1. It seems there is a mistake in the given data or calculations. Please double-check the data and calculations."
