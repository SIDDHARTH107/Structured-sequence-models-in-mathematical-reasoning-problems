    "message_2": "Let's analyze each case separately:\n\n1. Isomorphisms between G and C12 (cyclic group of order 12):\n\nSince C12 is a cyclic group of order 12, it has a generator, say g, such that C12 = {1, g, g^2, ..., g^11}. If G is isomorphic to C12, then G must also be cyclic and have a generator, say h. The isomorphism φ: G → C12 can be defined as φ(h^k) = g^k for k = 0, 1, ..., 11. This is the only possible isomorphism between G and C12, and it exists if and only if G is a cyclic group of order 12.\n\n2. Isomorphisms between G and A4 (alternating group of order 12):\n\nThe group A4 is the set of all even permutations of 4 elements, and it has order 12. A4 is not cyclic, as it does not have an element of order 12. If G is isomorphic to A4, then G must have the same structure as A4. In particular, G must have the following properties:\n\n- G is not cyclic.\n- G has three elements of order 2.\n- G has eight elements of order 3.\n\nIf G has these properties, then there exists an isomorphism φ: G → A4. However, finding an explicit isomorphism can be challenging, as it depends on the specific structure of G. In general, there is no unique isomorphism between G and A4, and there may be multiple isomorphisms or none at all, depending on the structure of G.\n\n3. Isomorphisms between G and D6 (dihedral group of order 12):\n\nThe dihedral group D6 consists of the symmetries of a regular hexagon, and it has order 12. D6 has the following structure:\n\n- D6 has a cyclic subgroup of order 6, generated by a rotation r.\n- D6 has six elements of order 2, corresponding to the reflections s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4, and sr^5.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to D6, then G must have the same structure as D6. In particular, G must have a cyclic subgroup of order 6 and six elements of order 2. If G has this structure, then there exists an isomorphism φ: G → D6. As in the case of A4, finding an explicit isomorphism can be challenging and depends on the specific structure of G. In general, there is no unique isomorphism between G and D6, and there may be multiple isomorphisms or none at all, depending on the structure of G.\n\nIn summary, to find all possible isomorphisms between a group G of order 12 and the groups C12, A4, and D6, one must analyze the structure of G and determine whether it has the necessary properties to be isomorphic to each of these groups. If G has the required properties, then there exists at least one isomorphism between G and the corresponding group, but finding an explicit isomorphism can be challenging and depends on the specific structure of G."
