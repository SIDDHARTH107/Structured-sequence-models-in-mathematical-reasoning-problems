    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+2) - log(x-2) = log(5), we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this property, we get:\n\nlog((x+2)/(x-2)) = log(5)\n\nNow, since the logarithms are equal, we can set the arguments equal to each other:\n\n(x+2)/(x-2) = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\n5(x-2) = (x+2)\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n5x - 10 = x + 2\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n4x - 10 = 2\n\nAdding 10 to both sides, we get:\n\n4x = 12\n\nDividing by 4, we get:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution for x is 3."
