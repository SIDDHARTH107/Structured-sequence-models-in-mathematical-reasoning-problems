    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value of the number in the nth row and kth column can be found using the combination formula: C(n-1, k-1), where n is the row number and k is the column number.\n\nFor the 9th row and 4th column, we have:\n\nC(9-1, 4-1) = C(8, 3)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, the value of the number in the 9th row and 4th column of Pascal's triangle is 56."
