    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the differential equation for exponential growth:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population, k is the growth rate, and P is the population at a given time t.\n\nGiven that the population is growing at a rate of 2% per year, we have k = 0.02. The initial population is P(0) = 10,000. We want to find the population after 10 years, so we need to solve for P(10).\n\nFirst, we need to solve the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.02P\n\nTo solve this, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = 0.02 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.02 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.02t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 10,000:\n\nln(10,000) = 0.02(0) + C\n\nC = ln(10,000)\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\nln(P) = 0.02t + ln(10,000)\n\nTo find P(10), we can plug in t = 10:\n\nln(P) = 0.02(10) + ln(10,000)\n\nln(P) = 0.2 + ln(10,000)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.2 + ln(10,000))\n\nP = e^0.2 * e^ln(10,000)\n\nP = e^0.2 * 10,000\n\nP ≈ 1.2214 * 10,000\n\nP ≈ 12,214\n\nSo, the population after 10 years will be approximately 12,214."
