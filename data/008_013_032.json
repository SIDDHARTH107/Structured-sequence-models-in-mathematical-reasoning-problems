    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as AX = B, where:\n\nA = | 3  1 -1 |\n    | 1 -2  4 |\n    | 2  3  1 |\n\nB = |  6 |\n    | -7 |\n    |  2 |\n\nNow, let's perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\n1. First, we'll find the L and U matrices:\n\nU = | 3    1   -1 |\n    | 0  -2.333  4.333 |\n    | 0    0    4.8 |\n\nL = | 1    0    0 |\n    | 1/3  1    0 |\n    | 2/3  1.4  1 |\n\n2. Now, we'll solve the equation LY = B for Y:\n\nL = | 1    0    0 |     Y = | Y1 |     B = |  6 |\n    | 1/3  1    0 |         | Y2 |         | -7 |\n    | 2/3  1.4  1 |         | Y3 |         |  2 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nY1 = 6\nY2 = -9\nY3 = 1\n\nSo, Y = |  6 |\n        | -9 |\n        |  1 |\n\n3. Finally, we'll solve the equation UX = Y for X:\n\nU = | 3    1   -1 |     X = | x |     Y = |  6 |\n    | 0  -2.333  4.333 |         | y |         | -9 |\n    | 0    0    4.8 |         | z |         |  1 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 0.208333\n\nSo, X = |  1   |\n        |  2   |\n        |  0.208333 |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z â‰ˆ 0.208333."
