    "message_1": "Sure, here's a knapsack problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA burglar is trying to steal items from a store, but they can only carry a maximum weight of 15 pounds in their knapsack. The items available are: a gold watch that weighs 6 pounds and is worth $6000, a laptop that weighs 4 pounds and is worth $2000, a camera that weighs 3 pounds and is worth $1000, and a set of diamond earrings that weigh 2 pounds and are worth $4000. Which items should the burglar choose to steal in order to maximize their total value while staying within the weight limit of their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm to find the items with the highest value-to-weight ratio. First, we calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item:\n\n1. Gold watch: $6000 / 6 lbs = $1000/lb\n2. Laptop: $2000 / 4 lbs = $500/lb\n3. Camera: $1000 / 3 lbs = $333.33/lb\n4. Diamond earrings: $4000 / 2 lbs = $2000/lb\n\nNow, we sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio in descending order:\n\n1. Diamond earrings: $2000/lb\n2. Gold watch: $1000/lb\n3. Laptop: $500/lb\n4. Camera: $333.33/lb\n\nNext, we start adding items to the knapsack, starting with the highest value-to-weight ratio item, until we reach the weight limit:\n\n1. Add diamond earrings: 2 lbs, $4000\n2. Add gold watch: 6 lbs, $6000 (total weight: 8 lbs, total value: $10,000)\n3. Add laptop: 4 lbs, $2000 (total weight: 12 lbs, total value: $12,000)\n4. We cannot add the camera because it would exceed the weight limit (12 lbs + 3 lbs = 15 lbs).\n\nSo, the burglar should steal the diamond earrings, gold watch, and laptop for a total value of $12,000 and a total weight of 12 pounds."
