    "message_1": "A ladder, leaning against a wall, is 12 meters long and makes a 65-degree angle with the ground. How far up the wall does the ladder reach?",
    "message_2": "To find how far up the wall the ladder reaches, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side (the height up the wall) to the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder) in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 65 degrees, and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, which is 12 meters.\n\nsin(65) = height up the wall / 12\n\nTo find the height up the wall, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight up the wall = sin(65) * 12\n\nNow, we can calculate the sine of 65 degrees and multiply it by 12:\n\nheight up the wall ≈ 0.8988 * 12\nheight up the wall ≈ 10.78 meters\n\nSo, the ladder reaches approximately 10.78 meters up the wall."
