    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the given differential equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is formed by replacing y'' with r^2, y' with r, and y with 1:\n\nr^2 + 3r + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can factor the equation as follows:\n\n(r + 1)(r + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two roots: r1 = -1 and r2 = -2.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution to the differential equation using these roots:\n\ny(x) = C1 * e^(-1x) + C2 * e^(-2x)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants."
