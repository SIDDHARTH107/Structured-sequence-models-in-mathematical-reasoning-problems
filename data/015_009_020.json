    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map given by x(n+1) = r*x(n)*(1-x(n)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLyapunov exponent (λ) = ln(abs(r - 2*r*x(n)))\n\nFor r=4, we will calculate the first 5 Lyapunov exponents using different initial values of x(n). Let's choose x(1) = 0.1, x(2) = 0.2, x(3) = 0.3, x(4) = 0.4, and x(5) = 0.5.\n\n1. For x(1) = 0.1:\nλ(1) = ln(abs(4 - 2*4*0.1)) = ln(abs(4 - 0.8)) = ln(3.2) ≈ 1.163\n\n2. For x(2) = 0.2:\nλ(2) = ln(abs(4 - 2*4*0.2)) = ln(abs(4 - 1.6)) = ln(2.4) ≈ 0.875\n\n3. For x(3) = 0.3:\nλ(3) = ln(abs(4 - 2*4*0.3)) = ln(abs(4 - 2.4)) = ln(1.6) ≈ 0.470\n\n4. For x(4) = 0.4:\nλ(4) = ln(abs(4 - 2*4*0.4)) = ln(abs(4 - 3.2)) = ln(0.8) ≈ -0.223\n\n5. For x(5) = 0.5:\nλ(5) = ln(abs(4 - 2*4*0.5)) = ln(abs(4 - 4)) = ln(0) = -∞\n\nThe first 5 Lyapunov exponents are 1.163, 0.875, 0.470, -0.223, and -∞. Since at least one of the Lyapunov exponents is positive (1.163), the system is considered chaotic. Note that the Lyapunov exponent becomes negative or -∞ for some values of x(n), which indicates that the system may exhibit both chaotic and non-chaotic behavior depending on the initial conditions."
