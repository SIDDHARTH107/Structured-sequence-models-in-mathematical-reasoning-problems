    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of circular permutations and the Polya's Enumeration Theorem (also known as the Burnside's Lemma).\n\nFirst, let's consider arranging the balls in a straight line. There are 12 balls in total, so there are 12! ways to arrange them. However, since the 8 black balls are identical and the 4 white balls are identical, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the identical balls. So, there are (12!)/(8!4!) ways to arrange the balls in a straight line.\n\nNow, let's consider arranging the balls in a circle. Since the circle has rotational symmetry, we need to divide the number of linear arrangements by the number of positions in the circle to account for the symmetry. There are 12 positions in the circle, so we divide the number of linear arrangements by 12:\n\nNumber of circular arrangements = (12!)/(8!4! * 12)\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer because we have not yet considered the rotational symmetry of the circle. To do this, we will use Polya's Enumeration Theorem.\n\nThere are 12 positions in the circle, so there are 12 possible rotations. We will now count the number of arrangements that are fixed under each rotation.\n\n1. Identity rotation (0 positions): All arrangements are fixed, so there are (12!)/(8!4!) fixed arrangements.\n\n2. 1-position rotation: No arrangements are fixed, as rotating by 1 position will always change the arrangement.\n\n3. 2-position rotation: No arrangements are fixed, as rotating by 2 positions will always change the arrangement.\n\n4. 3-position rotation: No arrangements are fixed, as rotating by 3 positions will always change the arrangement.\n\n5. 4-position rotation: No arrangements are fixed, as rotating by 4 positions will always change the arrangement.\n\n6. 6-position rotation: No arrangements are fixed, as rotating by 6 positions will always change the arrangement.\n\n7. 12-position rotation (full circle): All arrangements are fixed, so there are (12!)/(8!4!) fixed arrangements.\n\nNow, we apply Polya's Enumeration Theorem:\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements up to rotation = (Number of fixed arrangements under each rotation) / (Number of rotations)\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = [(12!)/(8!4!) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + (12!)/(8!4!)] / 12\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = (2 * (12!))/(8!4! * 12)\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = (12!)/(8!4! * 6)\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9)/(4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = 11 * 10 * 3\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = 330\n\nSo, there are 330 ways to arrange the 8 identical black balls and 4 identical white balls in a circle up to rotation symmetry."
