    "message_1": "A farmer has 1000 acres of land to plant corn and wheat. Each acre of corn requires 4 hours of labor and 2 pounds of fertilizer, and produces a profit of $100. Each acre of wheat requires 6 hours of labor and 3 pounds of fertilizer, and produces a profit of $150. The farmer has 2000 hours of labor and 1200 pounds of fertilizer. How many acres of corn and wheat should the farmer plant to maximize their profit?",

We are given the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 1000 (total acres)\n2. 4x + 6y ≤ 2000 (total labor hours)\n3. 2x + 3y ≤ 1200 (total fertilizer)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 100x + 150y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ 1000 - x\n2. y ≤ (2000 - 4x) / 6\n3. y ≤ (1200 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of these inequalities:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n1000 - x = (2000 - 4x) / 6\n6(1000 - x) = 2000 - 4x\n6000 - 6x = 2000 - 4x\n4000 = 2x\nx = 2000 / 2\nx = 1000\n\ny = 1000 - x\ny = 1000 - 1000\ny = 0\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\n1000 - x = (1200 - 2x) / 3\n3(1000 - x) = 1200 - 2x\n3000 - 3x = 1200 - 2x\n1800 = x\nx = 1800\n\ny = 1000 - x\ny = 1000 - 1800\ny = -800 (not possible since y must be non-negative)\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\n(2000 - 4x) / 6 = (1200 - 2x) / 3\n2(2000 - 4x) = 3(1200 - 2x)\n4000 - 8x = 3600 - 6x\n400 = 2x\nx = 200\n\ny = (2000 - 4x) / 6\ny = (2000 - 4(200)) / 6\ny = (2000 - 800) / 6\ny = 1200 / 6\ny = 200\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nP(1000, 0) = 100(1000) + 150(0) = $100,000\nP(200, 200) = 100(200) + 150(200) = $50,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the farmer plants 1000 acres of corn and 0 acres of wheat, resulting in a profit of $100,000."
