    "message_2": "The given sequence is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. We can observe that each number is double the previous number:\n\n2 × 2 = 4\n4 × 2 = 8\n8 × 2 = 16\n16 × 2 = 32\n\nSo, to find the next number in the sequence, we should double the last number:\n\n32 × 2 = 64\n\nHence, the next number in the sequence is 64."
