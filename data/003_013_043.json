    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation. In this problem, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (40 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point to the base of the building (30 meters).\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = 40 / 30\ntan(θ) = 4 / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ whose tangent is 4/3. We can use the arctangent (inverse tangent) function to do this:\n\nθ = arctan(4/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum angle of elevation to the top of the building from a point 30 meters away from the base is approximately 53.13 degrees."
