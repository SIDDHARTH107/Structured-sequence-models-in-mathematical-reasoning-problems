    "message_1": "A store offers 5 different types of shirts, and a customer wants to purchase 3 of them. How many different options does the customer have if they can choose any combination of shirts?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, the customer has 5 different types of shirts to choose from (n = 5) and wants to purchase 3 of them (r = 3).\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo, the customer has 10 different options to choose any combination of 3 shirts from the 5 available types."
