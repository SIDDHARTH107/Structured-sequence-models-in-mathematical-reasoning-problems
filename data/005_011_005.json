    "message_1": "A student wants to conduct an experiment to test the effectiveness of two different study methods, A and B. They randomly select 35 students from their class and assign 17 to use method A and 18 to use method B. After a week of studying, the student measures each student's test score. The average test score for students using method A is 78 and the average score for students using method B is 85. \n\nCan the student conclude with 95% confidence that method B is more effective than method A in improving test scores? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference between the two study methods with 95% confidence, we will perform a two-sample t-test. We need the following information:\n\n1. Sample sizes (n1 and n2)\n2. Sample means (x̄1 and x̄2)\n3. Sample standard deviations (s1 and s2)\n4. Significance level (α)\n\nWe are given the sample sizes and means:\n\nn1 = 17 (method A)\nx̄1 = 78 (method A)\n\nn2 = 18 (method B)\nx̄2 = 85 (method B)\n\nHowever, we are not given the sample standard deviations (s1 and s2). Without this information, we cannot perform a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the two study methods with 95% confidence.\n\nIf the student were to provide the standard deviations for each group, we could proceed with the t-test."
