    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve in Trigonometry using the law of sines to solve triangles:\n\nA triangle has two known angles: angle A is 56° and angle B is 72°. The length of the side opposite angle B is 12 cm. Find the length of the sides opposite angle A and angle C.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first find angle C, and then use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of the sides opposite angle A and angle C.\n\nStep 1: Find angle C\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we can find angle C by subtracting the other two angles from 180°:\n\nAngle C = 180° - Angle A - Angle B\nAngle C = 180° - 56° - 72°\nAngle C = 180° - 128°\nAngle C = 52°\n\nStep 2: Use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of the sides opposite angle A and angle C\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe know the values of angle A, angle B, angle C, and side b (opposite angle B). We can use this information to find the lengths of sides a (opposite angle A) and c (opposite angle C).\n\na / sin(56°) = 12 / sin(72°)\na = (12 * sin(56°)) / sin(72°)\na ≈ 10.39 cm\n\nc / sin(52°) = 12 / sin(72°)\nc = (12 * sin(52°)) / sin(72°)\nc ≈ 9.47 cm\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite angle A is approximately 10.39 cm, and the length of the side opposite angle C is approximately 9.47 cm."
