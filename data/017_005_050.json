    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Recall that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group G, denoted by n_p, satisfies:\n\n1. n_p divides |G|\n2. n_p ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nLet G be a group of order 8. Since 8 = 2^3, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, n_2 divides 8 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 8.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup of G (by the Sylow Theorems). Let P be this unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Since |P| = 2^3 = 8, P is a subgroup of order 8, which means P = G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 8 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 8\nIf there are 8 Sylow 2-subgroups, then each of them has order 2^2 = 4. Let P be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since |P| = 4, there are two possibilities for P: either P is cyclic, or P is isomorphic to the Klein four-group (V_4), which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nIf P is cyclic, then P is isomorphic to Z_4, the cyclic group of order 4. Let Q be a subgroup of G such that |Q| = 2. Since the order of G is 8, the intersection of P and Q must be the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of order 4 and 2, respectively.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to V_4, then G has a normal subgroup of order 4 that is isomorphic to V_4. Let Q be a subgroup of G such that |Q| = 2. Since the order of G is 8, the intersection of P and Q must be the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are groups of order 4 and 2, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 8, then either G is cyclic (Case 1) or G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a group of order 4 (Case 2)."
