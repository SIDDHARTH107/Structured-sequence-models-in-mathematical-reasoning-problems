    "message_2": "A cyclic group G of order 12 is generated by an element a, such that a^12 = e (identity element). The possible orders of the subgroups of G are the divisors of the order of G.\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Therefore, the possible orders of the subgroups of G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12."
