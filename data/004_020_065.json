    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in pulling the block to 2 m, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = -k * x\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nIn this case, the spring constant k is 50 N/m, and the displacement x is 2 m - 0.5 m = 1.5 m (since the un-stretched length of the spring is 0.5 m).\n\nNow, we can calculate the force exerted by the spring:\n\nF = -50 N/m * 1.5 m = -75 N\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the displacement, which is expected for a spring.\n\nTo find the work done by the force, we can use the formula:\n\nW = F * x\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force, and x is the displacement.\n\nIn this case, the force F is -75 N, and the displacement x is 1.5 m:\n\nW = -75 N * 1.5 m = -112.5 J\n\nThe work done by the force in pulling the block to 2 m is -112.5 J. The negative sign indicates that the work is done against the force exerted by the spring."
