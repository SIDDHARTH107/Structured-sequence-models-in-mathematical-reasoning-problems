    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a statistical design that allows us to test multiple factors and their interactions efficiently. The notation for an orthogonal array is OA(N, k, s, t), where N is the number of runs (rows), k is the number of factors (columns), s is the number of levels for each factor, and t is the strength of the array (the level of interaction between factors).\n\nIn this case, we have 6 factors (k = 6) and each factor has 4 levels (s = 4). We want to find the minimum size of the orthogonal array needed, which means finding the smallest N.\n\nTo find the smallest N, we can use the inequality:\n\nN ≥ s^t * (k - 1) / (t - 1)\n\nSince we want to test all possible combinations of these factors, we need to consider the highest level of interaction, which is t = k = 6. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nN ≥ 4^6 * (6 - 1) / (6 - 1)\nN ≥ 4^6 * 5 / 5\nN ≥ 4^6\nN ≥ 4096\n\nSo, the minimum size of the orthogonal array needed is 4096."
