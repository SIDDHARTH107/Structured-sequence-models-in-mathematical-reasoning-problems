    "message_2": "To optimize the values of x and y, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's define the objective function f(x, y) = x + y, and the constraint function g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 50. We want to find the maximum of f(x, y) subject to the constraint g(x, y) = 0.\n\nThe Lagrange function is given by L(x, y, λ) = f(x, y) - λg(x, y) = x + y - λ(x^2 + y^2 - 50).\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L and set it to zero:\n\n∇L = (∂L/∂x, ∂L/∂y, ∂L/∂λ) = (1 - 2λx, 1 - 2λy, -x^2 - y^2 + 50).\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1 - 2λx = 0\n1 - 2λy = 0\n-x^2 - y^2 + 50 = 0\n\nSolving the first two equations for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 1/(2x) = 1/(2y)\n\nSince x + y = 10, we can substitute y = 10 - x into the equation for λ:\n\n1/(2x) = 1/(2(10 - x))\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n10 - x = x\nx = 5\n\nNow, substituting x = 5 back into the equation x + y = 10, we find:\n\n5 + y = 10\ny = 5\n\nSo, the values of x and y that maximize both variables simultaneously are x = 5 and y = 5."
