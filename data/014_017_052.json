    "message_2": "To perform a frequency analysis of the encrypted message, we need to calculate the percentage of each letter's occurrence in the message. \n\nTotal characters in the message = 150\n\nFrequency of 'e' = 30 times\nFrequency of 'a' = 20 times\nFrequency of 'm' = 10 times\nFrequency of 'q' = 5 times\n\nPercentage of 'e' = (30/150) * 100 = 20%\nPercentage of 'a' = (20/150) * 100 = 13.33%\nPercentage of 'm' = (10/150) * 100 = 6.67%\nPercentage of 'q' = (5/150) * 100 = 3.33%\n\nSince all other letters appear less than 5 times, their individual percentages will be less than 3.33%. \n\nSo, the frequency analysis of the encrypted message is as follows:\n\n'e' - 20%\n'a' - 13.33%\n'm' - 6.67%\n'q' - 3.33%\nAll other letters - less than 3.33% each"
