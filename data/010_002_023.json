    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is both open and closed. \n\n1. The closure of A in X is the smallest closed set containing A. Since A is already closed in the discrete topology, the closure of A is A itself. So, the closure of A is {1,2}.\n\n2. The interior of B in X is the largest open set contained in B. Since B is already open in the discrete topology, the interior of B is B itself. So, the interior of B is {2,3}.\n\n3. In a discrete space, a sequence converges to a point if and only if it is eventually constant, i.e., it takes the value of that point from some term onwards. Since X has only three points, any convergent sequence in X must converge to either 1, 2, or 3. If a sequence converges to 1, it is eventually in A. If it converges to 2, it is in both A and B. If it converges to 3, it is in B. Therefore, there is no convergent sequence in X that does not converge to any point in A or B."
