    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the number of triangles in the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = (4^n - 1) / (4 - 1)\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 6th iteration:\n\nNumber of triangles = (4^6 - 1) / (4 - 1)\nNumber of triangles = (4096 - 1) / 3\nNumber of triangles = 4095 / 3\nNumber of triangles = 1365\n\nSo, there will be 1365 triangles in the 6th iteration of constructing the Sierpinski pyramid."
