    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors v and u, we can use the following formula:\n\nv x u = (v_y * u_z - v_z * u_y)i - (v_x * u_z - v_z * u_x)j + (v_x * u_y - v_y * u_x)k\n\nGiven the vectors v = 5i - 2j + 3k and u = 2i + 4j - 6k, we can identify the components as follows:\n\nv_x = 5, v_y = -2, v_z = 3\nu_x = 2, u_y = 4, u_z = -6\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nv x u = ((-2) * (-6) - 3 * 4)i - (5 * (-6) - 3 * 2)j + (5 * 4 - (-2) * 2)k\n\nv x u = (12 - 12)i - (-30 - 6)j + (20 + 4)k\n\nv x u = 0i + 36j + 24k\n\nSo, the cross product of the two vectors v and u is:\n\nv x u = 36j + 24k"
