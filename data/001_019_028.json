    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 5| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 5 = 7\nIn this case, we can solve for x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation and then dividing by 3:\n\n3x = 12\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 3x - 5 = -7\nIn this case, we can solve for x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation and then dividing by 3:\n\n3x = -2\nx = -2/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 4 and -2/3."
