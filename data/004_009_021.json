    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^3 + 4x^2)(5x - 1) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^3 + 4x^2\nv(x) = 5x - 1\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^3 + 4x^2)/dx = 6x^2 + 8x\nv'(x) = d(5x - 1)/dx = 5\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In other words:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we can plug in the derivatives and original functions we found earlier:\n\nf'(x) = (6x^2 + 8x)(5x - 1) + (2x^3 + 4x^2)(5)\n\nNow, we can distribute and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = (30x^3 - 6x^2 + 40x^2 - 8x) + (10x^3 + 20x^2)\n\nf'(x) = 30x^3 + 34x^2 - 8x + 10x^3 + 20x^2\n\nFinally, combine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 40x^3 + 54x^2 - 8x\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^3 + 4x^2)(5x - 1) using the product rule is:\n\nf'(x) = 40x^3 + 54x^2 - 8x"
