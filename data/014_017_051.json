    "message_1": "A cryptographer has intercepted a secret message that has been encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The cryptographer suspects that this cipher uses the English alphabet (26 letters) and knows that the letter \"E\" appears most frequently in English text. The cryptographer conducts a frequency analysis of the ciphertext and determines that the letter \"T\" appears most frequently. How many letters of the ciphertext need to be analyzed to be certain that \"T\" is used to represent \"E\"?",
    "message_2": "It is not possible to be absolutely certain that \"T\" is used to represent \"E\" just by analyzing the frequency of letters in the ciphertext. Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers can have multiple solutions, and the frequency analysis only provides a clue to the possible substitution. To be certain, the cryptographer would need additional information, such as the context of the message or a partial decryption key. However, analyzing a larger sample of the ciphertext can increase the confidence in the assumption that \"T\" represents \"E,\" but certainty cannot be guaranteed."
