    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n| 2 -3  4 |  9 |\n| 1  2 -1 | -1 |\n| 3  1  2 | 14 |\n```\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We can start by subtracting 1/2 of the first row from the second row and 3/2 of the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4 |   9  |\n|  0   3.5 -3 |  -5.5|\n|  0   5.5  0 |  -0.5|\n```\n\nNow, we can divide the second row by 3.5 and the third row by 5.5:\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4 |   9  |\n|  0   1  -6/7 | -5/7 |\n|  0   1   0  | -1/11|\n```\n\nNext, we can subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4  |   9   |\n|  0   1  -6/7 | -5/7  |\n|  0   0   6/7 | -6/77 |\n```\n\nNow, we can multiply the third row by 7/6 to get a leading 1 in the last row:\n\n```\n|  2  -3   4  |   9   |\n|  0   1  -6/7 | -5/7  |\n|  0   0   1   | -7/11 |\n```\n\nFinally, we can use back-substitution to find the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. From the last row, we have:\n\n```\nz = -7/11\n```\n\nSubstituting this value into the second row, we get:\n\n```\ny - 6/7(-7/11) = -5/7\ny + 6/11 = -5/7\ny = -5/7 - 6/11\ny = (-55 - 42) / 77\ny = -97/77\n```\n\nSubstituting the values of `y` and `z` into the first row, we get:\n\n```\n2x - 3(-97/77) + 4(-7/11) = 9\n2x + 291/77 - 28/11 = 9\n2x = 9 - 291/77 + 28/11\n2x = (693 - 291 + 176) / 77\n2x = 578/77\nx = 289/77\n```\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 289/77\ny = -97/77\nz = -7/11\n```"
