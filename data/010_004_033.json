    "message_2": "To show that the sequence {1/n} is a convergent sequence in the interval [0,1], we need to prove two things:\n\n1. The sequence {1/n} is contained in the interval [0,1].\n2. The sequence {1/n} converges to a limit in the interval [0,1].\n\n1. To show that the sequence {1/n} is contained in the interval [0,1], consider any term of the sequence, 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Since n is positive, 1/n is also positive. As n increases, 1/n decreases, and the smallest possible value of n is 1, which gives us the largest possible value of 1/n, which is 1. Therefore, 1/n is always in the range (0,1] for all positive integers n.\n\n2. To show that the sequence {1/n} converges to a limit in the interval [0,1], we need to find a limit L such that for any given ε > 0, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n > N, the distance between 1/n and L is less than ε. In other words, we need to show that |1/n - L| < ε for all n > N.\n\nLet's consider the limit L = 0. For any given ε > 0, we want to find a positive integer N such that for all n > N, |1/n - 0| < ε. Since |1/n - 0| = |1/n| = 1/n, we want to find N such that 1/n < ε for all n > N.\n\nWe can rewrite this inequality as n > 1/ε. Since n is a positive integer, we can choose N to be the smallest integer greater than 1/ε. Then, for all n > N, we have n > 1/ε, which implies that 1/n < ε. Thus, |1/n - 0| < ε for all n > N.\n\nTherefore, the sequence {1/n} converges to the limit L = 0 in the interval [0,1]."
