The student has a tent that weighs 2 kg, a sleeping bag that weighs 1.5 kg, a camera that weighs 0.5 kg, and a book that weighs 0.3 kg. The student wants to bring some food, and has the following options: \n- Peanut butter and jelly sandwich (0.2 kg) \n- Granola bars (0.05 kg each) \n- Apples (0.1 kg each) \n\nThe student can bring a maximum of 10 food items. How many different combinations of food items can the student bring to stay within the weight limit of the backpack?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the total weight of the non-food items: tent (2 kg) + sleeping bag (1.5 kg) + camera (0.5 kg) + book (0.3 kg) = 4.3 kg.\n\nThe backpack can hold a maximum weight of 5 kg, so the student has 5 kg - 4.3 kg = 0.7 kg available for food items.\n\nNow, let's consider the different combinations of food items the student can bring:\n\n1. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (0.2 kg each): The student can bring a maximum of 3 sandwiches (0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg) without exceeding the weight limit.\n\n2. Granola bars (0.05 kg each): The student can bring a maximum of 14 granola bars (0.05 kg * 14 = 0.7 kg) without exceeding the weight limit. However, the student can only bring a maximum of 10 food items, so they can bring up to 10 granola bars.\n\n3. Apples (0.1 kg each): The student can bring a maximum of 7 apples (0.1 kg * 7 = 0.7 kg) without exceeding the weight limit. However, the student can only bring a maximum of 10 food items, so they can bring up to 10 apples.\n\nNow let's consider the combinations of different food items:\n\n4. 1 sandwich (0.2 kg) + granola bars (0.05 kg each): The student can bring up to 9 granola bars (0.05 kg * 9 = 0.45 kg) with 1 sandwich, for a total weight of 0.65 kg.\n\n5. 1 sandwich (0.2 kg) + apples (0.1 kg each): The student can bring up to 5 apples (0.1 kg * 5 = 0.5 kg) with 1 sandwich, for a total weight of 0.7 kg.\n\n6. 2 sandwiches (0.4 kg) + granola bars (0.05 kg each): The student can bring up to 6 granola bars (0.05 kg * 6 = 0.3 kg) with 2 sandwiches, for a total weight of 0.7 kg.\n\n7. Granola bars (0.05 kg each) + apples (0.1 kg each): The student can bring up to 4 apples (0.1 kg * 4 = 0.4 kg) and up to 6 granola bars (0.05 kg * 6 = 0.3 kg) for a total weight of 0.7 kg.\n\nIn summary, the student has the following options for food combinations:\n\n1. Up to 3 sandwiches\n2. Up to 10 granola bars\n3. Up to 7 apples\n4. 1 sandwich + up to 9 granola bars\n5. 1 sandwich + up to 5 apples\n6. 2 sandwiches + up to 6 granola bars\n7. Up to 4 apples + up to 6 granola bars\n\nThere are 7 different combinations of food items the student can bring to stay within the weight limit of the backpack."
