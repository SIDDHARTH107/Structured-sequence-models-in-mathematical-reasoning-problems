    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of f(z) over the contour C, we will use the Cauchy's Residue theorem. The theorem states that for a function that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C except for a finite number of singular points inside C, the integral of the function over the contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its singular points inside C.\n\nFirst, let's find the singular points of f(z) by finding the points where the denominator is zero:\n\n(z + 1)(z + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two singular points: z = -1 and z = -2.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these singular points are inside the contour C. The contour C is a square with vertices at (-1, 0), (-1, 2), (2, 2), and (2, 0). The point z = -1 is on the contour, and the point z = -2 is outside the contour. Therefore, we only need to consider the residue at z = -1.\n\nTo find the residue of f(z) at z = -1, we can use the following formula for simple poles:\n\nRes[f(z), z] = lim(z->z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nIn our case, z0 = -1, so we have:\n\nRes[f(z), z] = lim(z->-1) [(z + 1) * (z^3 / (z + 1)(z + 2))]\n\nThe (z + 1) term cancels out, leaving:\n\nRes[f(z), z] = lim(z->-1) [z^3 / (z + 2)]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nRes[f(z), z] = (-1)^3 / (-1 + 2) = -1 / 1 = -1\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy's Residue theorem to find the integral of f(z) over the contour C:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = 2πi * (sum of residues inside C) = 2πi * (-1) = -2πi."
