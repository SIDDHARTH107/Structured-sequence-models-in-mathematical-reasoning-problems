    "message_1": "A flagpole stands at a height of 25 feet. If an observer stands 50 feet away from the base of the pole, at what angle of elevation must he look to see the top of the pole? Round your answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation. In this problem, the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (25 feet), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the observer and the base of the pole (50 feet).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = 25 / 50\ntan(θ) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ whose tangent is 0.5. We can do this using the arctangent (inverse tangent) function:\n\nθ = arctan(0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 26.57 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation is approximately 27 degrees."
