    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 8 vertices and the following edges: \n{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,5), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)}.\nDetermine the chromatic index of the graph G.",
    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph G. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. In this graph, each vertex has a degree of 3. Therefore, Δ = 3.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either Δ or Δ + 1. So, the chromatic index of G is either 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges of the graph with 3 colors. We can start by coloring the edges (1,2), (2,3), and (3,4) with colors 1, 2, and 3, respectively. However, when we try to color the edge (4,1), we find that it is adjacent to both edges with colors 1 and 3. This means that we cannot color the graph with only 3 colors.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic index of the graph G is Δ + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4."
