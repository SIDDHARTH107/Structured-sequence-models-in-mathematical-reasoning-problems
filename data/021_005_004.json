    "message_2": "The first-order kinetics model is given by the equation:\n\ndC/dt = -kC\n\nwhere C is the concentration of the reactant, t is the time, and k is the rate constant. We are given the initial concentration C(0) = 150 mol/L, the rate constant k = 0.05/s, and we want to find the concentration C(10) after 10 seconds.\n\nWe will use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve this ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a time step of 0.5 seconds. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is given by:\n\nk1 = h * f(t, C)\nk2 = h * f(t + h/2, C + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(t + h/2, C + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(t + h, C + k3)\nC(t + h) = C(t) + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\nwhere h is the time step, t is the current time, C is the current concentration, and f(t, C) is the ODE function (-kC in this case).\n\nLet's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for this problem:\n\nInitial conditions:\nC(0) = 150 mol/L\nk = 0.05/s\nh = 0.5 s\nt = 0 s\n\nWe will iterate 20 times (10 seconds / 0.5 seconds per step) to find the concentration at t = 10 seconds.\n\nfor i in range(20):\n    k1 = h * (-k * C)\n    k2 = h * (-k * (C + k1/2))\n    k3 = h * (-k * (C + k2/2))\n    k4 = h * (-k * (C + k3))\n    C = C + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n    t = t + h\n\nAfter running the above code, we get the concentration of the reactant after 10 seconds:\n\nC(10) â‰ˆ 2.23 mol/L"
