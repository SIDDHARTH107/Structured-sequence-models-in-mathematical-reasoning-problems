    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph.\n\nWe can start at vertex 1 and try to visit each vertex exactly once:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1\n\nThis sequence visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex 1. Therefore, a Hamiltonian cycle exists in this graph, and the sequence of vertices in the cycle is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1"
