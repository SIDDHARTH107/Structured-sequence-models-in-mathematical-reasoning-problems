    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 centimeters and two bases 10 centimeters and 14 centimeters respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 is 10 centimeters, base2 is 14 centimeters, and the height is 8 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 14) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (24) * 8\nArea = 12 * 8\nArea = 96 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 96 square centimeters."
