    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Find (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) and prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow let's find the union of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal. However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union, as the question asks to prove that it is not commutative.\n\nThe Cartesian product itself is not commutative, meaning that A × B ≠ B × A in general. In this example, we can clearly see that A × B and B × A have different ordered pairs:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nSince A × B ≠ B × A, the Cartesian product is not commutative. However, the union operation is commutative, meaning that (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = (B × A) ∪ (A × B), as we demonstrated above. The question seems to be asking to prove something that is not true, as the Cartesian product is not commutative, but the union operation is."
