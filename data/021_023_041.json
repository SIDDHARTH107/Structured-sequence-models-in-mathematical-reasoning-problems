    "message_1": "A factory produces three products: A, B, and C. The factory earns a profit of $10, $6, and $4 for each unit of A, B, and C, respectively. The factory can produce a maximum of 100 units of A, 50 units of B, and 80 units of C per day. The factory also has a constraint that it cannot produce more than a total of 120 units of products per day. Using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), find the optimal production quantity of each product to maximize the overall profit of the factory.",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the GWO algorithm directly. Instead, I can guide you through the steps to solve the problem using GWO.\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective is to maximize the profit, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 10A + 6B + 4C\n\n2. Define the constraints:\n\nA <= 100\nB <= 50\nC <= 80\nA + B + C <= 120\n\n3. Initialize the GWO algorithm parameters: Set the number of wolves (population size), the number of iterations, and other algorithm-specific parameters.\n\n4. Generate an initial population of wolves: Randomly generate a set of solutions (wolves) within the search space, considering the constraints.\n\n5. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf: Calculate the profit for each solution in the population.\n\n6. Update the alpha, beta, and delta wolves: Identify the three best solutions in the population based on their fitness values.\n\n7. Update the position of each wolf: Update the position of each wolf in the population using the GWO equations, considering the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 for the specified number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\n9. Obtain the optimal solution: The alpha wolf's position represents the optimal production quantities for products A, B, and C.\n\nPlease note that the GWO algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution may not be the global optimum. You may need to run the algorithm multiple times with different initial populations or parameter settings to find the best solution."
