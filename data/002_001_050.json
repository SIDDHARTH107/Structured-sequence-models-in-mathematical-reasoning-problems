    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 10 cm. Calculate its area.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 * 10) / 2\n\nArea = 80 / 2\n\nArea = 40 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 40 square centimeters."
