    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2)] dx from a to b\n\nwhere dy/dx is the derivative of the function with respect to x, and the integral is evaluated from x = a to x = b.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function y = x^2/4:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2/4)/dx = (1/2)x\n\nNow, let's plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + ((1/2)x)^2)] dx from 0 to 4\n\nArc length = ∫[sqrt(1 + (x^2/4))] dx from 0 to 4\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x^2/4, so du/dx = x/2, or du = (1/2)xdx. Then, the integral becomes:\n\nArc length = 2∫[sqrt(1 + u)] du from u = 0 to u = 4\n\nNow, we can use the substitution method again. Let v = 1 + u, so dv/du = 1, or dv = du. Then, the integral becomes:\n\nArc length = 2∫[sqrt(v)] dv from v = 1 to v = 5\n\nThe integral of sqrt(v) is (2/3)v^(3/2), so we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\nArc length = 2[(2/3)(5^(3/2)) - (2/3)(1^(3/2))]\n\nArc length = (4/3)(5^(3/2) - 1)\n\nArc length ≈ 9.31\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2/4 between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 9.31."
