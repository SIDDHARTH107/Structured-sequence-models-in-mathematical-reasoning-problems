The cost function for producing one unit of the good is $C(q) = 2q$, where $q$ is the quantity produced. The inverse demand function is $p = 10 - q$, where $p$ is the price charged per unit of the good. \n\nWhat will be the equilibrium quantity produced and price charged by each firm? What will be the total quantity produced and price charged in the market?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete on price, and the firm with the lowest price captures the entire market demand. Since both firms have the same cost function, they will both set their prices equal to their marginal cost to maximize their profits. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function with respect to quantity:\n\nMC(q) = dC(q)/dq = d(2q)/dq = 2\n\nSo, both firms will set their price at $2 per unit. Now, we need to find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm. Since the goods are identical and the prices are the same, the market demand will be split evenly between the two firms. The market demand function can be found by rearranging the inverse demand function:\n\nq = 10 - p\n\nSubstitute the price charged by each firm, which is $2:\n\nq = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nSince the market demand is split evenly between the two firms, each firm will produce half of the total quantity:\n\nq_A = q_B = 8/2 = 4\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm is 4 units, and the price charged by each firm is $2 per unit. The total quantity produced in the market is 8 units, and the market price is $2 per unit."
