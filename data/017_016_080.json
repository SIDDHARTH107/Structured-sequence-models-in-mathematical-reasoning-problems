    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or a non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, which can be written as 3^3, we know that G has a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3^3 = 27.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. In this case, the only possibility is n_3 = 1, which means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27 in G.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27, this subgroup must be normal in G. Let's denote this normal subgroup by N. Now, we know that N is a normal subgroup of G with order 27, and G/N is a group of order |G|/|N| = 27/27 = 1. Thus, G/N is the trivial group, which means that G is isomorphic to N.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether N is cyclic or not. Since N is a group of order 27, it is a p-group with p = 3. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, N must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C9 × C3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3)\n3. C3 × C3 × C3 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nHowever, the second and third options are abelian groups, and there is no non-abelian group of order 27 that can be formed as a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Therefore, N must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, and there is no non-abelian group of order 27 that G can be isomorphic to."
