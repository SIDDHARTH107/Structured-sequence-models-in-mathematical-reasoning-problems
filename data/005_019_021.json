The sales of the products in the next week are predicted to be as follows: \n\n- 30% of product A sales will be followed by product A sales in the next week, 50% by product B, and 20% by product C.\n- 10% of product B sales will be followed by product A sales in the next week, 80% by product B, and 10% by product C.\n- 15% of product C sales will be followed by product A sales in the next week, 15% by product B, and 70% by product C.\n\nIf the company sells 1000 units of product A in the current week, how many units of each product are expected to be sold in the next week?",
    "message_2": "Since the company sells 1000 units of product A in the current week, we can use the given percentages to predict the sales of each product in the next week.\n\nFor product A:\n30% of 1000 units = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 units\n\nFor product B:\n50% of 1000 units = 0.50 * 1000 = 500 units\n\nFor product C:\n20% of 1000 units = 0.20 * 1000 = 200 units\n\nSo, in the next week, the company is expected to sell 300 units of product A, 500 units of product B, and 200 units of product C."
