    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. We will show that G is isomorphic to either C4 (the cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (the Klein four-group).\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element of G with order 4. Then, the subgroup generated by a, denoted by ⟨a⟩, has order 4. Since the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, and the order of G is 4, we have that ⟨a⟩ is a subgroup of G with order 4. Since there is only one subgroup of order 4 in G, we must have that G = ⟨a⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 4, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nSince G has order 4 and no element of order 4, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 2. The identity element e has order 1, so there must be at least one element of order 2. Let a be an element of order 2 in G, i.e., a^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the set G \\ {e, a}. This set has two elements, and neither of them can be equal to a (since a is already in the group). Let b be one of these elements. Since G has no element of order 4, b cannot have order 4, so b must have order 2, i.e., b^2 = e.\n\nNow, let c be the remaining element in G \\ {e, a, b}. Since G is a group, the product ab must be in G. We have four possibilities for ab:\n\n1. ab = e. This would imply that b = a^(-1) = a, which is a contradiction since a and b are distinct elements.\n2. ab = a. This would imply that b = e, which is a contradiction since b is distinct from e.\n3. ab = b. This would imply that a = e, which is a contradiction since a is distinct from e.\n4. ab = c. This is the only remaining possibility.\n\nNow, we have that (ab)^2 = abab. Since a and b have order 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = e. Thus, abab = aeaebb = aabb = e. So, c = ab has order 2.\n\nTherefore, we have found three elements of order 2 in G: a, b, and c. The group G has the following multiplication table:\n\n  | e a b c\n--+-------\ne | e a b c\na | a e c b\nb | b c e a\nc | c b a e\n\nThis multiplication table is identical to the multiplication table of V4, the Klein four-group. Thus, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that if G is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4."
