    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"ATTACK NOW\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square using the key.\n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet in order, excluding the letter 'J' (since 'I' and 'J' are considered the same in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe Playfair square with the key \"MATHS\" looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can encrypt the message \"ATTACK NOW\" using the following rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, add an 'X' after the first letter and continue.\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to the right (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below (wrapping around if necessary).\n4. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nThe message \"ATTACK NOW\" can be broken into pairs: AT TA CK NO WX (we added an 'X' at the end to make the last pair).\n\nNow, let's encrypt each pair:\n\nAT -> TM\nTA -> HT\nCK -> ID\nNO -> PU\nWX -> YZ\n\nThe encrypted message is \"TMHTIDPUYZ\"."
