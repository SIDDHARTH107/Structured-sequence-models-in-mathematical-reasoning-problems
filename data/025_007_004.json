    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on the given variety, we will use the Dolbeault cohomology groups. Recall that for a complex manifold $X$, the Dolbeault cohomology groups are given by\n$$\nH^{p,q}(X) = \\frac{\\ker(\\bar{\\partial} : \\mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X) \\to \\mathcal{A}^{p,q+1}(X))}{\\text{im}(\\bar{\\partial} : \\mathcal{A}^{p,q-1}(X) \\to \\mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X))},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}^{p,q}(X)$ denotes the space of smooth $(p,q)$-forms on $X$.\n\nIn our case, the variety is given by the zero set of the polynomials $f_1(x,y,z)$ and $f_2(x,y,z)$. Let $X$ be the complex algebraic variety defined by these polynomials. We want to compute the first cohomology group with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on $X$, which is given by $H^{0,1}(X)$.\n\nFirst, note that the variety $X$ is a smooth complex manifold, since the gradients of $f_1$ and $f_2$ are linearly independent at every point of $X$. Therefore, we can apply the Dolbeault cohomology groups to compute the desired cohomology group.\n\nNow, we need to compute the kernel and image of the $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator. Since we are interested in $H^{0,1}(X)$, we have\n$$\n\\ker(\\bar{\\partial} : \\mathcal{A}^{0,1}(X) \\to \\mathcal{A}^{0,2}(X))\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\text{im}(\\bar{\\partial} : \\mathcal{A}^{0,0}(X) \\to \\mathcal{A}^{0,1}(X)).\n$$\n\nThe space $\\mathcal{A}^{0,1}(X)$ consists of smooth $(0,1)$-forms on $X$, which are of the form $\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\bar{1}} d\\bar{z}_1 + \\alpha_{\\bar{2}} d\\bar{z}_2 + \\alpha_{\\bar{3}} d\\bar{z}_3$, where $\\alpha_{\\bar{1}}, \\alpha_{\\bar{2}}, \\alpha_{\\bar{3}}$ are smooth functions on $X$. The space $\\mathcal{A}^{0,2}(X)$ consists of smooth $(0,2)$-forms on $X$, which are of the form $\\beta = \\beta_{\\bar{1}\\bar{2}} d\\bar{z}_1 \\wedge d\\bar{z}_2 + \\beta_{\\bar{1}\\bar{3}} d\\bar{z}_1 \\wedge d\\bar{z}_3 + \\beta_{\\bar{2}\\bar{3}} d\\bar{z}_2 \\wedge d\\bar{z}_3$, where $\\beta_{\\bar{1}\\bar{2}}, \\beta_{\\bar{1}\\bar{3}}, \\beta_{\\bar{2}\\bar{3}}$ are smooth functions on $X$.\n\nThe $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator acts on $\\alpha$ as follows:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial}\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\bar{1}}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_2} d\\bar{z}_1 \\wedge d\\bar{z}_2 + \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\bar{1}}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_3} d\\bar{z}_1 \\wedge d\\bar{z}_3 + \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\bar{2}}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_3} d\\bar{z}_2 \\wedge d\\bar{z}_3.\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the kernel and image of the $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator. The kernel consists of $(0,1)$-forms $\\alpha$ such that $\\bar{\\partial}\\alpha = 0$. This means that the partial derivatives of the components of $\\alpha$ must vanish, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\bar{1}}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_2} = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\bar{1}}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_3} = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\bar{2}}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_3} = 0$. The image consists of $(0,1)$-forms $\\alpha$ that can be written as $\\bar{\\partial}f$ for some smooth function $f$ on $X$. In other words, $\\alpha_{\\bar{1}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}_1}$, $\\alpha_{\\bar{2}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}_2}$, and $\\alpha_{\\bar{3}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}_3}$.\n\nSince the variety $X$ is a smooth complex manifold, the Poincar√© lemma holds, which states that the kernel and image of the $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator are equal. Therefore, we have\n$$\nH^{0,1}(X) = \\frac{\\ker(\\bar{\\partial} : \\mathcal{A}^{0,1}(X) \\to \\mathcal{A}^{0,2}(X))}{\\text{im}(\\bar{\\partial} : \\mathcal{A}^{0,0}(X) \\to \\mathcal{A}^{0,1}(X))} = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, the first cohomology group with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on the given variety is trivial, i.e., $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$."
