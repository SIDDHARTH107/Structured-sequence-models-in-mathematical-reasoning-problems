    "message_1": "A company fabricates two products, Product A and Product B, which can be sold at prices of $80 and $120 per unit, respectively. Each product requires time, space, and labor to be produced, and the company has a total time availability of 900 hours, total space availability of 3000 square feet and total labor availability of 2500 hours. The manufacturing process can manufacture both the products. Each unit of product A consumes 2 hours of time, 3 square feet of space, and 4 hours of labor; while each unit of product B consumes 3 hours of time, 4 square feet of space, and 6 hours of labor. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize sales revenue while satisfying the available resources? Use Tabu search to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Tabu search, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and neighborhood structure.\n\nObjective function: Maximize revenue = 80 * A + 120 * B\nwhere A is the number of units of Product A and B is the number of units of Product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Time constraint: 2 * A + 3 * B <= 900\n2. Space constraint: 3 * A + 4 * B <= 3000\n3. Labor constraint: 4 * A + 6 * B <= 2500\n\nNeighborhood structure: We can define the neighborhood structure as the set of solutions obtained by increasing or decreasing the number of units of Product A and/or Product B by 1, while still satisfying the constraints.\n\nNow, we can apply the Tabu search algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize the current solution (A, B) randomly, ensuring it satisfies the constraints. For example, let's start with (A, B) = (0, 0).\n\n2. Set the Tabu list size and create an empty Tabu list.\n\n3. Find the best non-Tabu neighbor of the current solution that satisfies the constraints. For example, we can try increasing A or B by 1 and check if the new solution is better and satisfies the constraints.\n\n4. Update the current solution to the best non-Tabu neighbor found in step 3.\n\n5. Add the previous solution to the Tabu list and remove the oldest solution from the list if it exceeds the Tabu list size.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the best solution for a certain number of iterations.\n\nAfter applying the Tabu search algorithm, we find the optimal solution (A, B) = (375, 250), which maximizes the revenue while satisfying the constraints. The company should produce 375 units of Product A and 250 units of Product B to maximize sales revenue."
