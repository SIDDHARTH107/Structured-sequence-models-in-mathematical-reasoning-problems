    "message_1": "A train station has 5 different trains that travel to a nearby city. The probability of Train A being on time is 0.8, Train B being on time is 0.9, Train C being on time is 0.6, Train D being on time is 0.7 and Train E being on time is 0.75. If a person randomly chooses two trains to take for their trip, what is the probability that both of the chosen trains will be on time?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both chosen trains will be on time, we need to consider all possible pairs of trains and their respective probabilities of being on time. There are a total of 10 possible pairs of trains:\n\n1. A and B\n2. A and C\n3. A and D\n4. A and E\n5. B and C\n6. B and D\n7. B and E\n8. C and D\n9. C and E\n10. D and E\n\nNow, we'll calculate the probability of each pair being on time by multiplying their individual probabilities:\n\n1. A and B: 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72\n2. A and C: 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48\n3. A and D: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56\n4. A and E: 0.8 * 0.75 = 0.6\n5. B and C: 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54\n6. B and D: 0.9 * 0.7 = 0.63\n7. B and E: 0.9 * 0.75 = 0.675\n8. C and D: 0.6 * 0.7 = 0.42\n9. C and E: 0.6 * 0.75 = 0.45\n10. D and E: 0.7 * 0.75 = 0.525\n\nSince each pair has an equal chance of being chosen, we can find the average probability of both trains being on time by adding up the probabilities and dividing by the number of pairs:\n\n(0.72 + 0.48 + 0.56 + 0.6 + 0.54 + 0.63 + 0.675 + 0.42 + 0.45 + 0.525) / 10 = 5.52 / 10 = 0.552\n\nSo, the probability that both chosen trains will be on time is 0.552 or 55.2%."
