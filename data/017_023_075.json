    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we first find the prime factorization of 72, which is 2^3 * 3^2. Now, we use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of partitions of each of the prime powers in the factorization.\n\nFor 2^3, there are two partitions: (3) and (2,1). For 3^2, there is only one partition: (2). Therefore, there are 2 * 1 = 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 72.\n\nOut of these two groups, one of them is cyclic, which is the group Z_72 (the integers modulo 72 under addition). The other group is non-abelian, which is the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_8, denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_8. This group is formed by taking the direct product of Z_9 and Z_8 and introducing a non-trivial action between the two groups.\n\nIn summary, there is 1 cyclic group of order 72 (Z_72) and 1 non-abelian group of order 72 (Z_9 ⋊ Z_8)."
