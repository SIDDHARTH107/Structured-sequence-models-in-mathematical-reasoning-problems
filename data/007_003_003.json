    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 29^5 is divided by 8, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We can first find the remainder when 29 is divided by 8, and then raise that remainder to the power of 5.\n\n29 ≡ 5 (mod 8)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 5^5 is divided by 8:\n\n5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 8)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 1 (mod 8)\n5^3 ≡ 5 * 1 ≡ 5 (mod 8)\n5^4 ≡ 25 ≡ 1 (mod 8)\n5^5 ≡ 5 * 1 ≡ 5 (mod 8)\n\nSo, the remainder when 29^5 is divided by 8 is 5."
