    "message_2": "To find the sine of 45 degrees using the unit circle, we first need to convert 45 degrees to radians. \n\n45 degrees * (π / 180) = π/4 radians\n\nNow, we can find the sine of π/4 radians using the unit circle. On the unit circle, the sine of an angle is equal to the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle. For π/4 radians (45 degrees), this point is at (1/√2, 1/√2) or (√2/2, √2/2) when rationalized.\n\nSo, the sine of 45 degrees (π/4 radians) is:\n\nsin(45°) = sin(π/4) = 1/√2 or √2/2"
