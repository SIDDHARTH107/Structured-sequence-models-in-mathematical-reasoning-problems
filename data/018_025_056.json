    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the intersection of the result with set B. Show that the result of this intersection is not equal to the symmetric difference of B and A intersected with set A, thereby proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In this case:\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the result with set B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, and then intersect it with set A:\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 2}\n\nAs we can see, the result of (A ∆ B) ∩ B is {5, 6}, while the result of (B ∆ A) ∩ A is {1, 2}. Since these two results are not equal, this shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
