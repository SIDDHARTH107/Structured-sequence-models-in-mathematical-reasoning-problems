    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation:\n(sin(x) + cos(x))^2 = 1^2\n\n2. Expand the left side of the equation using the distributive property (FOIL method):\nsin^2(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\n3. Use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n1 + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\n4. Subtract 1 from both sides:\n2sin(x)cos(x) = 0\n\n5. Use the double angle identity for sine, sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x):\nsin(2x) = 0\n\n6. Solve for x:\n2x = nπ, where n is an integer\n\nx = nπ/2, where n is an integer\n\nSince we are looking for solutions between 0 and 2π, we can find the values of n that satisfy this condition:\n\nn = 0: x = 0\nn = 1: x = π/2\nn = 2: x = π\nn = 3: x = 3π/2\nn = 4: x = 2π\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π."
