    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nGiven A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, let's find the symmetric difference of set A and set B.\n\nFirst, we find the union of A and B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNext, we find the intersection of A and B:\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference:\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's swap A and B and find the symmetric difference of set B and set A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nThe union of B and A is the same as the union of A and B:\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThe intersection of B and A is the same as the intersection of A and B:\nB ∩ A = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference:\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative."
