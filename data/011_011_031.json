    "message_2": "To partition the number 10 into four positive integers, we can use the stars and bars method. Since we want to partition 10 into four positive integers, we can think of this as distributing 10 identical objects (stars) into 4 distinct boxes.\n\nFirst, we need to subtract 1 from each box, since each box must have at least one star. This leaves us with 6 stars to distribute among the 4 boxes. Now, we can use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to distribute these 6 stars.\n\nWe have 6 stars and 3 bars (to separate the 4 boxes). We need to find the number of ways to arrange these 9 objects (6 stars and 3 bars). This is a combinatorial problem, and the solution is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 9 (total number of objects) and k = 3 (number of bars). So, we have:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!6!) = 362880 / (6 * 720) = 84\n\nTherefore, there are 84 distinct ways to partition the number 10 into four positive integers."
