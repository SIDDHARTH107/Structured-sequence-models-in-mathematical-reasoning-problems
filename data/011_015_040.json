What is the minimum number of friends that need to wear the same color shirt for there to be a \"Ramsey party\"? (A Ramsey party is a party where there are either three friends who all wear the same color shirt or three friends who all wear different color shirts.)",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of friends that need to wear the same color shirt for there to be a Ramsey party, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes (in this case, shirt colors) and more than n pigeons (friends), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, there are 3 pigeonholes (red, blue, and green shirts) and 6 friends. If we evenly distribute the friends among the shirt colors, we would have 2 friends wearing each color. However, this would not create a Ramsey party, as we need at least 3 friends wearing the same color or 3 friends wearing different colors.\n\nTo guarantee a Ramsey party, we can add one more friend to one of the shirt colors. This would result in 3 friends wearing the same color, which satisfies the condition for a Ramsey party. Therefore, the minimum number of friends that need to wear the same color shirt for there to be a Ramsey party is 3."
