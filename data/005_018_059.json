The survival time (in days) of each patient after treatment is recorded below:\n\n| Patient | Survival Time |\n|-------:|--------------:|\n|      1 |           800 |\n|      2 |           400 |\n|      3 |          1200 |\n|        |              |\n|     98 |           500 |\n|     99 |           300 |\n|    100 |           700 |\n\nAccording to the survival analysis, the probability of a patient surviving beyond 650 days is 0.6. Find the median survival time for the patients.",
    "message_2": "To find the median survival time, we first need to arrange the survival times in ascending order. Since we don't have the full data set, we can use the given information to estimate the median.\n\nWe know that the probability of a patient surviving beyond 650 days is 0.6, which means that 60% of the patients survive beyond 650 days. Since there are 100 patients in total, this means that 40 patients have a survival time of 650 days or less.\n\nThe median survival time is the value that separates the data into two equal halves, so it would be the average of the 50th and 51st patient's survival times when the data is sorted in ascending order. Since we know that 40 patients have a survival time of 650 days or less, the 50th and 51st patients must have survival times greater than 650 days.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot determine the exact median survival time without the complete data set. However, we can conclude that the median survival time is greater than 650 days."
