    "message_2": "To find the solution set for the inequality 3x + 4 > 7x - 5, we will first isolate x.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality.\n4 > 4x - 5\n\nStep 2: Add 5 to both sides of the inequality.\n9 > 4x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides by 4.\n9/4 > x or x < 9/4\n\nThe solution set for the inequality is x < 9/4.\n\nTo graph the inequality, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line.\n2. Mark the point 9/4 on the number line.\n3. Since the inequality is \"x < 9/4\", we will use an open circle at the point 9/4 to indicate that the value 9/4 is not included in the solution set.\n4. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating that all values less than 9/4 are part of the solution set.\n\nThe graph of the inequality 3x + 4 > 7x - 5 is a number line with an open circle at 9/4 and the region to the left of the open circle shaded."
