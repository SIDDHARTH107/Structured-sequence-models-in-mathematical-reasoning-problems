    "message_1": "A Sierpinski arrowhead curve has been transformed into 4 smaller scaled copies of itself, each of which is 1/3 the size of the original. If the length of the original curve is x, what is the total length of the 4 smaller versions, and what fraction of the original length does this represent?",
    "message_2": "If each of the 4 smaller scaled copies is 1/3 the size of the original, then the length of each smaller copy is (1/3)x. To find the total length of the 4 smaller versions, we can multiply the length of one smaller copy by 4:\n\nTotal length of 4 smaller versions = 4 * (1/3)x = (4/3)x\n\nNow, to find the fraction of the original length that this represents, we can divide the total length of the 4 smaller versions by the original length:\n\nFraction of the original length = (Total length of 4 smaller versions) / (Original length) = ((4/3)x) / x\n\nSince x is in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\nFraction of the original length = 4/3\n\nSo, the total length of the 4 smaller versions is (4/3)x, and this represents 4/3 of the original length."
