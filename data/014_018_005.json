Suppose we encrypt a message using a substitution cipher by replacing every letter with the letter three places after it in the alphabet set. For example, 'a' would be replaced with 'd', 'b' with 'e', and so on. If the encrypted message is \"wkh surjudp lv surylghg\" (without punctuation or spaces), what is the original message?",
