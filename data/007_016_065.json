    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. We are looking for the smallest Sophie Germain prime p such that 4p + 1 is also prime.\n\nLet's check the first few Sophie Germain primes:\n\n1. p = 2: 2p + 1 = 5 (prime), 4p + 1 = 9 (not prime)\n2. p = 3: 2p + 1 = 7 (prime), 4p + 1 = 13 (prime)\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime that satisfies the condition is p = 3, as 4p + 1 = 4(3) + 1 = 13, which is also prime."
