    "message_1": "Consider the following plain text message: \"MATH IS FUN\". If we use a transposition cipher and rearrange the letters in the message using a specific key, what is the encrypted message if the key is \"3142\"?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH IS FUN\" using the transposition cipher with the key \"3142\", we first need to arrange the message into a matrix using the key length as the number of columns. In this case, the key length is 4. So, we arrange the message as follows:\n\nM A T H\nI S F U\nN\n\nNow, we read the columns in the order specified by the key \"3142\". The encrypted message will be:\n\nA M H T S I F N U\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"AMHTSIFNU\"."
