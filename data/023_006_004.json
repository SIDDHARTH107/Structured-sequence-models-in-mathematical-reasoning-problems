    "message_2": "To find the signal x(t) in the time domain, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of X(jω). We can do this using the following formula:\n\nx(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[X(jω) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nGiven X(jω) = 40 / (1 + jω)^2, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of this function.\n\nLet's first rewrite X(jω) in terms of polar coordinates:\n\nX(jω) = 40 / (1 + jω)^2 = 40 / (1 + jω)(1 + jω)\n\nNow, let's find the poles of X(jω). The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator becomes zero:\n\n(1 + jω)(1 + jω) = 0\n\nThis equation has two poles: ω = -j and ω = -j (both are the same).\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the inverse Fourier transform. The residue theorem states that the inverse Fourier transform of a function with poles is equal to the sum of the residues of the function at each pole multiplied by e^(jωt).\n\nResidue at ω = -j:\n\nResidue = lim(ω -> -j) [(ω + j) * 40 / (1 + jω)(1 + jω)]\n\nTo find the residue, we can use the following formula:\n\nResidue = [d/dω (40 / (1 + jω)(1 + jω))] at ω = -j\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to ω:\n\nd/dω (40 / (1 + jω)(1 + jω)) = -40 * 2j / (1 + jω)^3\n\nNow, we can find the residue at ω = -j:\n\nResidue = -40 * 2j / (1 + j(-j))^3 = -80j / (1 + 1)^3 = -80j / 8 = -10j\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform using the residue theorem:\n\nx(t) = 2π * (-10j) * e^(j(-j)t) = -20πj * e^(t)\n\nHowever, we have a condition that |x(t)| ≤ 10 for all t. Let's check if our solution satisfies this condition:\n\n|x(t)| = |-20πj * e^(t)| = 20π * e^(t)\n\nThis function does not satisfy the given condition, as it grows exponentially with t. Therefore, there is no signal x(t) in the time domain that satisfies the given condition."
