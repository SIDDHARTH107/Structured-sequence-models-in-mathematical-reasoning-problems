    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function f(t), we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, T is the period of the function, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor this problem, the period T = 2π, so ω = 2π/2π = 1.\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) dt] from 0 to T\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * [∫(1 dt) from 0 to π + ∫(-1 dt) from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * [t | from 0 to π - t | from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * [π - 0 - (2π - π)]\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * [π - π] = 0\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(cos(nt) dt) from 0 to π + ∫(-cos(nt) dt) from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [sin(nt)/n | from 0 to π - (-sin(nt)/n) | from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(sin(nπ)/n - sin(0)) + (sin(2nπ)/n - sin(nπ)/n)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(sin(nt) dt) from 0 to π + ∫(-sin(nt) dt) from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(nt)/n | from 0 to π + cos(nt)/n | from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-cos(nπ)/n + cos(0)) + (cos(2nπ)/n - cos(nπ)/n)]\n\nFor odd values of n, cos(nπ) = -1 and cos(2nπ) = 1, so:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-(-1)/n + 1) + (1/n - (-1)/n)] = (2/n) for odd n\n\nFor even values of n, cos(nπ) = 1 and cos(2nπ) = 1, so:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-(1)/n + 1) + (1/n - (1)/n)] = 0 for even n\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(t):\n\nf(t) = Σ[(2/n) * sin(nt)] for odd n\n\nThe summation is from n = 1 to infinity, with only odd values of n contributing to the series."
