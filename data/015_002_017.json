    "message_1": "A butterfly flaps its wings in New York and causes a small disturbance in the atmosphere. This disturbance ultimately causes a tornado in the distant city of Los Angeles. Assuming that the butterfly's wings displaced about 0.004 cubic meters of air, and that the tornado had a diameter of 500 meters and a height of 2 kilometers, what was the volume of air displaced by the tornado? Express your answer in scientific notation to two significant figures.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of air displaced by the tornado, we can model the tornado as a cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the diameter of the tornado to its radius: \nradius = diameter / 2 = 500 meters / 2 = 250 meters\n\nNext, we need to convert the height of the tornado from kilometers to meters: \nheight = 2 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = 2000 meters\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \nV = π(250 meters)^2(2000 meters) ≈ 3.14 * 62500 * 2000\n\nV ≈ 3.14 * 1.25 * 10^8 cubic meters\n\nTo express the answer in scientific notation to two significant figures, we can round the value of π to 3.1 and the value of 1.25 to 1.3:\n\nV ≈ 3.1 * 1.3 * 10^8 cubic meters\n\nV ≈ 4.03 * 10^8 cubic meters\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the volume of air displaced by the tornado is approximately 4.0 * 10^8 cubic meters."
