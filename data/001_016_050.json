    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $3^{5}\\cdot3^{-2}$, we can use the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base: $a^{m}\\cdot a^{n} = a^{m+n}$. In this case, our base is 3, and our exponents are 5 and -2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$3^{5}\\cdot3^{-2} = 3^{5+(-2)} = 3^{3} = 27$\n\nThe simplified expression is 27."
