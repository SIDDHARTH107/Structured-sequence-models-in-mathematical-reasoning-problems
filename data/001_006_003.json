    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 5x - 3, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2x² + 5x - 3\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(-3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\n\n1) x = (-5 + 7) / 4\nx = 2 / 4\nx = 1/2\n\n2) x = (-5 - 7) / 4\nx = -12 / 4\nx = -3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation are x = 1/2 and x = -3."
