    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced by a factor of 3.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of segments is 4, and the length of each segment is 6 cm / 3 = 2 cm.\nAfter the second iteration, the number of segments is 4 * 4 = 16, and the length of each segment is 2 cm / 3 = 2/3 cm.\nAfter the third iteration, the number of segments is 16 * 4 = 64, and the length of each segment is (2/3) cm / 3 = 2/9 cm.\n\nThe total perimeter of the Koch island after the third iteration is the product of the number of segments and the length of each segment:\n\nPerimeter = 64 * (2/9) cm = 128/9 cm â‰ˆ 14.22 cm."
