    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from the graph to itself) and is a subgroup of the symmetric group on the vertices of the graph.\n\nIn this graph, we have 6 vertices, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can observe the following symmetries:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself.\n2. The reflection about the vertical axis, which swaps vertices A and F, B and E, and leaves C and D fixed.\n3. The reflection about the horizontal axis, which swaps vertices A and C, B and D, and leaves E and F fixed.\n4. The 180-degree rotation, which swaps vertices A and D, B and C, and E and F.\n\nThese are the only 4 automorphisms of this graph. Therefore, the size of the automorphism group is 4.\n\nThe automorphism group can be identified as the Klein four-group, which is a non-cyclic group of order 4. It is isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as Z_2 Ã— Z_2."
