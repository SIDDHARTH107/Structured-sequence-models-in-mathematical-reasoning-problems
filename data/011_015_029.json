    "message_2": "Using Ramsey Theory, we can solve this problem by finding the smallest number R(m, n) such that in any party of R(m, n) people, there will always be a group of m people who know each other or a group of n people who are strangers. In this case, we are looking for R(3, 3).\n\nTo find R(3, 3), we can use the upper bound formula for Ramsey numbers:\n\nR(m, n) ≤ R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1)\n\nApplying this formula, we get:\n\nR(3, 3) ≤ R(2, 3) + R(3, 2)\n\nSince R(2, 3) = 3 and R(3, 2) = 3 (because it takes at least 3 people to have a pair of strangers or a pair of acquaintances), we have:\n\nR(3, 3) ≤ 3 + 3\n\nR(3, 3) ≤ 6\n\nNow, we need to verify if 6 is indeed the smallest number of people required. To do this, we can check if there is a counterexample for 5 people. We can represent the relationships between people using a complete graph with 5 vertices, where each edge is colored either red (representing people who know each other) or blue (representing strangers). By the Pigeonhole Principle, in a group of 5 people, there must be at least 3 people who either all know each other (all red edges) or are all strangers (all blue edges). Thus, there is no counterexample for 5 people.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of people that must be present in a party to ensure that at least 3 people either know each other or are strangers is R(3, 3) = 6."
