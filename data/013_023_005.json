    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A has $10 and can choose to send any amount they want to Player B. Whatever amount Player A sends will be tripled, and then Player B can choose to either share half of the tripled amount back with Player A or keep the entire tripled amount for themselves. If Player A sends x dollars, and Player B decides to share the tripled amount back equally, write an equation to represent the amount of money that Player A and Player B end up with after the game.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of money Player A sends to Player B. The amount of money that gets tripled is 3x. If Player B decides to share the tripled amount back equally, they will give half of it to Player A, which is (3x)/2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final amount of money for each player.\n\nPlayer A initially had $10 and sent x dollars to Player B, so they have (10 - x) dollars left. After receiving (3x)/2 from Player B, their total amount becomes:\n\nAmount_A = (10 - x) + (3x)/2\n\nPlayer B initially had $0 and received x dollars from Player A, which got tripled to 3x. After sharing (3x)/2 back with Player A, they keep the remaining half, which is also (3x)/2.\n\nAmount_B = (3x)/2\n\nSo, the equation representing the amount of money that Player A and Player B end up with after the game is:\n\nAmount_A = (10 - x) + (3x)/2\nAmount_B = (3x)/2"
