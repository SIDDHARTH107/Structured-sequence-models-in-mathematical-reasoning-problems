    "message_2": "Since G has four elements, and a has order 4, we know that G must contain the elements {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. Now, let's consider the element b.\n\nSince b has order 2, we know that b^2 = e. Also, we are given that $bab^{-1} = a^{-1}$. Since b has order 2, we have $b^{-1} = b$. Thus, we can rewrite the given equation as $bab = a^{-1}$.\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides of this equation by a:\n\n$abab = a^{-1}a$\n\nSince a and b are elements of a group, the associative property holds, and we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$(ab)(ab) = e$\n\nThis means that the element ab has order 2.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: b = a^2\n\nIn this case, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3} = {e, a, b, a^3}, and G is a cyclic group of order 4, generated by a. Thus, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: b ≠ a^2\n\nIn this case, since G has only four elements, and we have already accounted for e, a, and a^2, the only possibility left for b is that b = a^3. Thus, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3} = {e, a, a^2, b}.\n\nNow, let's consider the element ab. Since (ab)(ab) = e, we know that ab has order 2. Also, ab ≠ e, ab ≠ a, and ab ≠ b, so we must have ab = a^2.\n\nThus, G = {e, a, a^2, b} = {e, a, ab, b}, and G is a Klein four-group V4.\n\nIn conclusion, depending on the relationship between a and b, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
