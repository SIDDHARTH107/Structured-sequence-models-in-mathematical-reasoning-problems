    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a series of right angles. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Starting Segment Length) * (2^Iteration)\n\nIn this case, the starting segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the total length after the 10th iteration. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10)\nLength = 1 * 1024\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve after the 10th iteration is 1024 units."
