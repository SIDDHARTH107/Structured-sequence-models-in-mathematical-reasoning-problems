    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation cos(2x) = 1/2, we first need to find the values of 2x for which the cosine function equals 1/2. \n\nRecall that the cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants. The angles in these quadrants whose cosine is 1/2 are π/3 and 5π/3. Since the cosine function has a period of 2π, we can add multiples of 2π to these angles to find all possible values of 2x:\n\n2x = π/3 + 2πn\n2x = 5π/3 + 2πn\n\nwhere n is an integer.\n\nNow, we want to find the values of x between 0 and 2π. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equations above by 2:\n\nx = (π/3 + 2πn)/2\nx = (5π/3 + 2πn)/2\n\nSince x is between 0 and 2π, we only need to consider the integer values of n that result in x values within this range. For the first equation:\n\nn = 0: x = (π/3 + 2π(0))/2 = π/3\nn = 1: x = (π/3 + 2π(1))/2 = 5π/3\n\nFor the second equation:\n\nn = 0: x = (5π/3 + 2π(0))/2 = 5π/6\nn = 1: x = (5π/3 + 2π(1))/2 = 13π/6 > 2π (out of range)\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 2π are:\n\nx = π/3, 5π/3, and 5π/6."
