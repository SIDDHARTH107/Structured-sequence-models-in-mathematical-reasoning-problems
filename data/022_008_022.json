    "message_2": "To show that $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0$, we need to evaluate the function $f(z) = \\sin(z^2)$ at $z = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^2\\right)$\n\nNow, we know that $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}$, so we can substitute this into the function:\n\n$f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right)$\n\nRecall that the sine function has a period of $2\\pi$, meaning that $\\sin(x) = \\sin(x + 2n\\pi)$ for any integer $n$. However, in this case, $\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}$ is not an integer multiple of $\\pi$, so we cannot directly conclude that the sine function is equal to 0.\n\nInstead, we can use the properties of the sine function to determine the value of $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right)$. The sine function is an odd function, meaning that $\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)$. Therefore, if $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right) = 0$, then $\\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right) = -\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right) = 0$ as well.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right) = 0$ based on the information given. The problem statement is incorrect, as it is not necessarily true that $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0$ for the entire function $f(z) = \\sin(z^2)$."
