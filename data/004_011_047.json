    "message_1": "A cylindrical water tank has a radius of 5 feet and a height of 10 feet. The tank is being drained at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. At what rate is the water level dropping when the water is 6 feet deep? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use related rates. Let V be the volume of the water in the tank, r be the radius of the tank, h be the height of the water in the tank, and t be the time in minutes. We are given that r = 5 feet and the tank is being drained at a rate of dV/dt = -2 cubic feet per minute.\n\nThe volume of the water in the tank can be described by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nSince the radius of the tank is constant, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = π(5^2)dh/dt\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = -2 cubic feet per minute:\n\n-2 = π(5^2)dh/dt\n\nNow we can solve for dh/dt when the water is 6 feet deep:\n\n-2 = π(5^2)(dh/dt)\n\ndh/dt = -2 / (π(5^2))\n\ndh/dt ≈ -0.02546 feet per minute\n\nSo, the water level is dropping at a rate of approximately 0.02546 feet per minute when the water is 6 feet deep."
