    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Solve the resulting system of equations using back-substitution.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  7 |\n|  4 -2  3 | -1 |\n|  3  5 -2 |  9 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows. To do this, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and subtract 1.5 times the first row from the third row:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 1.5 * Row1\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7  |\n|  0  -8   5 | -15 |\n|  0  -0.5  0.5 |  -0.5 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y term in the third row. To do this, we can add 1/16 times the second row to the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 + (-0.5/-8) * Row2\n\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7  |\n|  0  -8   5 | -15 |\n|  0   0   1 |  1  |\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nStep 3: Solve the resulting system of equations using back-substitution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\nz = 1\n\nNow, substitute the value of z into the second row:\n\n-8y + 5z = -15\n-8y + 5(1) = -15\n-8y = -20\ny = 2.5\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z into the first row:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 7\n2x + 3(2.5) - 1 = 7\n2x + 7.5 - 1 = 7\n2x = 0.5\nx = 0.25\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0.25, y = 2.5, and z = 1."
