    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series representation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{(z+1)^2(z-2)}$ centered at $z_0 = -1$, we first perform partial fraction decomposition. Let\n\n$$\\frac{1}{(z+1)^2(z-2)} = \\frac{A}{z+1} + \\frac{B}{(z+1)^2} + \\frac{C}{z-2}.$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(z+1)^2(z-2)$, we get\n\n$$1 = A(z+1)(z-2) + B(z-2) + C(z+1)^2.$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ by plugging in appropriate values of $z$:\n\n1. For $z = -1$, we have $1 = -3B \\implies B = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\n2. For $z = 2$, we have $1 = 9C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n3. Differentiating both sides with respect to $z$ and plugging in $z = -1$, we get $0 = A - B + 2C \\implies A = -\\frac{1}{3} + 2\\cdot\\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nThus, we have\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot\\frac{1}{z+1} - \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(z+1)^2} + \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot\\frac{1}{z-2}.$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as a Laurent series centered at $z_0 = -1$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{9}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^n(z+1)^n - \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^n(n+1)(z+1)^n + \\frac{1}{9}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{z+1}{3}\\right)^n.$$\n\nThe region of convergence for each of the three series is determined by the radius of convergence:\n\n1. The first series converges for $|z+1| < 1$, i.e., $-2 < z < 0$.\n2. The second series converges for $|z+1| < 1$, i.e., $-2 < z < 0$.\n3. The third series converges for $\\left|\\frac{z+1}{3}\\right| < 1$, i.e., $-4 < z < 2$.\n\nThe intersection of these regions is $-2 < z < 0$, so the region of convergence for the Laurent series representation of $f(z)$ is $-2 < z < 0$."
