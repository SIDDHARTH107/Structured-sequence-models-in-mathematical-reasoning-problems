    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by successively replacing each square with a cross shape made up of five smaller squares. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter at the nth iteration as P(n). For the initial square (n = 0), the perimeter is P(0) = 4 units (since there are 4 sides with a length of 1 unit each).\n\nAt each iteration, the length of each side of the smaller squares is 1/3 of the previous iteration. Also, the number of squares in the perimeter increases by a factor of 4. Therefore, the perimeter at the nth iteration can be calculated as:\n\nP(n) = 4 * (1/3)^n * P(0)\n\nNow, we want to find the perimeter at the 5th iteration (n = 5):\n\nP(5) = 4 * (1/3)^5 * P(0)\nP(5) = 4 * (1/243) * 4\nP(5) = 16/243\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal at the 5th iteration, where each side of the initial square has a length of 1 unit, is 16/243 units."
