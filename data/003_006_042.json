    "message_1": "A triangle has sides of length 6, 10, and x. If the angle opposite the side of length x is 40 degrees, what is the length of x? Use the law of sines to solve the triangle.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Law of Sines, we first need to find the angle opposite one of the given sides. Let's call the angle opposite the side of length 6 \"A\", the angle opposite the side of length 10 \"B\", and the angle opposite the side of length x \"C\". We know that C = 40 degrees.\n\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can write:\n\nA + B + C = 180\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines, which states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In other words:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe have two sides and one angle, so we can set up the following equation using the Law of Sines:\n\n6/sin(A) = 10/sin(B)\n\nWe can't solve this equation directly, but we can use the fact that A + B + C = 180 to find another equation involving A and B:\n\nA + B = 180 - C\nA + B = 180 - 40\nA + B = 140\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\n\n1) 6/sin(A) = 10/sin(B)\n2) A + B = 140\n\nWe can solve equation (2) for A:\n\nA = 140 - B\n\nNow substitute this expression for A in equation (1):\n\n6/sin(140 - B) = 10/sin(B)\n\nNow we can use the sine subtraction formula:\n\nsin(140 - B) = sin(140)cos(B) - cos(140)sin(B)\n\nSubstitute this back into equation (1):\n\n6/[sin(140)cos(B) - cos(140)sin(B)] = 10/sin(B)\n\nNow we can solve this equation for sin(B) using a calculator:\n\nsin(B) ≈ 0.7193\n\nNow we can find the angle B:\n\nB ≈ 46.3 degrees\n\nNow we can find the angle A using equation (2):\n\nA = 140 - B\nA ≈ 93.7 degrees\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side x:\n\nx/sin(40) = 6/sin(93.7)\n\nCross-multiply and solve for x:\n\nx = 6 * sin(40) / sin(93.7)\nx ≈ 3.92\n\nSo the length of side x is approximately 3.92 units."
