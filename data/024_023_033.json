    "message_2": "To find the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of this manifold, we first note that the given metric tensor is the standard Euclidean metric in 4-dimensional space. The isometry group of this space is the Euclidean group E(4), which consists of translations and rotations.\n\nThe Lie algebra of E(4) can be decomposed into two parts: the Lie algebra of translations and the Lie algebra of rotations. The Lie algebra of translations is simply R^4, as translations in each of the four coordinate directions are generated by the basis vectors ∂/∂x1, ∂/∂x2, ∂/∂x3, and ∂/∂x4.\n\nThe Lie algebra of rotations in 4-dimensional space is so(4), which is the set of all skew-symmetric 4x4 matrices. The dimension of so(4) is 6, as there are 6 independent parameters needed to specify a rotation in 4-dimensional space (corresponding to the 6 independent entries in the upper triangular part of a skew-symmetric matrix).\n\nThus, the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of the given manifold is the direct sum of R^4 and so(4), which can be denoted as R^4 ⊕ so(4). This Lie algebra has a total dimension of 4 (translations) + 6 (rotations) = 10."
