    "message_1": "A company produces two products: chairs and tables. The production of each chair requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of raw material, while the production of each table requires 3 hours of labor and 5 units of raw material. The company has 200 hours of labor and 300 units of raw material available per day. The chairs sell for $50 each and the tables sell for $100 each. How many chairs and tables should the company produce to maximize the daily revenue while ensuring robustness to up to a 20% increase in the raw material cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw material are:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\n3x + 5y ≤ 300 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize revenue is:\n\nRevenue = 50x + 100y\n\nTo ensure robustness to up to a 20% increase in the raw material cost, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the raw material constraint becomes:\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 300 * 0.8 = 240 (raw material constraint with 20% increase)\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region and the corner points of the system of inequalities:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 200\n3x + 5y ≤ 240\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe corner points are (0, 0), (0, 80), (60, 40), and (80, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the revenue function at each of these corner points:\n\n(0, 0): Revenue = 50(0) + 100(0) = $0\n(0, 80): Revenue = 50(0) + 100(80) = $8000\n(60, 40): Revenue = 50(60) + 100(40) = $7000\n(80, 0): Revenue = 50(80) + 100(0) = $4000\n\nThe maximum revenue of $8000 is achieved when the company produces 0 chairs and 80 tables. This production plan ensures robustness to up to a 20% increase in the raw material cost."
