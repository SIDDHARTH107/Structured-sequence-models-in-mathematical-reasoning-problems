Find the wavefunction $\\psi(x,t)$ at time $t=2$ seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the Schrödinger equation, we first need to separate the variables. We can do this by assuming a solution of the form $\\psi(x,t) = \\phi(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$ih\\phi(x)\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{h^2}{2m}\\phi''(x)T(t) + V(x)\\phi(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $\\phi(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{ih}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{h^2}{2m}\\frac{\\phi''(x)}{\\phi(x)} + V(x)$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $E$ (the energy eigenvalue):\n\n$\\frac{ih}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = E$\n\n$-\\frac{h^2}{2m}\\frac{\\phi''(x)}{\\phi(x)} + V(x) = E$\n\nNow, we have two separate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve. The first one is:\n\n$\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{-iET}{h}$\n\nThe solution to this ODE is:\n\n$T(t) = e^{-iEt/h}$\n\nThe second ODE is:\n\n$-\\frac{h^2}{2m}\\phi''(x) + V(x)\\phi(x) = E\\phi(x)$\n\nThis ODE is more difficult to solve, especially with the given potential function $V(x) = x(x-1)$. In general, the solutions to this ODE will be a linear combination of energy eigenfunctions:\n\n$\\phi(x) = \\sum_n c_n \\phi_n(x)$\n\nwhere $c_n$ are coefficients and $\\phi_n(x)$ are the energy eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalues $E_n$. To find the wavefunction at time $t=2$ seconds, we need to determine the coefficients $c_n$ by using the initial wavefunction $\\psi(x,0) = x(1-x)$:\n\n$x(1-x) = \\sum_n c_n \\phi_n(x)$\n\nIn general, finding the coefficients $c_n$ and the energy eigenfunctions $\\phi_n(x)$ for an arbitrary potential function is a difficult task and often requires numerical methods. Once the coefficients and eigenfunctions are found, the wavefunction at time $t=2$ seconds can be calculated as:\n\n$\\psi(x,2) = \\sum_n c_n \\phi_n(x) e^{-iE_nt/h}$\n\nHowever, without more information or simplifications to the potential function, it is not possible to provide an explicit solution for the wavefunction $\\psi(x,t)$ at time $t=2$ seconds."
