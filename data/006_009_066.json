    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition, multiply the probability of having the condition by the total number of people in the town.\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Probability × Total number of people\n= 0.2 × 500\n= 100\n\nSo, 100 people in the town are expected to have the medical condition."
