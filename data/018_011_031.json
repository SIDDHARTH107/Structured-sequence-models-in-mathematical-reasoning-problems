    "message_2": "First, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B, so A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ B) × A. Since A ∩ B is an empty set, the Cartesian product of the empty set with any set will also be an empty set. Therefore, (A ∩ B) × A = ∅.\n\nNext, let's find A × B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. In this case, A × B = {(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)}.\n\nNow, let's find A × {3}. The Cartesian product of set A and a set containing only the element 3 is the set of all ordered pairs (a, 3) where a ∈ A. In this case, A × {3} = {(2,3), (4,3), (6,3)}.\n\nFinally, let's find (A × B) ∩ (A × {3}). The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the common elements are the ordered pairs (2,3), (4,3), and (6,3). Therefore, (A × B) ∩ (A × {3}) = {(2,3), (4,3), (6,3)}.\n\nNow, let's show that the Cartesian product is distributive over intersection. We need to show that (A ∩ B) × A = (A × B) ∩ (A × A) for any sets A and B.\n\nLet's consider the left-hand side of the equation, (A ∩ B) × A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ (A ∩ B) and b ∈ A. Since a ∈ (A ∩ B), it means that a ∈ A and a ∈ B. So, the ordered pairs (a, b) can be written as (a, a) where a ∈ A and a ∈ B.\n\nNow, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, (A × B) ∩ (A × A). This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) that are common to both A × B and A × A. Since A × B contains all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B, and A × A contains all ordered pairs (a, a) where a ∈ A, the intersection of these two sets will contain all ordered pairs (a, a) where a ∈ A and a ∈ B.\n\nComparing the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation, we can see that they both represent the same set of ordered pairs (a, a) where a ∈ A and a ∈ B. Therefore, the Cartesian product is distributive over intersection: (A ∩ B) × A = (A × B) ∩ (A × A)."
