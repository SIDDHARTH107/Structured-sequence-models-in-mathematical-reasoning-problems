    "message_2": "This is a Fibonacci-like sequence. To find the ninth term, we can calculate the terms one by one:\n\n1st term: 3\n2nd term: 5\n3rd term: 3 + 5 = 8\n4th term: 5 + 8 = 13\n5th term: 8 + 13 = 21\n6th term: 13 + 21 = 34\n7th term: 21 + 34 = 55\n8th term: 34 + 55 = 89\n9th term: 55 + 89 = 144\n\nSo, the ninth term of the sequence is 144."
