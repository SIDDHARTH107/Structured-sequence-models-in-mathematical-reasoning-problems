    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, and has 1,000 units of raw material and 800 units of labor available. It earns a profit of $5 on each unit of A and $8 on each unit of B. Product A requires 3 units of raw material and 4 units of labor per unit, while product B requires 4 units of raw material and 5 units of labor per unit. Find the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y.\n\nThe constraints for raw material and labor are:\n3x + 4y ≤ 1000 (raw material constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 800 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 1000\ny ≤ (1000 - 3x) / 4\n\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 800\ny ≤ (800 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect, as well as the x and y axes. We will find these intersection points:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n3x + 4y = 1000\n4x + 5y = 800\n\nSolve the system of equations:\nx = 200 - y\nSubstitute x into the first equation:\n3(200 - y) + 4y = 1000\n600 - 3y + 4y = 1000\ny = 400\n\nx = 200 - 400 = -200 (not valid since x ≥ 0)\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0):\n3x + 4(0) = 1000\nx = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333.33\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0):\n4(0) + 5y = 800\ny = 800 / 5 = 160\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(333.33, 0) = 5(333.33) + 8(0) ≈ 1666.65\n3. P(0, 160) = 5(0) + 8(160) = 1280\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (333.33, 0), with a profit of approximately $1666.65. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, it should produce 333 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize its profit."
