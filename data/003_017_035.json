    "message_2": "To find the average temperature of the room over an 8-hour period, we can use the sinusoidal function that represents the temperature variation. The sinusoidal function can be written in the form:\n\nT(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere T(t) is the temperature at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nSince the temperature varies between a maximum of 25°C and a minimum of 20°C, the amplitude A is half the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures:\n\nA = (25 - 20) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5\n\nThe vertical shift D is the average of the maximum and minimum temperatures:\n\nD = (25 + 20) / 2 = 45 / 2 = 22.5\n\nNow, we have the sinusoidal function:\n\nT(t) = 2.5 * sin(B(t - C)) + 22.5\n\nSince we are looking for the average temperature over an 8-hour period, we don't need to worry about the phase shift C and the angular frequency B. The average temperature will be the same regardless of the phase shift and the period of the sinusoidal function.\n\nTo find the average temperature, we can integrate the temperature function over an 8-hour period and divide by the length of the interval (8 hours):\n\nAverage temperature = (1/8) * ∫[2.5 * sin(B(t - C)) + 22.5] dt from 0 to 8\n\nSince the integral of sin(B(t - C)) over a full period is 0, the average temperature will be the same as the vertical shift D:\n\nAverage temperature = 22.5°C\n\nSo, the average temperature of the room over an 8-hour period is 22.5°C."
