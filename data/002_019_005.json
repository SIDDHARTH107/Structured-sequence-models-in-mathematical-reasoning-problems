    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (a sector of a circle), and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (A_base): \nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = 25π cm^2\n\n2. Lateral area (A_lateral):\nFirst, we need to find the height (h) of the cone using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have the slant height (l) and the radius (r).\n\nh = √(l^2 - r^2)\nh = √(12^2 - 5^2)\nh = √(144 - 25)\nh = √119 cm\n\nNow, we can find the lateral area using the formula:\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nA_lateral = π * (5 cm) * (12 cm)\nA_lateral = 60π cm^2\n\n3. Total surface area (A_total):\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π cm^2 + 60π cm^2\nA_total = 85π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 85π cm^2, or approximately 267.04 cm^2."
