    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius (r) of 5 centimeters, the circumference (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2πr\nC = 2 × 3.14159 × 5\nC ≈ 31.4159 centimeters\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle with a radius of 5 centimeters is approximately 31.4159 centimeters."
