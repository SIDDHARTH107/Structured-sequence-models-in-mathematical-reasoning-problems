    "message_2": "Let's first recall some facts about elliptic curves and their torsion points. \n\n1. The torsion points on an elliptic curve form a subgroup of the group of points on the curve.\n2. The number of torsion points of order n is at most n^2.\n\nNow, we are given that |E[5]| = 8. Since the torsion points form a subgroup, this implies that the 5-torsion subgroup has order 8. The only possible structures for this subgroup are either Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_4. \n\nLet's consider the Weil pairing, which is a bilinear map e_n: E[n] x E[n] -> μ_n, where μ_n is the group of nth roots of unity. The Weil pairing is alternating, which means that e_n(P, P) = 1 for all P in E[n]. \n\nNow, let's analyze the two possible structures for the 5-torsion subgroup:\n\n1. If the 5-torsion subgroup is Z_8, then there exists a point Q of order 8 in E[5]. However, this would mean that e_5(2Q, 2Q) = e_8(Q, Q) = 1, which contradicts the fact that the Weil pairing is alternating. Therefore, the 5-torsion subgroup cannot be Z_8.\n\n2. If the 5-torsion subgroup is Z_2 x Z_4, then there exist points P1 and P2 in E[5] such that P1 has order 2 and P2 has order 4. In this case, we have e_5(P1, P2) = e_4(2P1, P2) = e_4(O, P2) = 1, where O is the identity element. This is consistent with the properties of the Weil pairing.\n\nThus, the 5-torsion subgroup must be Z_2 x Z_4. This means that there is a point of order 2 and a point of order 4 in E[5]. \n\nA point of order 2 on the elliptic curve has the form (x, 0), which means that x^3 + ax + b = 0. Let x_2 be the x-coordinate of this point. Then, x_2^3 + ax_2 + b ≡ 0 (mod 5).\n\nA point of order 4 on the elliptic curve satisfies 2P = (x_4, 0), where P is the point of order 4. Let x_4 be the x-coordinate of this point. Then, (2x_4)^3 + a(2x_4) + b ≡ 0 (mod 5).\n\nNow, we have two congruences:\n\n1. x_2^3 + ax_2 + b ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n2. 8x_4^3 + 2ax_4 + b ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n\nSubtracting the first congruence from the second, we get:\n\n7x_4^3 - x_2^3 + 2ax_4 - ax_2 ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n\nSince 7 ≡ 2 (mod 5), we can rewrite this as:\n\n2(x_4^3 - x_2^3) + a(2x_4 - x_2) ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n\nThis implies that 5 divides a(2x_4 - x_2), so a ≡ 0 (mod 5).\n\nNow, substituting a ≡ 0 (mod 5) back into the first congruence, we get:\n\nx_2^3 + b ≡ 0 (mod 5)\n\nThis implies that b ≡ -x_2^3 (mod 5).\n\nTherefore, the possible values of a and b modulo 5 are a ≡ 0 (mod 5) and b ≡ -x_2^3 (mod 5), where x_2 is the x-coordinate of a point of order 2 on the elliptic curve."
