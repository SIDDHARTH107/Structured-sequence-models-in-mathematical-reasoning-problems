    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod at t = 60 seconds, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∂T/∂t and ∂²T/∂x² are the first and second partial derivatives of T with respect to t and x, respectively.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)  and  ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nSolving the first equation for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A cos(λx) + B sin(λx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants.\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions. At x = 0, the temperature is 50°C, and at x = 10 cm, the temperature is 20°C. So,\n\nX(0)T(t) = 50  =>  A cos(0) + B sin(0) = 50  =>  A = 50\n\nX(10)T(t) = 20  =>  50 cos(λ10) + B sin(λ10) = 20\n\nSince the rod is finite, we can assume a Fourier series solution with λ = nπ/L, where n is an integer and L is the length of the rod (10 cm). So,\n\n50 cos(nπ) + B sin(nπ) = 20\n\nFor n = 1, we get:\n\n50 cos(π) + B sin(π) = 20  =>  B = 0\n\nThus, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = 50 cos(nπx/10)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution T(x, t) by multiplying X(x) and T(t):\n\nT(x, t) = 50Ce^(-αλ²t) cos(nπx/10)\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 50 cos(nπx/10). So,\n\n50Ce^(-αλ²0) cos(nπx/10) = 50 cos(nπx/10)\n\nThis implies that C = 1.\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution along the rod at t = 60 seconds is:\n\nT(x, t) = 50e^(-αλ²t) cos(nπx/10)\n\nT(x, 60) = 50e^(-0.5(π/10)² * 60) cos(πx/10)\n\nT(x, 60) ≈ 50e^(-4.7124) cos(πx/10)\n\nT(x, 60) ≈ 50 * 0.00898 * cos(πx/10)\n\nT(x, 60) ≈ 0.449 cos(πx/10)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod at t = 60 seconds. Note that this is an approximate solution, as we have considered only the first term (n = 1) of the Fourier series. To get a more accurate solution, we would need to consider more terms in the series."
