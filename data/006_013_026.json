    "message_1": "A certain type of natural disaster occurs in a region with a probability of 0.2 in any given year. Calculate the probability that this natural disaster will occur at least 2 out of the next 5 years.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the natural disaster occurring at least 2 out of the next 5 years, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of k successes (natural disasters) in n trials (years)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (natural disaster) in a single trial (year)\n- n is the number of trials (years)\n- k is the number of successes (natural disasters)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least 2 natural disasters occurring in the next 5 years. So, we need to calculate the probability of 2, 3, 4, and 5 natural disasters occurring and sum those probabilities.\n\nP(X≥2) = P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=2) = C(5, 2) * 0.2^2 * (1-0.2)^(5-2) = 10 * 0.04 * 0.512 = 0.2048\nP(X=3) = C(5, 3) * 0.2^3 * (1-0.2)^(5-3) = 10 * 0.008 * 0.64 = 0.0512\nP(X=4) = C(5, 4) * 0.2^4 * (1-0.2)^(5-4) = 5 * 0.0016 * 0.8 = 0.0064\nP(X=5) = C(5, 5) * 0.2^5 * (1-0.2)^(5-5) = 1 * 0.00032 * 1 = 0.00032\n\nNow, we can sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X≥2) = 0.2048 + 0.0512 + 0.0064 + 0.00032 = 0.26272\n\nSo, the probability that the natural disaster will occur at least 2 out of the next 5 years is approximately 0.26272 or 26.27%."
