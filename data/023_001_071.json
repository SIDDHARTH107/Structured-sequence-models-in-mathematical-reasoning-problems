    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series:\n\nf(x) ≈ (a_0 / 2) + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor a periodic function with period 2L, the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\n\nIn our case, the period is 2π, so L = π. Let's find the coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[x * cos(0) dx] from -π to π\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[x dx] from -π to π\na_0 = (1 / π) * [(x^2 / 2) | from -π to π]\na_0 = (1 / π) * [(π^2 / 2) - (-π^2 / 2)]\na_0 = (1 / π) * (π^2)\na_0 = π\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x) dx] from -π to π\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function and cos(n * x) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nWe will use integration by parts, where u = x and dv = sin(n * x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1 / n) * cos(n * x).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-x / n) * cos(n * x) + (1 / n) * ∫[cos(n * x) dx]] from -π to π\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-x / n) * cos(n * x) + (1 / n^2) * sin(n * x)] from -π to π\n\nNow, evaluate the integral:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [((-π / n) * cos(n * π) + (1 / n^2) * sin(n * π)) - ((π / n) * cos(-n * π) + (1 / n^2) * sin(-n * π))]\nb_n = (1 / π) * [((-π / n) * (-1)^n - 0) - (π / n) * (-1)^n]\nb_n = (1 / π) * [2 * (-1)^n * (π / n)]\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) ≈ (π / 2) + Σ [(2 * (-1)^n * (π / n)) * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
