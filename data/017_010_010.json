    "message_2": "First, let's find the center of each group and their orders.\n\n1. Cyclic group C10:\nSince C10 is an abelian group, every element in the group commutes with every other element. Therefore, the center of C10 is the whole group itself. The order of the center of C10 is equal to the order of the group, which is 10.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5:\nThe dihedral group D5 has 10 elements, which can be represented as {e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4}, where r is the rotation and s is the reflection. The center of D5 consists of the elements that commute with all other elements in the group. In the dihedral group, only the identity element e and the 180-degree rotation r^2 commute with all other elements. Therefore, the center of D5 is {e, r^2}, and its order is 2.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10:\nThere is no non-abelian group of order 10. The only two groups of order 10 are C10 and D5, both of which we have already considered.\n\nIn conclusion, the orders of the centers of the groups are:\n- C10: 10\n- D5: 2"
