    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 5 elements, i.e., |A| = 5. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nThe number of elements in the power set P(A) can be calculated using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the original set A. In this case, n = 5.\n\nSo, the number of elements in P(A) is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's verify that the size of the power set is always larger than the size of the set itself.\n\nFor any set A with |A| = n, the size of its power set P(A) is 2^n. We want to show that 2^n > n for all n ≥ 0.\n\nBase case: n = 0\n2^0 = 1 > 0, so the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that 2^k > k for some k ≥ 0. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by properties of exponents)\nSince 2^k > k (by the inductive hypothesis), we have:\n2 * 2^k > 2 * k\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is equivalent to showing that k > 1.\n\nSince our induction starts at k = 0, we can check the next value, k = 1:\n2 * 1 = 2 > 1 + 1 = 2, which is not true.\n\nHowever, for k ≥ 2, we have:\n2 * k > k + 1\nk > 1\n\nSo, for all n ≥ 2, 2^n > n, and we have already shown that it holds for n = 0. Therefore, the size of the power set is always larger than the size of the set itself for all n ≥ 0."
