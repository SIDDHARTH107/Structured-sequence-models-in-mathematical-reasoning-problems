    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). To find the clique number of graph G, we need to identify the largest complete subgraph.\n\nLet's examine the connections between the vertices:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 4.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 5.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1 and 3.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 2 and 3.\n6. Vertex 6 is not connected to any vertex.\n7. Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 3.\n\nFrom the connections, we can see that the largest complete subgraph is formed by vertices 1, 2, and 3. All three vertices are connected to each other:\n\n- Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 3.\n- Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1 and 3.\n- Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of graph G is 3."
