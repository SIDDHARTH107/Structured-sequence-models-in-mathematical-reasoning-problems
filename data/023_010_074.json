    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of a 256x256 grayscale image using the Fourier transform, we need to apply the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the image. The 2D DFT is defined as:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ[Σ[f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N))]] for x = 0 to M-1 and y = 0 to N-1\n\nwhere:\n- F(u, v) is the frequency domain representation of the image\n- f(x, y) is the grayscale value of the pixel at position (x, y) in the image\n- M and N are the dimensions of the image (in this case, both are 256)\n- u and v are the frequency variables\n- j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718)\n\nTo compute the frequency domain representation, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible values of u and v (from 0 to 255).\n2. For each combination of u and v, compute the sum of the product of the grayscale values f(x, y) and the complex exponential term e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N)) for all x and y (from 0 to 255).\n3. Store the computed value F(u, v) in a 256x256 matrix.\n\nAfter completing these steps, the 256x256 matrix will contain the frequency domain representation of the image. Note that the resulting matrix will contain complex numbers.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a high-level explanation of the process, and actually computing the Fourier transform requires programming and numerical computation. Many programming languages and libraries, such as Python with the NumPy library, provide built-in functions to perform the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform."
