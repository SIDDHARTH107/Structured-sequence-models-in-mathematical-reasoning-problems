    "message_1": "A man has a total of 100 coins in his pocket, some of which are quarters and some of which are dimes. If the value of his quarters is $4 more than twice the value of his dimes, how many quarters and how many dimes does he have?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of quarters and y be the number of dimes. We can set up the following system of equations:\n\nx + y = 100 (total number of coins)\n0.25x = 2(0.10y) + 4 (value of quarters is $4 more than twice the value of dimes)\n\nFirst, we can simplify the second equation:\n\n0.25x = 0.20y + 4\n\nNow, we can solve for y in the first equation:\n\ny = 100 - x\n\nNext, substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n\n0.25x = 0.20(100 - x) + 4\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n0.25x = 20 - 0.20x + 4\n0.45x = 24\nx = 53.333 (approximately)\n\nSince the number of quarters must be a whole number, we can round x down to 53. Now, we can find the number of dimes:\n\ny = 100 - 53\ny = 47\n\nSo, the man has 53 quarters and 47 dimes."
