    "message_1": "A weather forecaster predicts that the probability of rain on a specific day is 0.3. What is the probability that it will not rain that day?",
    "message_2": "The probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. In this case, the probability of rain is 0.3. Therefore, the probability of it not raining that day is:\n\n1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that it will not rain that day is 0.7 or 70%."
