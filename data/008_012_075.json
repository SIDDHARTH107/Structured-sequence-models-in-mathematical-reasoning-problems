    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    |  7 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find the inverse of A using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -5 -3 |\n             | -4  2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                   | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n         | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   |  5/22  3/22 |   | 11 |\n| y | = |  4/22 -2/22 | * |  7 |\n\n| x |   | (5/22)*11 + (3/22)*7  |\n| y | = | (4/22)*11 + (-2/22)*7 |\n\n| x |   |  55/22 + 21/22  |\n| y | = |  44/22 - 14/22  |\n\n| x |   |  76/22  |\n| y | = |  30/22  |\n\nx = 76/22 = 38/11\ny = 30/22 = 15/11\n\nSo, the values of x and y are x = 38/11 and y = 15/11."
