    "message_1": "A financial analyst wants to analyze the daily closing prices of a given stock over the past year. The data contains 252 data points (representing 252 trading days), and the prices have been adjusted for splits and dividends. \n\nThe analyst decides to use the Fourier transform to decompose the prices into their constituent frequencies. They wish to identify the dominant frequencies that may indicate periodicity in the data. \n\nIf the analyst applies the Fourier transform to the data, how many frequencies will they obtain in the frequency domain?",
    "message_2": "When the analyst applies the Fourier transform to the 252 data points, they will obtain 252 frequencies in the frequency domain. However, due to the symmetry of the Fourier transform for real-valued data, only the first 126 frequencies (excluding the zero frequency) will be unique and relevant for analysis."
