    "message_2": "To compute the second Chern class c2(M) of the complex manifold M, we can use the Chern classes relation for complex manifolds of complex dimension 2. The relation is given by:\n\nc2(M) = c1(M)^2 - 2 * c1(M)\n\nwhere c1(M) is the first Chern class and c2(M) is the second Chern class.\n\nGiven that c1(M) = 5, we can substitute this value into the relation:\n\nc2(M) = 5^2 - 2 * 5\nc2(M) = 25 - 10\nc2(M) = 15\n\nTherefore, the second Chern class c2(M) of the complex manifold M is 15."
