    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph.\n\nLet's consider the graph G with 8 vertices where the degree of each vertex is at least 5. Since there are 8 vertices, the maximum degree a vertex can have is 7 (connected to all other vertices).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for the maximum clique size:\n\n1. If there is a vertex with a degree of 7, it means it is connected to all other vertices. In this case, the maximum clique size would be 8, as all vertices would be connected to each other.\n\n2. If all vertices have a degree of 5, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle to analyze the maximum clique size. Since each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices, there are a total of 8 * 5 = 40 connections. However, each connection is counted twice (once for each vertex), so there are actually 40 / 2 = 20 unique connections.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of vertices that can form a clique. If we have a clique of size k, there are k * (k - 1) / 2 connections within the clique. We want to find the maximum k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 20.\n\nFor k = 4, we have 4 * 3 / 2 = 6 connections.\nFor k = 5, we have 5 * 4 / 2 = 10 connections.\nFor k = 6, we have 6 * 5 / 2 = 15 connections.\nFor k = 7, we have 7 * 6 / 2 = 21 connections.\n\nSince 21 connections exceed the total number of unique connections, the maximum number of vertices that can form a clique in G is 6."
