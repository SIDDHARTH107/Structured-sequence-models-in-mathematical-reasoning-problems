    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees for which sin(x) = 0.5, we can use the arcsin function, also known as the inverse sine function.\n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 30 degrees\n\nHowever, the sine function is periodic with a period of 360 degrees, so there are multiple solutions for x. The general solution is:\n\nx = 30 + 360n or x = 180 - 30 + 360n, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, the possible values of x are:\n\nx ≈ 30, 150, 390, 510, ... (and so on, for both positive and negative integers n)\n\nThe nearest degree for the given condition is x ≈ 30 degrees."
