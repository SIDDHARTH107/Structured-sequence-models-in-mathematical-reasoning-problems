The total amount in the pot will then be doubled and divided equally among all players, including those who did not contribute. Each player starts with $10, and the game is repeated for 10 rounds. If a player does not contribute anything in a round, they receive no payout for that round. \n\nAssuming all players are rational and self-interested, what is the Nash equilibrium for the amount each player should contribute in each round to maximize their own payout?",
    "message_2": "In the Public Goods Game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when no player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategies of the other players. In this case, the rational and self-interested strategy for each player is to contribute nothing to the common pot in each round.\n\nHere's why:\n\nLet's consider a single round of the game. If a player contributes x dollars to the pot, the pot will increase by 2x dollars after doubling. This 2x dollars will then be divided among the 5 players, so each player will receive (2x/5) dollars. Since there are 5 players, the player who contributed x dollars will receive (2x/5) dollars back, which is less than their initial contribution of x dollars (as long as x > 0). This means that contributing any amount of money to the pot will result in a net loss for the contributing player.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium in this game is for each player to contribute $0 in each round. This is because if any player were to deviate from this strategy and contribute a positive amount, they would receive a lower payout than if they had contributed nothing."
