    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to maximize the profit from the production of two products, A and B. The production process uses two machines, M1 and M2. The time required to produce one unit of Product A is 2 hours on M1 and 1 hour on M2. The time required to produce one unit of Product B is 1 hour on M1 and 3 hours on M2. The company has a total of 100 hours available for M1 and 120 hours for M2. The profit of Product A is $10/unit and Product B is $15/unit. Using semi-definite programming, what is the optimal production quantity of Product A and B for the company to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming instead of semi-definite programming since the constraints are linear. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 100 (M1's available hours)\nx + 3y ≤ 120 (M2's available hours)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we'll use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. 2x + y = 100\n   y = -2x + 100\n\n2. x + 3y = 120\n   y = (1/3)x + 40\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's the quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (30, 20), and (50, 0).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 15(40) = $600\n3. P(30, 20) = 10(30) + 15(20) = $900\n4. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 15(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit is $900, which occurs when producing 30 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B."
