This subset of vertices covers all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Edge 1-2 is covered by vertex 2\n- Edge 1-4 is covered by vertex 4\n- Edge 2-3 is covered by vertex 2\n- Edge 2-4 is covered by vertex 2\n- Edge 2-5 is covered by vertex 2\n- Edge 3-5 is covered by vertex 5\n- Edge 4-5 is covered by vertex 4\n\nNo smaller subset of vertices can cover all the edges in the graph, so the minimum size of a vertex cover is 3."
