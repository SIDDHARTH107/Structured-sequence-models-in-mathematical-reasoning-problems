    "message_1": "In discriminant analysis, a student is given a set of data consisting of the heights of 50 male and 50 female students. The student needs to determine if the height can be used to predict the gender of the student using discriminant analysis. The heights are normally distributed and have a mean and standard deviation of 68 inches and 3 inches for males, and 63 inches and 2.5 inches for females. What is the equation of the discriminant function and what is the percentage of correct classification of students using this function?",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the discriminant function. The discriminant function is given by the equation:\n\nD(x) = ln(P(Male)/P(Female)) + (x^2/(2*σ_M^2) - x^2/(2*σ_F^2)) - (μ_M^2/(2*σ_M^2) - μ_F^2/(2*σ_F^2))\n\nwhere D(x) is the discriminant function, x is the height, P(Male) and P(Female) are the prior probabilities of being male and female (in this case, both are 0.5 since there are equal numbers of males and females), μ_M and μ_F are the mean heights for males and females, and σ_M and σ_F are the standard deviations for males and females.\n\nUsing the given data, we have:\n\nμ_M = 68 inches\nσ_M = 3 inches\nμ_F = 63 inches\nσ_F = 2.5 inches\n\nPlugging these values into the discriminant function equation, we get:\n\nD(x) = ln(0.5/0.5) + (x^2/(2*3^2) - x^2/(2*2.5^2)) - (68^2/(2*3^2) - 63^2/(2*2.5^2))\nD(x) = (x^2/18 - x^2/12.5) - (4624/18 - 3969/12.5)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nD(x) = (-(1/18) + (1/12.5))x^2 + (4624/18 - 3969/12.5)\n\nNow, to classify a student as male or female based on their height, we can use the following rule:\n\nIf D(x) > 0, classify as Male\nIf D(x) < 0, classify as Female\n\nTo calculate the percentage of correct classification, we would need to apply this rule to the actual data and compare the predicted gender with the true gender. However, since the actual data is not provided, we cannot calculate the percentage of correct classification."
