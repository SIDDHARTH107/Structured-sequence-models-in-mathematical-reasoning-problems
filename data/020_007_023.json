Each machine takes a different amount of time to complete each job, as shown in the table below:\n\n| Machine | Job 1 | Job 2 | Job 3 | Job 4 |\n|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 3     | 5     | 2     | 8     |\n| 2       | 2     | 6     | 7     | 1     |\n| 3       | 6     | 9     | 3     | 4     |\n| 4       | 4     | 4     | 6     | 7     |\n| 5       | 5     | 2     | 8     | 4     |\n\nThe factory wants to assign each job to one of the machines so that all jobs are completed as quickly as possible. What is the minimum time required to complete all jobs, and which machine is assigned to each job?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum time required to complete all jobs, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm. The Hungarian Algorithm is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Subtract the smallest value in each row from all the values in that row.\n2. Subtract the smallest value in each column from all the values in that column.\n3. Cover all zeros in the matrix using a minimum number of horizontal and vertical lines.\n4. If the number of lines is equal to the number of jobs, an optimal assignment is possible. If not, go to step 5.\n5. Find the smallest uncovered value and subtract it from all uncovered values. Add it to the values at the intersection of the lines. Go back to step 3.\n\nApplying the Hungarian Algorithm to the given matrix:\n\nStep 1:\n| 1 | 3 | 0 | 6 |\n| 0 | 4 | 6 | 0 |\n| 3 | 6 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |\n| 3 | 0 | 6 | 0 |\n\nStep 2:\n| 0 | 2 | 0 | 5 |\n| 0 | 4 | 6 | 0 |\n| 2 | 5 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |\n| 3 | 0 | 6 | 0 |\n\nStep 3: Cover all zeros using a minimum number of lines (4 lines in this case).\n\nStep 4: The number of lines is equal to the number of jobs, so an optimal assignment is possible.\n\nThe optimal assignment is:\nMachine 1: Job 3\nMachine 2: Job 1\nMachine 3: Job 4\nMachine 4: Job 2\nMachine 5 is not assigned any job since there are only 4 jobs.\n\nThe minimum time required to complete all jobs is 2 (Job 3 by Machine 1) + 2 (Job 1 by Machine 2) + 4 (Job 4 by Machine 3) + 4 (Job 2 by Machine 4) = 12."
