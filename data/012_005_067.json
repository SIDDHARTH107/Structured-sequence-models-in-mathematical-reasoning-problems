    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices. Since we don't have the specific graph, we can only provide an upper bound for the diameter.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 8 vertices can have. This would be a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the number of edges would be:\n\nE = (8 * 7) / 2 = 28\n\nHowever, our graph has only 12 edges, which means it's not a complete graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph could be a tree, where the diameter is the longest path between any two vertices.\n\nA tree with 8 vertices can have a maximum diameter of 7 (a straight line of 8 vertices). However, since our graph has more edges than a tree (a tree with 8 vertices would have 7 edges), it's likely that the diameter is smaller than 7.\n\nWithout knowing the specific graph, we cannot determine the exact diameter, but we can conclude that the diameter is less than or equal to 7."
