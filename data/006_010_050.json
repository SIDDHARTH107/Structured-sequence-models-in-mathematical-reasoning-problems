    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) out of n trials (people in the demographic group)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of someone being affected by the disease, which is 0.25)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people in the demographic group, which is 10)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people affected by the disease)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 3 out of 10 people being affected by the disease, which means we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., 10 people being affected. To find the probability of at least 3 people being affected, we can find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 people being affected and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) - P(2)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to find P(0), P(1), and P(2):\n\nP(0) = C(10, 0) * (0.25)^0 * (1-0.25)^(10-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.75)^10 ≈ 0.0563\nP(1) = C(10, 1) * (0.25)^1 * (1-0.25)^(10-1) = 10 * 0.25 * (0.75)^9 ≈ 0.1877\nP(2) = C(10, 2) * (0.25)^2 * (1-0.25)^(10-2) = 45 * 0.0625 * (0.75)^8 ≈ 0.2816\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 3 people being affected:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) - P(2) ≈ 1 - 0.0563 - 0.1877 - 0.2816 ≈ 0.4744\n\nSo, the probability of at least 3 out of 10 people from the demographic group being affected by the disease is approximately 0.4744 or 47.44%."
