    "message_1": "Suppose a company is trying to optimize their production by deciding how many of two products, A and B, to manufacture. Each unit of product A sells for $10 and requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time. Each unit of product B sells for $15 and requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 50 hours of labor and 60 hours of machine time available each day. Formulate a mixed-integer linear programming problem to determine the optimal production plan for the company that maximizes their revenue.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A to be produced and y be the number of units of product B to be produced. The objective is to maximize the revenue, which can be represented by the following objective function:\n\nObjective function: Maximize Z = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 50 (Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor, and there are 50 hours of labor available)\n2. Machine time constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 60 (Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of machine time and each unit of product B requires 2 hours of machine time, and there are 60 hours of machine time available)\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y ≥ 0 (The number of units produced for both products must be non-negative)\n\nThe mixed-integer linear programming problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize Z = 10x + 15y\nSubject to:\n2x + 3y ≤ 50\n3x + 2y ≤ 60\nx, y ≥ 0 and integer values\n\nTo solve this mixed-integer linear programming problem, one can use optimization software or algorithms such as branch and bound, cutting plane, or branch and cut methods. The optimal solution will provide the number of units of product A and product B to be produced that maximizes the revenue."
