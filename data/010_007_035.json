    "message_2": "Since Y is the unit circle S¹, we know that the fundamental group of S¹ is isomorphic to ℤ. That is, π(S¹, y0) ≅ ℤ for some y0 in p⁻¹(x0). To show that π(Y, y0) has the same fundamental group, we will use the fact that p: Y → X is a covering map.\n\nLet p_*: π(Y, y0) → π(X, x0) be the induced homomorphism by the covering map p. By the lifting criterion for covering spaces, p_* is injective. This means that the fundamental group of Y, π(Y, y0), is isomorphic to a subgroup of the fundamental group of X, π(X, x0).\n\nSince π(X, x0) = ℤ, the only possible subgroups of π(X, x0) are of the form nℤ, where n is a non-negative integer. Now, we consider two cases:\n\n1. If n = 0, then the subgroup is trivial, which means that π(Y, y0) is trivial. However, this contradicts the fact that Y is the unit circle S¹, which has a non-trivial fundamental group.\n\n2. If n > 0, then the subgroup is isomorphic to ℤ, which means that π(Y, y0) ≅ ℤ.\n\nTherefore, the only possible fundamental group for Y is π(Y, y0) ≅ ℤ, which is the same as the fundamental group of the unit circle S¹."
