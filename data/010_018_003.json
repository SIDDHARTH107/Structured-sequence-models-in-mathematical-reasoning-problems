    "message_1": "Consider a Morse-Smale complex with 8 critical points. Among these critical points, 5 are local minima and 3 are local maxima. If the number of index-1 critical points is twice the number of index-2 critical points, how many saddle points does the complex have?",
    "message_2": "A Morse-Smale complex is a topological space with a Morse function that has a gradient flow with no closed orbits. In such a complex, critical points are classified by their index, which is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at the critical point. Local minima have index 0, local maxima have index n (where n is the dimension of the space), and saddle points have indices between 1 and n-1.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that there are 8 critical points, 5 of which are local minima (index 0) and 3 of which are local maxima (index n). We are also given that the number of index-1 critical points is twice the number of index-2 critical points.\n\nLet x be the number of index-1 critical points and y be the number of index-2 critical points. We have the following equations:\n\nx + y = 8 - 5 - 3 = 0 (since the total number of critical points is 8)\nx = 2y (since the number of index-1 critical points is twice the number of index-2 critical points)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n2y + y = 0\n3y = 0\ny = 0\n\nNow, substituting this value of y back into the second equation, we get:\n\nx = 2(0) = 0\n\nSo, there are 0 index-1 critical points and 0 index-2 critical points. Since saddle points have indices between 1 and n-1, there are no saddle points in this Morse-Smale complex."
