    "message_1": "Consider the Chirikov-Taylor map defined by the iterative equation: \n\nx(n+1) = x(n) + y(n+1) - k*sin(2*pi*x(n))/2*pi\n\ny(n+1) = y(n) - k*sin(2*pi*x(n))/2*pi\n\nwhere k is a constant. Evaluate the value of k such that the Chirikov-Taylor map exhibits chaotic dynamics.",
    "message_2": "The Chirikov-Taylor map, also known as the standard map, exhibits chaotic dynamics for a range of values of the constant k. There is no single value of k for which the map becomes chaotic. Instead, the onset of chaos occurs when k exceeds a critical value, which is approximately k â‰ˆ 0.9716. \n\nFor k values greater than this critical value, the Chirikov-Taylor map exhibits chaotic dynamics, and the degree of chaos increases as k increases. It is important to note that the transition to chaos is not abrupt, and the map can exhibit a mix of regular and chaotic behavior for values of k near the critical value."
