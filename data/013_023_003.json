If Player A decides to trust Player B, Player A will give $4 to Player B. Player B can choose to keep all the money ($14) or share it with Player A. If Player B shares, they will split the $14 equally ($7 each). If Player B keeps all the money, Player A will receive nothing. If Player A does not trust Player B, both players will receive $1. \n\nWhat is the optimal decision for Player A? What is the Nash equilibrium for the Trust Game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal decision for Player A, we need to analyze the possible outcomes and their respective payoffs. There are two possible decisions for Player A: trust or not trust Player B.\n\n1. If Player A trusts Player B:\n   a. Player B shares the money: Player A gets $7, Player B gets $7.\n   b. Player B keeps the money: Player A gets $0, Player B gets $14.\n\n2. If Player A does not trust Player B: Player A gets $1, Player B gets $1.\n\nNow, let's find the Nash equilibrium for the Trust Game. A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nIf Player A trusts Player B, Player B's best response is to keep the money, as they would get $14 instead of $7. If Player A does not trust Player B, there is no decision for Player B to make, as they will receive $1 regardless.\n\nGiven Player B's best response, Player A's best decision is to not trust Player B, as they would get $1 instead of $0. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for the Trust Game is for Player A to not trust Player B, resulting in both players receiving $1."
