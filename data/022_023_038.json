Here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve: \n\nConsider the wave equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0,$\n\nwhere $c=2$ is a constant speed of wave propagation. Suppose that the initial displacement is given by:\n\n$u(x,0) = e^{-\\frac{(x-1)^2}{0.1}},$\n\nand the initial velocity is zero, that is,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0.$\n\nFind the solution $u(x,t)$ for $t>0$ and $-5 \\leq x \\leq 5$ using the method of separation of variables.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$(1) \\quad X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$.\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$(2) \\quad \\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$.\n\nSince the left-hand side of equation (2) depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$(3) \\quad T''(t) + c^2 k^2 T(t) = 0$,\n\n$(4) \\quad X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$.\n\nThe general solution to equation (4) is:\n\n$X(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier sine series of the initial displacement:\n\n$u(x,0) = e^{-\\frac{(x-1)^2}{0.1}} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(\\frac{n \\pi x}{L})$,\n\nwhere $L = 5$ is half of the interval length. The coefficients $B_n$ are given by:\n\n$B_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} e^{-\\frac{(x-1)^2}{0.1}} \\sin(\\frac{n \\pi x}{L}) dx$.\n\nThe general solution to equation (3) is:\n\n$T(t) = C \\cos(c k t) + D \\sin(c k t)$.\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0$.\n\nThis implies that $D = 0$, and thus:\n\n$T(t) = C \\cos(c k t)$.\n\nThe solution to the wave equation is given by:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\cos(\\frac{2 n \\pi t}{5}) \\sin(\\frac{n \\pi x}{5})$,\n\nwhere $B_n$ are the Fourier coefficients."
