    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is created by successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to the sides of a larger equilateral triangle. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (1/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the first iteration (n = 0), the perimeter is just the perimeter of the initial equilateral triangle:\n\nPerimeter = 10 * 3 = 30 cm\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of sides is multiplied by 4, and the side length is multiplied by 1/3:\n\nIteration 1 (n = 1):\n- Number of sides: 3 * 4 = 12\n- Side length: 10 * (1/3) = 10/3 cm\n- Perimeter: 12 * (10/3) = 40 cm\n\nIteration 2 (n = 2):\n- Number of sides: 12 * 4 = 48\n- Side length: (10/3) * (1/3) = 10/9 cm\n- Perimeter: 48 * (10/9) = 160/3 cm\n\nIteration 3 (n = 3):\n- Number of sides: 48 * 4 = 192\n- Side length: (10/9) * (1/3) = 10/27 cm\n- Perimeter: 192 * (10/27) = 640/9 cm\n\nIteration 4 (n = 4):\n- Number of sides: 192 * 4 = 768\n- Side length: (10/27) * (1/3) = 10/81 cm\n- Perimeter: 768 * (10/81) = 2560/27 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after its 4th iteration with an initial side length of 10 cm is 2560/27 cm, or approximately 94.81 cm."
