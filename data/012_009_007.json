    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible for such a graph to exist. We can use the Havel-Hakimi theorem to check if the degree sequence is graphical. The Havel-Hakimi theorem states that a degree sequence is graphical if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first number (k) and subtracting 1 from the next k numbers (sorted in non-increasing order) is graphical.\n\nGiven degree sequence: d(G) = (3, 2, 2, 1, 1)\n\n1. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: (3, 2, 2, 1, 1)\n2. Remove the first number (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 numbers: (1, 1, 1, 1)\n\nNow we have a new sequence (1, 1, 1, 1), which represents a graph where all vertices have degree 1. This is a valid graphical sequence since it represents a disjoint set of edges (a matching).\n\nNow, let's draw a sketch of the graph G:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E.\n2. Assign degrees according to the original degree sequence: deg(A) = 3, deg(B) = 2, deg(C) = 2, deg(D) = 1, deg(E) = 1.\n3. Connect the vertices based on their degrees:\n   - Connect A to B, C, and D (A has degree 3).\n   - Connect B to C (B has degree 2, and it's already connected to A).\n   - Connect D to E (D has degree 1, and it's already connected to A).\n   - All vertices now have their required degrees.\n\nThe graph G looks like this:\n\n```\n  B---C\n  |   |\n  A---D\n   \\\n    E\n```\n\nSo, it is possible for a graph G with the given degree sequence to exist, and the sketch of the graph G is shown above."
