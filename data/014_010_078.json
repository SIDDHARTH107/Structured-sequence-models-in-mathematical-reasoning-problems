    "message_1": "Suppose we have a plaintext message \"HELLO WORLD\" that needs to be encrypted using a simple substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by a corresponding number from 0 to 25. The encryption rule is to add 3 to each letter's numerical value and take the result modulo 26 to get the new numerical value. What is the resulting ciphertext for \"HELLO WORLD\" using this substitution cipher?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the given substitution cipher, we first need to convert each letter to its corresponding numerical value (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25), then add 3 to each value, and finally take the result modulo 26.\n\nHere's the conversion for each letter in \"HELLO WORLD\":\n\nH (7) -> 7+3 = 10 -> 10 mod 26 = 10 (K)\nE (4) -> 4+3 = 7 -> 7 mod 26 = 7 (H)\nL (11) -> 11+3 = 14 -> 14 mod 26 = 14 (O)\nL (11) -> 11+3 = 14 -> 14 mod 26 = 14 (O)\nO (14) -> 14+3 = 17 -> 17 mod 26 = 17 (R)\n(space remains unchanged)\nW (22) -> 22+3 = 25 -> 25 mod 26 = 25 (Z)\nO (14) -> 14+3 = 17 -> 17 mod 26 = 17 (R)\nR (17) -> 17+3 = 20 -> 20 mod 26 = 20 (U)\nL (11) -> 11+3 = 14 -> 14 mod 26 = 14 (O)\nD (3) -> 3+3 = 6 -> 6 mod 26 = 6 (G)\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext for \"HELLO WORLD\" using this substitution cipher is \"KHOOR ZRUOG\"."
