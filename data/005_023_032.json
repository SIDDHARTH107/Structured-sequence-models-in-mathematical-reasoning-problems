    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the data set in ascending order:\n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23\n\nNow, let's find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3):\n\nQ1: The median of the lower half (2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7) is (5+5)/2 = 5\nQ2: The median of the entire data set is 8\nQ3: The median of the upper half (9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23) is 15\n\nNow, let's calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 15 - 5 = 10\n\nNext, we'll find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 5 - 1.5 * 10 = -10\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 15 + 1.5 * 10 = 30\n\nNow, we'll identify any outliers in the data set:\n\nSince all the values in the data set fall within the range of -10 to 30, there are no outliers in this data set using the IQR method."
