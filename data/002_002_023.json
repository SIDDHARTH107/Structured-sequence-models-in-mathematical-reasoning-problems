    "message_2": "To find the volume of the metal ball, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSince the diameter of the metal ball is 10 cm, its radius is half of that, which is 5 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of the radius into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(5)^3\nVolume = (4/3)π(125)\nVolume = (500/3)π\n\nThe volume of the metal used to make the ball is approximately (500/3)π cubic centimeters. If you want a numerical approximation, you can calculate:\n\nVolume ≈ (500/3) * 3.14159 ≈ 523.598 cubic centimeters."
