    "message_2": "A genus 2 curve can be represented as a hyperelliptic curve, which has the form:\n\ny^2 = f(x) = (x - e_1)(x - e_2)...(x - e_6)\n\nwhere e_i are the roots of the polynomial f(x) and are distinct complex numbers. Since the curve is defined up to isomorphism, we can use the action of the Mobius group PSL(2, ℂ) on the roots to fix three of them. For example, we can set e_1 = 0, e_2 = 1, and e_3 = ∞. Then, the curve can be written as:\n\ny^2 = x(x - 1)(x - e_4)(x - e_5)(x - e_6)\n\nNow, we have only three parameters left, e_4, e_5, and e_6, which are the roots of the polynomial f(x). Therefore, the number of parameters required to specify a genus 2 curve using the moduli space of algebraic curves is 3."
