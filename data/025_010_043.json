    "message_1": "Consider an elliptic curve $E$ given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. Let $D$ be the divisor on $E$ defined by $D = 3P_1 + 2P_2$, where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the points on $E$ given by $P_1 = (2,3)$ and $P_2 = (4,6)$. Determine the degree and the dimension of the vector space $L(D)$ of all rational functions on $E$ with poles of order at most one at $P_1$ and $P_2$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the degree of the divisor $D$. The degree of a divisor is the sum of its coefficients, so in this case, the degree of $D$ is $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nNext, we need to find the dimension of the vector space $L(D)$. By the Riemann-Roch theorem for elliptic curves, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = \\deg(D) - g + 1$,\n\nwhere $K$ is the canonical divisor, $g$ is the genus of the curve, and $l(D)$ is the dimension of the vector space $L(D)$. For an elliptic curve, the genus is always 1. Since the degree of $D$ is 5, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = 5 - 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nNow we need to find $l(K - D)$. The canonical divisor $K$ of an elliptic curve is given by the divisor of the differential form $\\omega = dx/2y$. The degree of $K$ is $2g - 2 = 2(1) - 2 = 0$. Therefore, the degree of $K - D$ is $0 - 5 = -5$. Since the degree of $K - D$ is negative, there are no functions with poles only at the points specified by $K - D$, so $l(K - D) = 0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$l(D) = 5$.\n\nSo, the degree of the divisor $D$ is 5, and the dimension of the vector space $L(D)$ is 5."
