    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the Dragon Curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal Length = Initial Length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the total length after 10 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nTotal Length = 1 * (2^10)\n\nTotal Length = 1 * 1024\n\nTotal Length = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve obtained after 10 iterations with an initial segment length of 1 unit is 1024 units."
