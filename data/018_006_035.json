    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A contains 25 elements and U denotes the universal set. If the complement of A contains 15 elements, prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U, we need to show that every element in U is either in A or in the complement of A (denoted as A').\n\nLet's first analyze the given information:\n\n1. A contains 25 elements.\n2. The complement of A (A') contains 15 elements.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element x in U. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. x is in A.\n2. x is not in A.\n\nIf x is in A, then it is already in the union of A and A'. \n\nIf x is not in A, then by definition, x must be in the complement of A (A'), since A' contains all elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, x is in the union of A and A'.\n\nIn both cases, x is in the union of A and A'. Since x was an arbitrary element in U, this holds true for all elements in U. Therefore, the union of A and its complement A' contains all elements in U.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of elements in the union of A and A'. Since A and A' are disjoint sets (i.e., they have no elements in common), the total number of elements in their union is the sum of the number of elements in each set. So, the union of A and A' contains 25 + 15 = 40 elements.\n\nSince the union of A and A' contains all elements in U and has the same number of elements as U, we can conclude that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
