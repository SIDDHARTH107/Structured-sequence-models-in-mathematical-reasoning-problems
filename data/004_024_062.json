    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx at point (2,0), we will first differentiate the given implicit function with respect to x.\n\nGiven function: y^3 + 2y = x^2\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd/dx (y^3 + 2y) = d/dx (x^2)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) + 2(dy/dx) = 2x\n\nNow, we will find the value of dy/dx at the point (2,0). Substitute x = 2 and y = 0 into the equation:\n\n3(0)^2(dy/dx) + 2(dy/dx) = 2(2)\n\n0 + 2(dy/dx) = 4\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\n2(dy/dx) = 4\n\ndy/dx = 4/2\n\ndy/dx = 2\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx at the point (2,0) is 2."
