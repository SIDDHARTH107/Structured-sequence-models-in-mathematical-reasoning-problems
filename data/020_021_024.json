    "message_1": "A company has three machines that can produce a certain product. Machine 1 produces 30 units per hour, Machine 2 produces 25 units per hour, and Machine 3 produces 20 units per hour. The company wants to produce 600 units of the product in the shortest possible time. What is the optimal number of hours each machine should be used?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of hours each machine should be used, we first need to determine the combined production rate of all three machines.\n\nMachine 1: 30 units/hour\nMachine 2: 25 units/hour\nMachine 3: 20 units/hour\n\nCombined production rate = 30 + 25 + 20 = 75 units/hour\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours it would take for all three machines to produce 600 units together.\n\nTotal units needed = 600 units\nCombined production rate = 75 units/hour\n\nNumber of hours needed = Total units needed / Combined production rate\nNumber of hours needed = 600 units / 75 units/hour = 8 hours\n\nSo, the optimal number of hours each machine should be used is 8 hours. All three machines should be used simultaneously for 8 hours to produce 600 units in the shortest possible time."
