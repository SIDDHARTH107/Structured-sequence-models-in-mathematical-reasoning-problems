    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) and then compute the probability that the value of $X_t$ exceeds 2 for any $t \\in [t_0, t_f]$.\n\nThe given SDE is:\n\n$$\ndX_t = aX_t dt + bX_t dW_t\n$$\n\nwith $a = 0.5$, $b = 1.5$, and initial condition $X_0 = 1$. This is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with drift $a$ and volatility $b$. The solution to this SDE is given by:\n\n$$\nX_t = X_0 \\exp\\left((a - \\frac{b^2}{2})t + bW_t\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for any $t \\in [t_0, t_f]$. To do this, we will first find the probability that $X_t > 2$ at a fixed time $t$ and then use the reflection principle to find the probability for any $t \\in [t_0, t_f]$.\n\nLet $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$. Then, $Y_t$ is a Gaussian process with mean $(a - \\frac{b^2}{2})t$ and variance $b^2t$. We want to find the probability $P(Y_t > \\ln(2))$:\n\n$$\nP(Y_t > \\ln(2)) = P\\left(\\frac{Y_t - (a - \\frac{b^2}{2})t}{\\sqrt{b^2t}} > \\frac{\\ln(2) - (a - \\frac{b^2}{2})t}{\\sqrt{b^2t}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $Y_t$ is Gaussian, the term inside the probability is a standard normal random variable, say $Z$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\nP(Y_t > \\ln(2)) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\ln(2) - (a - \\frac{b^2}{2})t}{\\sqrt{b^2t}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for any $t \\in [t_0, t_f]$. Using the reflection principle, we have:\n\n$$\nP(\\exists t \\in [t_0, t_f]: X_t > 2) = 2P(Y_{t_f} > \\ln(2)) - P(\\exists t \\in [t_0, t_f]: Y_t = \\ln(2))\n$$\n\nSince the last term is the probability of a continuous random variable taking a specific value, it is equal to 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\nP(\\exists t \\in [t_0, t_f]: X_t > 2) = 2P(Y_{t_f} > \\ln(2))\n$$\n\nPlugging in the values $a = 0.5$, $b = 1.5$, and $t_f = 10$, we get:\n\n$$\nP(\\exists t \\in [t_0, t_f]: X_t > 2) = 2P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\ln(2) - (0.5 - \\frac{1.5^2}{2})10}{\\sqrt{1.5^2 \\cdot 10}}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nP(\\exists t \\in [t_0, t_f]: X_t > 2) = 2P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\ln(2) - 2.5}{\\sqrt{22.5}}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, we find that:\n\n$$\nP(\\exists t \\in [t_0, t_f]: X_t > 2) \\approx 2(1 - 0.9938) = 0.0124\n$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that the value of $X_t$ exceeds 2 for any $t \\in [t_0, t_f]$ is approximately 1.24%."
