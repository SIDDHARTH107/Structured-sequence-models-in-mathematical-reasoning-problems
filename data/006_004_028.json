    "message_1": "Suppose that you are playing a game of chance at a carnival where you have to select a card from a deck of 52 cards. The game operator will give you a prize if you choose the ace of hearts. What is the probability of winning the game if you get only one chance to select a card?",
    "message_2": "There is only one ace of hearts in a standard deck of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of selecting the ace of hearts in one chance is 1 out of 52. \n\nThe probability can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage:\n\nFraction: 1/52\nDecimal: 0.01923 (rounded to 5 decimal places)\nPercentage: 1.923% (rounded to 3 decimal places)"
