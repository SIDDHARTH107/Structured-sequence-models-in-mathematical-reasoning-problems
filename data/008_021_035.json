    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the third equation is just a multiple of the second equation (multiplied by 2). This means that the third equation does not provide any new information, and we are left with a system of two linear equations with three variables:\n\n$x + 2y - z = 5$\n\n$2x + 5y - 2z = 12$\n\nNow, let's solve this system of two linear equations with three variables. We can eliminate one of the variables by multiplying the first equation by 2 and then subtracting it from the second equation:\n\n$2(x + 2y - z) = 2(5)$\n\n$2x + 4y - 2z = 10$\n\nNow subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation:\n\n$(2x + 5y - 2z) - (2x + 4y - 2z) = 12 - 10$\n\n$y = 2$\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the relationship between x and z. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$x + 2(2) - z = 5$\n\n$x + 4 - z = 5$\n\n$x - z = 1$\n\nNow we have a relationship between x and z: $x - z = 1$. Since we only have two equations for three variables, we cannot find a unique solution for x and z. The solution to this system of linear equations is a family of solutions given by:\n\n$x - z = 1$\n\n$y = 2$\n\nFor any value of z, we can find a corresponding value of x that satisfies the equation $x - z = 1$."
