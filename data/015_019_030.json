    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the total energy of the Henon-Heiles system, we first need to express the Hamiltonian of the system. The Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the system. The kinetic energy is given as T = 10, and the potential energy is given by the function V(x, y). \n\nThe Hamiltonian H can be written as:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = T(x, y, p_x, p_y) + V(x, y)\n\nwhere p_x and p_y are the momenta in the x and y directions, respectively.\n\nSince we are given the y-momentum as p_y = 3, we can write the kinetic energy as:\n\nT(x, y, p_x, p_y) = (1/2m)(p_x^2 + p_y^2) = (1/2m)(p_x^2 + 3^2)\n\nNow, we can write the Hamiltonian as:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = (1/2m)(p_x^2 + 3^2) + (1/2)(x^2 + y^2) + x^2y - (1/3)y^3\n\nTo find the maximum value of the total energy, we need to find the maximum value of the Hamiltonian. Since the kinetic energy is fixed at 10, we can write:\n\n10 = (1/2m)(p_x^2 + 3^2)\n\nSolving for p_x^2:\n\np_x^2 = 20m - 9\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = (1/2m)(20m - 9 + 3^2) + (1/2)(x^2 + y^2) + x^2y - (1/3)y^3\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 10 + (1/2)(x^2 + y^2) + x^2y - (1/3)y^3\n\nTo find the maximum value of the Hamiltonian, we can take the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂H/∂x = x + 2xy = 0\n∂H/∂y = y + x^2 - y^2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 0 and y = 0. Substituting these values back into the Hamiltonian:\n\nH(0, 0, p_x, p_y) = 10 + (1/2)(0^2 + 0^2) + 0^2*0 - (1/3)*0^3 = 10\n\nThus, the maximum value of the total energy of the Henon-Heiles system is 10."
