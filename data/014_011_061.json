    "message_2": "To create a transposition cipher using the key \"3142\", we first need to split the message into groups of 4 characters, since the key has 4 digits. If the message doesn't divide evenly into groups of 4, we can add padding characters (e.g., \"X\") to the end of the message.\n\nMessage: \"HELLO WORLD\"\n\nSplit into groups of 4: \"HELL\" \"O WO\" \"RLDX\"\n\nNow, we rearrange the characters in each group according to the key \"3142\":\n\n\"HELL\" -> \"ELHL\"\n\"O WO\" -> \" WOO\"\n\"RLDX\" -> \"LDRX\"\n\nFinally, we combine the rearranged groups to get the encrypted message:\n\nEncrypted message: \"ELHL WOOLDRX\""
