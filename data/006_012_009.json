    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, there is a 25% chance of a burglary occurring on any given day. If the police department wants to have a presence in the neighborhood at least 90% of the time that a burglary occurs, how many hours per day should a patrol car spend in the neighborhood?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of a burglary occurring as P(B) = 0.25, and the probability of no burglary occurring as P(~B) = 0.75. We want to find the number of hours a patrol car should spend in the neighborhood such that the probability of a police presence during a burglary is at least 90%, or P(P|B) ≥ 0.9.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can express the probability of a police presence during a burglary as:\n\nP(P|B) = P(B|P) * P(P) / P(B)\n\nWe want to find P(P), the probability of a police presence in the neighborhood. Let x be the fraction of the day that the patrol car spends in the neighborhood. Then, P(P) = x, and P(~P) = 1 - x.\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to find P(B):\n\nP(B) = P(B|P) * P(P) + P(B|~P) * P(~P)\n\nSince the probability of a burglary occurring is 25%, we have:\n\n0.25 = P(B|P) * x + P(B|~P) * (1 - x)\n\nWe are given that the police department wants to have a presence in the neighborhood at least 90% of the time that a burglary occurs, so P(B|P) = 0.9. We can now solve for P(B|~P):\n\n0.25 = 0.9 * x + P(B|~P) * (1 - x)\n\nNow, we need to find P(B|~P). Since the probability of a burglary occurring is independent of the police presence, we have:\n\nP(B|~P) = P(B) = 0.25\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n0.25 = 0.9 * x + 0.25 * (1 - x)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n0.25 = 0.9x + 0.25 - 0.25x\n0 = 0.65x\nx = 0\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it would mean that the patrol car doesn't need to spend any time in the neighborhood. This is likely because the given information is contradictory: it's not possible to have a 25% chance of a burglary occurring on any given day and also have a police presence during 90% of burglaries.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we can instead find the minimum value of x such that P(P|B) ≥ 0.9:\n\n0.9 ≤ P(B|P) * P(P) / P(B)\n0.9 ≤ 0.9 * x / 0.25\n0.9 * 0.25 ≤ 0.9 * x\n0.225 ≤ x\n\nThus, the patrol car should spend at least 22.5% of the day in the neighborhood, or 5.4 hours per day, to have a presence during at least 90% of burglaries."
