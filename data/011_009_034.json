    "message_2": "The problem you've described is actually a combinatorial problem, not a Bell number problem. Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set, while this problem is about counting the number of unique handshakes among 7 people.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of ways to choose 2 people (to shake hands) out of 7 people, so n = 7 and k = 2.\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!)\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\n\nC(7, 2) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / 2\n\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nSo there are 21 ways to arrange the handshakes among the 7 people."
