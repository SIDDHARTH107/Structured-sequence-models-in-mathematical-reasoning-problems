    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x - 1 between the limits x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of f(x) is:\n\nâˆ«(2x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x - 1) dx = (1/2)(2x^4) - (4/3)(x^3) + (3/2)(x^2) - x + C\n= x^4 - (4/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits x = 0 and x = 2:\n\nF(2) = (2^4) - (4/3)(2^3) + (3/2)(2^2) - 2\nF(0) = (0^4) - (4/3)(0^3) + (3/2)(0^2) - 0\n\nF(2) = 16 - (32/3) + 6 - 2 = 14 - (32/3)\nF(0) = 0\n\nNow, subtract F(0) from F(2) to find the area under the curve:\n\nArea = F(2) - F(0) = 14 - (32/3)\n\nTo make it easier to read, let's convert 14 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\n14 = 42/3\n\nNow, subtract the fractions:\n\nArea = (42/3) - (32/3) = (42 - 32)/3 = 10/3\n\nSo, the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x - 1 between the limits x = 0 and x = 2 is 10/3 square units."
