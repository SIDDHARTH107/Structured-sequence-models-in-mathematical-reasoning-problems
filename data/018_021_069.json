    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and (A ∩ B), denoted as (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4}\n\nThere are no common elements between the two sets, so the intersection is an empty set:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = ∅\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∩ C) = (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C)\n\nLet's consider a set C = {2, 3, 7, 8}. We will find the symmetric difference and intersection for these sets.\n\nB ∩ C = {3}\nA ∆ (B ∩ C) = A ∆ {3} = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ C):\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\nA ∆ C = {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ C):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C) = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nWe can see that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∩ C) = (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C)\n\n{1, 2, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nThus, the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over intersection."
