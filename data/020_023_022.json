    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Optimal Portfolio Selection:\n\nSuppose an investor has $100,000 to invest and wants to create a portfolio with a mix of two securities, A and B. The expected return for security A is 8%, while the expected return for security B is 12%. The standard deviation for security A is 15%, and for security B is 20%. Assuming that the investor wants to minimize risk, how much money should they allocate to each security to create an optimal portfolio?",
    "message_2": "To create an optimal portfolio that minimizes risk, we need to find the weights of each security that minimize the portfolio's variance. Let's denote the weight of security A as wA and the weight of security B as wB. Since the investor has $100,000 to invest, we have the constraint:\n\nwA + wB = 1\n\nThe portfolio variance can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nPortfolio Variance = (wA^2 * σA^2) + (wB^2 * σB^2) + (2 * wA * wB * Cov(A, B))\n\nHowever, we don't have the covariance (Cov(A, B)) between the two securities. If we assume that the securities are uncorrelated (Cov(A, B) = 0), the formula simplifies to:\n\nPortfolio Variance = (wA^2 * σA^2) + (wB^2 * σB^2)\n\nNow, we need to minimize the Portfolio Variance with respect to the weights wA and wB, subject to the constraint wA + wB = 1. To do this, we can substitute wB = 1 - wA and rewrite the Portfolio Variance as a function of wA only:\n\nPortfolio Variance = (wA^2 * σA^2) + ((1 - wA)^2 * σB^2)\n\nNow, we can take the derivative of the Portfolio Variance with respect to wA and set it to zero to find the optimal weight for security A:\n\nd(Portfolio Variance)/dwA = 2 * wA * σA^2 - 2 * (1 - wA) * σB^2 = 0\n\nSolving for wA:\n\nwA * (σA^2 + σB^2) = σB^2\nwA = σB^2 / (σA^2 + σB^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values for σA and σB:\n\nwA = (0.2^2) / ((0.15^2) + (0.2^2))\nwA ≈ 0.711\n\nNow, we can find the optimal weight for security B:\n\nwB = 1 - wA\nwB ≈ 1 - 0.711\nwB ≈ 0.289\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amount of money to allocate to each security:\n\nAmount in Security A = $100,000 * wA ≈ $100,000 * 0.711 ≈ $71,100\nAmount in Security B = $100,000 * wB ≈ $100,000 * 0.289 ≈ $28,900\n\nSo, the investor should allocate approximately $71,100 to security A and $28,900 to security B to create an optimal portfolio that minimizes risk."
