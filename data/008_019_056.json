    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system of equations as follows:\n\n(1) 2x + 3yi + 5z = 7 + 2yi\n(2) x + 4yi - z = 3 - yi\n(3) 3x - 2yi + 4z = 10 - yi\n\nNow, let's eliminate the y terms from equations (1) and (3) by subtracting equation (1) from equation (3):\n\n(3) - (1): x - 5yi - z = 3 - yi\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n(1) 2x + 3yi + 5z = 7 + 2yi\n(2) x + 4yi - z = 3 - yi\n(4) x - 5yi - z = 3 - yi\n\nNext, let's eliminate the y terms from equations (2) and (4) by adding equation (2) to equation (4):\n\n(2) + (4): 2x - yi - 2z = 6 - 2yi\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n(1) 2x + 3yi + 5z = 7 + 2yi\n(5) 2x - yi - 2z = 6 - 2yi\n(4) x - 5yi - z = 3 - yi\n\nNow, let's eliminate the x terms from equations (1) and (5) by subtracting equation (5) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (5): 6yi + 7z = 1 + 3yi\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n(6) 6yi + 7z = 1 + 3yi\n(5) 2x - yi - 2z = 6 - 2yi\n(4) x - 5yi - z = 3 - yi\n\nNow, let's solve equation (6) for z:\n\n7z = 1 + 3yi - 6yi\n7z = 1 - 3yi\nz = (1 - 3yi)/7\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of z into equations (4) and (5):\n\n(4) x - 5yi - (1 - 3yi)/7 = 3 - yi\n(5) 2x - yi - 2(1 - 3yi)/7 = 6 - 2yi\n\nNow, let's solve equation (4) for x:\n\nx = 3 - yi + 5yi + (1 - 3yi)/7\nx = (22 + 32yi)/7\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of x into equation (5):\n\n2(22 + 32yi)/7 - yi - 2(1 - 3yi)/7 = 6 - 2yi\n\nNow, let's solve equation (5) for y:\n\n(44 + 64yi)/7 - 7yi = 6 - 2yi\n64yi - 7yi = 2yi - 6\n69yi = 6\nyi = 6/69\nyi = 2/23\n\nNow we have the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = (22 + 32yi)/7 = (22 + 32(2/23))/7 = (22 + 64/23)/7 = (22*23 + 64)/161 = (506 + 64)/161 = 570/161\ny = 2/23\nz = (1 - 3yi)/7 = (1 - 3(2/23))/7 = (1 - 6/23)/7 = (23 - 6)/161 = 17/161\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = 570/161\ny = 2/23\nz = 17/161"
