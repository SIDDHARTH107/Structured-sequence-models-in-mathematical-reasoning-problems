    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ are the eigenvalues.\n\nA - λI = [ 5-λ  -3\n                   3   -1-λ ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (5-λ)(-1-λ) - (-3)(3) = λ^2 - 4λ + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 2:\n\nλ = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nλ = (4 ± √(16 - 8)) / 2\nλ = (4 ± √8) / 2\nλ = 2 ± √2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 + √2 and λ2 = 2 - √2.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. We'll start with λ1 = 2 + √2:\n\n(A - λ1I) * v1 = 0\n\n[ 5-(2+√2)  -3       [ x1\n   3         -1-(2+√2) ]     x2 ] = 0\n\n[ 3-√2  -3       [ x1\n   3   -3-√2 ]     x2 ] = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we have the equation:\n\n(3-√2)x1 - 3x2 = 0\n\nWe can solve for x1:\n\nx1 = (3/3) * x2\nx1 = x2\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = 1. So, the eigenvector v1 corresponding to λ1 is:\n\nv1 = [ 1\n          1 ]\n\nNow, we'll find the eigenvector for λ2 = 2 - √2:\n\n(A - λ2I) * v2 = 0\n\n[ 5-(2-√2)  -3       [ x1\n   3         -1-(2-√2) ]     x2 ] = 0\n\n[ 3+√2  -3       [ x1\n   3   -3+√2 ]     x2 ] = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we have the equation:\n\n(3+√2)x1 - 3x2 = 0\n\nWe can solve for x1:\n\nx1 = (3/3) * x2\nx1 = x2\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = 1. So, the eigenvector v2 corresponding to λ2 is:\n\nv2 = [ 1\n          1 ]\n\nFinally, let's verify that A * v = λ * v for each eigenvalue and eigenvector:\n\nFor λ1 = 2 + √2 and v1 = [ 1\n                                       1 ]:\n\nA * v1 = [ 5  -3       [ 1\n               3   -1 ]     1 ] = [ 2\n                                            2 ]\n\nλ1 * v1 = (2 + √2) * [ 1\n                                     1 ] = [ 2 + √2\n                                                 2 + √2 ] = [ 2\n                                                                   2 ]\n\nSo, A * v1 = λ1 * v1.\n\nFor λ2 = 2 - √2 and v2 = [ 1\n                                       1 ]:\n\nA * v2 = [ 5  -3       [ 1\n               3   -1 ]     1 ] = [ 2\n                                            2 ]\n\nλ2 * v2 = (2 - √2) * [ 1\n                                     1 ] = [ 2 - √2\n                                                 2 - √2 ] = [ 2\n                                                                   2 ]\n\nSo, A * v2 = λ2 * v2.\n\nThus, we have verified that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors satisfy the equation A * v = λ * v."
