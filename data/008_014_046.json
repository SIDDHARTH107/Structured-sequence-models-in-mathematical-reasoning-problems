    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  6 -2 |\n    | 2  4  1 |\n    |-1  2  3 |\n\nb = | 12 |\n    |  7 |\n    |  5 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nQ = |  0.8018  0.5345  0.2673 |\n    |  0.5345 -0.8018  0.2673 |\n    |-0.2673  0.2673  0.9347 |\n\nR = | 3.7417  5.3452  0.5345 |\n    | 0      2.6833  3.2083 |\n    | 0      0      2.6833 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Qtb, where Qt is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nFirst, we find Qtb:\n\nQtb = |  0.8018  0.5345 -0.2673 | | 12 |\n      |  0.5345 -0.8018  0.2673 | |  7 |\n      |  0.2673  0.2673  0.9347 | |  5 |\n\nQtb = |  8.9443 |\n      | -2.6833 |\n      |  6.4680 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Qtb:\n\n| 3.7417  5.3452  0.5345 | | x |   |  8.9443 |\n| 0      2.6833  3.2083 | | y | = | -2.6833 |\n| 0      0      2.6833 | | z |   |  6.4680 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx ≈ 1\ny ≈ -1\nz ≈ 2.41\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is approximately x = 1, y = -1, and z = 2.41."
