    "message_2": "To simplify the expression log(base 5)125 - log(base 5)25, we can use the logarithm property:\n\nlog(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)\n\nSo, log(base 5)125 - log(base 5)25 = log(base 5)(125/25)\n\n125/25 = 5\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is log(base 5)5.\n\nSince 5 is the base of the logarithm, and 5^1 = 5, the final answer is:\n\nlog(base 5)5 = 1."
