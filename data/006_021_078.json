    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that none of the forests experience a wildfire and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least one forest experiences a wildfire.\n\nThe probability that a single forest does not experience a wildfire is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince there are 5 different forests, the probability that none of them experience a wildfire is 0.8^5 = 0.32768.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one forest experiences a wildfire by subtracting the probability that none of them do from 1:\n\n1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 5 forests experiences a wildfire is approximately 0.67232 or 67.232%."
