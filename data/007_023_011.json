    "message_2": "In the context of cryptographic hash functions, the probability of two distinct inputs having the same hash value is referred to as a collision. A good cryptographic hash function should have a very low probability of collisions, ideally close to zero.\n\nHowever, the information provided in the problem statement is not sufficient to determine the probability of a collision. To calculate the probability, we would need to know the size of the hash function's output space (i.e., the number of possible hash values) and the specific properties of the hash function.\n\nIn general, for a hash function with an output space of size N, the probability of a collision between two distinct inputs is approximately 1/N. But without knowing the size of the output space and the properties of the given hash function, we cannot provide a specific probability for h(x) = h(y) in this case."
