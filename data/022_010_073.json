    "message_2": "To find the Laurent expansion of f(z) = cos(z) around the point z = π/2, we first need to express the function in terms of (z - π/2). We can do this using the Taylor series expansion of the cosine function:\n\ncos(z) = Σ (-1)^n * (z^n) / (2n)!\n\nNow, we substitute (z - π/2) in place of z:\n\ncos(z) = Σ (-1)^n * ((z - π/2)^n) / (2n)!\n\nThis is the Laurent expansion of f(z) = cos(z) around the point z = π/2.\n\nThe annulus of convergence for a Laurent series is determined by the radius of convergence of the series. Since the cosine function is entire (i.e., it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane), its Taylor series converges everywhere. Therefore, the annulus of convergence for the Laurent series of f(z) = cos(z) around the point z = π/2 is the entire complex plane:\n\nAnnulus of convergence: {z ∈ ℂ}"
