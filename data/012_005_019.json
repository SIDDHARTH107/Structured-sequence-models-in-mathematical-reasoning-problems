    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. First, let's analyze the properties of the graph.\n\nA connected graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges must have at least one cycle. This is because a tree (a connected graph with no cycles) has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, a tree with 8 vertices would have 7 edges, but our graph has 10 edges.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases for the diameter of the graph:\n\n1. Diameter = 6: This would mean that there is a path of length 6 between two vertices, and no path between any pair of vertices is longer than 6. However, this is not possible for a connected graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges. To see why, consider that the longest path in a tree with 8 vertices is 7 (a straight line of 8 vertices). Adding any edge to this tree would create a cycle and reduce the diameter to at most 5.\n\n2. Diameter = 5: This is possible for a connected graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges. One example is a graph with a central vertex connected to 4 other vertices, and each of those vertices connected to another vertex. This graph has a diameter of 5, as the longest shortest path between any two vertices is 5 (from one of the outer vertices to another outer vertex through the central vertex).\n\n3. Diameter = 4: This is also possible for a connected graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges. One example is a cycle of 5 vertices with 3 additional vertices connected to one of the vertices in the cycle. The longest shortest path between any two vertices in this graph is 4.\n\nSince we have found examples of connected graphs with 8 vertices and 10 edges that have diameters of 4 and 5, and we have shown that a diameter of 6 is not possible, the diameter of the graph can be either 4 or 5."
