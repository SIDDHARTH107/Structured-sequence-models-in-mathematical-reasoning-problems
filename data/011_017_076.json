    "message_1": "In a 4 by 4 Latin square, each cell is filled with an integer between 1 and 4 such that no row or column has repeated integers. How many distinct Latin squares are possible?",
    "message_2": "To count the number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, as there are no restrictions on the placement of the numbers 1 through 4.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3! ways to fill it, as there are 3 choices for the first number (not the same as the number above it), 2 choices for the second number, and only 1 choice for the third number. The fourth number is determined by the remaining number.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possibilities: either the first and second numbers are the same as the first and second numbers in the second row, or they are the same as the second and first numbers in the second row. In either case, the third and fourth numbers are determined by the remaining numbers. So, there are 2 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the remaining numbers in each column, so there is only 1 way to fill it.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares is 4! × 3! × 2 = 24 × 6 × 2 = 288."
