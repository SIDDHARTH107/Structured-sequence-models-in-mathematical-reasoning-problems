    "message_2": "To use Bezout's theorem, we first need to determine the degrees of the two curves. The degree of a curve is the highest total degree of any term in the polynomial defining the curve.\n\nFor $C_1$, the highest total degree is 3 (from the terms $x^3$ and $y^3$). So, the degree of $C_1$ is 3.\n\nFor $C_2$, the highest total degree is 2 (from the terms $x^2$ and $y^2$). So, the degree of $C_2$ is 2.\n\nBezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the product of the degrees is $3 \\times 2 = 6$. So, the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ is 6, assuming that the curves have no common components and the intersection points are counted with their multiplicities."
