    "message_1": "A company is planning to introduce a new product in the market. The production cost for each unit of the product is estimated to be $50. The company aims to make a profit of at least $20,000 per month from this product. The product can be sold for $80 per unit. What is the minimum number of units that the company needs to sell in a month to achieve its profit target using Harmony Search Algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Harmony Search Algorithm is an optimization algorithm that is inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this case, we can use it to find the minimum number of units the company needs to sell to achieve its profit target. However, this problem can be solved more easily using a simple algebraic equation.\n\nLet's denote the number of units the company needs to sell as x. The profit per unit is the selling price minus the production cost, which is $80 - $50 = $30. The company wants to make a profit of at least $20,000 per month. We can set up the following equation:\n\nProfit = Number of units * Profit per unit\n$20,000 ≤ x * $30\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx ≥ $20,000 / $30\nx ≥ 666.67\n\nSince the company cannot sell a fraction of a unit, they need to sell at least 667 units per month to achieve their profit target of $20,000."
