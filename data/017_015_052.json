    "message_2": "There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, which are:\n\n1. S4 (Symmetric group on 4 elements)\n2. D12 (Dihedral group of order 12)\n3. Z2 × S3 (Direct product of Z2 and S3)\n4. Z4 ⋊ Z3 (Semidirect product of Z4 and Z3)\n5. Z2 × D6 (Direct product of Z2 and D6)\n\nNow, let's show that none of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 or the alternating group A5.\n\nC24 is a cyclic group of order 24, which means it has only one element of order 24. In contrast, all five non-abelian groups listed above have no elements of order 24. Therefore, none of these groups can be isomorphic to C24.\n\nA5 is the alternating group on 5 elements, which has order 60. Since the order of A5 is different from the order of the five non-abelian groups listed above (which have order 24), none of these groups can be isomorphic to A5."
