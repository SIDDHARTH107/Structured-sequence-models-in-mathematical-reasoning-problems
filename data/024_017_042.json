    "message_1": "Consider a curve in 3-dimensional space defined by the equation r(t) = <3t, 4t - 1, 2t + 2>. A vector v with coordinates <1, 2, 3> is initially tangent to the curve at t=0. Determine the parallel transport of v along the curve and find its final coordinates when t=2.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve r(t), we first need to find the tangent vector to the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to t:\n\ndr/dt = <3, 4, 2>\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector remains parallel to the tangent vector at each point along the curve. To do this, we can use the covariant derivative, which is given by:\n\nDv/dt = dv/dt - (v • (dr/dt)) * (dr/dt)\n\nwhere \"•\" denotes the dot product. Since the vector v is initially tangent to the curve at t=0, we have:\n\nv(0) = <1, 2, 3>\ndr/dt(0) = <3, 4, 2>\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of v along the curve from t=0 to t=2. To do this, we can integrate the covariant derivative with respect to t:\n\nv(t) = ∫ Dv/dt dt\n\nHowever, since the tangent vector dr/dt is constant along the curve, the covariant derivative Dv/dt is also constant. This means that the parallel transport of v along the curve is just a straight line, and we can find the final coordinates of v at t=2 by simply adding the initial coordinates of v to the tangent vector multiplied by the change in t:\n\nv(2) = v(0) + (dr/dt) * (2 - 0)\nv(2) = <1, 2, 3> + <3, 4, 2> * 2\nv(2) = <1, 2, 3> + <6, 8, 4>\nv(2) = <7, 10, 7>\n\nSo, the final coordinates of the parallel transported vector v along the curve r(t) when t=2 are <7, 10, 7>."
