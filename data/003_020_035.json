    "message_2": "To find the distance of the top of the tree from the base of the tree, we can use the trigonometric function cosine. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side (the distance we want to find) to the hypotenuse (the length of the tree).\n\nLet's denote the distance from the base of the tree to the top as x. Then we have:\n\ncos(40°) = x / 25\n\nTo find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 25:\n\nx = 25 * cos(40°)\n\nNow, we can calculate the cosine of 40 degrees and multiply it by 25:\n\nx ≈ 25 * 0.7660\nx ≈ 19.15\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the distance of the top of the tree from the base is approximately 19 meters."
