    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the ball reaches, we first need to find the time at which the ball reaches its maximum height. This occurs when the velocity of the ball is 0 (i.e., when the ball changes direction from going up to going down). So, we set the velocity function v(t) equal to 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = -32t + 48\n\nNow, we solve for t:\n32t = 48\nt = 48/32\nt = 1.5 seconds\n\nSo, the ball reaches its maximum height at t = 1.5 seconds.\n\nNext, we need to find the position function, which represents the height of the ball at any given time t. To do this, we integrate the velocity function:\n\nâˆ«(-32t + 48) dt = -16t^2 + 48t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition that the height is 0 when t = 0:\n\n0 = -16(0)^2 + 48(0) + C\nC = 0\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -16t^2 + 48t\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height by plugging in the time t = 1.5 seconds into the position function:\n\ns(1.5) = -16(1.5)^2 + 48(1.5)\ns(1.5) = -16(2.25) + 72\ns(1.5) = -36 + 72\ns(1.5) = 36 feet\n\nThus, the maximum height the ball reaches is 36 feet, and it takes 1.5 seconds for the ball to reach that height."
