    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 20, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers with a difference of at least 20.\n\nThe smallest prime gap greater than or equal to 20 occurs between the prime numbers 89 and 113. The difference between these two prime numbers is 24, which is greater than or equal to 20."
