    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the knot formed by joining the ends of two circular loops, we need to consider the Seifert surface of the knot. The Seifert surface is a surface whose boundary is the knot. The genus of the knot is the minimum genus of all possible Seifert surfaces for that knot.\n\nIn this case, we have two circular loops with different radii (3 and 4). When we join the ends of these loops, we obtain a link, not a knot. A link is a collection of two or more knots that are interlinked but not knotted together. The simplest link is the Hopf link, which consists of two circles linked together.\n\nSince we are dealing with a link and not a single knot, the concept of genus does not apply in the same way. However, we can discuss the genus of each component of the link separately. In this case, both components are unknotted circles, and the genus of an unknotted circle is 0. So, the genus of each component of the link is 0."
