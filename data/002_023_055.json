    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 10 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (10 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 100 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 400π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 1256.64 square centimeters (using the value of π ≈ 3.1416)."
