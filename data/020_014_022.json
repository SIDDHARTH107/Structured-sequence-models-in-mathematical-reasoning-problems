    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = 0.5(x-3)^4 - 2(x-3)^2 + 5 over the interval [-5, 5], we will first find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it to zero. Then, we will check the endpoints of the interval and compare the function values at the critical points and endpoints to determine the global minimum.\n\n1. Find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [0.5(x-3)^4 - 2(x-3)^2 + 5]\nf'(x) = 0.5 * 4(x-3)^3 - 2 * 2(x-3)\nf'(x) = 2(x-3)^3 - 4(x-3)\n\n2. Set the first derivative to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2(x-3)^3 - 4(x-3)\n\nFactor out a 2(x-3):\n\n0 = 2(x-3)[(x-3)^2 - 2]\n\nNow, we have two factors: 2(x-3) and (x-3)^2 - 2. Set each factor to zero and solve for x:\n\n2(x-3) = 0 => x = 3\n\n(x-3)^2 - 2 = 0 => (x-3)^2 = 2 => x-3 = ±√2 => x = 3 ± √2\n\nSo, we have three critical points: x = 3 - √2, x = 3, and x = 3 + √2.\n\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints:\n\nf(-5) = 0.5(-5-3)^4 - 2(-5-3)^2 + 5 = 324\nf(3-√2) ≈ 0.5(1-2√2)^4 - 2(1-2√2)^2 + 5 ≈ 3.17157\nf(3) = 0.5(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 5 = 5\nf(3+√2) ≈ 0.5(1+2√2)^4 - 2(1+2√2)^2 + 5 ≈ 3.17157\nf(5) = 0.5(5-3)^4 - 2(5-3)^2 + 5 = 9\n\n4. Compare the function values:\n\nThe smallest function value is f(3-√2) ≈ 3.17157, which is also equal to f(3+√2). Therefore, the global minimum of the function f(x) = 0.5(x-3)^4 - 2(x-3)^2 + 5 over the interval [-5, 5] occurs at x = 3 - √2 and x = 3 + √2, with a minimum value of approximately 3.17157."
