    "message_1": "In a study on the effects of four variables (A, B, C, D) on a process, an Orthogonal Array OA(16,4,2) was used. Each variable has two levels, high (+1) and low (-1). How many unique combinations can be created from this OA?",
    "message_2": "An Orthogonal Array OA(16,4,2) means that there are 16 experiments (rows), 4 variables (columns), and 2 levels for each variable (high and low). In this case, the 2 levels are represented by +1 (high) and -1 (low).\n\nSince there are 2 levels for each of the 4 variables, the total number of unique combinations that can be created is:\n\n2^4 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 unique combinations that can be created from this Orthogonal Array."
