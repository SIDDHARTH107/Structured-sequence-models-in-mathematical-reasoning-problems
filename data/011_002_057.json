    "message_1": "A committee of 4 students is to be selected from a group of 10 students. In how many ways can the committee be formed if two specific students must be included?",
    "message_2": "Since two specific students must be included in the committee, we are left with choosing 2 more students from the remaining 8 students (10 - 2 = 8). We can use the combination formula to determine the number of ways to choose 2 students from 8:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 8 and k = 2:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!6!)\nC(8, 2) = (8*7*6!)/(2!6!)\nC(8, 2) = (8*7)/(2*1)\nC(8, 2) = 28\n\nSo, there are 28 ways to form the committee with the two specific students included."
