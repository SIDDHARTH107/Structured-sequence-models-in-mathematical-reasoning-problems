    "message_2": "To use bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean salary of the company, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a sample of 100 employees with an average salary of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $5,000. This will be our original sample.\n2. Resample the original sample with replacement (i.e., randomly select 100 employees from the original sample, allowing for the possibility of selecting the same employee multiple times) to create a new bootstrap sample.\n3. Calculate the mean salary of the bootstrap sample.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times (e.g., 10,000 times) to create a distribution of bootstrap sample means.\n5. Calculate the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of bootstrap sample means. These values will represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean salary.\n\nNote that as an AI, I cannot perform the bootstrapping process directly. However, I can provide you with a Python code snippet that you can use to perform the bootstrapping and calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original sample\nnp.random.seed(42)\noriginal_sample = np.random.normal(loc=50000, scale=5000, size=100)\n\n# Bootstrap resampling\nn_iterations = 10000\nbootstrap_means = []\n\nfor _ in range(n_iterations):\n    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(original_sample, size=100, replace=True)\n    bootstrap_mean = np.mean(bootstrap_sample)\n    bootstrap_means.append(bootstrap_mean)\n\n# Calculate 95% confidence interval\nlower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)\nupper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)\n\nprint(f\"The 95% confidence interval for the population mean salary is between ${lower_bound:.2f} and ${upper_bound:.2f}.\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the estimated 95% confidence interval for the population mean salary of the company using bootstrapping."
