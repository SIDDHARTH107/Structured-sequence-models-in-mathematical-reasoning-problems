    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of Team A making a free throw is 0.9, and the probability of Team B making a free throw is 0.8. If both teams attempt one free throw each, what is the probability that both teams will make the free throws?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both teams making their free throws, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together.\n\nProbability of Team A making a free throw = 0.9\nProbability of Team B making a free throw = 0.8\n\nProbability of both teams making their free throws = (Probability of Team A making a free throw) × (Probability of Team B making a free throw) = 0.9 × 0.8 = 0.72\n\nSo, the probability that both teams will make the free throws is 0.72 or 72%."
