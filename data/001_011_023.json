    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation (2/x) + (1/(x-5)) = 1, we first need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is x(x-5). \n\nNow, we'll rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n(2/x) * ((x-5)/(x-5)) + (1/(x-5)) * (x/x) = 1 * (x(x-5))/(x(x-5))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(2(x-5) + x(x-5))/(x(x-5)) = x(x-5)/(x(x-5))\n\nNow, since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:\n\n2(x-5) + x(x-5) = x(x-5)\n\nDistribute the terms:\n\n2x - 10 + x^2 - 5x = x^2 - 5x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 2x - 10 = x^2 - 5x\n\nNow, subtract x^2 - 5x from both sides:\n\n-3x - 10 = 0\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n-3x = 10\n\nDivide by -3:\n\nx = -10/3\n\nSo, the solution to the rational equation is x = -10/3, which is not equal to 0 or 5."
