    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $3 and the profit per unit of B is $2. The company has limited resources and can produce no more than 200 units of A and 150 units of B. The production time per unit of A is 2 hours, while that for B is 3 hours. The total production time available is 500 hours. How many units of A and B should be produced in order to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 3x + 2y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 200 (cannot produce more than 200 units of A)\n2. y ≤ 150 (cannot produce more than 150 units of B)\n3. 2x + 3y ≤ 500 (total production time available)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 200 (vertical line)\n2. y = 150 (horizontal line)\n3. 2x + 3y = 500 (slope-intercept form: y = (500 - 2x) / 3)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (200, 0), (200, 100), and (150, 150).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 2(0) = $0\n2. P(200, 0) = 3(200) + 2(0) = $600\n3. P(200, 100) = 3(200) + 2(100) = $800\n4. P(150, 150) = 3(150) + 2(150) = $750\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (200, 100), with a profit of $800. Therefore, the company should produce 200 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize their profit."
