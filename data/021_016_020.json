    "message_1": "Suppose you are managing a transport company and you need to optimize the delivery routes for your trucks. You have 10 possible delivery locations and you want to determine the most efficient route that minimizes the total distance traveled by your trucks. Use ant colony optimization to find the optimal route for your trucks to deliver to all 10 locations. Given the coordinates of each location, what is the distance traveled by the optimal route?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using ant colony optimization, we need the coordinates of the 10 delivery locations. Please provide the coordinates of each location."
