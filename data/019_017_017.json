    "message_2": "The formula ∀x (x > 0 → ∃y (y^2 = x)) states that for every positive integer x, there exists an integer y such that y^2 = x. However, this statement is not true for the set of all integers.\n\nTo show this, we can provide a counterexample. Consider the positive integer x = 3. There is no integer y such that y^2 = 3. The closest integers are y = 1 and y = 2, but 1^2 = 1 and 2^2 = 4, neither of which equal 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula ∀x (x > 0 → ∃y (y^2 = x)) is not true in the universe of all integers."
