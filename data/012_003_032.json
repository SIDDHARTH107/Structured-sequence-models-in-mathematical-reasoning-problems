    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest possible independent set in the graph.\n\nIn this graph, we can find the maximum independent set by selecting vertices that are not connected by any edges. One possible maximum independent set is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. This set contains 5 vertices, and no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge.\n\nTherefore, the maximum independent set in this graph has 5 vertices: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}."
