    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g over a field K. Consider a line bundle L on X such that its degree is d. \n\nNow, suppose that we have a coherent sheaf F on X with its intersection cohomology being non-zero in degree 2. We denote the dimension of the H^2 space by h^2(X,F). \n\nThe question for the math student to solve is:\n\nGiven the genus g of X, the degree d of L, and h^2(X,F), what is the upper bound on the Euler characteristic chi(F) of F?",
    "message_2": "To find the upper bound on the Euler characteristic χ(F) of F, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nχ(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + h^0(D) - h^1(D),\n\nwhere χ(D) is the Euler characteristic of the sheaf associated to D, deg(D) is the degree of D, h^0(D) and h^1(D) are the dimensions of the spaces H^0(X, D) and H^1(X, D), respectively.\n\nIn our case, we have a coherent sheaf F on X with non-zero intersection cohomology in degree 2, and we know h^2(X, F). We can rewrite the Riemann-Roch theorem for F as:\n\nχ(F) = deg(F) + 1 - g + h^0(F) - h^1(F) + h^2(X, F).\n\nWe are given the degree d of the line bundle L on X, and we can assume that F is a twist of L by some divisor D, i.e., F = L ⊗ O_X(D). Then, deg(F) = deg(L) + deg(D) = d + deg(D).\n\nNow, we want to find the upper bound on χ(F). Since h^0(F), h^1(F), and h^2(X, F) are all non-negative, we can maximize χ(F) by minimizing h^1(F). By Serre duality, we have:\n\nh^1(F) = h^1(X, F) = h^0(X, K_X ⊗ F^*),\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical divisor on X and F^* is the dual of F. Since h^0(X, K_X ⊗ F^*) is non-negative, the minimum value of h^1(F) is 0.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound on the Euler characteristic χ(F) is given by:\n\nχ(F) ≤ d + deg(D) + 1 - g + h^2(X, F).\n\nThis is the upper bound on the Euler characteristic χ(F) of F, given the genus g of X, the degree d of L, and h^2(X, F)."
