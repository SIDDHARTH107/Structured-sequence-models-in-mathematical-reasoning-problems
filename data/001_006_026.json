    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = x^2 - 3x - 10\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation can be factored as:\n\n0 = (x - 5)(x + 2)\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation are x = 5 and x = -2."
