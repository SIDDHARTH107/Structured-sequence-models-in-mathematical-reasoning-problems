    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 8x + 15y = 127, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 15, and then find the particular solution for x and y.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD(8, 15) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n15 = 1 * 8 + 7\n8 = 1 * 7 + 1\n7 = 7 * 1\n\nSo, GCD(8, 15) = 1. Since 1 divides 127, there exists a solution to the Diophantine equation.\n\nNow, let's work our way back up to find the particular solution:\n\n1 = 8 - 1 * 7\n1 = 8 - 1 * (15 - 1 * 8)\n1 = 8 - 15 + 8\n1 = 2 * 8 - 15\n\nNow we have the equation in the form of 1 = 2 * 8 - 15, which is a particular solution for the Diophantine equation. Multiplying both sides by 127:\n\n127 = 2 * 8 * 127 - 15 * 127\n127 = 16 * 127 - 15 * 127\n\nSo, a particular solution is x = 16 * 127 and y = -15 * 127.\n\nHowever, we want the general solution for all integer values of x and y. To find the general solution, we can use the following formula:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b / GCD(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a / GCD(a, b))\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solution, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the Diophantine equation, and k is an integer.\n\nIn our case, x0 = 16 * 127, y0 = -15 * 127, a = 8, b = 15, and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = 16 * 127 + k * (15 / 1)\ny = -15 * 127 - k * (8 / 1)\n\nx = 16 * 127 + 15k\ny = -15 * 127 - 8k\n\nFor any integer value of k, this will give a valid solution for x and y in the Diophantine equation 8x + 15y = 127."
