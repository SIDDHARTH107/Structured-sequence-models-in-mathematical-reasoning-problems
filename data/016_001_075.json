    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 2.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.58.\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.58 (rounded to two decimal places)."
