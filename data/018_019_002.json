    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B, but not both}\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nA Δ B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and C.\n\n(A Δ B) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nC = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n(A Δ B) Δ C = {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C.\n\nB = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\nC = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nB Δ C = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B Δ C).\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n(B Δ C) = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}\n\nA Δ (B Δ C) = {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nWe can see that the results are the same:\n\n(A Δ B) Δ C = {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nA Δ (B Δ C) = {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative. Let X, Y, and Z be arbitrary sets. We want to show that (X Δ Y) Δ Z = X Δ (Y Δ Z).\n\nLet's consider an element x that belongs to (X Δ Y) Δ Z. There are two cases:\n\n1. x ∈ (X Δ Y) and x ∉ Z: This means that x is in exactly one of the sets X and Y, and not in Z. Therefore, x is in exactly one of the sets X and (Y Δ Z), so x ∈ X Δ (Y Δ Z).\n\n2. x ∉ (X Δ Y) and x ∈ Z: This means that x is in both sets X and Y or in neither, and x is in Z. Therefore, x is in exactly one of the sets X and (Y Δ Z), so x ∈ X Δ (Y Δ Z).\n\nNow, let's consider an element x that belongs to X Δ (Y Δ Z). There are two cases:\n\n1. x ∈ X and x ∉ (Y Δ Z): This means that x is in X and in exactly one of the sets Y and Z. Therefore, x is in exactly one of the sets (X Δ Y) and Z, so x ∈ (X Δ Y) Δ Z.\n\n2. x ∉ X and x ∈ (Y Δ Z): This means that x is not in X and is in exactly one of the sets Y and Z. Therefore, x is in exactly one of the sets (X Δ Y) and Z, so x ∈ (X Δ Y) Δ Z.\n\nSince all elements in (X Δ Y) Δ Z are in X Δ (Y Δ Z) and vice versa, we can conclude that (X Δ Y) Δ Z = X Δ (Y Δ Z). Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is associative."
