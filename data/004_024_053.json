    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx when x is equal to 3, we first need to differentiate the given equation with respect to x.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n\nd/dx(x^2) + d/dx(y^2) = d/dx(25)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 3. We can do this by plugging x = 3 into the original equation:\n\n(3)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\n9 + y^2 = 25\n\ny^2 = 16\n\ny = Â±4 (since y can be positive or negative)\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: y = 4\nPlugging x = 3 and y = 4 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(4)(dy/dx) = 0\n\n6 + 8(dy/dx) = 0\n\n8(dy/dx) = -6\n\n(dy/dx) = -6/8 = -3/4\n\nCase 2: y = -4\nPlugging x = 3 and y = -4 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(-4)(dy/dx) = 0\n\n6 - 8(dy/dx) = 0\n\n8(dy/dx) = 6\n\n(dy/dx) = 6/8 = 3/4\n\nSo, there are two possible values for dy/dx when x = 3: dy/dx = -3/4 (when y = 4) and dy/dx = 3/4 (when y = -4)."
