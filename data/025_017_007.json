    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information and use the properties of the canonical class and contractions to compute the self-intersection number.\n\nSince f : X → Y is a contraction, it means that f(C) is a point in Y for the curve C in X. Also, we are given that -KX is f-ample, which means that for any curve C contracted by f, we have -KX ⋅ C > 0.\n\nNow, let's use the properties of the canonical class and contractions. By the negativity lemma, we have:\n\nKX ⋅ C ≤ 0, since KX is not nef.\n\nNow, let's consider the relative canonical class formula:\n\nKX = f*(KY) + R,\n\nwhere KY is the canonical class of Y and R is the ramification divisor of f.\n\nSince Y is a smooth projective curve, its canonical class KY is a divisor of degree 2g(Y) - 2, where g(Y) is the genus of Y. Since Y is a smooth projective curve, g(Y) ≥ 0, so KY is effective.\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection product of both sides of the relative canonical class formula with C:\n\nKX ⋅ C = (f*(KY) + R) ⋅ C.\n\nSince f is a contraction, f*(KY) ⋅ C = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nKX ⋅ C = R ⋅ C.\n\nNow, R is an effective divisor, and C is a curve contracted by f. So, R ⋅ C ≥ 0. Combining this with the inequality KX ⋅ C ≤ 0, we get:\n\nKX ⋅ C = 0.\n\nFinally, we can compute the self-intersection number -KX ⋅ C:\n\n- KX ⋅ C = - (0) = 0."
