    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to bring the matrix to its row-echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n6 & 9 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 6 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Divide the third row by 3.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Subtract 2 times the third row from the first row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that there are 2 non-zero rows, which means the rank of matrix A is 2."
