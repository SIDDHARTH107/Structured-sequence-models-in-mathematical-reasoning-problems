    "message_1": "Consider a surface given by the equation z = x^2 + 2y^2. What is the mean curvature of this surface at the point (1,1,3)?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (1,1,3), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\n1. First, find the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y:\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 4y\n\n2. Next, find the unit normal vector N to the surface:\nN = (−∂z/∂x, −∂z/∂y, 1) / ||(−∂z/∂x, −∂z/∂y, 1)||\nAt the point (1,1,3), we have:\nN = (−2, −4, 1) / ||(−2, −4, 1)||\n||N|| = √((-2)^2 + (-4)^2 + 1^2) = √(21)\nN = (−2/√21, −4/√21, 1/√21)\n\n3. Now, find the second partial derivatives of z:\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 8\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\n4. Compute the components of the second fundamental form:\nL = N • ∂²z/∂x² = (−2/√21, −4/√21, 1/√21) • (2, 0, 0) = -4/√21\nM = N • ∂²z/∂x∂y = (−2/√21, −4/√21, 1/√21) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nN = N • ∂²z/∂y² = (−2/√21, −4/√21, 1/√21) • (0, 8, 0) = -32/√21\n\n5. Finally, compute the mean curvature H:\nH = (LN - M²) / 2(EG - F²)\nIn this case, E = 1, G = 1, and F = 0 (from the first fundamental form), so the formula simplifies to:\nH = (LN - M²) / 2\nH = (-4/√21 * -32/√21 - 0²) / 2\nH = (128/21) / 2\nH = 64/21\n\nThe mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (1,1,3) is 64/21."
