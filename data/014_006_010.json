    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using a one-time pad encryption, we need to perform a modular addition of the plaintext and the key. Since the key is longer than the plaintext, we will only use the first 5 characters of the key, which is \"JUGLE\". \n\nFirst, we convert the plaintext and the key to their numerical equivalents:\n\nMATHS -> 12 0 19 7 18\nJUGLE -> 9 20 6 11 4\n\nNow, we perform the modular addition (mod 26):\n\n(12+9) mod 26 = 21\n(0+20) mod 26 = 20\n(19+6) mod 26 = 25\n(7+11) mod 26 = 18\n(18+4) mod 26 = 22\n\nThe encrypted message in numerical form is:\n\n21 20 25 18 22\n\nNow, we convert it back to letters:\n\n21 -> V\n20 -> U\n25 -> Z\n18 -> S\n22 -> W\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"VUZSW\"."
