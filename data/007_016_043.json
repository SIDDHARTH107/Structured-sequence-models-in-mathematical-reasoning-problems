    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number.\n\nTo find the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a twin prime, we can start by listing the first few Sophie Germain primes and their corresponding \"safe\" primes (2p + 1):\n\n1. p = 2, 2p + 1 = 5\n2. p = 3, 2p + 1 = 7\n3. p = 5, 2p + 1 = 11\n4. p = 11, 2p + 1 = 23\n5. p = 23, 2p + 1 = 47\n\nNow, we can check if any of these primes are also twin primes:\n\n1. p = 2: 2 is a twin prime (with 3), but 2p + 1 = 5 is not a twin prime.\n2. p = 3: 3 is a twin prime (with 5), and 2p + 1 = 7 is also a twin prime (with 5).\n3. p = 5: 5 is a twin prime (with 3), but 2p + 1 = 11 is not a twin prime.\n4. p = 11: 11 is not a twin prime.\n5. p = 23: 23 is not a twin prime.\n\nThe smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a twin prime is 3."
