    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x + 2 over the interval [-5, 5], we first need to find the vertex of the parabola.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / (2a)\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = 6, so:\n\nx_vertex = -6 / (2 * 3) = -1\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging x_vertex into the function:\n\nf(-1) = 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 2 = 3 - 6 + 2 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-1, -1). Since the parabola opens upwards (a > 0), the maximum value of the function over the interval [-5, 5] will occur at one of the endpoints of the interval.\n\nLet's evaluate the function at the endpoints:\n\nf(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 6(-5) + 2 = 75 - 30 + 2 = 47\nf(5) = 3(5)^2 + 6(5) + 2 = 75 + 30 + 2 = 107\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x + 2 over the interval [-5, 5] is 107."
