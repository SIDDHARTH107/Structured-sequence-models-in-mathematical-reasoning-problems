    "message_1": "A student standing 10 meters away from a building looks up and measures the angle of elevation to be 45 degrees. Find the height of the building.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the student to the building is 10 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45) = height / 10\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the building:\n\nheight = 10 * 1\n\nheight = 10 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is 10 meters."
