    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) in terms of positive powers of (z-2i), we will first rewrite the function in terms of (z-2i). Let's perform a change of variable: let w = z - 2i. Then, z = w + 2i. Now, we can rewrite f(z) in terms of w:\n\nf(z) = f(w + 2i) = ((w + 2i)^2 + 1)/((w + 2i)^2 - 4)\n\nNow, we want to expand this expression in terms of positive powers of w. To do this, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Notice that the denominator can be factored as (w + 2i - 2)(w + 2i + 2) = (w + 2i - 2)(w + 2i + 2). Now, we can write:\n\nf(w + 2i) = A/(w - 2) + B/(w + 4)\n\nTo find A and B, we can clear the denominators:\n\n(w^2 + 4w + 5) = A(w + 4) + B(w - 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in values of w that will eliminate one of the terms. Let w = 2:\n\n(2^2 + 4*2 + 5) = A(2 + 4)\n13 = 6A\nA = 13/6\n\nNow, let w = -4:\n\n((-4)^2 + 4*(-4) + 5) = B(-4 - 2)\n9 = -6B\nB = -3/2\n\nNow we have:\n\nf(w + 2i) = (13/6)/(w - 2) - (3/2)/(w + 4)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of each term. For the first term, we have:\n\n(13/6)/(w - 2) = (13/6) * (1/(1 - (-w/2)))\n= (13/6) * Σ((-w/2)^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n(-3/2)/(w + 4) = (-3/2) * (1/(1 - (-w/4)))\n= (-3/2) * Σ((-w/4)^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can combine these two series to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z) in terms of positive powers of (z-2i):\n\nf(z) = (13/6) * Σ((-w/2)^n) - (3/2) * Σ((-w/4)^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nThe radius of convergence for each term is determined by the geometric series convergence, which is |(-w/2)| < 1 and |(-w/4)| < 1. In terms of z, this translates to |(z - 2i)/2| < 1 and |(z - 2i)/4| < 1. The intersection of these two regions is the annulus 1 < |z - 2i| < 3, which is the region we are interested in. Therefore, the radius of convergence for the Laurent series expansion is 3."
