    "message_1": "Consider a triangle with sides of length 5, 6, and 7. Create a triangulation of this triangle by dividing it into smaller triangles such that each vertex of the original triangle is a vertex of the smaller triangles, and no vertex of a smaller triangle lies on an edge of the original triangle. What is the maximum number of small triangles that can be used in this triangulation?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the vertices of the original triangle as A, B, and C, with side lengths AB = 5, BC = 6, and AC = 7. We can create a triangulation by adding non-intersecting diagonals inside the triangle. Each time we add a diagonal, we create a new triangle.\n\nLet's consider the number of diagonals we can add. We can add a diagonal from vertex A to a point on side BC, from vertex B to a point on side AC, and from vertex C to a point on side AB. However, we cannot add a diagonal from a vertex to a point on the opposite side if there is already a diagonal from that vertex to another point on the same side. This is because the new diagonal would intersect the existing diagonal, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, we can add at most one diagonal from each vertex to a point on the opposite side. This means we can add at most 3 diagonals in total. Adding 3 diagonals will divide the original triangle into 4 smaller triangles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of small triangles that can be used in this triangulation is 4."
