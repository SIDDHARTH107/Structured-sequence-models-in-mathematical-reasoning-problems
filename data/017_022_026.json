    "message_2": "There are two non-abelian groups of order 60, up to isomorphism. They are the symmetric group S_5 and the alternating group A_5.\n\n1. Symmetric group S_5:\nThe symmetric group S_5 consists of all the permutations of 5 elements. It has order 5! = 120, which is not 60. However, the subgroup of even permutations, called the alternating group A_5, has order 60. So, we need to consider A_5.\n\n2. Alternating group A_5:\nThe alternating group A_5 consists of all the even permutations of 5 elements. It has order 60, which is half the order of S_5. A_5 is a simple group, meaning it has no nontrivial normal subgroups. This group is non-abelian, as not all of its elements commute.\n\nProperties of A_5:\n- It is a simple group, so it has no nontrivial normal subgroups.\n- It is non-abelian.\n- It is the smallest simple non-abelian group.\n- It has a center that is trivial, i.e., it only contains the identity element.\n- It has 24 elements of order 5, 20 elements of order 3, and 15 elements of order 2.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one non-abelian group of order 60 up to isomorphism, which is the alternating group A_5."
