    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the horizontal component of the force and then multiply it by the distance the crate is moved. \n\nFirst, let's find the horizontal component of the force (F_horizontal):\nF_horizontal = F * cos(angle)\nwhere F is the force exerted on the rope (250 N) and angle is the angle between the rope and the horizontal (30 degrees).\n\nWe need to convert the angle to radians:\nangle_rad = (30 * π) / 180 = π / 6\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal component of the force:\nF_horizontal = 250 * cos(π / 6)\n\nF_horizontal ≈ 250 * 0.866025\nF_horizontal ≈ 216.51 N\n\nNow, we can find the work done (W) by the force:\nW = F_horizontal * distance\nwhere distance is the distance the crate is moved (15 meters).\n\nW = 216.51 N * 15 m\nW ≈ 3247.65 J (Joules)\n\nSo, the work done by the force is approximately 3247.65 Joules."
