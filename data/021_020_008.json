    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve on 'Solving optimization problems using artificial bee colony algorithm':\n\nConsider the following optimization problem: minimize the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 10x + 4 in the range [0, 5] using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with a population size of 20, maximum iterations of 50, and neighborhood size of 5. Starting with the initial solutions x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, find the optimal solution to the problem using the ABC algorithm.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Set the initial solutions x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and calculate their fitness values using the objective function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 10x + 4.\n\n2. Employed bee phase: For each solution, generate a new candidate solution by modifying the current solution with a random neighbor within the neighborhood size of 5. Calculate the fitness of the new candidate solution and perform a greedy selection between the current solution and the new candidate solution.\n\n3. Onlooker bee phase: Calculate the probability of selecting each solution based on their fitness values. Select a solution with higher probability and generate a new candidate solution as in the employed bee phase. Perform a greedy selection between the current solution and the new candidate solution.\n\n4. Scout bee phase: If a solution has not been improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new randomly generated solution within the search space [0, 5].\n\n5. Termination: Repeat steps 2-4 for a maximum of 50 iterations or until the optimal solution is found.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm with the given parameters, we will obtain the optimal solution for the problem. Note that the actual optimal solution may vary depending on the random nature of the algorithm. However, the ABC algorithm should converge to a solution close to the true global minimum of the function f(x) within the specified range [0, 5]."
