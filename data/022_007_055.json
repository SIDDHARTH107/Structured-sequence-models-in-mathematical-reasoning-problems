    "message_1": "What is the order of the polynomial $p(z)=z^5+2z^3+z-1$ and does it have any roots in the complex plane?\n\nHint: Use Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.",
    "message_2": "The order of the polynomial $p(z) = z^5 + 2z^3 + z - 1$ is determined by the highest power of $z$ in the polynomial. In this case, the highest power of $z$ is 5, so the order of the polynomial is 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the roots of the polynomial in the complex plane. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane. Since our polynomial is of order 5, it must have 5 roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities.\n\nSo, the order of the polynomial $p(z) = z^5 + 2z^3 + z - 1$ is 5, and it has roots in the complex plane."
