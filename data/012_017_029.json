    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nIn the given graph with 6 vertices {A, B, C, D, E, F} and 6 edges {(A,B), (B,C), (C,D), (D,E), (E,F), (F,A)}, there is no perfect matching.\n\nTo see why, let's try to find a perfect matching. We can start with edge (A,B). Now, we need to find an edge for vertex C that doesn't share a vertex with (A,B). The only option is (C,D). Next, we need to find an edge for vertex E that doesn't share a vertex with (A,B) or (C,D). The only option is (E,F). However, now vertex F is incident to two edges, (E,F) and (F,A), which is not allowed in a perfect matching.\n\nTherefore, there is no perfect matching in the given graph."
