    "message_2": "To find the total Gaussian curvature of the surface S, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature at each point on the surface and then integrate it over the entire surface.\n\nThe surface S is given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2. We can write this as a parametric equation:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nwhere u = x and v = y.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. The first fundamental form is given by:\n\nI = (ru·ru) du^2 + 2(ru·rv) du dv + (rv·rv) dv^2\n\nwhere ru = dr/du and rv = dr/dv.\n\nLet's find ru and rv:\n\nru = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = ru·ru = (1, 0, 2u)·(1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = ru·rv = (1, 0, 2u)·(0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = rv·rv = (0, 1, 2v)·(0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form. We need to find the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nruu = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe coefficients of the second fundamental form are given by:\n\nL = ruu·N = (0, 0, 2)·N\nM = ruv·N = (0, 0, 0)·N\nN = rvv·N = (0, 0, 2)·N\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface. To find N, we first find the normal vector n = ru x rv:\n\nn = (1, 0, 2u) x (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize n to get the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = n/||n|| = (-2u, -2v, 1)/sqrt((-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = (-2u, -2v, 1)/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find L, M, and N:\n\nL = (0, 0, 2)·(-2u, -2v, 1)/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\nM = 0\nN = (0, 0, 2)·(-2u, -2v, 1)/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1) = 2/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2)/(EG - F^2) = (4/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)^2)/((1 + 4u^2)(1 + 4v^2) - (4uv)^2)\n\nTo find the total Gaussian curvature, we need to integrate K over the surface S:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = ∬_S K dS\n\nHowever, this integral is quite complex and does not have a closed-form solution. To find the total Gaussian curvature, we would need to use numerical methods or software to approximate the integral."
