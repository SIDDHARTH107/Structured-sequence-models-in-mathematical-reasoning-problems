    "message_2": "To find the speed of the car at some point during this time interval, we can calculate the average speed during the 4 seconds interval (between 4 seconds and 8 seconds).\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance traveled) / (Time interval)\n\nTotal distance traveled = 60 meters\nTime interval = 8 seconds - 4 seconds = 4 seconds\n\nAverage speed = 60 meters / 4 seconds = 15 meters/second\n\nSo, the car was traveling at a speed of 15 meters/second at some point during this time interval."
