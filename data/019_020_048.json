    "message_2": "To determine the time complexity, we can compare the time taken for different problem sizes. \n\nFor size 100, the algorithm takes 5 seconds.\nFor size 200, the algorithm takes 10 seconds.\n\nNotice that when the problem size doubles, the time taken also doubles. This suggests that the algorithm has a linear time complexity. Therefore, the Big-O notation for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the problem size."
