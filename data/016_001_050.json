    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle does not depend on the initial side length of the equilateral triangle. It is a fractal dimension that characterizes the self-similar nature of the Sierpinski triangle.\n\nTo calculate the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, it is formed by 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 2 (s = 2).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.58496.\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is approximately 1.58496, regardless of the initial side length of the equilateral triangle."
