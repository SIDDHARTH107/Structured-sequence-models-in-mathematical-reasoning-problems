    "message_2": "First, we need to find the derivative of the function $y = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1$ with respect to $x$. This will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\n$y' = \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 6x + 2$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point where $x = 2$. We do this by plugging in $x = 2$ into the derivative:\n\n$y'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) + 2 = 12 - 12 + 2 = 2$\n\nSo the slope of the tangent line at $x = 2$ is 2. Now we need to find the $y$-coordinate of the point on the curve where $x = 2$:\n\n$y(2) = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 8 - 12 + 4 + 1 = 1$\n\nSo the point on the curve where $x = 2$ is $(2, 1)$. Now we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - 1 = 2(x - 2)$\n\n$y = 2x - 4 + 1$\n\n$y = 2x - 3$\n\nNow we need to find the point on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the line $y = 4x + 5$. Since parallel lines have the same slope, we need to find the point on the curve where the slope of the tangent line is 4. We do this by setting the derivative equal to 4:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 4$\n\n$3x^2 - 6x - 2 = 0$\n\nNow we need to solve this quadratic equation for $x$. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nHere, $a = 3$, $b = -6$, and $c = -2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(3)(-2)}}{2(3)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 24}}{6}$\n\n$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{60}}{6}$\n\nWe have two possible solutions for $x$, but we need to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates to get the points on the curve. We do this by plugging the $x$-values back into the original function:\n\nFor $x = \\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}$:\n\n$y = \\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right) + 1$\n\nFor $x = \\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}$:\n\n$y = \\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right) + 1$\n\nSo the two possible points on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the line $y = 4x + 5$ are:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}, \\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right) + 1\\right)$\n\nand\n\n$\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}, \\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{60}}{6}\\right) + 1\\right)$"
