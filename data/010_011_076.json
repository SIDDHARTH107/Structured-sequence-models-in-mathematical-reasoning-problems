    "message_2": "By the statement of the problem, we have a 4-dimensional manifold M with boundary ∂M homeomorphic to S³. We want to find the Euler characteristic of M, denoted χ(M).\n\nTo do this, we will use the formula for the Euler characteristic of a manifold with boundary:\n\nχ(M) = χ(∂M) + χ(M, ∂M),\n\nwhere χ(∂M) is the Euler characteristic of the boundary and χ(M, ∂M) is the relative Euler characteristic of the manifold M with respect to its boundary.\n\nSince ∂M is homeomorphic to S³, we have χ(∂M) = χ(S³). The Euler characteristic of an n-sphere is given by χ(S^n) = 1 + (-1)^n. Thus, χ(S³) = 1 + (-1)³ = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nNow we need to find the relative Euler characteristic χ(M, ∂M). Since M is a connected, compact, smooth 4-manifold, we can use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which states that the Euler characteristic of a compact, oriented manifold is equal to the alternating sum of its Betti numbers:\n\nχ(M) = b₀(M) - b₁(M) + b₂(M) - b₃(M) + b₄(M).\n\nHowever, we know that χ(M) = χ(∂M) + χ(M, ∂M) = 0 + χ(M, ∂M), so we have\n\nχ(M, ∂M) = b₀(M) - b₁(M) + b₂(M) - b₃(M) + b₄(M).\n\nSince M is a 4-dimensional manifold, we know that b₄(M) = 0. Furthermore, since M is connected, we have b₀(M) = 1. Thus, we have\n\nχ(M, ∂M) = 1 - b₁(M) + b₂(M) - b₃(M).\n\nNow we can plug this back into our formula for χ(M):\n\nχ(M) = χ(∂M) + χ(M, ∂M) = 0 + (1 - b₁(M) + b₂(M) - b₃(M)).\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of M is\n\nχ(M) = 1 - b₁(M) + b₂(M) - b₃(M)."
