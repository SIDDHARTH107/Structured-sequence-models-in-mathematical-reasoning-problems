    "message_2": "To find the derivative f'(x) of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 5)(3x - 1), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. \n\nLet u(x) = 2x^2 + 5 and v(x) = 3x - 1. Then, f(x) = u(x)v(x).\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 5)/dx = 4x\nv'(x) = d(3x - 1)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (4x)(3x - 1) + (2x^2 + 5)(3)\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 4x + 6x^2 + 15\nf'(x) = 18x^2 - 4x + 15\n\nSo, the derivative f'(x) of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 5)(3x - 1) is f'(x) = 18x^2 - 4x + 15."
