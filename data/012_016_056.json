    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of the given graph, we will use the recursive deletion-contraction algorithm. The graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges, which we will label as follows:\n\n```\n(1)--e1--(4)\n | \\    |\ne2  e3  e4\n |   \\  |\n(2)--e5--(5)\n```\n\nWe will start by considering edge e1. \n\n1. Deleting e1 results in a graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges. The remaining edges are e2, e3, e4, e5, and e6. This graph has no cycles, so it is a tree. The Tutte polynomial of a tree with n vertices is x^(n-2), so in this case, it is x^(5-2) = x^3.\n\n2. Contracting e1 results in a graph with 4 vertices and 6 edges. The resulting graph is:\n\n```\n(1,4)\n  | \\\n  e4 e3\n  |   \\\n(2)--e5--(5)\n```\n\nNow, we will consider edge e4 in the contracted graph.\n\na. Deleting e4 results in a graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges. This graph has no cycles, so it is a tree. The Tutte polynomial of a tree with n vertices is x^(n-2), so in this case, it is x^(4-2) = x^2.\n\nb. Contracting e4 results in a graph with 3 vertices and 4 edges. This graph is a triangle, which is a cycle of length 3. The Tutte polynomial of a cycle of length n is (x-1)^(n-1)(y-1), so in this case, it is (x-1)^(3-1)(y-1) = (x-1)^2(y-1).\n\nNow, we can combine the results from the deletion and contraction of e1 and e4:\n\nT(x, y) = x^3 + x(x^2 + (x-1)^2(y-1)) = x^3 + x^3 + x(x-1)^2(y-1)\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(x, y) = 2x^3 + x(x-1)^2(y-1)"
