    "message_1": "A company operates a fleet of delivery trucks that make daily runs between three warehouses. Given that each truck can hold a maximum of 10 pallets, how many different ways can the company load the trucks if Warehouse 1 has 6 pallets to send, Warehouse 2 has 8 pallets, and Warehouse 3 has 12 pallets?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using combinatorics. Let's denote the number of pallets from Warehouse 1, 2, and 3 as x, y, and z, respectively. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\nx + y + z = 10\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n0 ≤ x ≤ 6 (since there are 6 pallets in Warehouse 1)\n0 ≤ y ≤ 8 (since there are 8 pallets in Warehouse 2)\n0 ≤ z ≤ 12 (since there are 12 pallets in Warehouse 3)\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x + y + z = 10. The stars and bars method states that the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + ... + xn = k is given by the binomial coefficient C(k + n - 1, n - 1).\n\nIn our case, n = 3 (since we have 3 variables) and k = 10 (since the sum is 10). So, the total number of non-negative integer solutions without considering the constraints is:\n\nC(10 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = 66\n\nNow, we need to subtract the solutions that violate the constraints. However, since the maximum values of x, y, and z are 6, 8, and 12, respectively, and the sum is only 10, none of the constraints will be violated. Therefore, all 66 solutions are valid.\n\nSo, there are 66 different ways the company can load the trucks."
