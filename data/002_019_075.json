    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is its total surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cone, we need to find the sum of the base area and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe base area (A_base) of a cone is given by the formula:\nA_base = π * r^2\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nThe lateral surface area (A_lateral) of a cone is given by the formula:\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nwhere r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem:\nl = √(r^2 + h^2)\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.\n\nGiven the radius (r) = 4 cm and height (h) = 6 cm, we can find the slant height (l):\nl = √(4^2 + 6^2)\nl = √(16 + 36)\nl = √52\nl ≈ 7.21 cm\n\nNow, we can find the base area (A_base) and the lateral surface area (A_lateral):\n\nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * 4^2\nA_base = 16π cm^2\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nA_lateral = π * 4 * 7.21\nA_lateral ≈ 28.84π cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 16π + 28.84π\nA_total ≈ 44.84π cm^2\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is approximately 44.84π cm^2 or approximately 140.86 cm^2."
