    "message_2": "We will prove this using the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).\n\nConsider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$. We can see that $g(x)$ is continuous since both $f(x)$ and $x$ are continuous functions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate $g(x)$ at the endpoints of the interval $[0, 1]$:\n\n1. $g(0) = f(0) - 0 = 0$.\n2. $g(1) = f(1) - 1 = 0$.\n\nIf there exists an $x \\in [0, 1]$ such that $g(x) = 0$, then we have $f(x) = x$. If not, then $g(x)$ must be either strictly positive or strictly negative for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nCase 1: $g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nIn this case, we have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. However, this contradicts the fact that $g(0) = f(0) - 0 = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $g(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nIn this case, we have $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$. However, this contradicts the fact that $g(1) = f(1) - 1 = 0$.\n\nSince both cases lead to contradictions, there must exist an $x \\in [0, 1]$ such that $g(x) = 0$, which implies that $f(x) = x$."
