    "message_1": "Two players, A and B, are playing a game of matching pennies. Player A has a penny with heads on both sides, and player B has a penny with tails on both sides. They play the game ten times, and each time they simultaneously choose to show either the heads or tails side of their penny. If the two sides match, player A wins one dollar; otherwise, player B wins one dollar. What is the expected value for the total amount of money that player A wins after 10 rounds of the game?",
    "message_2": "Since player A has a penny with heads on both sides and player B has a penny with tails on both sides, every time they play, player A will always show heads and player B will always show tails. This means that the two sides will never match, and player A will never win any rounds.\n\nTherefore, the expected value for the total amount of money that player A wins after 10 rounds of the game is $0."
