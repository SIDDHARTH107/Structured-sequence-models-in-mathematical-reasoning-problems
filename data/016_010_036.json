    "message_2": "In an Apollonian gasket, the curvature of each new circle can be found using the Descartes Circle Theorem. Given four mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, the theorem states that:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nWe are given the initial three circles with curvatures k1 = 1, k2 = 2, and k3 = 3. We need to find the curvature of the next 7 circles to have a total of 10 circles.\n\n1. To find the curvature of the 4th circle (k4), we can rearrange the Descartes Circle Theorem formula:\n\nk4 = (2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2) - (k1 + k2 + k3)^2)^(1/2)\n\nk4 = (2(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) - (1 + 2 + 3)^2)^(1/2)\n\nk4 = (2(14) - 36)^(1/2) = 4\n\n2. To find the curvature of the 5th circle (k5), we can use the same formula, but now we have to consider the circle with curvature k4 as one of the initial circles. We can choose the circles with curvatures k1, k2, and k4:\n\nk5 = (2(1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2) - (1 + 2 + 4)^2)^(1/2)\n\nk5 = (2(21) - 49)^(1/2) = 3\n\n3. To find the curvature of the 6th circle (k6), we can choose the circles with curvatures k1, k3, and k4:\n\nk6 = (2(1^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) - (1 + 3 + 4)^2)^(1/2)\n\nk6 = (2(26) - 64)^(1/2) = 2\n\n4. To find the curvature of the 7th circle (k7), we can choose the circles with curvatures k2, k3, and k4:\n\nk7 = (2(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) - (2 + 3 + 4)^2)^(1/2)\n\nk7 = (2(29) - 81)^(1/2) = 1\n\nNow, we have found all the unique circles that can be formed using the initial three circles. The next circles will be repetitions of the previous circles, and the pattern will continue. So, the first 10 circles in the Apollonian gasket construction have curvatures:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2\n\nThe sum of the curvatures of these 10 circles is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 25"
