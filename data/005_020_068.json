    "message_1": "In a Monte Carlo simulation study of a stock portfolio with an average daily return of 0.1% and a standard deviation of 0.5%, a student wants to estimate the probability of the portfolio making a daily return of at least 1%. Assuming a normal distribution for returns, what percentage of Monte Carlo simulations result in a portfolio return of at least 1%?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the portfolio making a daily return of at least 1%, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use a standard normal distribution table (or a calculator) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (1% return), μ is the average daily return (0.1%), and σ is the standard deviation (0.5%).\n\nz = (1 - 0.1) / 0.5\nz = 0.9 / 0.5\nz = 1.8\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability of getting a z-score of 1.8 or higher. The table or calculator will give us the area to the left of the z-score, so we need to subtract that value from 1 to get the area to the right (which represents the probability of getting a return of at least 1%).\n\nUsing a calculator or table, we find that the area to the left of z = 1.8 is approximately 0.9641. Therefore, the area to the right (the probability of a return of at least 1%) is:\n\n1 - 0.9641 = 0.0359\n\nSo, approximately 3.59% of Monte Carlo simulations result in a portfolio return of at least 1%."
