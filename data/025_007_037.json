    "message_1": "Let X be an elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + ax + b over the finite field F_p, where p is a prime and a, b are elements of F_p. Let P be a point on X with order n, i.e., nP = 0. If n is an odd prime and Q is a point on X with the property that 2Q = P, then what is the order of Q in terms of n?",
    "message_2": "Since 2Q = P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by n:\n\nn(2Q) = nP\n\nUsing the properties of scalar multiplication on elliptic curves, we can rewrite this as:\n\n2(nQ) = 0\n\nNow, we want to find the order of Q, which is the smallest positive integer m such that mQ = 0. We know that n is an odd prime, so let's consider two cases:\n\n1) If nQ = 0, then the order of Q divides n. Since n is an odd prime, the order of Q must be either 1 or n. However, the order cannot be 1, because the only point with order 1 is the identity element (0), and 2Q = P implies that Q is not the identity element. Therefore, in this case, the order of Q is n.\n\n2) If nQ â‰  0, then 2(nQ) = 0 implies that the order of 2Q is n. Since 2Q = P, this means that the order of P is n. However, this contradicts the assumption that n is the order of P. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, the order of Q must be n."
