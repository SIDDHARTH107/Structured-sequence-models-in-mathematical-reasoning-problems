    "message_2": "To determine if such a graph is possible, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words, the sum of the degree sequence must be an even number.\n\nIn this case, the degree sequence is {3,3,3,2,2,2,1,1}. The sum of the degrees is:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 17\n\nSince the sum of the degrees is an odd number (17), it violates the Handshaking Lemma. Therefore, a graph with this degree sequence is not possible."
