    "message_2": "A Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it covers every point in a given space. In this case, we want to cover a square of side length 1 with a Peano curve of length 3. \n\nSince the Peano curve covers the entire square, the total length of the curve (3) must be equal to the area of the square (1 * 1 = 1). However, this is not possible, as the length of the curve (3) is greater than the area of the square (1). \n\nTherefore, it is not possible to cover a square of side length 1 with a Peano curve of length 3."
