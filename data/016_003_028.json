    "message_2": "The exact length of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is not known and is considered to be an unsolved problem in mathematics. The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, which means it has a complex, self-similar structure at different scales. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is infinitely intricate, making it difficult to determine its exact length.\n\nHowever, it is known that the Mandelbrot set is contained within a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. This is because any complex number c with an absolute value greater than 2 will escape to infinity under iteration of the function f(z) = z^2 + c. But this information does not provide the exact length of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set within that circle."
