The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSimilarly, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3} - {} = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A):\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} x {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}\n\nThe Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A Δ B and b is in B Δ A. So, we have:\n\n{(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3),\n (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3),\n (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3),\n (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3),\n (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B Δ A) and (A Δ B):\n\n(B Δ A) x (A Δ B) = {4, 5, 1, 2, 3} x {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nThe Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in B Δ A and b is in A Δ B.
