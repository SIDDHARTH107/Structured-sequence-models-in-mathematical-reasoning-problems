    "message_1": "A factory produces 20,000 units of product A and 15,000 units of product B. The factory experiences a shutdown for one month and during that time, the production of product A and product B decreases by 10%. What is the total reduction in production from the shutdown?",
    "message_2": "To find the total reduction in production, we need to calculate the decrease in production for both product A and product B.\n\nFor product A:\n20,000 units * 10% = 2,000 units decrease\n\nFor product B:\n15,000 units * 10% = 1,500 units decrease\n\nNow, we add the decrease in production for both products:\n2,000 units (product A) + 1,500 units (product B) = 3,500 units\n\nSo, the total reduction in production from the shutdown is 3,500 units."
