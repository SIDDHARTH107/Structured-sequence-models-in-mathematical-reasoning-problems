    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium price and quantity produced by each firm in a Bertrand competition, we first need to find the reaction functions of both firms. The reaction function shows the optimal price a firm should set given the price set by its competitor.\n\nLet p_A and p_B be the prices set by firms A and B, respectively. The market price, p, will be the minimum of p_A and p_B, i.e., p = min(p_A, p_B). The demand for each firm will be:\n\nq_A = 100 - 2p_A if p_A < p_B\nq_A = (100 - 2p_A)/2 if p_A = p_B\nq_A = 0 if p_A > p_B\n\nq_B = 100 - 2p_B if p_B < p_A\nq_B = (100 - 2p_B)/2 if p_A = p_B\nq_B = 0 if p_B > p_A\n\nThe profit functions for each firm are:\n\nπ_A = p_A * q_A - C(q_A) = p_A * q_A - 10q_A\nπ_B = p_B * q_B - C(q_B) = p_B * q_B - 10q_B\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to each firm's price, taking into account the competitor's price.\n\nFor firm A, when p_A = p_B:\n\nπ_A = p_A * (100 - 2p_A)/2 - 10(100 - 2p_A)/2\nd(π_A)/dp_A = (100 - 4p_A)/2 - 10 = 0\np_A = (100 - 20)/4 = 20\n\nFor firm B, when p_B = p_A:\n\nπ_B = p_B * (100 - 2p_B)/2 - 10(100 - 2p_B)/2\nd(π_B)/dp_B = (100 - 4p_B)/2 - 10 = 0\np_B = (100 - 20)/4 = 20\n\nSince both firms have the same reaction function and set the same price, p_A = p_B = 20. The equilibrium price is 20.\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm:\n\nq_A = (100 - 2p_A)/2 = (100 - 2*20)/2 = 30\nq_B = (100 - 2p_B)/2 = (100 - 2*20)/2 = 30\n\nThe equilibrium quantity produced by each firm is 30 units."
