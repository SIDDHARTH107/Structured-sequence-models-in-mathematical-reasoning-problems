    "message_2": "To determine if X is isomorphic to a curve Y which is a line with two points identified, we need to check if X can be transformed into such a curve through a birational map. A birational map is an isomorphism between two curves that is defined by rational functions.\n\nFirst, let's find the genus of the curve X. The genus of a curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2) / 2\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree of the curve X is 3 (since the highest power of x or y is 3). So, the genus of X is:\n\ng = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) / 2 = 2(1) / 2 = 1\n\nNow, let's consider the curve Y, which is a line with two points identified. Since a line is a curve of degree 1, its genus is:\n\ng = (1 - 1)(1 - 2) / 2 = 0(0 - 1) / 2 = 0\n\nSince the genus of X (g = 1) is different from the genus of Y (g = 0), the two curves cannot be isomorphic. Therefore, the curve X is not isomorphic to a curve Y which is a line with two points identified."
