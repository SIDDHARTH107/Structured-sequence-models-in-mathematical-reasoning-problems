    "message_1": "A metal cylinder has a radius of 7 cm and a height of 20 cm. What is its total surface area (including the base and top)?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cylinder, we need to find the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius of the cylinder is 7 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(7)^2 = 49π cm^2\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 * 49π = 98π cm^2\n\nNow, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. With a radius of 7 cm and a height of 20 cm, the lateral surface area is:\n\nA = 2π(7)(20) = 280π cm^2\n\nFinally, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 98π + 280π = 378π cm^2\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 378π cm^2."
