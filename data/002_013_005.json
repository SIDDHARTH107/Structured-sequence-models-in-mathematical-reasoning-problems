    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 7 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × length × width × height\n\nIn this case, the length is 7 cm, the width is 4 cm, and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 7 × 4 × 5\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 140\n\nVolume = 46.67 cubic centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 46.67 cubic centimeters."
