    "message_2": "In order for the game to be considered a fair split, both Player A and Player B should receive an equal amount of money. Since Player A is given $10, a fair split would be $5 for each player. \n\nHowever, in this scenario, Player A decides to give $4 to Player B. In order for the game to be considered a fair split, Player B would need to receive an additional $1 to reach the fair split amount of $5."
