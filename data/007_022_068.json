    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm x satisfying the equation 8P = xP in the elliptic curve defined over the field GF(19), we need to find the value of x such that 8P is equal to xP. Since P = (5,1), we can compute the multiples of P until we find a match.\n\nFirst, let's recall the elliptic curve addition rules. Given two points P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2) on an elliptic curve, their sum R = (x3, y3) is given by:\n\n1. If P ≠ Q:\n   x3 = ((y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1))² - x1 - x2 (mod p)\n   y3 = ((y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1)) * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p)\n\n2. If P = Q:\n   x3 = ((3 * x1² + a) * (2 * y1)^(-1))² - 2 * x1 (mod p)\n   y3 = ((3 * x1² + a) * (2 * y1)^(-1)) * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p)\n\nHere, a is the coefficient of the elliptic curve equation y² = x³ + ax + b (mod p), and p is the prime number defining the field GF(p).\n\nHowever, we don't have the equation of the elliptic curve. Without the equation, we cannot compute the multiples of P and find the discrete logarithm x. Please provide the elliptic curve equation to proceed with the calculation."
