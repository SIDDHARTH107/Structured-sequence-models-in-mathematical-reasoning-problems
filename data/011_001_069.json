    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways to select 3 people from a group of 8, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (8 in this case) and k is the number of people to be selected (3 in this case).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo there are 56 different ways to select 3 people from a group of 8 to form a committee."
