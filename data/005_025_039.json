    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces light bulbs with a mean lifetime of 1000 hours and a standard deviation of 50 hours. An investigator wants to test if the company's claim is true. The investigator randomly selects 50 light bulbs and tests their lifetime, getting a mean of 980 hours. Can the investigator reject the company's claim at the 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the investigator can reject the company's claim at the 5% significance level, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The mean lifetime of the light bulbs is 1000 hours.\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The mean lifetime of the light bulbs is not 1000 hours.\n\nGiven:\nSample mean (x̄) = 980 hours\nPopulation mean (μ) = 1000 hours\nStandard deviation (σ) = 50 hours\nSample size (n) = 50\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\nSE = σ / √n = 50 / √50 ≈ 7.071\n\nNext, we calculate the t-score:\nt = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (980 - 1000) / 7.071 ≈ -2.828\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test at the 5% significance level with 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.009.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.828) is less than the critical t-value (-2.009), we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. This means the investigator can conclude that there is significant evidence to suggest that the mean lifetime of the light bulbs is not 1000 hours."
