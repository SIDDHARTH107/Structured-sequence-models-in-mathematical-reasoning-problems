    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a hurricane occurring at a specific location during the hurricane season, we need to know the length of the hurricane season in days. Let's assume the hurricane season lasts for N days.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane NOT occurring on any given day is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane NOT occurring during the entire hurricane season is the probability of it not happening on each day, raised to the power of the number of days in the season: 0.97^N.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane occurring at least once during the hurricane season is the complement of the probability of it not happening during the entire season: 1 - 0.97^N.\n\nPlease provide the length of the hurricane season (N) to get the specific probability."
