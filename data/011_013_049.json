    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of parks and libraries, we can use the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nFor the parks, there are 7 parks (n = 7) and the group wants to visit 3 parks (r = 3). So, the number of combinations of parks is:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n= 7! / (3!4!)\n= (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n= (7*6*5) / (3*2*1)\n= 210 / 6\n= 35 combinations of parks\n\nFor the libraries, there are 10 libraries (n = 10) and the group wants to visit 2 libraries (r = 2). So, the number of combinations of libraries is:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n= 10! / (2!8!)\n= (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1))\n= (10*9) / (2*1)\n= 90 / 2\n= 45 combinations of libraries\n\nNow, to find the total number of combinations of parks and libraries, we multiply the number of combinations of parks by the number of combinations of libraries:\n\nTotal combinations = 35 combinations of parks * 45 combinations of libraries\n= 1575 different combinations of parks and libraries."
