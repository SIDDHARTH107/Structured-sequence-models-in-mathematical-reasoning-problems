    "message_2": "The dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g can be found using the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nwhere M_g is the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g. In this case, we are given that the genus is 3, so we can plug that into the formula:\n\ndim(M_3) = 3(3) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 3 is 6."
