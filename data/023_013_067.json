The temperature on one side is held constant at 100 degrees Celsius and on the other side is held constant at 0 degrees Celsius. Using Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform, determine the temperature distribution throughout the metal plate after 2 minutes, given the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the 2D heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and y are the spatial coordinates.\n\nSince the temperature is held constant on the sides, we can assume that the temperature distribution is only a function of x and time, i.e., T(x, t). So, the heat equation simplifies to:\n\n∂T/∂t = α∂²T/∂x²\n\nWe can solve this equation using Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform. First, we need to find the initial temperature distribution, which is given by:\n\nT(x, 0) = 20 + 80x\n\nNow, we can apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation:\n\n∂T̂/∂t = α(k²T̂)\n\nwhere T̂ is the Fourier transform of T, and k is the wave number. This is a simple ordinary differential equation, which can be solved as:\n\nT̂(k, t) = T̂(k, 0)e^(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution:\n\nT̂(k, 0) = ∫[20 + 80x]e^(-ikx) dx, from 0 to 1\n\nT̂(k, 0) = [20(1 - e^(-ik))/(ik) + 80(e^(-ik) - ik - 1)/k²]\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at any time by taking the inverse Fourier transform of T̂(k, t):\n\nT(x, t) = ∫T̂(k, t)e^(ikx) dk, from -∞ to ∞\n\nT(x, t) = ∫[20(1 - e^(-ik))/(ik) + 80(e^(-ik) - ik - 1)/k²]e^(-αk²t)e^(ikx) dk\n\nTo find the temperature distribution after 2 minutes (120 seconds), we can plug in t = 120:\n\nT(x, 120) = ∫[20(1 - e^(-ik))/(ik) + 80(e^(-ik) - ik - 1)/k²]e^(-0.1k²*120)e^(ikx) dk\n\nThis integral is quite complex and cannot be solved analytically. However, it can be solved numerically using computational methods such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the temperature distribution T(x, 120) throughout the metal plate after 2 minutes."
