    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 174 and 84 using the Euclidean algorithm, we will perform a series of divisions with remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Divide 174 by 84 and find the remainder:\n   174 รท 84 = 2 with a remainder of 6.\n\n2. Now, divide the previous divisor (84) by the remainder (6):\n   84 รท 6 = 14 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 174 and 84 is 6."
