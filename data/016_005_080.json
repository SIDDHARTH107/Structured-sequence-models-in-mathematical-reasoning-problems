    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. In each iteration, the number of line segments doubles. Let's calculate the total number of line segments after 5 iterations:\n\nIteration 1: 1 initial segment is replaced by 2 segments (2^1 = 2)\nIteration 2: 2 segments are replaced by 4 segments (2^2 = 4)\nIteration 3: 4 segments are replaced by 8 segments (2^3 = 8)\nIteration 4: 8 segments are replaced by 16 segments (2^4 = 16)\nIteration 5: 16 segments are replaced by 32 segments (2^5 = 32)\n\nTo find the total number of line segments after 5 iterations, we sum the number of segments in each iteration:\n\nTotal line segments = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62"
