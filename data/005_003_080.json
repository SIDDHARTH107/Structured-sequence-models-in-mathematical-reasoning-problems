The data collected for five employees is listed below: \n\nEmployee 1:  Age = 28, Years of experience = 3, Salary = $45,000\nEmployee 2:  Age = 35, Years of experience = 5, Salary = $55,000\nEmployee 3:  Age = 42, Years of experience = 8, Salary = $65,000\nEmployee 4:  Age = 22, Years of experience = 1, Salary = $35,000\nEmployee 5:  Age = 31, Years of experience = 4, Salary = $50,000\n\nBased on this data, develop a regression model to predict the salary of an employee based on their age and years of experience. Use the developed model to predict the salary of an employee who is 40 years old and has 12 years of experience.",
    "message_2": "To develop a regression model, we will use multiple linear regression, which has the following form:\n\nSalary = b0 + b1 * Age + b2 * Years of experience\n\nFirst, let's calculate the means of Age, Years of experience, and Salary:\n\nMean_Age = (28 + 35 + 42 + 22 + 31) / 5 = 31.6\nMean_Years_of_experience = (3 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4) / 5 = 4.2\nMean_Salary = (45000 + 55000 + 65000 + 35000 + 50000) / 5 = 50000\n\nNext, we need to calculate the covariance and variance:\n\nCovariance(Age, Salary) = Σ[(Age - Mean_Age) * (Salary - Mean_Salary)] / (n - 1)\nCovariance(Years_of_experience, Salary) = Σ[(Years_of_experience - Mean_Years_of_experience) * (Salary - Mean_Salary)] / (n - 1)\nVariance(Age) = Σ[(Age - Mean_Age)^2] / (n - 1)\nVariance(Years_of_experience) = Σ[(Years_of_experience - Mean_Years_of_experience)^2] / (n - 1)\n\nAfter calculating the covariance and variance, we can find the coefficients b1 and b2:\n\nb1 = Covariance(Age, Salary) / Variance(Age)\nb2 = Covariance(Years_of_experience, Salary) / Variance(Years_of_experience)\n\nFinally, we can find the intercept b0:\n\nb0 = Mean_Salary - b1 * Mean_Age - b2 * Mean_Years_of_experience\n\nNow we have the regression model:\n\nSalary = b0 + b1 * Age + b2 * Years_of_experience\n\nTo predict the salary of an employee who is 40 years old and has 12 years of experience, plug the values into the model:\n\nPredicted_Salary = b0 + b1 * 40 + b2 * 12\n\nAfter calculating the coefficients and plugging the values, we get the predicted salary for the employee."
