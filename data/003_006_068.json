    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we should first find the largest side, which is already given as 18 cm. The smallest angle will be opposite to the largest side. Let's denote the angles opposite to sides 10 cm, 14 cm, and 18 cm as A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe will use the Law of Cosines to find angle C, as it is opposite to the largest side:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nwhere a = 10 cm, b = 14 cm, and c = 18 cm.\n\ncos(C) = (10^2 + 14^2 - 18^2) / (2 * 10 * 14)\ncos(C) = (100 + 196 - 324) / (280)\ncos(C) = (-28) / (280)\n\nNow, we will find the angle C:\n\nC = arccos(-28/280)\nC ≈ 97.41°\n\nNow that we have found angle C, we can use the Law of Sines to find angle A:\n\nsin(A) / a = sin(C) / c\n\nsin(A) / 10 = sin(97.41°) / 18\n\nsin(A) = (10 * sin(97.41°)) / 18\n\nNow, we will find the angle A:\n\nA = arcsin(sin(A))\nA ≈ 33.56°\n\nFinally, we can find angle B using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nB = 180° - A - C\nB = 180° - 33.56° - 97.41°\nB ≈ 49.03°\n\nThe smallest angle in the triangle is angle A, which is approximately 33.56°."
