    "message_1": "A hospital kept a record of the number of days their patients survived after being diagnosed with a particular disease. Out of 50 patients diagnosed, only 30 survived the entire length of the study. Using survival analysis techniques, what is the probability that a patient diagnosed with the same disease will survive for 100 days or more?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a patient surviving for 100 days or more, we need more information about the survival times of the patients in the study. Survival analysis techniques, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require the survival times and censoring information for each patient.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we can only calculate the proportion of patients who survived the entire length of the study. This proportion is:\n\nNumber of patients who survived / Total number of patients = 30 / 50 = 0.6 or 60%\n\nThis means that 60% of the patients survived the entire length of the study, but without knowing the length of the study or the survival times of the patients, we cannot determine the probability of a patient surviving for 100 days or more."
