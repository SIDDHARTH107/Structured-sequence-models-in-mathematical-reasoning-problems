    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference AΔB and BΔA:\n\nAΔB = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\nBΔA = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (AΔB) × A = {1, 4} × {1, 2, 3} = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n2. A × (AΔB) = {1, 2, 3} × {1, 4} = {(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}\n3. (BΔA) × B = {1, 4} × {2, 3, 4} = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}\n4.

This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
