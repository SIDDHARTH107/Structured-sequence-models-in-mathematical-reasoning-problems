    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It was first described by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. Since it is a fractal curve, it has a non-integer dimension, and its length is theoretically infinite.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for the length of the curve that connects the points (0, 0) and (1, 1) in a straight line, that would be the distance between these two points using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\nLength = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nLength = √((1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2)\n\nLength = √(1 + 1)\n\nLength = √2\n\nSo, the length of the straight line connecting the points (0, 0) and (1, 1) is √2."
