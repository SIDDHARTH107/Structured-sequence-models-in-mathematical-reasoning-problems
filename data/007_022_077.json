    "message_2": "To find all the points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5 over the finite field F_7, we will iterate through all possible x and y values in the field and check if the equation holds true. The finite field F_7 consists of integers modulo 7, which are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. \n\nWe will go through each x value and calculate the corresponding y^2 value. Then, we will check if there exists a y value in F_7 such that y^2 is equal to the calculated value. If there is, we will add the point (x, y) to our list of points on the curve.\n\nHere's the process:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 3*0 + 5 = 5 (mod 7)\nThere are two y values with y^2 = 5 (mod 7): y = 2 and y = 5.\nSo, we have points (0, 2) and (0, 5).\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 3*1 + 5 = 9 = 2 (mod 7)\nThere are two y values with y^2 = 2 (mod 7): y = 3 and y = 4.\nSo, we have points (1, 3) and (1, 4).\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 3*2 + 5 = 21 = 0 (mod 7)\nThere is one y value with y^2 = 0 (mod 7): y = 0.\nSo, we have point (2, 0).\n\nFor x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 3*3 + 5 = 41 = 6 (mod 7)\nThere are no y values with y^2 = 6 (mod 7).\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 3*4 + 5 = 77 = 6 (mod 7)\nThere are no y values with y^2 = 6 (mod 7).\n\nFor x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 3*5 + 5 = 145 = 2 (mod 7)\nThere are two y values with y^2 = 2 (mod 7): y = 3 and y = 4.\nSo, we have points (5, 3) and (5, 4).\n\nFor x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 3*6 + 5 = 245 = 5 (mod 7)\nThere are two y values with y^2 = 5 (mod 7): y = 2 and y = 5.\nSo, we have points (6, 2) and (6, 5).\n\nIn summary, the points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5 over the finite field F_7 are:\n(0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 5)."
