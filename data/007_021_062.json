    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that Pollard's rho algorithm is used for integer factorization, not for finding the private key d in RSA. However, I will guide you through the process of finding the private key d using the given information.\n\nGiven prime numbers p = 17 and q = 23, and public key e = 5, we can find the private key d as follows:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q = 17 * 23 = 391\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (17 - 1) * (23 - 1) = 16 * 22 = 352\n3. Find the modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod φ(n)), which is the private key d.\n\nWe need to find d such that:\n\ne * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\n5 * d ≡ 1 (mod 352)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular multiplicative inverse of e:\n\ngcd(5, 352) = 1 = 5 * d - 352 * k (for some integer k)\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = 213\n\nSo, the private key d = 213."
