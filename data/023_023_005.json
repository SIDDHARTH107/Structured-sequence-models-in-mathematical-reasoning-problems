    "message_1": "A telecommunications company's network signal can be represented by the function f(t) = 4cos(100πt) + 2sin(200πt). Determine the bandwidth of the network signal using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To determine the bandwidth of the network signal, we need to find the range of frequencies present in the signal. The given function is a combination of two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies:\n\nf(t) = 4cos(100πt) + 2sin(200πt)\n\nThe first term, 4cos(100πt), has a frequency of 50 Hz (since the frequency is half of the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine function). The second term, 2sin(200πt), has a frequency of 100 Hz (since the frequency is half of the coefficient of t in the argument of the sine function).\n\nThe bandwidth of the network signal is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies present in the signal. In this case, the bandwidth is:\n\nBandwidth = Highest frequency - Lowest frequency\nBandwidth = 100 Hz - 50 Hz\nBandwidth = 50 Hz\n\nSo, the bandwidth of the network signal is 50 Hz."
