    "message_2": "The rule for divisibility by 5 states that if the last digit of a number is either 0 or 5, then the number is divisible by 5. In this case, the last digit of 361 is 1, so it is not divisible by 5.\n\nTo find the remainder, we can perform the division:\n\n361 รท 5 = 72 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the remainder when 361 is divided by 5 is 1."
