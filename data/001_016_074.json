    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression 4^3 x 4^5, we use the product of powers property, which states that when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we can add the exponents. In this case, the base is 4.\n\n4^3 x 4^5 = 4^(3+5) = 4^8\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is 4^8."
