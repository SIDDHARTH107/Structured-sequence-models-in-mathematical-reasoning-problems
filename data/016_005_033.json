    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each segment. Let's analyze the first three iterations:\n\n1. Original segment length: 1\n   After first iteration, we remove the middle third (1/3), leaving two segments of length 1/3 each.\n   Remaining length: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\n2. In the second iteration, we remove the middle third of each of the two remaining segments (1/9 each).\n   Total length removed: 2 * (1/9) = 2/9\n   Remaining length: 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9\n\n3. In the third iteration, we remove the middle third of each of the four remaining segments (1/27 each).\n   Total length removed: 4 * (1/27) = 4/27\n   Remaining length: 4/9 - 4/27 = 8/27\n\nSo, after the first three iterations, the length of the resulting Cantor set is 8/27."
