    "message_2": "The given equation x^2 + y^2 = 4 represents a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the xy-plane. The symmetries of this circle include reflections across the x-axis, y-axis, and the origin, as well as rotations by multiples of 90 degrees.\n\n1. Reflection across the x-axis:\nThe transformation matrix for reflection across the x-axis is:\nT1 = | 1  0 |\n       | 0 -1 |\n\n2. Reflection across the y-axis:\nThe transformation matrix for reflection across the y-axis is:\nT2 = |-1  0 |\n       | 0  1 |\n\n3. Reflection across the origin:\nThe transformation matrix for reflection across the origin is:\nT3 = |-1  0 |\n       | 0 -1 |\n\n4. Rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise:\nThe transformation matrix for a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation is:\nT4 = | 0 -1 |\n       | 1  0 |\n\n5.
