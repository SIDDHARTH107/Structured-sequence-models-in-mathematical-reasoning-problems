    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nFirst, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B (A Δ B):\n\n1. Union of sets A and B (A ∪ B): {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}\n2. Intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B): {3, 5}\n3. Symmetric difference (A Δ B): (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of sets B and A (B Δ A):\n\n1. Union of sets B and A (B ∪ A): {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}\n2. Intersection of sets B and A (B ∩ A): {3, 5}\n3. Symmetric difference (B Δ A): (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 7, 8}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of sets A and B (A Δ B) is equal to the symmetric difference of sets B and A (B Δ A), which is {2, 7, 8}. This demonstrates that the symmetric difference is commutative, meaning the order of the sets does not affect the result."
