If a call option on this stock has a strike price of $120 and a time to maturity of 1 year, what is the theoretical value of the option according to the Black-Scholes model?",
    "message_2": "To find the theoretical value of the call option according to the Black-Scholes model, we need to use the Black-Scholes formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rt) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = call option price\nS = current stock price = $100\nX = strike price = $120\nr = continuously compounded risk-free rate = 0.04\nt = time to maturity = 1 year\nN(d) = cumulative standard normal distribution function\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * t) / (σ * sqrt(t))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(t)\n\nwhere:\nln = natural logarithm\nσ = volatility = 0.20\nsqrt = square root\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/120) + (0.04 + (0.20^2)/2) * 1) / (0.20 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (-0.1823 + 0.06) / 0.20\nd1 = -0.1223 / 0.20\nd1 = -0.6115\n\nd2 = -0.6115 - 0.20 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.6115 - 0.20\nd2 = -0.8115\n\nNow, we need to find N(d1) and N(d2). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we get:\n\nN(-0.6115) = 0.2704\nN(-0.8115) = 0.2088\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option price:\n\nC = 100 * 0.2704 - 120 * e^(-0.04 * 1) * 0.2088\nC = 27.04 - 120 * 0.9608 * 0.2088\nC = 27.04 - 120 * 0.9608 * 0.2088\nC = 27.04 - 24.1872\nC = 2.8528\n\nThe theoretical value of the call option according to the Black-Scholes model is approximately $2.85."
