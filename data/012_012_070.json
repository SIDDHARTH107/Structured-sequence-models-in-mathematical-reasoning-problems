    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. Without knowing the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges, it is impossible to determine the exact girth of the graph. However, we can discuss some possibilities.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph with 10 vertices, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the graph would have 45 edges, and the girth would be 3, as there would be triangles formed by any three vertices.\n\nHowever, since the graph has only 14 edges, it is not a complete graph. The girth could be larger than 3, depending on the arrangement of the vertices and edges. If there are no cycles of length 3, the girth could be 4 or more. If the graph is a tree (i.e., it has no cycles), the girth would be infinite.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the arrangement of the vertices and edges, it is impossible to determine the exact girth of the graph."
