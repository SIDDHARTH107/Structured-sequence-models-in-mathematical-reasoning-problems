    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe have the base (12 cm), but we need to find the height. To do this, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle between the base and one of the other sides, and then use the sine function to find the height.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. Let a = 12 cm (base), b = 9 cm, and c = 15 cm. We will find angle B (opposite side b) using the Law of Cosines:\n\ncos(B) = (a^2 + c^2 - b^2) / (2 * a * c)\n\ncos(B) = (12^2 + 15^2 - 9^2) / (2 * 12 * 15)\ncos(B) = (144 + 225 - 81) / (360)\ncos(B) = (288) / (360)\ncos(B) = 0.8\n\nNow, we find angle B:\n\nB = arccos(0.8)\nB ≈ 36.87 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the sine function to find the height (h):\n\nsin(B) = height / c\nheight = c * sin(B)\n\nheight = 15 * sin(36.87)\nheight ≈ 8.99 cm\n\nNow, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 8.99\nArea ≈ 53.94 cm^2\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 53.94 cm^2, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
