    "message_1": "A student is driving a car at an average speed of 60 mph for 2 hours. Then the student increases the speed to 75 mph for the next hour. What is the average speed of the car during the entire journey, according to the Mean Value Theorem?",
    "message_2": "To find the average speed of the car during the entire journey, we need to first find the total distance traveled and then divide it by the total time taken.\n\nFor the first 2 hours, the student drives at 60 mph:\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles\n\nFor the next hour, the student drives at 75 mph:\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 75 mph × 1 hour = 75 miles\n\nTotal distance traveled = 120 miles + 75 miles = 195 miles\nTotal time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\nNow, we can find the average speed:\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 195 miles / 3 hours = 65 mph\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, the average speed of the car during the entire journey is 65 mph."
