    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for finding the slope of a tangent line to a curve:\n\nA roller coaster car is traveling along a parabolic track given by the equation y = x^2. At the point (3, 9), what is the slope of the tangent line to the curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (3, 9), we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nThe given equation is y = x^2. \n\nNow, let's find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 3:\n\ndy/dx (3) = 2(3) = 6\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (3, 9) is 6."
