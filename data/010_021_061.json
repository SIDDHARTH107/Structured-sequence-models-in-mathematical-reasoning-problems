Let $\\gamma: S^1 \\to M$ be a closed curve such that $\\gamma^*(\\omega) = m$.

    "message_2": "To find the integer $n$ such that $\\gamma^n$ is nullhomologous, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ for which the homology class of the $n$-fold iterate of $\\gamma$ is trivial in $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. \n\nRecall that $\\gamma^*(\\omega) = m$. This means that the integral of $\\omega$ over the curve $\\gamma$ is equal to $m$. Now, let's consider the $n$-fold iterate of $\\gamma$, denoted by $\\gamma^n$. The integral of $\\omega$ over $\\gamma^n$ is given by:\n\n$$\\int_{\\gamma^n} \\omega = n \\int_{\\gamma} \\omega = nm.$$\n\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\gamma^n$ is nullhomologous. This means that the integral of $\\omega$ over $\\gamma^n$ should be an integer multiple of the cohomology class $k$:\n\n$$nm = lk$$\n\nfor some integer $l$. Since $m$ and $k$ are coprime (otherwise, $\\gamma$ would not be a nontrivial curve), we can find the smallest positive integer $n$ by finding the smallest positive integer $l$ such that $lk$ is divisible by $m$. This can be done using the following formula:\n\n$$n = \\frac{lk}{m}.$$\n\nSince $l$ is the smallest positive integer such that $lk$ is divisible by $m$, we have that $l = m$ and $n = k$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\gamma^n$ is nullhomologous is equal to the cohomology class $k$."
