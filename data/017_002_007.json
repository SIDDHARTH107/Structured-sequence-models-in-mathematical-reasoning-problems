    "message_1": "Let G be a cyclic group of order 12, generated by the element a. Find all the subgroups of G and determine whether each of them is cyclic or not.",
    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we can use the fact that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 12, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will find the subgroups of each order and determine if they are cyclic.\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element, is always a subgroup of any group. It is cyclic since it only contains one element.\n\n2. Order 2: We are looking for an element of order 2 in G. Since G is cyclic, we know that a^12 = e. Therefore, a^6 has order 2, because (a^6)^2 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^6 is {e, a^6} and has order 2. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n3. Order 3: We are looking for an element of order 3 in G. Since a^12 = e, a^4 has order 3, because (a^4)^3 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^4 is {e, a^4, a^8} and has order 3. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n4. Order 4: We are looking for an element of order 4 in G. Since a^12 = e, a^3 has order 4, because (a^3)^4 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^3 is {e, a^3, a^6, a^9} and has order 4. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n5. Order 6: We are looking for an element of order 6 in G. Since a^12 = e, a^2 has order 6, because (a^2)^6 = a^12 = e. The subgroup generated by a^2 is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10} and has order 6. This subgroup is cyclic.\n\n6. Order 12: The entire group G is a subgroup of itself, and it is cyclic since it is generated by the element a.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {e} (order 1, cyclic)\n2. {e, a^6} (order 2, cyclic)\n3. {e, a^4, a^8} (order 3, cyclic)\n4. {e, a^3, a^6, a^9} (order 4, cyclic)\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10} (order 6, cyclic)\n6. G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11} (order 12, cyclic)\n\nAll the subgroups of G are cyclic."
