    "message_2": "To solve for the value of y in the equation 4x + 2y = 10, we need to express y in terms of x. \n\nStep 1: Isolate the term with y.\n2y = 10 - 4x\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 2.\ny = (10 - 4x) / 2\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation.\ny = 5 - 2x\n\nNow, y is expressed in terms of x as y = 5 - 2x."
