    "message_1": "In a clinical trial, there were 120 patients who were diagnosed with a particular disease. The survival times of these patients, in days, were recorded. Out of 120 patients, 40 were censored (meaning their survival times were unknown due to some reasons).\n\nUsing Kaplan-Meier estimator, find the survival probability at day 120 for the patients who were diagnosed with the disease.  The survival probability at day 120 can be interpreted as the probability that a patient's survival time exceeds 120 days.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the survival probability at day 120 using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we need the number of patients at risk and the number of events (deaths) at each time point. Unfortunately, the information provided does not give us the necessary data to perform this calculation.\n\nHowever, I can explain the Kaplan-Meier estimator formula and the process to calculate the survival probability at day 120 if you provide the required data.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator formula is:\n\nS(t) = ‚àè(1 - (d_i / n_i))\n\nwhere S(t) is the survival probability at time t, d_i is the number of events (deaths) at time i, and n_i is the number of patients at risk at time i.\n\nTo calculate the survival probability at day 120:\n\n1. Organize the data in ascending order of survival times, noting the number of events (deaths) and the number of patients at risk at each time point.\n2. Calculate the survival probability at each time point using the Kaplan-Meier estimator formula.\n3. Multiply the survival probabilities at each time point up to and including day 120.\n\nPlease provide the required data (number of patients at risk and the number of events at each time point) to calculate the survival probability at day 120 using the Kaplan-Meier estimator."
