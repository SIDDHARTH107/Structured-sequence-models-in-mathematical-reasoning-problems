    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using a sparse matrix, we first represent the given system of equations as a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the matrix representation of the system is:\n\n```\n[2 1 0 | 5]\n[1 3 1 | 10]\n[5 0 1 | 12]\n```\n\nNow, we can solve the system using Gaussian elimination or any other suitable method. Here, we will use Gaussian elimination.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n```\nR2 = R2 - (1/2) * R1\nR3 = R3 - (5/2) * R1\n```\n\nThe updated matrix is:\n```\n[2  1  0 |  5]\n[0  2.5 1 |  5]\n[0 -2.5 1 | -0.5]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third equation.\n```\nR3 = R3 + R2\n```\n\nThe updated matrix is:\n```\n[2  1  0 |  5]\n[0  2.5 1 |  5]\n[0  0  2 |  4.5]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z, y, and x.\n```\nz = (4.5 / 2) = 2.25\ny = (5 - 1 * 2.25) / 2.5 = 1.1\nx = (5 - 1.1) / 2 = 1.95\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.95, y = 1.1, and z = 2.25."
