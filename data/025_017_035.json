    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the given algebraic variety, we will first find its singular points and then perform a birational transformation to resolve the singularities.\n\nThe equation of the variety is given by:\n$y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = (x-z)(x-\\lambda z) + x(x-\\lambda z) + x(x-z) = 2x^2 - (\\lambda+1)xz + \\lambda z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = y^2 - x(x-\\lambda z) - x(x-z) = y^2 - x^2 + (\\lambda+1)xz - \\lambda z^2$\n\nNow, we will find the singular points by setting the partial derivatives equal to zero:\n\n$2x^2 - (\\lambda+1)xz + \\lambda z^2 = 0$\n\n$2yz = 0$\n\n$y^2 - x^2 + (\\lambda+1)xz - \\lambda z^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $y=0$ or $z=0$. \n\nCase 1: $y=0$\n\nIn this case, the variety equation becomes $0 = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$. This implies that either $x=0$, $x=z$, or $x=\\lambda z$. \n\nIf $x=0$, then the point is $(0,0,0)$, which is not a point on the projective variety.\n\nIf $x=z$, then the point is $(z,0,z)$, which is a point on the variety for any $z \\neq 0$. However, this point is not singular because $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} \\neq 0$.\n\nIf $x=\\lambda z$, then the point is $(\\lambda z, 0, z)$, which is a point on the variety for any $z \\neq 0$. However, this point is not singular because $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} \\neq 0$.\n\nCase 2: $z=0$\n\nIn this case, the variety equation becomes $y^2 = x^3$. The singular point is $(0,0,0)$, which is not a point on the projective variety.\n\nThus, there are no singular points on the algebraic variety. Therefore, the variety itself is already the minimal model, and no further birational transformations are needed. The minimal model of the given algebraic variety is:\n\n$y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$."
