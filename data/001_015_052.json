    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^(3x-2) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Write the equation in terms of the same base.\nSince 16 can be written as 2^4, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(3x-2) = 2^4\n\nStep 2: Set the exponents equal to each other.\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x - 2 = 4\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nNow, we can solve for x by isolating it:\n\n3x - 2 + 2 = 4 + 2\n3x = 6\nx = 6 / 3\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 2^(3x-2) = 16 is x = 2."
