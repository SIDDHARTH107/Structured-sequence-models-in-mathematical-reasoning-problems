    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the complex function $f(z) = z^3 - 3z^2 + 2$ on the closed disk $|z-2-2i| \\leq 2$, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum modulus of a continuous function on a closed and bounded set is achieved on the boundary of the set.\n\nFirst, let's parameterize the boundary of the disk. The boundary is given by $|z-2-2i| = 2$. Let $z = 2 + 2i + 2e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Now, we can substitute this parameterization into the function $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = (2 + 2i + 2e^{i\\theta})^3 - 3(2 + 2i + 2e^{i\\theta})^2 + 2$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = 8 + 12e^{i\\theta} + 12e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{3i\\theta} - 12 - 36i - 12e^{i\\theta} - 12e^{2i\\theta} + 2$$\n\n$$f(z) = 2e^{3i\\theta} - 36i$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum modulus of $f(z)$:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |2e^{3i\\theta} - 36i|$$\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum of this expression, we can use the triangle inequality:\n\n$$|2e^{3i\\theta} - 36i| \\leq |2e^{3i\\theta}| + |36i| = 2 + 36 = 38$$\n\nEquality holds when $2e^{3i\\theta} = 36i$, which gives us $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. Thus, the maximum modulus of $f(z)$ on the closed disk is 38.\n\nTo find the minimum modulus, we can use the reverse triangle inequality:\n\n$$|2e^{3i\\theta} - 36i| \\geq ||2e^{3i\\theta}| - |36i|| = |2 - 36| = 34$$\n\nEquality holds when $2e^{3i\\theta} = -36i$, which gives us $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. Thus, the minimum modulus of $f(z)$ on the closed disk is 34.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum modulus of the complex function $f(z)$ on the closed disk $|z-2-2i| \\leq 2$ is 38, and the minimum modulus is 34."
