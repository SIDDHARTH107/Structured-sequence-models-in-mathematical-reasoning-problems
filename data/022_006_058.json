    "message_2": "Let z = e^(iθ) be a point on the unit circle, where θ is the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to z. Then, we have:\n\nf(z) = (e^(iθ))^2 + e^(iθ) + 1 = e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1.\n\nNow, let's find the absolute value of f(z):\n\n|f(z)| = |e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1|.\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|, we can consider the function g(θ) = |f(e^(iθ))|^2. Squaring the absolute value of a complex number eliminates the square root, making it easier to work with:\n\ng(θ) = |e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1|^2.\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\ng(θ) = (e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1)(e^(-2iθ) + e^(-iθ) + 1)\n     = (e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1)(e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1)^*\n     = (e^(2iθ) + e^(iθ) + 1)(e^(-2iθ) + e^(-iθ) + 1)\n     = e^(4iθ) + 2e^(3iθ) + 3e^(2iθ) + 2e^(iθ) + 1.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum values of g(θ) for θ in the interval [0, 2π]. To do this, we can take the derivative of g(θ) with respect to θ and set it equal to 0:\n\ng'(θ) = 4i e^(4iθ) + 6i e^(3iθ) + 6i e^(iθ) = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 2i:\n\n2 e^(4iθ) + 3 e^(3iθ) + 3 e^(iθ) = 0.\n\nLet x = e^(iθ). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n2x^4 + 3x^3 + 3x = 0.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(2x^3 + 3x^2 + 3) = 0.\n\nSince x = e^(iθ) is nonzero, we can divide both sides by x:\n\n2x^3 + 3x^2 + 3 = 0.\n\nNow, we can use numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method) to find the roots of this equation. The real root is approximately x ≈ -0.877438. Since x = e^(iθ), we have:\n\nθ ≈ arccos(-0.877438/|x|) ≈ 2.0944.\n\nThus, the values of z on the unit circle where the absolute value of f(z) takes its maximum and minimum values are approximately:\n\nz = e^(iθ) ≈ e^(2.0944i)."
