Write the equation of the trigonometric function that models the height (in meters) of a person on the Ferris wheel as a function of time (in minutes) if the lowest point is at ground level. What is the height of a person after 2 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To model the height of a person on the Ferris wheel, we can use a sinusoidal function. Since the lowest point is at ground level, we'll use a sine function. The general form of the sine function is:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(B * (t - C)) + D\n\nwhere h(t) is the height of the person at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nThe diameter of the Ferris wheel is 50 meters, so the radius is 25 meters. This means that the amplitude (A) is 25 meters, as the person will be 25 meters above and below the center of the Ferris wheel.\n\nThe Ferris wheel makes one complete revolution in 5 minutes, so the period of the function is 5 minutes. To find the frequency (B), we can use the formula:\n\nB = 2π / period\n\nB = 2π / 5\n\nSince the lowest point is at ground level, there is no phase shift (C = 0).\n\nThe vertical shift (D) is the center of the Ferris wheel, which is 25 meters above ground level.\n\nNow we can write the equation of the trigonometric function:\n\nh(t) = 25 * sin((2π / 5) * t) + 25\n\nTo find the height of a person after 2 minutes, we can plug t = 2 into the equation:\n\nh(2) = 25 * sin((2π / 5) * 2) + 25\nh(2) = 25 * sin((4π / 5)) + 25\nh(2) ≈ 25 * (-0.9511) + 25\nh(2) ≈ -23.7775 + 25\nh(2) ≈ 1.2225\n\nAfter 2 minutes, the height of a person on the Ferris wheel is approximately 1.22 meters above ground level."
