    "message_2": "First, let's try to solve the system of linear equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n2(-x + 2y) = 2(5)\n-2x + 4y = 10\n\nNow we have:\n-2x + 4y = 10\n2x - 4y = 10\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n(-2x + 4y) + (2x - 4y) = 10 + 10\n0 = 20\n\nSince 0 â‰  20, the system of linear equations has no solutions. The reason for this is that the two lines represented by the equations are parallel and never intersect."
