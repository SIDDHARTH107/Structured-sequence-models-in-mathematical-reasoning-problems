    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = cos(2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a function g(x) inside another function h(x), then the derivative of the composition h(g(x)) is given by:\n\n(h(g(x)))' = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nIn our case, we have h(x) = cos(x) and g(x) = 2x. So, we need to find the derivatives of h(x) and g(x).\n\nThe derivative of h(x) = cos(x) is h'(x) = -sin(x).\nThe derivative of g(x) = 2x is g'(x) = 2.\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x):\n\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\nf'(x) = -sin(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = -sin(2(π/4)) * 2\nf'(π/4) = -sin(π/2) * 2\nf'(π/4) = -1 * 2\nf'(π/4) = -2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -2."
