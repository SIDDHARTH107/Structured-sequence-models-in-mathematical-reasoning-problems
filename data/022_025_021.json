    "message_2": "To solve the given Schrödinger equation using complex analysis, we will first rewrite the equation in terms of a complex variable and then apply the method of Frobenius to find the solution.\n\nLet's introduce a complex variable $z = x + ix$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. The differential equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$\\frac{d^2y}{dz^2} + (2+z^2)y = 0$\n\nNow, we will apply the method of Frobenius to find the solution. We assume that the solution can be written as a power series:\n\n$y(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$y'(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n z^{n-1}$\n\n$y''(z) = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^{n-2}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the differential equation, we obtain:\n\n$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^{n-2} + (2+z^2) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n = 0$\n\nNow, we will equate the coefficients of the same powers of $z$ to zero. This will give us a recurrence relation for the coefficients $a_n$.\n\nFor $n = 0$, we have:\n\n$a_2 + 2a_0 = 0 \\Rightarrow a_2 = -2a_0$\n\nFor $n \\geq 1$, we have:\n\n$(n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2} + (2+n^2) a_n = 0$\n\nThis recurrence relation can be used to find the coefficients $a_n$ for $n \\geq 1$. The general solution of the equation can then be written as:\n\n$y(z) = a_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$\n\nSince we are interested in the solution in terms of the original variable $x$, we can substitute $z = x + ix$ back into the solution:\n\n$y(x) = a_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n (x + ix)^n$\n\nThis is the general solution of the given Schrödinger equation using complex analysis method. Note that the solution is expressed in terms of a power series, and the coefficients $a_n$ can be found using the recurrence relation derived above."
