Antiderivative of 3x^2:\n   Here, n = 2. So, the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of 4x:\n   Here, n = 1. So, the antiderivative is (4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (4x^2)/2 = 2x^2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of 7:\n   Since 7 is a constant, its antiderivative is 7x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 7x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
