    "message_1": "A metal sheet in the shape of an ellipse has semi-axes of length 5 cm and 8 cm. An ant is walking on the metal sheet from a point on the shorter semi-axis to a point on the longer semi-axis. Assuming that the ant always moves in the direction of the shortest distance to the endpoint of its journey, what is the total distance that the ant walks?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between the two points on the ellipse, we can use the straight line distance formula. The ant starts at a point on the shorter semi-axis (5 cm) and ends at a point on the longer semi-axis (8 cm). Let's assume the starting point is at (0, 5) and the ending point is at (8, 0).\n\nThe distance formula is given by:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of the starting and ending points:\n\nDistance = √((8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2)\nDistance = √((8)^2 + (-5)^2)\nDistance = √(64 + 25)\nDistance = √89\n\nSo, the total distance that the ant walks is √89 cm, which is approximately 9.43 cm."
