    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for each possible route and then selecting the one with the smallest distance. Since there are 8 cities, there are 7! (7 factorial) possible routes, which equals 5,040 routes. However, calculating all of these routes manually would be very time-consuming.\n\nInstead, we can use some observations to narrow down the possibilities and find the shortest route more efficiently. We can start by looking at the shortest distances from each city and try to connect them in a way that forms a complete route.\n\n1. City 1 to City 2: 10 km\n2. City 2 to City 7: 20 km\n3. City 7 to City 8: 10 km\n4. City 8 to City 6: 18 km\n5. City 6 to City 4: 28 km\n6. City 4 to City 5: 20 km\n7. City 5 to City 3: 60 km (This is the only remaining connection to City 3)\n\nNow let's add up the distances:\n\n10 + 20 + 10 + 18 + 28 + 20 + 60 = 166 km\n\nSo, the shortest possible route the Traveling Salesman can take is:\n\nCity 1 → City 2 → City 7 → City 8 → City 6 → City 4 → City 5 → City 3 → City 1\n\nAnd the total distance for this route is 166 km."
