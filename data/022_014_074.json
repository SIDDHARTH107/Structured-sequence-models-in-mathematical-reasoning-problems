    "message_2": "To find the harmonic function u(x, y) that satisfies the given Laplace equation and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\nu(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)\n\nSubstituting this into the Laplace equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, we divide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We set:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ\nY''(y)/Y(y) = λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nY''(y) - λY(y) = 0\n\nWe first solve the X(x) equation. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, y) = X(0)Y(y) = y => X(0) = 1\nu(1, y) = X(1)Y(y) = 0\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we get:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 1\n\nSo, the X(x) equation becomes:\n\nX(x) = cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition:\n\nX(1) = cos(√λ) + B*sin(√λ) = 0\n\nSince cos(√λ) ≠ 0, we must have:\n\nB*sin(√λ) = -cos(√λ)\n\nNow, we solve the Y(y) equation. The general solution is:\n\nY(y) = C*cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy)\n\nSince u(0, y) = y, we have:\n\nY(0) = C*cosh(0) + D*sinh(0) = C = y\n\nSo, the Y(y) equation becomes:\n\nY(y) = y*cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nu(x, y) = (cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx))(y*cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy))\n\nTo satisfy the boundary conditions, we need to find λ, B, and D. We can do this by expanding u(x, y) in a Fourier sine series:\n\nu(x, y) = Σ [a_n * sin(nπx) * (y*cosh(nπy) + b_n*sinh(nπy))]\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients. We can find these coefficients by using the orthogonality properties of sine functions and the given boundary conditions. However, this process is quite involved and requires advanced techniques in Fourier analysis.\n\nIn summary, the harmonic function u(x, y) can be found by solving the separated ordinary differential equations and expanding the solution in a Fourier sine series. The exact solution depends on the coefficients a_n and b_n, which can be determined using Fourier analysis techniques."
