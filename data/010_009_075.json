    "message_1": "Consider a three-dimensional object with the shape of a cube. We want to triangulate this object into smaller tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron has a volume of exactly 1/6 cubic units. How many tetrahedra are needed in this subdivision?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume the side length of the cube is s cubic units. The volume of the cube is given by V = s^3 cubic units. Since each tetrahedron has a volume of 1/6 cubic units, we can find the number of tetrahedra needed by dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of each tetrahedron.\n\nNumber of tetrahedra = (Volume of cube) / (Volume of each tetrahedron)\nNumber of tetrahedra = (s^3) / (1/6)\n\nTo find the exact number of tetrahedra, we need to know the side length s of the cube. If the side length is not given, we cannot determine the exact number of tetrahedra needed in this subdivision."
