    "message_1": "A researcher wants to compare the heights of two different groups of students. She has collected data on the height in inches of 12 students in group 1 and 10 students in group 2. However, the normality assumption is not met. Can you help the researcher to test if there is a significant difference between the two groups based on their heights using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test? The data is given below:\n\nGroup 1: 68, 70, 72, 66, 64, 69, 70, 71, 65, 67, 70, 68\nGroup 2: 64, 63, 68, 72, 69, 68, 66, 70, 68, 67",
    "message_2": "Yes, I can help the researcher to test if there is a significant difference between the two groups based on their heights using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test). Here are the steps to perform the test:\n\n1. Combine the data from both groups and rank them in ascending order.\n\nCombined data: 63, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 71, 72, 72\n\n2. Assign ranks to the data points. In case of ties, assign the average rank.\n\nRanks: 1, 2.5, 2.5, 4, 5.5, 5.5, 7.5, 7.5, 9.5, 9.5, 9.5, 9.5, 13.5, 13.5, 15.5, 15.5, 15.5, 18, 19.5, 19.5\n\n3. Sum the ranks for each group.\n\nGroup 1 ranks: 2.5, 4, 19.5, 5.5, 9.5, 13.5, 15.5, 18, 7.5, 9.5, 15.5, 9.5\nSum of ranks for Group 1: R1 = 130.5\n\nGroup 2 ranks: 2.5, 1, 9.5, 19.5, 13.5, 9.5, 5.5, 15.5, 9.5, 7.5\nSum of ranks for Group 2: R2 = 94.5\n\n4. Calculate the test statistic (U) for both groups.\n\nU1 = n1 * n2 + n1 * (n1 + 1) / 2 - R1\nU1 = 12 * 10 + 12 * (12 + 1) / 2 - 130.5\nU1 = 120 + 78 - 130.5\nU1 = 67.5\n\nU2 = n1 * n2 + n2 * (n2 + 1) / 2 - R2\nU2 = 12 * 10 + 10 * (10 + 1) / 2 - 94.5\nU2 = 120 + 55 - 94.5\nU2 = 80.5\n\n5. Choose the smaller U value as the test statistic.\n\nU = min(U1, U2) = min(67.5, 80.5) = 67.5\n\n6. Determine the critical value for the test at a chosen significance level (e.g., α = 0.05) using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test table or software. For this example, let's use α = 0.05.\n\nFor n1 = 12 and n2 = 10, the critical value at α = 0.05 is 54.\n\n7. Compare the test statistic (U) to the critical value.\n\nSince U = 67.5 > 54 (the critical value), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference between the heights of the two groups of students at the 0.05 significance level using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test."
