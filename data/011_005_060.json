    "message_1": "In how many ways can a committee of 4 students be chosen from 10 students, if 2 of the students, Adam and Ben are declared ineligible to be part of the committee due to disciplinary reasons?",
    "message_2": "Since Adam and Ben are ineligible, we are left with 8 students to choose from. We need to choose a committee of 4 students from these 8.\n\nThe number of ways to do this can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students to choose from (8 in this case) and k is the number of students to choose (4 in this case).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo, there are 70 ways to choose a committee of 4 students from the remaining 8 students."
