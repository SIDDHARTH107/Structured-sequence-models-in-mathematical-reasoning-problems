The company wants to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demand of the retailers. The transportation cost from each warehouse to each retailer is given in the table below. The company must transport all the products from each warehouse and can transport any number of products through any path.\n  \n| Warehouse \\ Retailer | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n|----------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1                    |  3 | 7 | 2 | 9 | 8 | 3 | 5 | 1 |\n| 2                    |  5 | 9 | 3 | 6 | 5 | 8 | 4 | 7 |\n| 3                    |  8 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 9 | 7 | 5 | 3 |\n| 4                    |  2 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 3 | 7 | 8 | 4 |\n| 5                    |  6 | 4 | 8 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 9 | 7 |\n\nWhat is the minimum total transportation cost that the company can achieve while meeting the demand of the retailers?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the transportation algorithm, which is a special case of the linear programming problem. The transportation algorithm helps to find the optimal solution for minimizing the total transportation cost while meeting the demand of the retailers.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem using the transportation algorithm:\n\n1. Determine the supply from each warehouse and the demand for each retailer. In this problem, we don't have the supply and demand values, so we can't proceed with the transportation algorithm.\n\nWithout the supply and demand values, we cannot determine the minimum total transportation cost that the company can achieve while meeting the demand of the retailers. Please provide the supply and demand values for each warehouse and retailer to proceed with the solution."
