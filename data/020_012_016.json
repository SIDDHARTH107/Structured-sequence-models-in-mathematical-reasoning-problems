    "message_1": "A chemical company wants to maximize their profit by producing two chemicals A and B. The production of chemical A costs $5 per unit and can be sold for $12 per unit. The production of chemical B costs $9 per unit and can be sold for $15 per unit. However, the production process of chemical B creates a harmful waste that costs an additional $4 per unit to dispose of. The company has a budget of $800 to spend on the production process. How many units of each chemical should be produced to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of chemical A and y be the number of units of chemical B.\n\nThe profit for chemical A is $12 - $5 = $7 per unit, and the profit for chemical B is $15 - $9 - $4 = $2 per unit.\n\nThe total cost of producing x units of chemical A and y units of chemical B is $5x + ($9 + $4)y, which should be less than or equal to the budget of $800.\n\nSo, the constraint equation is:\n\n5x + 13y ≤ 800\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 7x + 2y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we need to find the feasible region for the constraint equation and then find the maximum value of the objective function within that region.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\n5x + 13y ≤ 800\ny ≤ (800 - 5x) / 13\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (we cannot produce a negative number of units), the feasible region is:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\ny ≤ (800 - 5x) / 13\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of the objective function within this feasible region. We can do this by analyzing the corner points of the feasible region.\n\nCorner points are:\n(0, 0)\n(160, 0)\n(0, 61)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the objective function at these corner points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 7(0) + 2(0) = 0\nP(160, 0) = 7(160) + 2(0) = 1120\nP(0, 61) = 7(0) + 2(61) = 122\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (160, 0), with a profit of $1120.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 160 units of chemical A and 0 units of chemical B to maximize their profit."
