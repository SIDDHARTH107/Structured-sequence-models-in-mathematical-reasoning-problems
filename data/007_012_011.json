    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p), which means (p-1)! + 1 is a multiple of p. So, we are looking for the smallest prime number greater than 1.\n\nThe smallest prime number greater than 1 is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the given condition is n = 2."
