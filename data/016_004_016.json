    "message_1": "What is the value of the complex number c for which the corresponding Julia set is a perfect circle with radius 2 when the Mandelbrot set is displayed with a maximum iteration count of 500?",
    "message_2": "The Julia set is a perfect circle with radius 2 when the complex number c is equal to 0. In this case, the Julia set equation is z_n+1 = z_n^2 + c, where c = 0. This simplifies to z_n+1 = z_n^2, and the set of points that do not escape to infinity when iterated forms a perfect circle with radius 2. The maximum iteration count of 500 does not affect the value of c for this specific Julia set."
