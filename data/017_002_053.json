    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we will use the fact that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 16, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. We will find the subgroups of each order and show that they are cyclic.\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element, is always a subgroup of any group. It is cyclic since it contains only one element.\n\n2. Order 2: For a subgroup of order 2, we need an element of order 2. Since G is cyclic, the element g^8 has order 2 because (g^8)^2 = g^16 = e. Thus, the subgroup H_2 = {e, g^8} has order 2 and is cyclic.\n\n3. Order 4: For a subgroup of order 4, we need an element of order 4. The element g^4 has order 4 because (g^4)^4 = g^16 = e. Thus, the subgroup H_4 = {e, g^4, g^8, g^12} has order 4 and is cyclic.\n\n4. Order 8: For a subgroup of order 8, we need an element of order 8. The element g^2 has order 8 because (g^2)^8 = g^16 = e. Thus, the subgroup H_8 = {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10, g^12, g^14} has order 8 and is cyclic.\n\n5. Order 16: The entire group G itself is a subgroup of order 16, and it is cyclic by definition.\n\nNow, we have found all the subgroups of G, and they are all cyclic:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, g^8}\n3. {e, g^4, g^8, g^12}\n4. {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10, g^12, g^14}\n5. {e, g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^15}\n\nTo prove that there are no other subgroups, we can use the fact that the number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order n is equal to the number of divisors of n. The number of divisors of 16 is 5 (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16), and we have found 5 subgroups, so there are no other subgroups of G."
