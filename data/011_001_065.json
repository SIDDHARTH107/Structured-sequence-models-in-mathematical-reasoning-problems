    "message_2": "To determine the number of different starting lineups possible, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (10 in this case) and k is the number of players to choose for the starting lineup (5 in this case).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(10, 5) = 3628800 / (120*120)\n\nC(10, 5) = 3628800 / 14400\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo there are 252 different starting lineups possible."
