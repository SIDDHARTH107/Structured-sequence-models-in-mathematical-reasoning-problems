    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 10. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, which is of order 5 and thus cyclic (since 5 is prime). Let K be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which is of order 2. Since the order of K is 2, K is also cyclic and isomorphic to the group Z_2.\n\nNow, we know that the order of the product of two subgroups H and K is |H||K|/|H ∩ K|. Since H and K are both cyclic and have prime orders, their intersection can only be the identity element. Thus, |H ∩ K| = 1, and the order of the product HK is |H||K| = 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nSince |HK| = |G|, we have that HK = G. Moreover, since the intersection of H and K is trivial, the elements of H and K commute with each other. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which is Z_5 × Z_2.\n\nNow, let's find the subgroups of order 2 in G. Since G is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_2, we can find the subgroups of order 2 in Z_5 × Z_2 and then find the corresponding subgroups in G. The elements of Z_5 × Z_2 are of the form (a, b), where a ∈ Z_5 and b ∈ Z_2. An element (a, b) has order 2 if and only if (a, b)^2 = (a^2, b^2) = (1, 1). In Z_5, only 1 has the property that a^2 = 1, so we must have a = 1. In Z_2, both 0 and 1 have the property that b^2 = 1, so we can have b = 0 or b = 1. Thus, there are two elements of order 2 in Z_5 × Z_2: (1, 0) and (1, 1).\n\nSince Z_5 × Z_2 has two elements of order 2, it has two subgroups of order 2, each generated by one of these elements: { (1, 0), (1, 1) } and { (1, 0), (1, 0) }. The corresponding subgroups in G can be found by considering the isomorphism between G and Z_5 × Z_2.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 10 has two different subgroups of order 2, and it is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, Z_5 × Z_2."
