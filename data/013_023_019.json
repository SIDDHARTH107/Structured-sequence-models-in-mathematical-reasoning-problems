    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player 1 has 10 tokens and decides how many to send to Player 2. Whatever Player 1 sends is tripled, and Player 2 then decides how many tokens to send back to Player 1. Whatever Player 2 sends is also tripled and returned to Player 1. If both players play rationally, what is the maximum number of tokens that Player 1 can expect to receive back?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game step by step:\n\n1. Player 1 sends x tokens to Player 2, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 10.\n2. The number of tokens triples, so Player 2 receives 3x tokens.\n3. Player 2 sends y tokens back to Player 1, where 0 ≤ y ≤ 3x.\n4. The number of tokens triples again, so Player 1 receives 3y tokens back.\n\nBoth players are rational, so they want to maximize their own tokens. Player 2 knows that if they send back too few tokens, Player 1 might not trust them in future rounds (if the game is repeated). Therefore, Player 2 will send back enough tokens to maintain trust and maximize their own tokens.\n\nLet's assume that Player 2 sends back 2x tokens to Player 1, keeping x tokens for themselves. In this case, Player 1 receives 3(2x) = 6x tokens back.\n\nNow, let's find the optimal value of x for Player 1 to maximize the number of tokens they receive back:\n\nPlayer 1 starts with 10 tokens, so they have (10 - x) tokens left after sending x tokens to Player 2. After receiving 6x tokens back, Player 1 has a total of (10 - x) + 6x = 10 + 5x tokens.\n\nTo maximize the number of tokens Player 1 receives back, we need to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 10 + 5x, subject to the constraint 0 ≤ x ≤ 10.\n\nThe function f(x) is a linear function with a positive slope (5), so it increases as x increases. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) occurs when x = 10.\n\nWhen x = 10, f(x) = 10 + 5(10) = 10 + 50 = 60.\n\nSo, if both players play rationally, the maximum number of tokens that Player 1 can expect to receive back is 60."
