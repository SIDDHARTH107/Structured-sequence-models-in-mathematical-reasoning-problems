    "message_1": "What is the probability of a ransomware cyber attack occurring on a network of 500 computers, given that the historical data suggests that there is a 12% chance of a ransomware attack on any given computer in the network?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement probability is the probability of an event not occurring, which in this case would be the probability of no ransomware attack occurring on any of the 500 computers.\n\nThe probability of a ransomware attack not occurring on a single computer is 1 - 0.12 = 0.88.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of no ransomware attack occurring on all 500 computers. Since the computers are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\nP(No ransomware on all 500 computers) = 0.88^500 ≈ 1.144e-27\n\nNow, we can find the complement of this probability, which is the probability of at least one ransomware attack occurring on the network:\n\nP(At least one ransomware attack) = 1 - P(No ransomware on all 500 computers) = 1 - 1.144e-27 ≈ 1\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware cyber attack occurring on a network of 500 computers is approximately 1, or 100%. This result suggests that it is almost certain that at least one computer in the network will experience a ransomware attack, given the historical data."
