    "message_2": "To find the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set, we can use the given formula:\n\nA = pi/2 - (sqrt(2))/4\n\nNow, we can substitute the values and evaluate the expression:\n\nA = (3.141592653589793)/2 - (1.4142135623730951)/4\n\nA ≈ 1.5707963267948966 - 0.3535533905932738\n\nA ≈ 1.2172429362016228\n\nTherefore, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.217 square units."
