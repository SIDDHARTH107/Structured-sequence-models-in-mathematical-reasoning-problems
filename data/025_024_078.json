    "message_2": "To translate the given equation 2 units to the left and 3 units down, we need to replace x with (x + 2) and y with (y + 3) in the equation.\n\nThe original equation is:\n\n4x^2 + y^2 = 16\n\nReplace x with (x + 2) and y with (y + 3):\n\n4(x + 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 16\n\nNow, expand the equation:\n\n4(x^2 + 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = 16\n\nDistribute the 4:\n\n4x^2 + 16x + 16 + y^2 + 6y + 9 = 16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x^2 + y^2 + 16x + 6y + 25 = 16\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides to set the equation equal to zero:\n\n4x^2 + y^2 + 16x + 6y + 9 = 0\n\nThe translated equation is:\n\n4x^2 + y^2 + 16x + 6y + 9 = 0"
