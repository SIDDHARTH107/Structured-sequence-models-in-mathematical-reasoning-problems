    "message_1": "In a Tragedy of the Commons scenario, six farmers each own a plot of land that can sustain 4 cows per acre. The land can support a total of 24 cows, but if any farmer adds an extra cow, the land is overgrazed and each acre will only support 3 cows. Each farmer wants to maximize their profit by raising as many cows as possible. If each farmer raises one cow, what is the total profit for the group? If one farmer raises an extra cow, what is their individual profit and what is the total profit for the group?",
    "message_2": "If each farmer raises one cow, the total profit for the group can be calculated as follows:\n\nSince there are 6 farmers and each farmer raises 1 cow, there are a total of 6 cows on the land. The land can support 4 cows per acre, so each farmer's plot of land can support 4 cows. Therefore, the total profit for the group is 6 cows.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where one farmer raises an extra cow:\n\nIf one farmer adds an extra cow, there will be a total of 7 cows on the land. However, this causes the land to be overgrazed, and each acre will only support 3 cows. So, the total number of cows the land can support now is 6 farmers * 3 cows per acre = 18 cows.\n\nThe farmer who added the extra cow now has 2 cows, while the other 5 farmers still have 1 cow each. So, the individual profit for the farmer who added the extra cow is 2 cows.\n\nThe total profit for the group in this scenario is the sum of the cows raised by all farmers: 2 cows (for the farmer who added the extra cow) + 5 cows (for the other 5 farmers) = 7 cows."
