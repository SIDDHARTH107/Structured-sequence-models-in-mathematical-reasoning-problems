    "message_2": "To show that the subspaces $W_k$ are $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$-invariant, we need to show that the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ on the elements of $W_k$ results in another element in $W_k$. Let's consider the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ on the basis elements of $W_k$:\n\n1. $x^k$: Under the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$, we have\n$$\nx^k \\mapsto (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta)^k.\n$$\nExpanding this expression using the binomial theorem, we see that each term has the form $x^{k-i}y^i(\\cos^i\\theta\\sin^{k-i}\\theta)$, which is a linear combination of the basis elements of $W_k$.\n\n2. $y^k$: Similarly, we have\n$$\ny^k \\mapsto (x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)^k.\n$$\nExpanding this expression using the binomial theorem, we see that each term has the form $x^{k-i}y^i(\\cos^{k-i}\\theta\\sin^i\\theta)$, which is a linear combination of the basis elements of $W_k$.\n\n3. $xy$: Under the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$, we have\n$$\nxy \\mapsto (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta)(x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta) = x^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - y^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta,\n$$\nwhich is a linear combination of the basis elements of $W_k$.\n\n4. $x^2 - y^2$: Under the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$, we have\n$$\nx^2 - y^2 \\mapsto (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta)^2 - (x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)^2 = (x^2 - y^2)\\cos^2\\theta - 2xy\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta + (x^2 - y^2)\\sin^2\\theta,\n$$\nwhich is a linear combination of the basis elements of $W_k$.\n\nThus, the subspaces $W_k$ are $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$-invariant.\n\nNow, let's consider the coordinate rings $\\mathrm{Sym}^\\bullet W_k$. Since $W_k$ is $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$-invariant, the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ on the elements of $W_k$ induces an action on the coordinate rings $\\mathrm{Sym}^\\bullet W_k$. This action is by rotations, as the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is by rotations.\n\nThe coordinate rings $\\mathrm{Sym}^\\bullet W_k$ are the rings of functions on smooth projective algebraic curves, as they are generated by homogeneous polynomials in two variables. To determine the equations of these algebraic curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we can look at the homogeneous polynomials in the coordinate rings $\\mathrm{Sym}^\\bullet W_k$.\n\nFor $k = 0$, the homogeneous polynomial is $x^2 - y^2$, so the equation of the algebraic curve is $X^2 - Y^2 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\nFor $k = 1$, the homogeneous polynomial is $xy$, so the equation of the algebraic curve is $XY = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\nFor $k = 2$, the homogeneous polynomial is $x^2y^2 - (xy)^2$, so the equation of the algebraic curve is $X^2Y^2 - (XY)^2 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\nThese algebraic curves are all of genus 1, as they are smooth projective curves defined by quadratic equations. Moreover, they are pairwise non-isomorphic, as their equations are distinct."
