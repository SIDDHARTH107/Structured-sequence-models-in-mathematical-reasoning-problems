    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x) over one period, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx) + b_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nWe can find the b_n coefficients using the following formula:\n\nb_n = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/T)]dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\nFor our function, T = 2, so we have:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[-1 to 1] [x * sin(nπx/2)]dx\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nπx/2)dx\ndu = dx, v = (-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-2/nπ) * x * cos(nπx/2) |(-1 to 1) - ∫[-1 to 1] (-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)dx]\n\nb_n = (-1/nπ) * [cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ)] - (2/nπ) * ∫[-1 to 1] cos(nπx/2)dx\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(-nπ) = (-1)^n, their difference is zero:\n\nb_n = -(2/nπ) * ∫[-1 to 1] cos(nπx/2)dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the cosine term:\n\nb_n = -(2/nπ) * [(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) |(-1 to 1)]\n\nb_n = -(2/nπ) * [(2/nπ) * (sin(nπ/2) - sin(-nπ/2))]\n\nb_n = -(4/n^2π^2) * (sin(nπ/2) - (-1)^n * sin(nπ/2))\n\nFor n even, sin(nπ/2) = 0, so b_n = 0.\nFor n odd, sin(nπ/2) = ±1, so b_n = -(4/n^2π^2) * (±2).\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) over one period is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(-1)^((n-1)/2) * (4/n^2π^2) * 2 * sin(nπx/2)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n=1, 3, 5, ...
