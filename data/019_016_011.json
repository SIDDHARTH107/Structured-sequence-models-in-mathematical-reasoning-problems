    "message_2": "The intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nThe union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of elements that belong to either A or B or both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}."
