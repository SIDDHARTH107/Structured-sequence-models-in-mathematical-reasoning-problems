    "message_2": "To perform a one-way ANOVA, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each group.\n2. Calculate the overall mean.\n3. Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB) and the sum of squares within groups (SSW).\n4. Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and the mean square within groups (MSW).\n5. Calculate the F-statistic.\n6. Determine the critical F-value from the F-distribution table.\n7. Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean plant growth among the three fertilizers.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of each group\n- Fertilizer A: (12 + 10 + 8 + 13 + 11) / 5 = 54 / 5 = 10.8\n- Fertilizer B: (15 + 17 + 11 + 14 + 13) / 5 = 70 / 5 = 14\n- Fertilizer C: (9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 8) / 5 = 50 / 5 = 10\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean\n(54 + 70 + 50) / 15 = 174 / 15 = 11.6\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB) and the sum of squares within groups (SSW)\nSSB = Σn_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2\nSSB = 5 * (10.8 - 11.6)^2 + 5 * (14 - 11.6)^2 + 5 * (10 - 11.6)^2\nSSB = 5 * (0.8)^2 + 5 * (2.4)^2 + 5 * (-1.6)^2\nSSB = 5 * 0.64 + 5 * 5.76 + 5 * 2.56\nSSB = 3.2 + 28.8 + 12.8\nSSB = 44.8\n\nSSW = Σ(sum of squares within each group)\nFor Fertilizer A: Σ(12-10.8)^2 + (10-10.8)^2 + (8-10.8)^2 + (13-10.8)^2 + (11-10.8)^2 = 1.44 + 0.64 + 7.84 + 4.84 + 0.04 = 14.8\nFor Fertilizer B: Σ(15-14)^2 + (17-14)^2 + (11-14)^2 + (14-14)^2 + (13-14)^2 = 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 + 1 = 20\nFor Fertilizer C: Σ(9-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (11-10)^2 + (12-10)^2 + (8-10)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10\nSSW = 14.8 + 20 + 10 = 44.8\n\nStep 4: Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and the mean square within groups (MSW)\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1), where k is the number of groups\nMSB = 44.8 / (3 - 1) = 44.8 / 2 = 22.4\n\nMSW = SSW / (N - k), where N is the total number of observations\nMSW = 44.8 / (15 - 3) = 44.8 / 12 = 3.733\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic\nF = MSB / MSW = 22.4 / 3.733 = 6\n\nStep 6: Determine the critical F-value from the F-distribution table\nUsing the F-distribution table with a 5% significance level, df1 = k - 1 = 2, and df2 = N - k = 12, we find the critical F-value to be approximately 3.89.\n\nStep 7: Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value\nSince the F-statistic (6) is greater than the critical F-value (3.89), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in the mean plant growth among the three fertilizers at a 5% significance level."
