    "message_2": "A topology on a set X is a collection of subsets of X, called open sets, that satisfy the following three conditions:\n\n1. The empty set and the set X itself are open sets.\n2. The intersection of any finite number of open sets is an open set.\n3. The union of any collection of open sets is an open set.\n\nThe discrete topology on X is the topology where every subset of X is considered an open set. In this case, X = {1,2,3,4,5}, so the discrete topology consists of all possible subsets of X, which are:\n\n{},{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{1,5},{2,3},{2,4},{2,5},{3,4},{3,5},{4,5},{1,2,3},{1,2,4},{1,2,5},{1,3,4},{1,3,5},{1,4,5},{2,3,4},{2,3,5},{2,4,5},{3,4,5},{1,2,3,4},{1,2,3,5},{1,2,4,5},{1,3,4,5},{2,3,4,5},{1,2,3,4,5}\n\nThere are other possible topologies on X as well. The minimal topology on X, called the trivial or indiscrete topology, contains only the empty set and X itself:\n\n{},{1,2,3,4,5}\n\nThere are also many other topologies on X that are neither discrete nor trivial. Some examples include:\n\n1. The topology generated by the basis {{1,2},{3,4,5}}:\n\n{},{1,2},{3,4,5},{1,2,3,4,5}\n\n2. The topology generated by the basis {{1},{2,3},{4,5}}:\n\n{},{1},{2,3},{4,5},{1,2,3},{1,4,5},{1,2,3,4,5}\n\n3. The topology generated by the basis {{1,2,3},{3,4,5}}:\n\n{},{1,2,3},{3,4,5},{1,2,3,4,5}\n\nIn general, there are 2^(2^5) = 2^32 possible collections of subsets of X, but not all of these collections will satisfy the axioms of a topology. The number of distinct topologies on a set with 5 elements is 173, which includes the discrete, trivial, and other topologies mentioned above."
