    "message_1": "In a communication system, the probability of a certain type of technological failure occurring is 0.05. If there are 100 similar communication systems in use, what is the probability that at least one of them will experience this type of technological failure?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that at least one system will experience a failure, we can find the probability that none of the systems will experience a failure and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single system does not experience a failure is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor 100 independent systems, the probability that none of them experience a failure is the product of the individual probabilities, which is (0.95)^100.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability that at least one system will experience a failure:\n\nP(at least one failure) = 1 - P(no failures)\nP(at least one failure) = 1 - (0.95)^100\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nP(at least one failure) ≈ 1 - 0.00657\nP(at least one failure) ≈ 0.99343\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 100 communication systems will experience a technological failure is approximately 0.99343 or 99.343%."
