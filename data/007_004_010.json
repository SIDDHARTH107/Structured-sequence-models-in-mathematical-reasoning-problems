    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 54 and 24 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by listing the factors of each number and finding the largest common factor.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder: 54 รท 24 = 2 remainder 6\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (6): 24 รท 6 = 4 remainder 0\n3. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6.\n\nSo, the GCD of 54 and 24 is 6."
