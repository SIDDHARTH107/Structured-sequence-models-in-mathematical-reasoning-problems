    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to write a numerical problem related to deontic logic since it deals with moral and ethical reasoning rather than mathematical calculations. Deontic logic is concerned with concepts such as obligation, permission, prohibition, and moral norms that cannot be quantified or reduced to numbers. However, if you provide me with more details about the specific area of deontic logic you would like the math student to explore, I can help you formulate a more appropriate question or task.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a problem related to deontic logic. While it is true that deontic logic cannot be directly translated into numerical problems, we can still create a problem that involves logical reasoning and critical thinking, which are skills that mathematicians often possess.\n\nHere's a problem that involves logical reasoning and is related to deontic logic:\n\nConsider a small town with three types of professionals: doctors, lawyers, and engineers. The town has a set of rules that dictate the relationships between these professionals:\n\n1. A doctor must always consult a lawyer before making a decision.\n2. An engineer must always consult a doctor before making a decision.\n3. A lawyer must never consult an engineer before making a decision.\n\nNow, imagine that a new project is being proposed in the town, and each professional must make a decision regarding the project. Based on the rules above, determine the order in which the professionals must consult each other to make their decisions.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. The engineer consults the doctor (Rule 2).\n2. The doctor consults the lawyer (Rule 1).\n3. The lawyer makes a decision without consulting the engineer (Rule 3).\n\nSo, the order of consultation is: Engineer → Doctor → Lawyer."
