    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence of functions (f_n) converges uniformly on X, we need to find the pointwise limit of the sequence and then check if the convergence is uniform.\n\nFirst, let's find the pointwise limit of the sequence:\n\nFor each x in X, we have:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) f_n(x) = lim (n -> ∞) (1 - 1/n) * x\n\nAs n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the limit becomes:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) (1 - 1/n) * x = 1 * x = x\n\nSo, the pointwise limit of the sequence (f_n) is the identity function f(x) = x.\n\nNow, let's check if the convergence is uniform. For uniform convergence, we need to show that for any ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N and for all x in X, we have:\n\n|f_n(x) - f(x)| < ε\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n|f_n(x) - f(x)| = |(1 - 1/n) * x - x|\n\n= |x - x/n|\n\nNow, let's find an N such that the above expression is less than ε for all x in X and n ≥ N:\n\n|x - x/n| < ε\n\nSince x is in the interval [-1, 1], we have |x| ≤ 1. Therefore, we can write:\n\n|x/n| < ε\n\nSince |x| ≤ 1, we have:\n\n1/n < ε\n\nn > 1/ε\n\nSo, we can choose N = ⌈1/ε⌉ (the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1/ε). Then, for all n ≥ N and for all x in X, we have:\n\n|x - x/n| < ε\n\nThus, the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly to the function f(x) = x on the interval X = [-1, 1]."
