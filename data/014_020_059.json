    "message_2": "The index of coincidence (IC) for a Vigenere cipher can be used to estimate the key length. The formula for the IC of a Vigenere cipher is:\n\nIC = (phi * (m - 1) + (1 - phi) * (1 / n)) / m\n\nwhere:\n- IC is the index of coincidence of the ciphertext\n- phi is the average index of coincidence for the plaintext language (for English, it is approximately 0.0667)\n- m is the period of the key (in this case, 5)\n- n is the size of the alphabet (for English, it is 26)\n\nWe are given the IC of the ciphertext (0.0689) and need to find the most likely period of the key (m). We can rearrange the formula to solve for m:\n\nm = ((IC - (1 - phi) * (1 / n)) / phi) + 1\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nm = ((0.0689 - (1 - 0.0667) * (1 / 26)) / 0.0667) + 1\n\nm ≈ 5.03\n\nSince the period of the key must be an integer, we can round the result to the nearest whole number:\n\nm ≈ 5\n\nTherefore, the most likely period of the key is 5."
