    "message_1": "A farmer has a rectangular field with an area of 1000 square meters. The farmer wants to surround the field with a fence on three sides, using a stone wall for one of the long sides and a metal fence for the other two sides. The metal fence costs $5 per meter and the stone wall costs $20 per meter. What are the dimensions of the field that minimize the cost of the fence?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the field be x meters and the width be y meters. The area of the field is given by the equation:\n\nx * y = 1000\n\nWe need to minimize the cost of the fence. The cost of the fence is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 20x + 5y + 5y = 20x + 10y\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function. To do this, we can express y in terms of x using the area equation:\n\ny = 1000/x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the cost equation:\n\nCost = 20x + 10(1000/x)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Cost)/dx = 20 - 10000/x^2 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n10000/x^2 = 20\nx^2 = 10000/20\nx^2 = 500\nx = sqrt(500)\nx ≈ 22.36 meters\n\nNow we can find the corresponding value for y:\n\ny = 1000/x\ny = 1000/22.36\ny ≈ 44.72 meters\n\nSo the dimensions of the field that minimize the cost of the fence are approximately 22.36 meters by 44.72 meters."
