    "message_1": "Here's a Stochastic Optimization problem for a math student:\n\nSuppose a company produces two types of products, A and B, at different manufacturing plants. The company has a limited budget to allocate between the two plants for advertising to increase their production. The advertising cost at Plant 1 is $300 and at Plant 2 is $500. For every $1 spent on advertising, the chance of producing an A product at Plant 1 is 0.05 and at Plant 2 is 0.03, similarly, the chance of producing a B product at Plant 1 is 0.03 and at Plant 2 is 0.04. Assuming the company has a target of producing at least 5 of A products and at least 4 of B products, and the company wants to minimize their overall advertising cost, how should they allocate their budget between the two plants? \n\nWhat is the expected minimum cost of advertising?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount spent on advertising at Plant 1 and y be the amount spent on advertising at Plant 2. We need to find the values of x and y that minimize the total advertising cost while meeting the production targets.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. The probability of producing at least 5 A products: 0.05x + 0.03y >= 5\n2. The probability of producing at least 4 B products: 0.03x + 0.04y >= 4\n\nWe want to minimize the total advertising cost: C = 300x + 500y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraints for y:\n\n1. y >= (5 - 0.05x) / 0.03\n2. y >= (4 - 0.03x) / 0.04\n\nNow, we'll graph these inequalities and find the feasible region. The feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. In this case, the feasible region is the area above both lines.\n\nNext, we'll find the minimum cost within the feasible region. To do this, we'll look for the point where the objective function (C = 300x + 500y) has the lowest value within the feasible region.\n\nUsing a graphical method or linear programming, we find that the minimum cost occurs at the point (x, y) = (60, 40). This means that the company should spend $60 on advertising at Plant 1 and $40 on advertising at Plant 2.\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the expected minimum cost of advertising:\n\nC = 300(60) + 500(40) = 18,000 + 20,000 = $38,000\n\nSo, the expected minimum cost of advertising is $38,000."
