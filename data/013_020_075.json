    "message_1": "Suppose in a Beauty Contest Game, there are 100 participants, and each participant is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the participant whose chosen number is closest to (2/3) times the average of all chosen numbers. If there is a tie, the winner is chosen randomly from among the tied participants. What number should a participant choose to maximize their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the chances of winning, a participant should try to guess what the average of all chosen numbers will be and then choose a number that is 2/3 of that average. Since the participants can choose any number between 0 and 100, we can assume that the average will be around 50. However, since all participants are trying to choose a number that is 2/3 of the average, the actual average will be lower than 50.\n\nLet's assume that all participants are rational and they all think that the average will be around 50. In this case, they would choose a number close to (2/3) * 50 = 33.33. However, if all participants choose a number around 33.33, the actual average will be around 33.33. Therefore, a rational participant should choose a number that is 2/3 of 33.33, which is approximately 22.22.\n\nHowever, this reasoning can be applied iteratively, and participants may keep adjusting their guesses. In practice, the best strategy would be to choose a number slightly lower than 22.22, as the average is likely to be lower than the initial estimate due to the iterative reasoning of the participants.\n\nIn conclusion, a participant should choose a number slightly lower than 22.22 to maximize their chances of winning the Beauty Contest Game."
