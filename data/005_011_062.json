She divided her class into two groups: Group A received traditional teaching and Group B received problem-based teaching. She gave both groups the same exam and recorded their scores. The scores were:\n\nGroup A: 85, 92, 78, 90, 88\nGroup B: 92, 94, 88, 89, 82\n\nCalculate the mean, median and mode of scores for each group and determine which teaching method resulted in higher exam scores.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the mean, median, and mode for each group.\n\nGroup A:\nMean: (85 + 92 + 78 + 90 + 88) / 5 = 433 / 5 = 86.6\nTo find the median, we need to order the scores from lowest to highest: 78, 85, 88, 90, 92\nMedian: 88 (the middle score)\nMode: There is no mode, as no score appears more than once.\n\nGroup B:\nMean: (92 + 94 + 88 + 89 + 82) / 5 = 445 / 5 = 89\nTo find the median, we need to order the scores from lowest to highest: 82, 88, 89, 92, 94\nMedian: 89 (the middle score)\nMode: There is no mode, as no score appears more than once.\n\nComparing the two groups:\nGroup A: Mean = 86.6, Median = 88, No mode\nGroup B: Mean = 89, Median = 89, No mode\n\nBased on the mean and median scores, Group B (problem-based teaching) resulted in higher exam scores than Group A (traditional teaching)."
