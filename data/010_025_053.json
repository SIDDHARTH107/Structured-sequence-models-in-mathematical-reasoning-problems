    "message_1": "Consider a two-dimensional surface with a hole, such as a torus. Suppose we have a topological quantum field theory that associates a vector space $V$ to each closed one-dimensional curve on this surface, and a linear operator $\\mathcal{T}(C_1,C_2)$ to each pair of one-dimensional curves $C_1$ and $C_2$. Suppose further that $\\mathcal{T}(C_1,C_2) = \\mathcal{T}(C_2,C_1)$ for all pairs of curves.\n\nSuppose we draw a pair of closed one-dimensional curves $A$ and $B$ on the torus as shown in the figure below:\n\n![torus with two curls](https://i.imgur.com/wSU9rrG.png \"Torus with two curls\")\n\nFind the dimension of the vector space $V$ associated to $A$ and the linear operator $\\mathcal{T}(A,B)$ associated to the curves $A$ and $B$ on this torus.",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the vector space $V$ associated with curve $A$, we need more information about the topological quantum field theory. The dimension of $V$ depends on the specific theory being considered. However, we can still discuss the linear operator $\\mathcal{T}(A,B)$ associated with the curves $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{T}(C_1,C_2) = \\mathcal{T}(C_2,C_1)$ for all pairs of curves, we know that $\\mathcal{T}(A,B) = \\mathcal{T}(B,A)$. This means that the linear operator is symmetric with respect to the curves $A$ and $B$. However, without more information about the topological quantum field theory, we cannot determine the explicit form of the linear operator $\\mathcal{T}(A,B)$."
