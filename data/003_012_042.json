    "message_1": "A student is standing 100 meters away from a cliff. The angle of elevation to the top of the cliff is 30 degrees. What is the height of the cliff?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the cliff, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the cliff (100 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the cliff (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 100\n\nThe tangent of 30 degrees is equal to 1/sqrt(3) or sqrt(3)/3. So,\n\nsqrt(3)/3 = height / 100\n\nTo solve for the height, multiply both sides by 100:\n\nheight = 100 * (sqrt(3)/3)\n\nheight ≈ 57.74 meters\n\nThe height of the cliff is approximately 57.74 meters."
