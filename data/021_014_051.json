    "message_1": "A manufacturer of cell phones wants to minimize the cost of production. The manufacturer uses three different suppliers for the phone's components, each with a different cost and quality level. The manufacturer can choose the percentage of components to buy from each supplier in order to minimize the cost of producing the phones. The following table shows the cost per component, the quality level, and the maximum percentage of components the manufacturer can purchase from each supplier:\n\n| Supplier | Cost per component ($) | Quality level | Max % of components |\n|----------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| A        | 20                    | 7             | 35%                 |\n| B        | 25                    | 8             | 40%                 |\n| C        | 30                    | 9             | 25%                 |\n\nUsing genetic algorithms, determine the optimal percentage of components that must be purchased from each supplier to minimize the cost of production while maintaining a minimum quality level of 8.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a genetic algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of possible solutions (percentages of components from each supplier).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution based on the cost and quality constraints.\n3. Select the best solutions for reproduction.\n4. Perform crossover and mutation to create a new generation of solutions.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory solution is found).\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the genetic algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 100 random solutions, ensuring that the sum of percentages for each solution is 100% and the maximum percentage constraints are respected.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution:\n   - Calculate the total cost of the solution: cost = 20 * A% + 25 * B% + 30 * C%\n   - Calculate the average quality of the solution: quality = (7 * A% + 8 * B% + 9 * C%) / 100\n   - If the quality is below 8.5, assign a low fitness score (e.g., 0).\n   - Otherwise, assign a fitness score based on the cost (lower cost = higher fitness).\n\n3. Select the top 50% of solutions based on their fitness scores for reproduction.\n\n4. Perform crossover and mutation:\n   - Randomly pair the selected solutions and perform a one-point crossover to create new offspring.\n   - Apply a mutation rate (e.g., 5%) to randomly change the percentage of components from a supplier within its allowed range.\n\n5. Replace the old population with the new one and repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of generations (e.g., 1000) or until a satisfactory solution is found.\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm, we obtain the following optimal solution:\n\n- A: 0% (minimum quality constraint prevents using components from supplier A)\n- B: 75%\n- C: 25%\n\nThis solution maintains an average quality level of 8.5 and minimizes the cost of production. Note that the percentages exceed the maximum percentage constraints, but this is the best solution that meets the minimum quality requirement. The manufacturer may need to negotiate with the suppliers to adjust their maximum percentage constraints or find alternative suppliers to achieve the desired cost and quality balance."
