    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 1177, we can start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 1177 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3.\n\n1177 รท 3 = 392.333... (not a whole number)\n\nThe next smallest prime number is 5.\n\n1177 รท 5 = 235.4 (not a whole number)\n\nThe next smallest prime number is 7.\n\n1177 รท 7 = 168 (whole number)\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime factor of 1177 is 7."
