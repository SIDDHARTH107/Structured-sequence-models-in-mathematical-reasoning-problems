    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it's not possible to write a numerical problem for the topic of paraconsistent logic since this field deals with non-classical logics that allow for contradictions to exist without leading to logical inconsistency. It does not involve numerical calculations or equations. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to formulate a conceptual problem or question related to paraconsistent logic.",
    "message_2": "That's correct. Paraconsistent logic is not a numerical field, so let's consider a conceptual problem instead.\n\nProblem: In a paraconsistent logic system, we have the following premises:\n\n1. A → B (If A, then B)\n2. A → ¬B (If A, then not B)\n3. A (A is true)\n\nUsing paraconsistent logic, determine if we can derive a conclusion from these premises without leading to logical inconsistency."
