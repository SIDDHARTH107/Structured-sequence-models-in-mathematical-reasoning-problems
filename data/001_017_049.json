    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Since the logarithms on the left side of the equation have the same base and are being added, we can combine them using the product rule for logarithms:\n\nlog(x + 3) + log(2x - 1) = log((x + 3)(2x - 1))\n\nNow, we can set the argument of the logarithms equal to each other, since the logarithms are equal:\n\n(x + 3)(2x - 1) = 36\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n2x^2 - x + 6x - 3 = 36\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 36\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n2x^2 + 5x - 39 = 0\n\nNow, we can attempt to factor the quadratic equation, but it does not factor easily. Instead, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -39. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4(2)(-39))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 312)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √337) / 4\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are:\n\nx = (-5 + √337) / 4 and x = (-5 - √337) / 4\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid, as logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. \n\nFor the first solution, x = (-5 + √337) / 4:\n\nx + 3 > 0 => (-5 + √337) / 4 + 3 > 0 => √337 > 7 => 337 > 49, which is true.\n\n2x - 1 > 0 => 2((-5 + √337) / 4) - 1 > 0 => (-5 + √337) / 2 - 1 > 0 => √337 > 6 => 337 > 36, which is also true.\n\nTherefore, the first solution x = (-5 + √337) / 4 is valid.\n\nFor the second solution, x = (-5 - √337) / 4:\n\nx + 3 > 0 => (-5 - √337) / 4 + 3 > 0, which is false since adding a positive number to a negative number will not make it positive.\n\nTherefore, the second solution x = (-5 - √337) / 4 is not valid.\n\nSo, the only valid solution for the given logarithmic equation is:\n\nx = (-5 + √337) / 4"
