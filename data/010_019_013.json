    "message_2": "Since X is a finite set, we can order its elements as (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n). Let ε > 0 be given. Since f is continuous on X, for each point (x_i, y_i) in X, there exists a δ_i > 0 such that for any point (x, y) in X with dist((x, y), (x_i, y_i)) < δ_i, we have |f(x, y) - f(x_i, y_i)| < ε/2.\n\nNow, let δ = min{δ_1, δ_2, ..., δ_n}. Since X is finite, δ > 0. Define a function f_n : X → R as follows:\n\nf_n(x, y) = f(x_i, y_i) + (f(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) - f(x_i, y_i)) * (dist((x, y), (x_i, y_i)) / dist((x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}), (x_i, y_i)))\n\nfor (x, y) in X such that dist((x, y), (x_i, y_i)) ≤ dist((x, y), (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})) for i = 1, 2, ..., n-1, and f_n(x_n, y_n) = f(x_n, y_n).\n\nWe can see that f_n is piecewise linear with respect to the distance function, and its graph consists of straight line segments connecting adjacent points in X. Moreover, f_n has finitely many linear pieces, since X is finite.\n\nNow, we show that f_n and f agree on some dense subset of X. For each point (x_i, y_i) in X, we have f_n(x_i, y_i) = f(x_i, y_i). Thus, f_n and f agree on X, which is a dense subset of itself.\n\nFinally, we show that the L∞-norm of f - f_n is less than ε. Let (x, y) be any point in X. Without loss of generality, assume that dist((x, y), (x_i, y_i)) ≤ dist((x, y), (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})) for some i. Then, we have:\n\n|f(x, y) - f_n(x, y)| = |f(x, y) - f(x_i, y_i) - (f(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) - f(x_i, y_i)) * (dist((x, y), (x_i, y_i)) / dist((x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}), (x_i, y_i)))|\n\nSince dist((x, y), (x_i, y_i)) < δ ≤ δ_i, we have |f(x, y) - f(x_i, y_i)| < ε/2. Moreover, |f(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) - f(x_i, y_i)| ≤ ε/2, since dist((x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}), (x_i, y_i)) < δ ≤ δ_i. Therefore, we have:\n\n|f(x, y) - f_n(x, y)| < ε/2 + ε/2 = ε\n\nThus, the L∞-norm of f - f_n is less than ε. This completes the proof."
