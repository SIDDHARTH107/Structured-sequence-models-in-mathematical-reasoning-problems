    "message_2": "To calculate the simple moving average (SMA) for a window size of 3, we will take the average of every 3 consecutive data points in the given dataset. Here's the calculation:\n\n1. (85 + 78 + 81) / 3 = 244 / 3 = 81.33\n2. (78 + 81 + 73) / 3 = 232 / 3 = 77.33\n3. (81 + 73 + 67) / 3 = 221 / 3 = 73.67\n4. (73 + 67 + 60) / 3 = 200 / 3 = 66.67\n5. (67 + 60 + 55) / 3 = 182 / 3 = 60.67\n6. (60 + 55 + 69) / 3 = 184 / 3 = 61.33\n7. (55 + 69 + 72) / 3 = 196 / 3 = 65.33\n8. (69 + 72 + 80) / 3 = 221 / 3 = 73.67\n9. (72 + 80 + 79) / 3 = 231 / 3 = 77\n10. (80 + 79 + 88) / 3 = 247 / 3 = 82.33\n\nThe simple moving averages for a window size of 3 are:\n\n81.33, 77.33, 73.67, 66.67, 60.67, 61.33, 65.33, 73.67, 77, 82.33\n\nInterpretation:\n\nThe simple moving average smoothens the original data, which helps in identifying trends in the data. In this case, we can observe that the rainfall decreases from the beginning of the year until around the middle of the year, then starts to increase again. The moving average helps to remove some of the noise in the data and makes it easier to identify patterns and trends."
