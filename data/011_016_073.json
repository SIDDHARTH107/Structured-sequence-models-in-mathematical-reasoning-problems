    "message_1": "How many ways can a committee of 4 people be chosen from a group of 10 people if there must be exactly 2 men and 2 women on the committee, assuming gender is the only characteristic being considered?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know how many men and women are in the group of 10 people. Let's assume there are M men and W women in the group, with M + W = 10.\n\nWe need to choose 2 men from M and 2 women from W. We can use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFor choosing 2 men from M, the formula would be:\n\nC(M, 2) = M! / (2!(M-2)!)\n\nFor choosing 2 women from W, the formula would be:\n\nC(W, 2) = W! / (2!(W-2)!)\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 men and 2 women:\n\nTotal ways = C(M, 2) * C(W, 2)\n\nHowever, since we don't have the exact values of M and W, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. If you provide the number of men and women in the group, we can calculate the total ways to form the committee."
