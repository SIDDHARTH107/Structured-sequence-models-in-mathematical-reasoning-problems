    "message_2": "The given function is f(t) = 2cos(3πt) + 3sin(7πt). To find the frequency content of this signal after applying the Fourier transform, we can analyze the function in terms of its sinusoidal components.\n\nThe first term, 2cos(3πt), has an amplitude of 2 and a frequency of (3π)/2π = 3/2 Hz. The second term, 3sin(7πt), has an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of (7π)/2π = 7/2 Hz.\n\nAfter applying the Fourier transform, the frequency content of the signal will have two distinct frequencies with their associated amplitudes:\n\n1. Frequency: 3/2 Hz, Amplitude: 2\n2. Frequency: 7/2 Hz, Amplitude: 3"
