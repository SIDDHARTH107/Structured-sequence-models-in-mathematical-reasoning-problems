    "message_1": "A student flips a fair coin 20 times. What is the probability that:\n\na) The student gets exactly 10 heads?\nb) The student gets at least 15 tails?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the probability of getting exactly 10 heads in 20 flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), and q is the probability of failure (1 - p = 0.5).\n\nFor this problem, n = 20, k = 10, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we need to find the binomial coefficient (nCk), which is the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nnC10 = 20! / (10! * 10!)\n\nnC10 = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11) / (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nnC10 = 184756\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = 184756 * (0.5^10) * (0.5^10)\n\nP(X = 10) = 184756 * (9.5367431640625e-7) * (9.5367431640625e-7)\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.176197\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 10 heads is approximately 0.176 or 17.6%.\n\nb) To find the probability of getting at least 15 tails, we can find the probabilities of getting 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 tails and then add them together.\n\nLet's use the same binomial probability formula as before, but this time, we'll consider tails as successful outcomes (k).\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = P(X = 15) + P(X = 16) + P(X = 17) + P(X = 18) + P(X = 19) + P(X = 20)\n\nWe'll calculate each probability separately and then add them together:\n\nP(X = 15) = (20C15) * (0.5^15) * (0.5^5) ≈ 0.01478\nP(X = 16) = (20C16) * (0.5^16) * (0.5^4) ≈ 0.00462\nP(X = 17) = (20C17) * (0.5^17) * (0.5^3) ≈ 0.00115\nP(X = 18) = (20C18) * (0.5^18) * (0.5^2) ≈ 0.00019\nP(X = 19) = (20C19) * (0.5^19) * (0.5^1) ≈ 0.00002\nP(X = 20) = (20C20) * (0.5^20) * (0.5^0) ≈ 0.000001\n\nNow, we add these probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) ≈ 0.01478 + 0.00462 + 0.00115 + 0.00019 + 0.00002 + 0.000001\n\nP(X ≥ 15) ≈ 0.02076\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 15 tails is approximately 0.0208 or 2.08%."
