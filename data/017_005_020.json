    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that n_3 divides the order of G and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is H. Since H is a subgroup of G and has the same order as G, we have H = G. Thus, G is a p-group of order 3^3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either a cyclic group of order 27 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let H_1, H_2, and H_3 be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups is trivial, the order of the product of any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups is 9. Let K = H_1H_2. Then K is a subgroup of G with order 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, K is either a cyclic group of order 9 or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. In either case, K is a normal subgroup of G since it has index 3 in G, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G.\n\nNow consider the quotient group G/K. Since the order of G is 27 and the order of K is 9, the order of G/K is 3. Thus, G/K is a cyclic group of order 3. By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a subgroup L of G such that L/K is isomorphic to G/K. Since G/K is a cyclic group of order 3, L has order 9. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either a cyclic group or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
