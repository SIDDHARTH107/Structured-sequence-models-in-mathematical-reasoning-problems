Let $\\mathcal{M} = \\langle \\mathbb{Z}, +^\\mathcal{M}, \\times^\\mathcal{M}, <^\\mathcal{M}\\rangle$ be an L-structure where +$^\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\times^\\mathcal{M}$ are the standard addition and multiplication operations on the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, and $<^\\mathcal{M}$ is the standard less-than relation on $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\\varphi(x)$ be the formula $x\\times x = 2$.\n\nWhat is the truth value of $\\varphi$ in $\\mathcal{M}$?",
    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the formula $\\varphi(x)$ in the L-structure $\\mathcal{M}$, we need to check if there exists an integer $x$ such that $x \\times x = 2$.\n\nHowever, there is no integer $x$ that satisfies this equation. The closest integers are 1 and -1, but their squares are 1 and 1, respectively. The next closest integers are 2 and -2, but their squares are 4 and 4, respectively.\n\nSince there is no integer $x$ that satisfies the formula $\\varphi(x)$, the truth value of $\\varphi$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ is false."
