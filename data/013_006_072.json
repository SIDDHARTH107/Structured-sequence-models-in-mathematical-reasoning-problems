    "message_1": "A group of 4 friends are on a hunting trip and have to choose between hunting a stag or a hare. They will only be successful if they all hunt the same animal. The payoff matrix for the stag hunt game is: \n\n                        Stag                      Hare \n          Stag          500, 500                50, 200\n          \n          Hare          200, 50                   100, 100\n          \nWhat is the best strategy for the friends to follow in order to maximize their chances of success?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, the best strategy for the friends to maximize their chances of success is to cooperate and all choose to hunt the stag. If all four friends hunt the stag, they will each receive a payoff of 500, which is the highest possible payoff in the matrix. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this strategy relies on trust and communication among the friends. If any of them deviate from the plan and choose to hunt the hare, the payoff for the group will be lower. To ensure the best outcome, the friends should agree on hunting the stag and stick to that decision."
