    "message_1": "In a game of chance, a player rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5?",
    "message_2": "A fair six-sided die has 6 equally likely outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Rolling a 3 or a 5 are two of these outcomes. The probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 is the ratio of the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 5) to the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, there are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 5) and 6 total possible outcomes.\n\nProbability = 2/6\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nProbability = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 on a fair six-sided die is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (33.33%)."
