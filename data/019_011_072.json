    "message_2": "To determine if the statement \"If x is an element of A, then x is an element of B\" is true or false using relevance logic, we need to examine the elements of sets A and B.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in A is also an element in B:\n\n1 ∈ A, but 1 ∉ B\n2 ∈ A, and 2 ∈ B\n3 ∈ A, but 3 ∉ B\n4 ∈ A, and 4 ∈ B\n5 ∈ A, but 5 ∉ B\n\nSince not all elements of A are elements of B, the statement \"If x is an element of A, then x is an element of B\" is false using relevance logic."
