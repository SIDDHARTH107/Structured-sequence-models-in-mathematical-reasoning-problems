    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, we know that |G| = 3^3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Thus, the possible orders of H are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since H is not equal to {e} (order 1) and G (order 27), the order of H must be either 3 or 9.\n\nNow, let's show that H is normal in G if and only if H is cyclic.\n\n(⇒) Suppose H is normal in G. Then, by the Fundamental Theorem of Group Theory, we know that the quotient group G/H is well-defined. Since |G| = 27 and |H| divides |G|, the possible orders of H are 3 or 9. If |H| = 3, then |G/H| = 9, and since 9 = 3^2, G/H is a cyclic group. This implies that G is a semi-direct product of H and G/H. However, since G has order 27, which is a prime power, G must be a direct product of H and G/H, which means that H is a normal cyclic subgroup of G.\n\nIf |H| = 9, then |G/H| = 3, which is a prime number, so G/H is a cyclic group. This implies that G is a semi-direct product of H and G/H. However, since G has order 27, which is a prime power, G must be a direct product of H and G/H, which means that H is a normal cyclic subgroup of G.\n\n(⇐) Suppose H is cyclic. If |H| = 3, then H is a subgroup of G of index 9. By the Normal Subgroup Index Theorem, any subgroup of index 9 in G must be normal. Therefore, H is normal in G.\n\nIf |H| = 9, then H is a subgroup of G of index 3. By the Normal Subgroup Index Theorem, any subgroup of index 3 in G must be normal. Therefore, H is normal in G.\n\nIn conclusion, H is normal in G if and only if H is cyclic. The possible orders of H are 3 or 9."
