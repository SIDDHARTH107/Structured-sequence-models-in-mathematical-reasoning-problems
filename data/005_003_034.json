    "message_2": "To calculate the expected score of a student who studies for 5 hours, we can plug the value of x (number of hours studied) into the regression equation:\n\ny = 0.7x + 21.2\n\nReplace x with 5:\n\ny = 0.7(5) + 21.2\n\nNow, perform the calculations:\n\ny = 3.5 + 21.2\n\ny = 24.7\n\nThe expected score of a student who studies for 5 hours is 24.7."
