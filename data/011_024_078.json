    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of goods that can be transported per day from city A to city G, we need to find the maximum flow through the network. We can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow.\n\nHere are the possible paths from city A to city G and their capacities:\n\n1. A -> B -> D -> G: min(13, 5, 8) = 5\n2. A -> B -> E -> F -> G: min(13, 8, 9, 14) = 8\n3. A -> C -> D -> G: min(10, 14, 8) = 8\n4. A -> C -> F -> G: min(10, 20, 14) = 10\n\nNow, we will find the maximum flow by adding the minimum capacities of each path:\n\nMaximum flow = 5 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 31\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of goods that can be transported per day from city A to city G is 31."
