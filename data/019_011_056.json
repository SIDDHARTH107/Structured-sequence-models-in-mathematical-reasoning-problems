    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem from Relevance Logic:\n\nSuppose P and Q are propositions, where P is false and Q is true. What is the truth value of (P ⊕ Q) → P?\n\nA) True \nB) False \nC) Cannot be determined \n\nIn this case, ⊕ represents the exclusive or logical operation, meaning that it is true when one proposition is true and the other is false.",
    "message_2": "Given that P is false and Q is true, we can evaluate the expression (P ⊕ Q) → P as follows:\n\n1. (P ⊕ Q) is true, since P is false and Q is true (exclusive or is true when one proposition is true and the other is false).\n\n2. Now we have (True) → P, which means \"if True, then P.\"\n\n3. Since P is false, the expression (True) → P is false (a true statement cannot imply a false one).\n\nSo, the truth value of (P ⊕ Q) → P is False, which corresponds to option B) False."
