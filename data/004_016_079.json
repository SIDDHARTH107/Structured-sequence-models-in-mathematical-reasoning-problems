    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) represent the position of the car at time t, where t is in hours and 0 ≤ t ≤ 10. Since the car travels a total distance of 500 miles during the 10-hour journey, we have:\n\nf(10) - f(0) = 500 miles\n\nThe average speed of the car during the journey is:\n\n(500 miles) / (10 hours) = 50 miles per hour\n\nNow, we want to show that at some point during the trip, the car was traveling at exactly 50 miles per hour. In other words, we want to show that there exists a time c in the interval (0, 10) such that the instantaneous speed of the car at time c is equal to the average speed of the car during the journey.\n\nSince the car is moving continuously during the journey, the function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 10]. Moreover, since the car's speed can change smoothly during the journey, the function f(t) is differentiable on the open interval (0, 10).\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 10) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(10) - f(0)) / (10 - 0)\n\nf'(c) represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time c. Plugging in the values we have:\n\nf'(c) = (500 miles) / (10 hours)\n\nf'(c) = 50 miles per hour\n\nSo, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a time c during the trip when the car was traveling at exactly 50 miles per hour."
