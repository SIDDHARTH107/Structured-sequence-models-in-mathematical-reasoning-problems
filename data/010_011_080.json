    "message_2": "Let M be a compact connected 2-dimensional manifold without boundary, and suppose its first homology group H1(M;Z) is isomorphic to Z. We want to determine the number of connected double covers of M (up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms).\n\nFirst, let's recall some facts about 2-dimensional manifolds and their classification. A compact connected 2-dimensional manifold without boundary is either a sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of projective planes. Since H1(M;Z) is isomorphic to Z, M cannot be a sphere or a connected sum of projective planes, as their first homology groups are trivial. Thus, M must be a torus.\n\nNow, let's consider double covers of M. A double cover is a 2-fold covering space, which means that there is a continuous map p: N -> M such that every point in M has exactly two pre-images in N. We want to determine the number of connected double covers of M up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms.\n\nFor a torus, there are three possible connected double covers up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms:\n\n1. The two-sheeted orientable cover: This is the torus itself, with the covering map being the identity map. The first homology group of this cover is also isomorphic to Z.\n\n2. The two-sheeted non-orientable cover: This is the Klein bottle. The first homology group of this cover is isomorphic to Z ⊕ Z/2Z.\n\n3. The four-sheeted orientable cover: This is the connected sum of two tori. The first homology group of this cover is isomorphic to Z ⊕ Z.\n\nSince we are considering connected double covers, we can rule out the four-sheeted orientable cover. Therefore, there are two connected double covers of M up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms: the two-sheeted orientable cover (the torus itself) and the two-sheeted non-orientable cover (the Klein bottle)."
