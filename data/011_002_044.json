    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value of an element in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n, and C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFor the 10th row and 7th element, we have:\n\nn = 9 (since Pascal's triangle starts with row 0)\nk = 6 (since the first element in each row is at position 0)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(9, 6) = 9! / (6! * (9-6)!)\n\nC(9, 6) = 362880 / (720 * 6)\n\nC(9, 6) = 362880 / 4320\n\nC(9, 6) = 84\n\nSo, the value of the 7th element in the 10th row of Pascal's triangle is 84."
