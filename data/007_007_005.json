    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 10x + 7y = 123, we first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 7, which is 1. Since the GCD(10, 7) = 1, there exists a solution to the equation.\n\nNow, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients that satisfy the equation 10x + 7y = GCD(10, 7).\n\n10 = 1 * 7 + 3\n7 = 2 * 3 + 1\n\nNow, we work our way back up:\n\n1 = 7 - 2 * 3\n1 = 7 - 2 * (10 - 1 * 7)\n1 = 3 * 7 - 2 * 10\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n1 = 3 * 7 - 2 * 10\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the equation by 123:\n\n123 = 3 * 7 * 123 - 2 * 10 * 123\n\nThis gives us:\n\n123 = 861y - 2460x\n\nNow, we have a particular solution (x₀, y₀) = (-123, 123). To find all the integer solutions, we can use the general solution formula for Diophantine equations:\n\nx = x₀ + k * (b / GCD(a, b))\ny = y₀ - k * (a / GCD(a, b))\n\nIn this case, a = 10, b = 7, and GCD(a, b) = 1. So, the general solution is:\n\nx = -123 + 7k\ny = 123 - 10k\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different integer values for k:\n\nk = 0: x = -123, y = 123\nk = 1: x = -116, y = 113\nk = 2: x = -109, y = 103\nk = 3: x = -102, y = 93\nk = 4: x = -95, y = 83\n...\n\nWe can continue this process to find all integer solutions for x and y that satisfy the Diophantine equation 10x + 7y = 123."
