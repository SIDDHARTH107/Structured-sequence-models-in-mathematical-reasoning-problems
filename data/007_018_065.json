    "message_2": "The prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest possible prime gap between two consecutive prime numbers greater than 1 million, we need to find the first pair of prime numbers that are greater than 1 million and have the smallest difference between them.\n\nUsing a prime number generator or algorithm, we find that the first two consecutive prime numbers greater than 1 million are 1,000,003 and 1,000,033. The difference between these two prime numbers is:\n\n1,000,033 - 1,000,003 = 30\n\nSo, the smallest possible value for the prime gap between two consecutive prime numbers greater than 1 million is 30."
