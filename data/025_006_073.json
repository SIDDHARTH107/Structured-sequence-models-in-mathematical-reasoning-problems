    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group H^1(X, ℤ/pℤ), we will use the Čech cohomology. Let {U_i} be an affine open cover of X, such that U_i = Spec(A_i) for some A_i. Since X is a smooth projective curve, we can choose an affine open cover such that the intersection U_i ∩ U_j is also affine.\n\nConsider the Čech complex C^•(X, ℤ/pℤ) associated with the cover {U_i} and the sheaf ℤ/pℤ. The Čech cohomology groups are defined as the cohomology groups of this complex, i.e., H^k(X, ℤ/pℤ) = H^k(C^•(X, ℤ/pℤ)).\n\nThe Čech complex is given by:\n\nC^0(X, ℤ/pℤ) → C^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) → C^2(X, ℤ/pℤ) → ...\n\nwhere C^k(X, ℤ/pℤ) is the group of k-cochains, which are maps from k-fold intersections of the open sets U_i to ℤ/pℤ.\n\nNow, we want to compute H^1(X, ℤ/pℤ). By definition, this is the quotient group:\n\nH^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) = Z^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) / B^1(X, ℤ/pℤ),\n\nwhere Z^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) is the group of 1-cocycles (closed 1-cochains) and B^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) is the group of 1-coboundaries (exact 1-cochains).\n\nSince X is a smooth projective curve, it is connected. Therefore, the global sections of the constant sheaf ℤ/pℤ are just the constant functions, and we have:\n\nC^0(X, ℤ/pℤ) = ℤ/pℤ.\n\nThe group C^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) consists of functions on pairwise intersections U_i ∩ U_j with values in ℤ/pℤ. Since the intersections are affine, we have:\n\nC^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) = ⊕(U_i ∩ U_j) ℤ/pℤ.\n\nNow, we can compute the first cohomology group H^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) using the Čech complex. The first cohomology group is given by the kernel of the differential map d^1: C^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) → C^2(X, ℤ/pℤ) modulo the image of the differential map d^0: C^0(X, ℤ/pℤ) → C^1(X, ℤ/pℤ).\n\nHowever, since X is a smooth projective curve, it is well-known that the higher cohomology groups of the constant sheaf ℤ/pℤ vanish, i.e., H^k(X, ℤ/pℤ) = 0 for k > 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nH^1(X, ℤ/pℤ) = 0."
