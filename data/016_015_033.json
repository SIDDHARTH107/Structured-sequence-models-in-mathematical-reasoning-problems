    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula L = N * S, where L is the length of the curve, N is the number of segments, and S is the length of each segment.\n\nIn each iteration, the number of segments in the Hilbert curve is multiplied by 4. So, for the 5th iteration, the number of segments is:\n\nN = 4^5 = 1024\n\nSince each line segment has a length of 1, the length of the Hilbert curve up to the 5th iteration is:\n\nL = 1024 * 1 = 1024"
