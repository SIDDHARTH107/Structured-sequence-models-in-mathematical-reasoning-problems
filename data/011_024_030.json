The maximum capacities of the roads that connect these locations are: AB - 800 boxes, AC - 500 boxes, BC - 1000 boxes, BD - 1200 boxes, and CD - 800 boxes. Find the maximum number of boxes that can be transported from A to D.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of boxes transported from A to B, and y be the number of boxes transported from A to C. Then, the number of boxes transported from B to D is x, and the number of boxes transported from C to D is y. The total number of boxes transported from A to D is x + y.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 800 (capacity of road AB)\n2. y ≤ 500 (capacity of road AC)\n3. x ≤ 1200 (capacity of road BD)\n4. y ≤ 800 (capacity of road CD)\n\nSince the factory needs to transport 1200 boxes, we have:\n\n5. x + y = 1200\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum possible values for x and y that satisfy all the constraints.\n\nFrom constraint 1, we have x ≤ 800. Since x + y = 1200, we can substitute x = 800 into the equation:\n\n800 + y = 1200\ny = 400\n\nSo, one possible solution is x = 800 and y = 400. This satisfies all the constraints.\n\nNow, let's check if there's a solution with y > 400. From constraint 2, we have y ≤ 500. If y = 500, then:\n\nx + 500 = 1200\nx = 700\n\nThis solution (x = 700, y = 500) also satisfies all the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be transported from A to D is 700 + 500 = 1200."
