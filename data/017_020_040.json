    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C40, D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 40, which can be factored as 2^3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_5 divides 8 and n_5 is congruent to 1 mod 5.\n\nFrom these conditions, we see that n_2 can be 1 or 5, and n_5 can be 1 or 8.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are coprime, their intersection is trivial. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 40. In this case, G is isomorphic to C40.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since P_5 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the order of P_2 is 8, it can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8 or the dihedral group D4. \n\nIf P_2 is isomorphic to C8, then G is an extension of P_5 by P_2, and we can use the semidirect product to construct G. In this case, there are four possible non-abelian groups of order 40, depending on the choice of the action of P_2 on P_5.\n\nIf P_2 is isomorphic to D4, then G is an extension of P_5 by P_2, and we can again use the semidirect product to construct G. In this case, there are four more possible non-abelian groups of order 40, depending on the choice of the action of P_2 on P_5.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 8\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and eight Sylow 5-subgroups. However, this case is not possible because the Sylow 5-subgroups would have a non-trivial intersection, which contradicts the fact that their orders are coprime.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20 (which is one of the eight non-abelian groups when P_2 is isomorphic to D4), or one of the other seven non-abelian groups of order 40, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups and the isomorphism type of the Sylow 2-subgroups."
