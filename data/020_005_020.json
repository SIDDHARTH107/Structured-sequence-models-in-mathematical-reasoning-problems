    "message_1": "A company produces two products, product A and product B. The profit per unit for each item is $15 for A and $20 for B. The production process involves two stages: a machining stage and an assembly stage. Each unit of product A requires 4 hours of machining and 2 hours of assembly, while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of machining and 4 hours of assembly. The machining stage is available for only 200 hours per week while the assembly stage is available for only 160 hours per week. The company wants to maximize the profit subject to the availability of the machines. What is the maximum profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 15x + 20y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n4x + 3y ≤ 200 (machining hours)\n2x + 4y ≤ 160 (assembly hours)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 200\ny ≤ (200 - 4x)/3\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 160\ny ≤ (160 - 2x)/4\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities, along with x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of 4x + 3y = 200 and 2x + 4y = 160:\nx = 20, y = 20\n\n2. Intersection of 4x + 3y = 200 and y = 0:\nx = 50, y = 0\n\n3. Intersection of 2x + 4y = 160 and x = 0:\nx = 0, y = 40\n\n4. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\nx = 0, y = 0\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Profit(20, 20) = 15(20) + 20(20) = 700\n2. Profit(50, 0) = 15(50) + 20(0) = 750\n3. Profit(0, 40) = 15(0) + 20(40) = 800\n4. Profit(0, 0) = 15(0) + 20(0) = 0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 40), with a profit of $800. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 40 units of product B to maximize their profit, which will be $800 per week."
