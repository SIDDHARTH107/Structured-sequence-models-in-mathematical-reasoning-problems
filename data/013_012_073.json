    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem related to Stackelberg Competition:\n\nA company is the leader in a Stackelberg game with two firms. The other firm is a follower. The market demand equation is Q = 240 - 4P. The leader’s total cost function is C(q) = 10q and the follower’s total cost function is C(q) = 5q. Determine the equilibrium levels of output, price, and profit for the leader and the follower.\n\nHint: To solve this problem, you will need to use the first-order conditions for profit maximization, as well as the market demand equation and the firm's total cost function.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the reaction function for the follower, then find the optimal output for the leader, and finally calculate the equilibrium levels of output, price, and profit for both the leader and the follower.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for the follower\nThe follower's profit function is given by:\nπ(q_follower) = P*q_follower - C(q_follower)\nwhere P is the market price and q_follower is the output of the follower.\n\nUsing the market demand equation, we can rewrite the profit function as:\nπ(q_follower) = (240 - 4(Q_leader + q_follower))*q_follower - 5*q_follower\n\nTo find the optimal output for the follower, we take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to q_follower and set it equal to 0:\ndπ(q_follower)/dq_follower = 240 - 4(Q_leader + 2*q_follower) - 5 = 0\n\nSolving for q_follower, we get the reaction function for the follower:\nq_follower = (235 - 4*Q_leader)/8\n\nStep 2: Find the optimal output for the leader\nThe leader's profit function is given by:\nπ(Q_leader) = P*Q_leader - C(Q_leader)\n\nUsing the market demand equation and the follower's reaction function, we can rewrite the profit function as:\nπ(Q_leader) = (240 - 4(Q_leader + (235 - 4*Q_leader)/8))*Q_leader - 10*Q_leader\n\nSimplifying and taking the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_leader, we get:\ndπ(Q_leader)/dQ_leader = 240 - 8*Q_leader - 4*q_follower - 10 = 0\n\nSubstituting the reaction function for q_follower, we get:\n240 - 8*Q_leader - 4*((235 - 4*Q_leader)/8) - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for Q_leader, we get:\nQ_leader = 25\n\nStep 3: Calculate the equilibrium levels of output, price, and profit\nUsing the reaction function for the follower, we can find the equilibrium output for the follower:\nq_follower = (235 - 4*25)/8 = 15\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium market price using the market demand equation:\nP = (240 - 4*(Q_leader + q_follower))/4 = (240 - 4*(25 + 15))/4 = 40\n\nFinally, we can calculate the profits for the leader and the follower:\nπ_leader = P*Q_leader - C(Q_leader) = 40*25 - 10*25 = 750\nπ_follower = P*q_follower - C(q_follower) = 40*15 - 5*15 = 525\n\nIn conclusion, the equilibrium levels of output are 25 units for the leader and 15 units for the follower. The equilibrium market price is 40, and the profits are 750 for the leader and 525 for the follower."
