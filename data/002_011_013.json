    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The base of the ladder is 7 feet away from the wall and the height of the wall is 9 feet. What is the length of the ladder if it just reaches the top of the wall?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the ladder forms a right-angled triangle with the wall and the ground.\n\nLet the length of the ladder be L. The base of the triangle is 7 feet, and the height is 9 feet. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nL^2 = 7^2 + 9^2\nL^2 = 49 + 81\nL^2 = 130\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 130 to get the length of the ladder:\n\nL = √130 ≈ 11.4 feet\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is approximately 11.4 feet."
