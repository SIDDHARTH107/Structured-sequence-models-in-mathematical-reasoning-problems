    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (machines), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (malfunction) for each trial, and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no malfunction) for each trial.\n\nIn this problem, n = 20 (number of machines), p = 1/10 (probability of malfunction), and we want to find the probability of at least 2 accidents, which means we need to find the probability of 2, 3, 4, ..., 20 accidents.\n\nHowever, it's easier to find the probability of 0 or 1 accident and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least 2 accidents. So, we will calculate P(X = 0) and P(X = 1) and then find 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)).\n\nFirst, let's find P(X = 0):\n\nP(X = 0) = C(20, 0) * (1/10)^0 * (9/10)^20\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (9/10)^20\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.3585\n\nNow, let's find P(X = 1):\n\nP(X = 1) = C(20, 1) * (1/10)^1 * (9/10)^19\nP(X = 1) = 20 * 1/10 * (9/10)^19\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.3753\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 2 accidents:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1))\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - (0.3585 + 0.3753)\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 1 - 0.7338\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.2662\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 accidents will occur in a week if the factory has 20 machines is approximately 26.62%."
