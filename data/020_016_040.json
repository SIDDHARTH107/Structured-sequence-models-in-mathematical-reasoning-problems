The thickness of the material used to make the container must be at least 0.1 inch to prevent it from breaking. The cost of material per square inch is $0.02. Find the radius and height of the container that will minimize the cost of the material used.",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the container and h be the height. The volume of the container is given by V = πr^2h. We are given that the maximum volume is 1000 cubic inches, so:\n\nπr^2h = 1000\n\nThe surface area of the container, which determines the cost of the material, consists of the area of the two circular bases and the lateral area. The surface area S is given by:\n\nS = 2πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nOur goal is to minimize the cost of the material used, which is proportional to the surface area. Since the cost per square inch is $0.02, we can write the cost function as:\n\nC(r, h) = 0.02S = 0.02(2πr^2 + 2πrh)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the optimal values of r and h. We can use the constraint given by the volume equation to eliminate one of the variables. Let's solve the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 1000 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h in the cost function:\n\nC(r) = 0.02(2πr^2 + 2πr(1000 / (πr^2)))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC(r) = 0.02(2πr^2 + 2000/r)\n\nNow we need to find the critical points of C(r) by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it to 0:\n\nC'(r) = 0.02(4πr - 2000/r^2)\n\nSet C'(r) to 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = 4πr - 2000/r^2\n4πr = 2000/r^2\nr^3 = 500/(π)\n\nNow, find the value of r:\n\nr = (500/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow that we have the optimal value of r, we can find the optimal value of h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 1000 / (πr^2)\nh = 1000 / (π(500/π)^(2/3))\n\nNow, we can find the numerical values for r and h:\n\nr ≈ 3.66 inches\nh ≈ 7.32 inches\n\nSo, the optimal dimensions for the container to minimize the cost of the material used are a radius of approximately 3.66 inches and a height of approximately 7.32 inches."
