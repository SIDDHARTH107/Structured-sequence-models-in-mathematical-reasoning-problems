    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain stock to increase is 0.35 and the probability of the same stock to decrease is 0.45. If the probability of the stock price to remain unchanged is 0.2, what is the probability that the stock will either increase or remain unchanged?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock will either increase or remain unchanged, we simply add the probabilities of these two events. \n\nProbability of stock increasing: 0.35\nProbability of stock remaining unchanged: 0.2\n\nProbability of stock either increasing or remaining unchanged = 0.35 + 0.2 = 0.55\n\nSo, the probability that the stock will either increase or remain unchanged is 0.55 or 55%."
