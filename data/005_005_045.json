    "message_1": "In a factory that produces light bulbs, the probability of producing a defective bulb is 0.03. If a sample of 200 bulbs is selected at random, what is the probability that there will be exactly 6 defective bulbs in the sample?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective bulbs\n- n is the total number of bulbs in the sample (200 in this case)\n- x is the number of defective bulbs we want to find the probability for (6 in this case)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (0.03 in this case)\n- q is the probability of a bulb not being defective (1 - p = 0.97 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(6) = C(200, 6) * (0.03^6) * (0.97^194)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(200, 6), which is:\n\nC(200, 6) = 200! / (6! * (200 - 6)!)\nC(200, 6) = 200! / (6! * 194!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorial and combinations, we get:\n\nC(200, 6) ≈ 3,315,315\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the probability formula:\n\nP(6) ≈ 3,315,315 * (0.03^6) * (0.97^194)\nP(6) ≈ 3,315,315 * 0.000000729 * 0.0196\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(6) ≈ 0.0471\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 6 defective bulbs in a sample of 200 is approximately 4.71%."
