    "message_1": "Suppose a substitution cipher is used where each letter is replaced by another letter in the English alphabet. If the letter \"A\" is replaced by the letter \"F\", then what letter would the letter \"G\" be replaced with in this cipher?",
    "message_2": "To determine the letter that \"G\" would be replaced with, we need to find the pattern or the shift used in the substitution cipher. In this case, \"A\" is replaced by \"F\". The shift between \"A\" and \"F\" is 5 positions forward in the alphabet.\n\nNow, we apply the same shift to the letter \"G\". Moving 5 positions forward from \"G\" in the alphabet, we get:\n\nG -> H -> I -> J -> K -> L\n\nSo, in this substitution cipher, the letter \"G\" would be replaced with the letter \"L\"."
