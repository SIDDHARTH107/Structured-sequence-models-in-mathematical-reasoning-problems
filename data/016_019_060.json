    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by the Koch curve. After each iteration, the number of sides of the perimeter increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Koch island after the nth iteration as P(n). The original perimeter is 3, so P(0) = 3.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of sides increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3. So, P(1) = 4 * (1/3) * P(0) = 4 * (1/3) * 3 = 4.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by a factor of 4/3. Therefore, the perimeter after the 5th iteration, P(5), can be calculated as:\n\nP(5) = P(0) * (4/3)^5\nP(5) = 3 * (4/3)^5\nP(5) ≈ 3 * 1024/243\nP(5) ≈ 12.615\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is approximately 12.615."
