    "message_1": "A cube has a volume of 343 cubic units. What is the volume of the sphere inscribed inside the cube?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find the side length of the cube and then the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the side length of the cube. We are given the volume as 343 cubic units.\n\n343 = s^3\n\nTo find the side length, we take the cube root of both sides:\n\ns = ∛343\ns = 7 units\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we can find the diameter of the inscribed sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 7 units.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 7/2\nr = 3.5 units\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula V = (4/3)πr^3:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3.5)^3\nV ≈ (4/3)π(42.875)\nV ≈ 180.955 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 180.955 cubic units."
