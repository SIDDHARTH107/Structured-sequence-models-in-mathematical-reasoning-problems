    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2y$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6xy = 3x(x - 2y)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -3x^2 = -3x^2\n$$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n$$\n3x(x - 2y) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n-3x^2 = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $x = 0$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $0 = 0$, which means that any value of $y$ will satisfy the equation. Thus, we have a line of critical points along the $y$-axis: $(0, y)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points using Morse theory. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nComputing the second partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6y\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = -6x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\n\nSo the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x - 6y & -6x \\\\\n-6x & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical points $(0, y)$:\n\n$$\nH(f)(0, y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-6y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $0$, which means that Morse theory cannot be used to classify these critical points. However, we can still analyze the behavior of the function around these points.\n\nNotice that the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2y$ is a cubic polynomial in $x$ and a linear polynomial in $y$. Therefore, the function does not have a local minimum, maximum, or saddle point along the line of critical points $(0, y)$. Instead, the function \"flattens out\" along the $y$-axis, and the critical points represent a degenerate case in which the function does not exhibit any of the typical behaviors associated with Morse theory."
