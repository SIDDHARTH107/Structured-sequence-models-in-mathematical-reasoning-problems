    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Stirling numbers of the second kind, we first need to understand what Stirling numbers represent. Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this problem, we have 5 employees and 3 projects. We need to assign 2 employees to one project and 1 employee each to the other two projects. We can think of this as partitioning the set of 5 employees into 3 non-empty subsets, where one subset has 2 employees and the other two subsets have 1 employee each.\n\nFirst, we need to choose which project will have 2 employees. There are 3 projects, so there are 3 ways to choose the project with 2 employees.\n\nNext, we need to assign the employees to the projects. We can use Stirling numbers of the second kind to find the number of ways to partition the 5 employees into the 3 non-empty subsets.\n\nSince we have already chosen the project with 2 employees, we are left with partitioning the 5 employees into 1 subset of size 2 and 2 subsets of size 1. This is equivalent to partitioning the 5 employees into 2 non-empty subsets, which can be represented as S(5, 2).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can find S(5, 2):\n\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\n\nTo find S(4, 2) and S(4, 1), we can use the same formula:\n\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nS(4, 1) = S(3, 0) + S(3, 1)\n\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1)\nS(3, 1) = S(2, 0) + S(2, 1)\n\nS(2, 2) = 1 (two singletons)\nS(2, 1) = 1 (one subset with both elements)\nS(3, 0) = S(2, 0) = 0 (no subsets)\n\nNow we can substitute back:\n\nS(3, 2) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(3, 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nFinally, we can find S(5, 2):\n\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose the project with 2 employees (3 ways) by the number of ways to partition the employees (15 ways):\n\nTotal ways = 3 * 15 = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 ways to assign the 5 employees to the 3 projects with the given constraints."
