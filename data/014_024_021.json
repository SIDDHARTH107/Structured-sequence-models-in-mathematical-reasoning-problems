    "message_1": "If a message encrypted with Caesar cipher has a shift of 5, and the letter \"A\" is represented by the number 0, what number represents the letter \"L\" in the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To find the number representing the letter \"L\" in the encrypted message, we need to apply the Caesar cipher shift of 5 to the original position of \"L\". \n\nThe letter \"A\" is represented by the number 0, so we can assign numbers to the rest of the alphabet accordingly:\nA=0, B=1, C=2, ..., L=11, ..., Z=25.\n\nNow, we apply the shift of 5 to the letter \"L\":\n11 (original position of L) + 5 (shift) = 16.\n\nHowever, if the result is greater than 25, we need to wrap around the alphabet. In this case, 16 is not greater than 25, so the number representing the letter \"L\" in the encrypted message is 16."
