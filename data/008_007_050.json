    "message_2": "To find the diagonal form of a matrix, we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then construct a diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal and a matrix P with the eigenvectors as columns. The diagonal form of A is given by the matrix D.\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues of A. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is an eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [3 - λ, -1; 2, 5 - λ]\n\nThe determinant of A - λI is:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(5 - λ) - (-1)(2) = λ^2 - 8λ + 13\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the characteristic equation:\n\nλ^2 - 8λ + 13 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots:\n\nλ = (8 ± √(8^2 - 4(13)))/2 = (8 ± √36)/2 = (8 ± 6)/2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are:\n\nλ1 = (8 + 6)/2 = 7\nλ2 = (8 - 6)/2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. For each eigenvalue, we need to solve the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\n1. For λ1 = 7:\n\n(A - 7I)v = [3 - 7, -1; 2, 5 - 7]v = [-4, -1; 2, -2]v = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n-4v1 - v2 = 0\n2v1 - 2v2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, so we only need to consider one of them. Let's take the first equation:\n\n-4v1 - v2 = 0 => v2 = -4v1\n\nLet v1 = 1, then v2 = -4. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 7 is:\n\nv1 = [1; -4]\n\n2. For λ2 = 1:\n\n(A - 1I)v = [3 - 1, -1; 2, 5 - 1]v = [2, -1; 2, 4]v = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of linear equations as:\n\n2v1 - v2 = 0\n2v1 + 4v2 = 0\n\nThe second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, so we only need to consider one of them. Let's take the first equation:\n\n2v1 - v2 = 0 => v2 = 2v1\n\nLet v1 = 1, then v2 = 2. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 1 is:\n\nv2 = [1; 2]\n\nNow, we can construct the diagonal matrix D and the matrix P:\n\nD = [7, 0; 0, 1]\nP = [1, 1; -4, 2]\n\nThe diagonal form of the matrix A is the matrix D:\n\nD = [7, 0; 0, 1]"
