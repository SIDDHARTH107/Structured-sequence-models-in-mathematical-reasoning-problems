    "message_2": "To solve this system of differential equations, we can use the method of integrating factors. First, we rewrite the system as:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} + bxy = ax$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} + cy = dxy$\n\nNow, we can find the integrating factors for both equations. For the first equation, the integrating factor is $e^{\\int b y dt}$. Since we cannot integrate $y$ directly, we can use the average value of $y$ over a period, which is a constant. Let's call this constant $K$. Then, the integrating factor is $e^{bKt}$.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\n$e^{bKt}\\frac{dx}{dt} + bxe^{bKt}y = axe^{bKt}$\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the derivative of $xe^{bKt}$ with respect to $t$. So, we can integrate both sides with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\int \\frac{d}{dt}(xe^{bKt}) dt = \\int axe^{bKt} dt$\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n$xe^{bKt} = \\frac{a}{bK}e^{bKt} + C_1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x(t)$:\n\n$x(t) = \\frac{a}{bK} + C_1e^{-bKt}$\n\nUsing the initial condition $x(0) = 1000$, we can find $C_1$:\n\n$1000 = \\frac{a}{bK} + C_1 \\Rightarrow C_1 = 1000 - \\frac{a}{bK}$\n\nSo, the solution for $x(t)$ is:\n\n$x(t) = \\frac{a}{bK} + (1000 - \\frac{a}{bK})e^{-bKt}$\n\nNow, we can find the solution for $y(t)$ in a similar way. The integrating factor for the second equation is $e^{\\int c dt} = e^{ct}$. Multiplying the second equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\n$e^{ct}\\frac{dy}{dt} + ce^{ct}y = dxe^{ct}y$\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the derivative of $ye^{ct}$ with respect to $t$. So, we can integrate both sides with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\int \\frac{d}{dt}(ye^{ct}) dt = \\int dxe^{ct}y dt$\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n$ye^{ct} = \\int dxe^{ct}y dt + C_2$\n\nNow, we can solve for $y(t)$:\n\n$y(t) = e^{-ct}(\\int dxe^{ct}y dt + C_2)$\n\nUsing the initial condition $y(0) = 100$, we can find $C_2$:\n\n$100 = e^0(\\int dx(0)y(0) dt + C_2) \\Rightarrow C_2 = 100$\n\nSo, the solution for $y(t)$ is:\n\n$y(t) = e^{-ct}(\\int dxe^{ct}y dt + 100)$\n\nTo find the time at which the predator population reaches its maximum value, we can take the derivative of $y(t)$ with respect to $t$ and set it equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = -ce^{-ct}(\\int dxe^{ct}y dt + 100) + e^{-ct}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\int dxe^{ct}y dt) = 0$\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to find the time at which the predator population reaches its maximum value."
