    "message_2": "To prove that the function f: X → R defined by f(x) = d(x, p) is continuous for all x ∈ X, we need to show that for any x ∈ X and any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all y ∈ X with d(x, y) < δ, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < ε.\n\nLet x, y ∈ X and consider |f(x) - f(y)| = |d(x, p) - d(y, p)|. By the triangle inequality, we have:\n\nd(x, p) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, p) => d(x, p) - d(y, p) ≤ d(x, y)\nd(y, p) ≤ d(y, x) + d(x, p) => d(y, p) - d(x, p) ≤ d(x, y)\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we get:\n\n- d(x, y) ≤ d(x, p) - d(y, p) ≤ d(x, y)\n\nHence, |f(x) - f(y)| = |d(x, p) - d(y, p)| ≤ d(x, y).\n\nNow, let ε > 0 be given. Choose δ = ε. Then, for all y ∈ X with d(x, y) < δ, we have:\n\n|f(x) - f(y)| ≤ d(x, y) < ε.\n\nThis shows that f is continuous at every point x ∈ X.\n\nNow, let's find the limit of f(x) as x approaches p. We want to find the limit L such that for any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ X with 0 < d(x, p) < δ, we have |f(x) - L| < ε.\n\nSince f(x) = d(x, p), we are looking for the limit of d(x, p) as x approaches p. Intuitively, as x gets closer to p, the distance between x and p should approach 0. Let's prove this formally.\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. Choose δ = ε. Then, for all x ∈ X with 0 < d(x, p) < δ, we have:\n\n|f(x) - 0| = |d(x, p) - 0| = d(x, p) < ε.\n\nThus, the limit of f(x) as x approaches p is 0."
