    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set (∅) is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of A. By definition, a subset B of a set A is a set such that every element of B is also an element of A. In mathematical notation, this is expressed as:\n\nB ⊆ A if and only if ∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A)\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set (∅). By definition, the empty set is a set with no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. In other words, there is no element x such that x ∈ ∅ and x ∉ A.\n\nSince there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A, it follows that every element in the empty set is also an element of A. Thus, by the definition of a subset, the empty set (∅) is a subset of A.\n\nIn conclusion, the empty set (∅) is a subset of any set, including a set A with 10 elements, as every element in the empty set is also an element of A by definition."
