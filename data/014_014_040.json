    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is replaced by I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   C R Y P T\n   O A B D E\n   F G H I K\n   L M N S U\n   V W X Z Q\n\n2. Break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an X between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an X at the end.\n\n   MA TH IS FX UN\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\n   Encrypted digraphs:\n   MA -> OD\n   TH -> YP\n   IS -> KN\n   FX -> GV\n   UN -> TS\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message:\n\n   ODYPKNGVTS"
