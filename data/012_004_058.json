The cost of laying a transmission line between each pair of power station-city is given in the following matrix:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-&A&B&C&D\\\\\n1&2&7&4&6\\\\\n2&4&1&5&8\\\\\n3&5&5&6&2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nwhere A, B, C, D represent the power stations and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 represent the cities.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost required to connect all the power stations to all the cities in the area?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost required to connect all the power stations to all the cities in the area, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm. The Hungarian Algorithm is used to find the minimum cost in an assignment problem, such as this one.\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimum value in each row and subtract it from each element in that row:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0&5&2&4\\\\\n3&0&4&7\\\\\n3&3&4&0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNext, we find the minimum value in each column and subtract it from each element in that column:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0&2&0&1\\\\\n3&0&2&4\\\\\n0&1&2&0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of lines to cover all the zeros in the matrix. In this case, we can cover all the zeros with 3 lines:\n\n- Horizontal line through the first row\n- Vertical line through the second column\n- Horizontal line through the third row\n\nSince the number of lines (3) is equal to the number of power stations, we can proceed to find the minimum cost assignment.\n\nThe minimum cost assignment is as follows:\n\n- Power station A (1) connects to city 1 with a cost of 2\n- Power station B (2) connects to city 2 with a cost of 1\n- Power station C (3) connects to city 5 with a cost of 2\n\nThe minimum cost required to connect all the power stations to all the cities in the area is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5."
