    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products A, B and C in the ratio of 3:4:5. The probability that a product is defective is 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05 for products A, B, and C, respectively. If a randomly selected product is found to be defective, what is the probability that it is of type A?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected defective product is of type A, we can use the Bayes' theorem. Let D be the event that a product is defective, and A, B, and C be the events that the product is of type A, B, and C, respectively. We want to find the probability P(A|D).\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)\n\nWe know the following probabilities:\nP(D|A) = 0.02 (probability that a product is defective given it is of type A)\nP(D|B) = 0.03 (probability that a product is defective given it is of type B)\nP(D|C) = 0.05 (probability that a product is defective given it is of type C)\n\nThe products are produced in the ratio 3:4:5, so the probabilities of selecting a product of each type are:\nP(A) = 3 / (3 + 4 + 5) = 3/12 = 1/4\nP(B) = 4 / (3 + 4 + 5) = 4/12 = 1/3\nP(C) = 5 / (3 + 4 + 5) = 5/12\n\nNow we need to find the probability P(D), which is the probability that a randomly selected product is defective. We can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B) + P(D|C) * P(C)\nP(D) = 0.02 * (1/4) + 0.03 * (1/3) + 0.05 * (5/12)\nP(D) = 0.005 + 0.01 + 0.0208333\nP(D) ≈ 0.0358333\n\nNow we can find P(A|D) using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A|D) = P(D|A) * P(A) / P(D)\nP(A|D) = 0.02 * (1/4) / 0.0358333\nP(A|D) ≈ 0.1391304\n\nSo the probability that a randomly selected defective product is of type A is approximately 0.139 or 13.9%."
