    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to non-parametric statistics:\n\nA researcher wants to study the distribution of ages in a population. She collects a random sample of 50 individuals and records their ages. The sample has a median age of 42 years. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a significance level of 0.05, does this sample provide evidence that the population median age is different from 40 years? \n\nCalculate the test statistic and the p-value for this hypothesis test.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\n2. Calculate the test statistic (W).\n3. Determine the critical value or p-value.\n4. Make a decision based on the p-value or critical value.\n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1)\nH0: The population median age is equal to 40 years (M = 40).\nH1: The population median age is not equal to 40 years (M ≠ 40).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic (W)\nSince we don't have the actual age data for the 50 individuals, we cannot calculate the exact test statistic (W). However, we can provide a general formula for calculating W:\n\nW = Σ [Ri - (n(n+1))/2]\n\nWhere Ri is the rank of each observation in the combined dataset (sample data and hypothesized median), and n is the sample size.\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value or p-value\nAgain, without the actual age data, we cannot calculate the exact p-value. However, we can provide a general method for finding the p-value:\n\n- Calculate the expected value (E(W)) and variance (Var(W)) of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\n- Standardize the test statistic: Z = (W - E(W)) / sqrt(Var(W)).\n- Find the p-value using the standard normal distribution table or a statistical software.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision based on the p-value or critical value\nIf the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence that the population median age is different from 40 years. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and cannot conclude that the population median age is different from 40 years.\n\nWithout the actual age data, we cannot provide the exact test statistic and p-value for this problem. However, the steps and formulas mentioned above can be used to perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test once the age data is available."
