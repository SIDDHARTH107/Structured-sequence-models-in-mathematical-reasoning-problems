    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n|  3   2  -1 |  1  |\n|  2  -2   4 | -2  |\n| -1  1/2 -1 |  0  |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operations:\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 + R1\n\n|  3    2   -1 |  1   |\n|  0   -4  8/3 | -4/3 |\n|  0  5/2 -2/3 |  1   |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operation:\nR3 = R3 - (5/8)R2\n\n|  3    2    -1  |  1    |\n|  0   -4  8/3  | -4/3  |\n|  0    0  -1/3 |  1/3  |\n\nStep 3: Convert the matrix into a diagonal matrix.\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operations:\nR1 = R1 + R3\nR2 = R2 - (8/3)R3\n\n|  3    2    0  |  4/3  |\n|  0   -4    0  | -2    |\n|  0    0  -1/3 |  1/3  |\n\nStep 4: Solve for x, y, and z.\nNow, we have a diagonal matrix, and we can easily solve for x, y, and z:\n\n(1) 3x + 2y = 4/3\n(2) -4y = -2\n(3) -1/3z = 1/3\n\nFrom equation (3), we have:\nz = -1\n\nFrom equation (2), we have:\ny = 1/2\n\nFrom equation (1), we have:\n3x + 2(1/2) = 4/3\n3x + 1 = 4/3\n3x = 1/3\nx = 1/9\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1/9, y = 1/2, and z = -1."
