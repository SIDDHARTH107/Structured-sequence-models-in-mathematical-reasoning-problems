    "message_1": "A company's quarterly earnings over the past year are represented by the following function in dollars:\nf(t) = 200sin(2π/3 * t) + 400sin(4π/3 * t) + 600sin(2π * t)\nwhere t is the time in quarters (e.g. t=0 represents Q1 of the past year, t=1 represents Q2, and so on).\n\nUsing Fourier analysis, what is the average quarterly earnings of the company over the past year, and how much of the earnings can be attributed to each quarterly component?",
    "message_2": "To find the average quarterly earnings over the past year, we can integrate the function f(t) over one period and divide by the period. Since the function is periodic with a period of 1 year (4 quarters), we can integrate from t=0 to t=4 and divide by 4.\n\nAverage quarterly earnings = (1/4) * ∫[f(t) dt] from 0 to 4\n\nf(t) = 200sin(2π/3 * t) + 400sin(4π/3 * t) + 600sin(2π * t)\n\nLet's integrate each term separately:\n\n∫[200sin(2π/3 * t) dt] = (-300/π)cos(2π/3 * t)\n∫[400sin(4π/3 * t) dt] = (-300/π)cos(4π/3 * t)\n∫[600sin(2π * t) dt] = (-300/π)cos(2π * t)\n\nNow, we evaluate these integrals at the limits 0 and 4:\n\n(-300/π)[cos(8π/3 * 4) - cos(8π/3 * 0)] = 0\n(-300/π)[cos(16π/3 * 4) - cos(16π/3 * 0)] = 0\n(-300/π)[cos(8π * 4) - cos(8π * 0)] = 0\n\nSince all the terms are 0, the average quarterly earnings over the past year is 0.\n\nNow, let's find how much of the earnings can be attributed to each quarterly component. The function f(t) is already separated into its components:\n\n1st component: 200sin(2π/3 * t)\n2nd component: 400sin(4π/3 * t)\n3rd component: 600sin(2π * t)\n\nThese components represent the earnings attributed to each quarter."
