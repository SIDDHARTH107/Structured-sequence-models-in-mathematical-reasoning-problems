Assume the rod is insulated at both ends.\n\nUsing the finite element method, find the numerical solution for the temperature distribution u(x,t) at time t=0.5 seconds, with the following parameters:\n\n- Length of rod L = 1 meter\n- Thermal conductivity constant k = 0.025 W/mK\n- Source term f(x,t) = 100 exp(-500(x-0.5)²) sin(20πt)\n- Number of elements = 10.\n\nPlot the temperature distribution using a suitable graphing tool.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the finite element method, we first need to discretize the problem. We will use a mesh of 10 elements, so we have 11 nodes (including the endpoints). The length of each element is Δx = L / 10 = 0.1 m.\n\nNext, we will approximate the solution u(x,t) using a linear combination of basis functions:\n\nu(x,t) ≈ Σ U_i(t) * N_i(x)\n\nwhere U_i(t) are the nodal values of the temperature and N_i(x) are the basis functions associated with each node.\n\nNow, we will use the Galerkin method to obtain a weak form of the given PDE. Multiply the PDE by a test function v(x) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫(∂u/∂t * v(x) - k * (∂²u/∂x²) * v(x)) dx = ∫f(x,t) * v(x) dx\n\nSubstitute the approximation of u(x,t) into the weak form:\n\n∫(∂(Σ U_i(t) * N_i(x))/∂t * v(x) - k * (∂²(Σ U_i(t) * N_i(x))/∂x²) * v(x)) dx = ∫f(x,t) * v(x) dx\n\nNow, we will use the finite element method to discretize the problem in time as well. Let's use the backward Euler method for time discretization:\n\nU_i(t+Δt) = U_i(t) + Δt * dU_i(t)/dt\n\nNow we can rewrite the weak form in terms of the nodal values U_i(t) and the basis functions N_i(x). After some calculations, we obtain a system of linear equations that can be written in matrix form:\n\n[M + k * Δt * K] * U(t+Δt) = M * U(t) + Δt * F(t)\n\nwhere M is the mass matrix, K is the stiffness matrix, and F(t) is the vector of the source term f(x,t) projected onto the basis functions.\n\nNow we can solve this system of linear equations for U(t+Δt) at each time step. We start at t=0 and advance in time until we reach t=0.5 seconds. We can use any suitable numerical method, such as the conjugate gradient method, to solve the linear system.\n\nAfter solving for U(t+Δt) at t=0.5 seconds, we can plot the temperature distribution u(x,t) using a suitable graphing tool, such as MATLAB or Python's Matplotlib library. The plot will show the temperature distribution along the rod at t=0.5 seconds."
