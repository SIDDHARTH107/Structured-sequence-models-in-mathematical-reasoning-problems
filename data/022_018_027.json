    "message_2": "To show that $u = Re(z) + Im(z)$ is a particular solution to the partial differential equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$, we first need to find the second partial derivatives of $u$ with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n\nLet's define $u = Re(z) + Im(z) = x + y$, where $z = x + iy$ and $\\bar{z} = x - iy$.\n\nNow, we find the second partial derivatives of $u$:\n\n1. $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 1$\n2. $u_y = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 1$\n3. $u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n4. $u_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we substitute the second partial derivatives into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\nSince the equation holds true, we can conclude that $u = Re(z) + Im(z)$ is a particular solution to the partial differential equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$."
