    "message_2": "To determine the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 16, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 16 must be a p-group, where p is a prime number. In this case, p = 2.\n2. The number of isomorphism classes of p-groups of order p^n is determined by the number of partitions of n.\n\nNow, let's find the number of partitions of n = 4 (since 16 = 2^4):\n\n1. 4\n2. 3 + 1\n3. 2 + 2\n4. 2 + 1 + 1\n5. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThere are 5 partitions of 4. However, not all of these partitions correspond to an isomorphism class of groups of order 16. We need to analyze each partition and determine which ones correspond to valid isomorphism classes.\n\n1. 4: This corresponds to the cyclic group C16, which has a single element of order 16.\n2. 3 + 1: This corresponds to the dihedral group D8, which has a presentation of the form ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^3b⟩.\n3. 2 + 2: This corresponds to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, C4 × C4.\n4. 2 + 1 + 1: This does not correspond to a valid isomorphism class of groups of order 16, as it would require a group with an element of order 2 and two elements of order 1, which is not possible.\n5. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: This does not correspond to a valid isomorphism class of groups of order 16, as it would require a group with four elements of order 1, which is not possible.\n\nThus, there are three isomorphism classes of groups of order 16: C16, D8, and C4 × C4.\n\nExamples for each isomorphism class:\n\n1. C16: The cyclic group of order 16 can be represented as ⟨a | a^16 = 1⟩, where a has order 16.\n2. D8: The dihedral group of order 16 can be represented as ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^3b⟩, where a has order 8 and b has order 2.\n3. C4 × C4: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 can be represented as ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^4 = 1, ab = ba⟩, where a and b both have order 4 and commute with each other.\n\nEvery group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of these classes because we have exhausted all possible partitions of 4 that correspond to valid isomorphism classes of groups of order 16."
