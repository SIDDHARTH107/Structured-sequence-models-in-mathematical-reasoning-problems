    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift of the function. In the given function f(x) = 2 sin(3x + π/4), the phase shift can be found by setting the argument of the sine function equal to zero:\n\n3x + π/4 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n3x = -π/4\nx = -π/12\n\nThe phase shift of the function is -π/12."
