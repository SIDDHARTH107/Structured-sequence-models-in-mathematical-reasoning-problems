    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using separation of variables, we first rewrite the equation to separate the variables y and x:\n\ndy/dx = 2xy\n\nDivide both sides by y:\n\n(1/y) dy/dx = 2x\n\nNow, multiply both sides by dx:\n\n(1/y) dy = 2x dx\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫2x dx\n\nThe left side integrates to:\n\nln|y| = ∫2x dx\n\nThe right side integrates to:\n\nx^2 + C\n\nNow, we have:\n\nln|y| = x^2 + C\n\nTo solve for y, we take the exponential of both sides:\n\ny = e^(x^2 + C)\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\ny = e^(x^2) * e^C\n\nSince e^C is a constant, we can replace it with another constant, say K:\n\ny = Ke^(x^2)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = K * e^(0^2)\n\n1 = K * e^0\n\n1 = K * 1\n\nK = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = e^(x^2)"
