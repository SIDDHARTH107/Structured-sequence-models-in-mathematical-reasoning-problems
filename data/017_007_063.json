    "message_2": "A group of order 6 has 6 elements. Let's denote the elements as e (identity), a, a^2, b, ab, and a^2b. The possible Cayley tables for a group of order 6 are determined by the group operation and the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverse).\n\nCayley table for the cyclic group C6:\nThe cyclic group C6 is generated by a single element, say a, with the property a^6 = e. The elements of C6 are {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}. The Cayley table for C6 is:\n\n```\n   e   a   a^2 a^3 a^4 a^5\ne  e   a   a^2 a^3 a^4 a^5\na  a   a^2 a^3 a^4 a^5 e\na^2 a^2 a^3 a^4 a^5 e   a\na^3 a^3 a^4 a^5 e   a   a^2\na^4 a^4 a^5 e   a   a^2 a^3\na^5 a^5 e   a   a^2 a^3 a^4\n```\n\nCayley table for the dihedral group D3:\nThe dihedral group D3 consists of the symmetries of an equilateral triangle. It has 6 elements: {e, a, a^2, b, ab, a^2b}, where a represents a rotation by 120 degrees, a^2 represents a rotation by 240 degrees, and b represents a reflection. The group operation follows the rules: a^3 = e, b^2 = e, and ba = a^2b. The Cayley table for D3 is:\n\n```\n   e   a   a^2 b   ab  a^2b\ne  e   a   a^2 b   ab  a^2b\na  a   a^2 e   ab  a^2b b\na^2 a^2 e   a   a^2b b   ab\nb  b   a^2b ab  e   a   a^2\nab ab  b   a^2b a^2 e   a\na^2b a^2b ab  b   a   a^2 e\n```\n\nSo, the Cayley table for the cyclic group C6 is the first one, and the Cayley table for the dihedral group D3 is the second one."
