    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is based on the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is particularly useful for solving complex optimization problems. Here, we will outline the steps to use the firefly algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function f(x, y) and the corresponding values of x and y.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters: Choose the number of fireflies (n), the maximum number of iterations (MaxIter), the absorption coefficient (gamma), the attractiveness constant (beta0), and the step size (alpha).\n\n2. Generate the initial population: Randomly generate n fireflies within the search space -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness: Calculate the fitness of each firefly using the given function f(x, y).\n\n4. Sort the fireflies: Rank the fireflies based on their fitness values.\n\n5. Update the fireflies' positions: For each firefly, compare its attractiveness with the other fireflies. If another firefly is more attractive (has a better fitness value), move the current firefly towards the more attractive one using the following equation:\n\n   x_new = x_old + beta * exp(-gamma * distance^2) * (x_attractive - x_old) + alpha * (random - 0.5)\n\n   where distance is the Euclidean distance between the two fireflies, beta is the attractiveness, and random is a random number between 0 and 1.\n\n6. Check the boundaries: Ensure that the updated positions of the fireflies are within the search space -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10. If not, set the position to the corresponding boundary value.\n\n7. Evaluate the new fitness: Calculate the fitness of the updated fireflies' positions using the function f(x, y).\n\n8. Update the best solution: If a firefly's new position has a better fitness value than its previous position, update its best position.\n\n9. Repeat steps 4-8 for MaxIter iterations or until convergence.\n\n10. Return the best solution: After the algorithm has converged or reached the maximum number of iterations, return the best solution found (minimum value of f(x, y) and the corresponding values of x and y).\n\nNote that the firefly algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, and the solution may vary depending on the initial population and parameter settings. To improve the accuracy of the solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best result."
