    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose there are three students in a classroom - Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice knows the answer to the math question, but Bob does not. Charlie knows that either Alice or Bob knows the answer but he doesn't know which one. What can Charlie conclude about the answer to the math question?\n\nAnswer: There are two possibilities for the answer to the math question. Either Alice knows the answer, or Bob does not know the answer. Charlie cannot say for certain which one is true.",
    "message_2": "However, Charlie can conclude that there is at least one person in the classroom who knows the answer to the math question. This is because he knows that either Alice or Bob knows the answer. So, while he cannot determine the exact answer to the question, he can be confident that the answer is known by someone in the room."
