    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be written as a power of g.\n\nSince G has order 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 7. Since 7 is prime, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 7. The identity element e has order 1, so we need to find an element of order 7.\n\nLet's consider the set of all non-identity elements in G, which we will call S = {g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6}. We know that the order of each element in S must be 7, because if any of them had order 1, it would be the identity element, which is a contradiction.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of all products of pairs of distinct elements in S, which we will call T = {g1g2, g1g3, g1g4, g1g5, g1g6, g2g3, g2g4, g2g5, g2g6, g3g4, g3g5, g3g6, g4g5, g4g6, g5g6}. Note that T has 15 elements.\n\nWe claim that T must contain all non-identity elements of G. Suppose for contradiction that there exists an element h in G that is not in T. Then h must be one of the elements in S, say h = g1. But then, since G is a group, the product g1g2 must be in G, and since g1g2 ≠ e (because g1 and g2 have order 7), we have g1g2 = h = g1, which implies g2 = e, a contradiction. Therefore, T must contain all non-identity elements of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of all products of triples of distinct elements in S, which we will call U = {g1g2g3, g1g2g4, g1g2g5, g1g2g6, g1g3g4, g1g3g5, g1g3g6, g1g4g5, g1g4g6, g1g5g6, g2g3g4, g2g3g5, g2g3g6, g2g4g5, g2g4g6, g2g5g6, g3g4g5, g3g4g6, g3g5g6, g4g5g6}. Note that U has 20 elements.\n\nWe claim that U must contain all elements of G, including the identity element e. Suppose for contradiction that there exists an element k in G that is not in U. Then k must be one of the elements in T, say k = g1g2. But then, since G is a group, the product g1g2g3 must be in G, and since g1g2g3 ≠ e (because g1, g2, and g3 have order 7), we have g1g2g3 = k = g1g2, which implies g3 = e, a contradiction. Therefore, U must contain all elements of G, including the identity element e.\n\nSince U contains the identity element e, there must be a triple of distinct elements in S whose product is e. Without loss of generality, let g1g2g3 = e. Then, g1g2 = g3^(-1), g1g3 = g2^(-1), and g2g3 = g1^(-1). Since the inverses of elements in S are also in S, we have that g1, g2, and g3 generate G.\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic subgroup generated by g1, denoted by <g1>. Since g1 has order 7, <g1> has 7 elements, which are {e, g1, g1^2, g1^3, g1^4, g1^5, g1^6}. Since G also has 7 elements, we have G = <g1>, which means G is cyclic, generated by g1."
