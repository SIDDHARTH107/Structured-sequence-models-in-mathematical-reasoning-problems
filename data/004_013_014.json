    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of producing the product, we need to find the minimum point of the cost function C(x) = 1000 + 5x + 0.02x^2. This is a quadratic function, and its minimum point can be found by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe derivative of C(x) with respect to x is:\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (1000 + 5x + 0.02x^2) = 5 + 0.04x\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 5 + 0.04x\n-5 = 0.04x\nx = -5 / 0.04\nx = -125\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative number of units produced, the minimum cost of producing the product occurs when x = 0 (i.e., no units are produced). In this case, the minimum cost is:\n\nC(0) = 1000 + 5(0) + 0.02(0)^2 = 1000\n\nSo, the minimum cost of producing the product is $1000."
