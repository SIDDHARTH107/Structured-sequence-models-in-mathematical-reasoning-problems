    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 5 modulo 11, we need to find an integer x such that:\n\na^x ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nwhere a is a primitive root modulo 11. In this case, we can choose a = 2, as 2 is a primitive root modulo 11.\n\nNow, we need to find x such that:\n\n2^x ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nWe can do this by trying different values of x and checking if the equation holds true.\n\nFor x = 1:\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n\nFor x = 2:\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n\nFor x = 3:\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 11)\n\nFor x = 4:\n2^4 ≡ 16 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 5 modulo 11 is x = 4."
