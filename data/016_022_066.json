    "message_2": "To find the number of smaller pyramids needed to construct the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of pyramids in iteration n = 3^(n-1)\n\nFor the fourth iteration (n=4), the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of pyramids in iteration 4 = 3^(4-1) = 3^3 = 27\n\nSo, 27 smaller pyramids are needed to construct the fourth iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid."
