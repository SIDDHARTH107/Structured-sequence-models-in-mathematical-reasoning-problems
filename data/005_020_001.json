    "message_1": "A ski resort claims to have an average snowfall of 400 inches per winter season, with a standard deviation of 80 inches. Using Monte Carlo simulation, estimate the probability that in a given season, the snowfall will be less than 325 inches.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the probability using Monte Carlo simulation, we will generate a large number of random snowfall values from a normal distribution with the given mean (400 inches) and standard deviation (80 inches), and then calculate the proportion of those values that are less than 325 inches.\n\nLet's perform the simulation with 1,000,000 trials:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries (Python code):\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n2. Set the parameters for the normal distribution and the number of trials:\n```python\nmean_snowfall = 400\nstd_dev_snowfall = 80\nnum_trials = 1000000\n```\n\n3. Generate 1,000,000 random snowfall values from the normal distribution:\n```python\nrandom_snowfall_values = np.random.normal(mean_snowfall, std_dev_snowfall, num_trials)\n```\n\n4. Calculate the proportion of values less than 325 inches:\n```python\nnum_less_than_325 = np.sum(random_snowfall_values < 325)\nprobability_less_than_325 = num_less_than_325 / num_trials\n```\n\n5. Print the estimated probability:\n```python\nprint(\"Estimated probability of snowfall less than 325 inches:\", probability_less_than_325)\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, you will get an estimated probability. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the process. The estimated probability should be close to the true probability, which can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution."
