    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (sqrt(2)/2)^n * n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor this problem, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2)/2)^10 * 10\n\nFirst, let's calculate (sqrt(2)/2)^10:\n\n(sqrt(2)/2)^10 = (2^0.5 / 2)^10 = 2^(10*0.5 - 10) = 2^(-5) = 1/32\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (1/32) * 10 = 10/32 = 5/16\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 5/16 units."
