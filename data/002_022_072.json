    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube (the outer radius minus half the difference between the outer and inner radii), and r is the radius of the tube (half the difference between the outer and inner radii).\n\nFirst, we need to find R and r:\n\nR = (outer radius - inner radius) / 2 + inner radius\nR = (6 - 4) / 2 + 4\nR = 2 / 2 + 4\nR = 1 + 4\nR = 5 cm\n\nr = (outer radius - inner radius) / 2\nr = (6 - 4) / 2\nr = 2 / 2\nr = 1 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 * 1^2\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 5 * 1\nVolume = 10 * π^2 cm^3\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 98.696 cm^3."
