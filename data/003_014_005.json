    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical displacement of the given function y = 3sin(2x - π/6), we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D.\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 3, so the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\nPhase Shift (C): The phase shift is the value of C in the general form. In this case, C = π/6. Since the general form is written as (x - C), the phase shift is actually positive π/6, which means the graph is shifted to the right by π/6.\n\nVertical Displacement (D): The vertical displacement is the value of D in the general form. In this case, there is no vertical displacement, so D = 0.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, the phase shift is π/6 to the right, and there is no vertical displacement."
