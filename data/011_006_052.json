    "message_1": "Consider a game where you have a jar containing 12 red balls, 8 green balls, and 6 blue balls. You randomly draw 5 balls from the jar without replacement. \nHow many ways can you draw:\na) 3 red balls, 1 green ball, and 1 blue ball?\nb) At least 2 red balls?",
    "message_2": "a) To draw 3 red balls, 1 green ball, and 1 blue ball, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFor 3 red balls from 12 red balls: C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = 220\nFor 1 green ball from 8 green balls: C(8, 1) = 8! / (1! * 7!) = 8\nFor 1 blue ball from 6 blue balls: C(6, 1) = 6! / (1! * 5!) = 6\n\nNow, multiply the combinations together: 220 * 8 * 6 = 10560 ways\n\nb) To find the number of ways to draw at least 2 red balls, we can consider the cases of drawing exactly 2 red balls, 3 red balls, 4 red balls, and 5 red balls.\n\nCase 1: 2 red balls\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!) = 66\nNow we need to draw 3 more balls from the remaining 14 (8 green and 6 blue). We can do this in C(14, 3) ways:\nC(14, 3) = 14! / (3! * 11!) = 364\nSo, there are 66 * 364 = 24024 ways to draw exactly 2 red balls.\n\nCase 2: 3 red balls\nWe already calculated this in part a): 10560 ways\n\nCase 3: 4 red balls\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = 495\nNow we need to draw 1 more ball from the remaining 14 (8 green and 6 blue). We can do this in C(14, 1) ways:\nC(14, 1) = 14! / (1! * 13!) = 14\nSo, there are 495 * 14 = 6930 ways to draw exactly 4 red balls.\n\nCase 4: 5 red balls\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * 7!) = 792\nThere is only 1 way to draw 5 red balls, so there are 792 ways to draw exactly 5 red balls.\n\nNow, add up the ways for each case: 24024 + 10560 + 6930 + 792 = 42306 ways to draw at least 2 red balls."
