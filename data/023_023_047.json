    "message_2": "The given signal is already in the form of a sum of sinusoids, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and frequency of the individual components. We can directly read the amplitudes and frequencies from the equation:\n\nf(t) = 5 cos(2πt) + 3 sin(4πt) - 2 cos(6πt) - 4 sin(8πt)\n\nThere are four components in the signal:\n\n1. Component 1: Amplitude = 5, Frequency = 2π (or 1 Hz)\n2. Component 2: Amplitude = 3, Frequency = 4π (or 2 Hz)\n3. Component 3: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = 6π (or 3 Hz)\n4. Component 4: Amplitude = 4, Frequency = 8π (or 4 Hz)\n\nSo, the individual components of the signal are:\n\n1. 5 cos(2πt) with amplitude 5 and frequency 1 Hz\n2. 3 sin(4πt) with amplitude 3 and frequency 2 Hz\n3. -2 cos(6πt) with amplitude 2 and frequency 3 Hz\n4. -4 sin(8πt) with amplitude 4 and frequency 4 Hz"
