Suppose that $a \\in H^1(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ and $b \\in H^2(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ are cohomology classes such that $a\\smile a = 0$ and $a\\smile b = 1$. \n\nDetermine the value of the following integral: \n\n$$\\int_{\\partial X} a\\smile a$$",
    "message_2": "To determine the value of the integral, we will use the fact that the integral of a cohomology class over a boundary is related to the integral of its Poincaré dual over the manifold.\n\nSince $a \\smile a = 0$, the Poincaré dual of $a \\smile a$ is also zero. Therefore, the integral of the Poincaré dual of $a \\smile a$ over the manifold X is zero:\n\n$$\\int_X PD(a \\smile a) = 0$$\n\nNow, we use the fact that the integral of a cohomology class over a boundary is equal to the integral of its Poincaré dual over the manifold:\n\n$$\\int_{\\partial X} a \\smile a = \\int_X PD(a \\smile a)$$\n\nSince the right-hand side is zero, we have:\n\n$$\\int_{\\partial X} a \\smile a = 0$$"
