    "message_1": "Alice and Bob want to communicate securely using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a prime number p = 23 and a primitive root of p, g = 5. She also chooses a secret key a = 6. Bob chooses the same values of p and g, and a secret key b = 15. What is the shared secret key that they can use to encrypt their messages?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S_A = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S_B = A^b mod p\n\nIf the protocol works correctly, S_A and S_B should be equal, and that will be the shared secret key.\n\nLet's compute the values:\n\n1. A = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\n2. B = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n3. S_A = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\n4. S_B = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key is 2. Alice and Bob can use this key to encrypt their messages."
