    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and frequency of the fundamental component of the rectangular pulse waveform using Fourier Transform, we first need to understand that the Fourier Transform of a rectangular pulse is a sinc function. The sinc function is defined as sinc(x) = sin(πx) / (πx).\n\nThe Fourier Transform of a rectangular pulse with duration T and amplitude A is given by:\n\nX(f) = A * T * sinc(πfT)\n\nIn this case, the duration T = 5 microseconds = 5 * 10^(-6) seconds, and the amplitude A = 5 volts.\n\nThe fundamental frequency (f1) of a rectangular pulse is the inverse of its duration:\n\nf1 = 1 / T = 1 / (5 * 10^(-6)) = 200,000 Hz\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude of the fundamental component by evaluating the sinc function at the fundamental frequency:\n\nX(f1) = A * T * sinc(πf1T) = 5 * (5 * 10^(-6)) * sinc(π(200,000)(5 * 10^(-6)))\n\nX(f1) = 25 * 10^(-6) * sinc(π)\n\nSince sinc(π) = 0, the amplitude of the fundamental component is:\n\nX(f1) = 0\n\nSo, the amplitude of the fundamental component is 0 volts, and the frequency of the fundamental component is 200,000 Hz."
