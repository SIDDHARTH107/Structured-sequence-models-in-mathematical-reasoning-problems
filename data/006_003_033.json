    "message_2": "There is only 1 King of Hearts in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing the King of Hearts is 1 out of 52, which can be represented as a fraction:\n\n1/52\n\nThis can also be represented as a decimal or percentage:\n\n0.01923 (rounded to 5 decimal places) or 1.923% (rounded to 3 decimal places)."
