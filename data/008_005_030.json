    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  1 |  9 ]\n[ 4  2  3 | 15 ]\n[ 1  1  1 |  5 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: We want to get a \"1\" in the top-left corner (pivot position). We can divide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  4.5 ]\n[ 4  2    3  | 15   ]\n[ 1  1    1  |  5   ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Now we want to get zeros below the pivot. We can subtract the first row from the third row and subtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  4.5 ]\n[ 0 -4   1   |  3   ]\n[ 0 -0.5  0.5 |  0.5 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Now we want to get a \"1\" in the second row and second column (next pivot position). We can divide the second row by -4:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  4.5 ]\n[ 0  1   -0.25| -0.75]\n[ 0 -0.5  0.5 |  0.5 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Now we want to get zeros above and below the second pivot. We can add 0.5 times the second row to the third row and subtract 1.5 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0    0.875 |  5.625 ]\n[ 0  1   -0.25  | -0.75  ]\n[ 0  0    0.375 | -0.125 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Now we want to get a \"1\" in the third row and third column (last pivot position). We can divide the third row by 0.375:\n\n```\n[ 1  0    0.875 |  5.625 ]\n[ 0  1   -0.25  | -0.75  ]\n[ 0  0    1     | -0.333 ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Now we want to get zeros above the last pivot. We can add 0.25 times the third row to the second row and subtract 0.875 times the third row from the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | -1 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | -0.333 ]\n```\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = 6, y = -1, and z â‰ˆ -0.333."
