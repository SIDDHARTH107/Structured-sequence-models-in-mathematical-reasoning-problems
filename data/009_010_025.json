    "message_1": "A stock trader holds a European call option on a stock with a strike price of $60$. The stock price follows the Black-Scholes model with a volatility of $0.25$, a risk-free interest rate of $2.5\\%$, and a time to expiration of $0.5$ years. The current stock price is $65$. What is the price of the call option according to the Black-Scholes equation?",
    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option, we will use the Black-Scholes formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS = current stock price = $65\nX = strike price = $60\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.025\nT = time to expiration = 0.5 years\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nln(x) = natural logarithm of x\nσ = volatility = 0.25\nsqrt(x) = square root of x\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(65/60) + (0.025 + (0.25^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.25 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ 0.7104\n\nd2 = 0.7104 - 0.25 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ 0.5354\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2) using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:\n\nN(0.7104) ≈ 0.7611\nN(0.5354) ≈ 0.7040\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\nC = 65 * 0.7611 - 60 * e^(-0.025 * 0.5) * 0.7040\nC ≈ 65 * 0.7611 - 60 * 0.9876 * 0.7040\nC ≈ 49.4715 - 41.7216\nC ≈ 7.7499\n\nThe price of the call option according to the Black-Scholes equation is approximately $7.75."
