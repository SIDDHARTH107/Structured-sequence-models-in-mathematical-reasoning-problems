    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. The production process uses two machines M1 and M2. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours on machine M1 and 1 hour on machine M2, while each unit of product B requires 1 hour on machine M1 and 3 hours on machine M2. In a particular week, the company has 200 hours of available time on machine M1 and 160 hours of available time on machine M2. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of products A and B should it produce? The profit per unit of product A is $5 and the profit per unit of product B is $7. However, due to noisy data, the available time on machine M1 and M2 could fluctuate by up to 10% from the given values.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the available time on machines M1 and M2 are:\n\n2x + y <= 200 (M1 constraint)\nx + 3y <= 160 (M2 constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nWe also need to consider the fluctuation of up to 10% in the available time on machines M1 and M2. The minimum and maximum available times for M1 are 180 hours and 220 hours, and for M2 are 144 hours and 176 hours.\n\nConsidering the minimum available times, the constraints become:\n\n2x + y <= 180 (M1 constraint)\nx + 3y <= 144 (M2 constraint)\n\nConsidering the maximum available times, the constraints become:\n\n2x + y <= 220 (M1 constraint)\nx + 3y <= 176 (M2 constraint)\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region for these constraints and then find the optimal solution for the objective function.\n\nFor the original constraints:\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of the inequalities 2x + y <= 200 and x + 3y <= 160. The corner points of this region are (0,0), (0,53.33), (100,0), and (40,80).\n\nFor the minimum available times constraints:\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of the inequalities 2x + y <= 180 and x + 3y <= 144. The corner points of this region are (0,0), (0,48), (90,0), and (36,72).\n\nFor the maximum available times constraints:\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of the inequalities 2x + y <= 220 and x + 3y <= 176. The corner points of this region are (0,0), (0,58.67), (110,0), and (44,88).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 7y at each of these corner points:\n\nOriginal constraints:\nP(0,0) = 0\nP(0,53.33) = 373.31\nP(100,0) = 500\nP(40,80) = 760\n\nMinimum available times constraints:\nP(0,0) = 0\nP(0,48) = 336\nP(90,0) = 450\nP(36,72) = 684\n\nMaximum available times constraints:\nP(0,0) = 0\nP(0,58.67) = 410.69\nP(110,0) = 550\nP(44,88) = 836\n\nThe optimal solution for the original constraints is to produce 40 units of product A and 80 units of product B, with a profit of $760. However, due to the noisy data, the company should consider producing between 36 to 44 units of product A and 72 to 88 units of product B, with a profit ranging between $684 and $836."
