    "message_1": "A car is traveling along a straight road at a constant acceleration of 5 m/s². Its initial velocity is 20 m/s. Use calculus to find the velocity and acceleration of the car after 7 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car after 7 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv(t) = v0 + at\n\nwhere v(t) is the velocity at time t, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nIn this case, v0 = 20 m/s, a = 5 m/s², and t = 7 seconds.\n\nv(7) = 20 + 5(7)\nv(7) = 20 + 35\nv(7) = 55 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the car after 7 seconds is 55 m/s.\n\nSince the acceleration is constant, it remains the same at 5 m/s² after 7 seconds."
