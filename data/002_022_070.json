    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 2 cm and a major radius of 4 cm. Calculate its volume in cm^3.",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 4 cm and r = 2 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 4 * (2^3)\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 4 * 8\n\nV = 64 * π^2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14159:\n\nV ≈ 64 * (3.14159)^2\n\nV ≈ 64 * 9.8696\n\nV ≈ 631.67 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 631.67 cubic centimeters."
