    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 40 = 2^3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5.\n\nNow, let P_5 and P_2 be 5-Sylow and 2-Sylow subgroups of G, respectively. Since n_5 = 1, P_5 is a normal subgroup of G. If n_2 = 1, then P_2 is also a normal subgroup of G. In this case, we have a normal subgroup of order 5 and a normal subgroup of order 8. Their intersection is trivial since their orders are coprime, so by the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_5 and P_2, which is C_5 × C_8 or C_5 × (C_4 × C_2). By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G is isomorphic to C_40 or C_20 × C_2. The latter case is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_20, so we have cases (a) and (b).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where n_2 = 5. In this case, there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups, each of order 8. Let's denote them by P_2^1, P_2^2, ..., P_2^5. Since P_5 is normal in G, we can define the action of G on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_5. The kernel of this homomorphism, K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in all P_2^i. Since the intersection of all P_2^i is trivial, K must be trivial or of order 2.\n\nIf K is trivial, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_5. However, the order of S_5 is 120, which is not divisible by 40, so this case is not possible.\n\nIf K has order 2, then G/K is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_5 of order 20. The only such subgroup is the alternating group A_5, which is simple. Therefore, G is an extension of A_5 by a group of order 2. In this case, G is a non-abelian group of order 40 with a center Z(G) of order 2, which corresponds to case (c).\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\na) C40\nb) D20\nc) a non-abelian group of order 40 where |Z(G)| = 2."
