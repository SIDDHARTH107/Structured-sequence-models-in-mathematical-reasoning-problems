    "message_1": "A factory has three machines: A, B, and C. The daily probability of an accident occurring on machine A is 0.05, on machine B is 0.07, and on machine C is 0.03. What is the probability that at least one accident will occur in the factory?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the probability that no accidents occur on any of the machines, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring on machine A is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\nThe probability of no accident occurring on machine B is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93.\nThe probability of no accident occurring on machine C is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nThe probability of no accidents occurring on all three machines is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n0.95 * 0.93 * 0.97 = 0.857295.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one accident occurring:\n\n1 - 0.857295 = 0.142705.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one accident will occur in the factory is approximately 0.1427 or 14.27%."
