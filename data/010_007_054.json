    "message_1": "Consider the space X obtained by identifying the edges of a square. Let p: Y → X be a covering map, where Y is path connected, and let y0 ∈ Y be such that p(y0) is a vertex of the square X. If the fundamental group of the space X is isomorphic to Z/2Z, what is the fundamental group of the space Y?",
    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of the space Y, we will use the covering space theory. Since p: Y → X is a covering map, we know that the fundamental group of the base space X, denoted as π₁(X), is isomorphic to Z/2Z. We are also given that Y is path-connected.\n\nLet's consider the vertex of the square X, which we will call x0, and its preimage p^(-1)(x0) in Y. Since p(y0) = x0, we know that y0 is an element of p^(-1)(x0). Let's denote the fiber p^(-1)(x0) as {y0, y1, ..., yn}, where n is the number of sheets in the covering.\n\nNow, let's consider the lifting correspondence between the subgroups of π₁(Y, y0) and the subgroups of π₁(X, x0) that contain p_*(π₁(Y, y0)), where p_* is the induced homomorphism of the covering map p. Since π₁(X, x0) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, it has only two subgroups: the trivial group {1} and itself, Z/2Z.\n\nIf p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) is the trivial group {1}, then π₁(Y, y0) would be isomorphic to π₁(X, x0), which is Z/2Z. However, this would imply that the covering map p is a homeomorphism, and Y and X would be homeomorphic spaces. This contradicts the fact that Y is a covering space of X, and they are not homeomorphic.\n\nTherefore, p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) must be equal to π₁(X, x0), which is isomorphic to Z/2Z. Since p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) is a normal subgroup of π₁(Y, y0), we can use the following isomorphism theorem:\n\nπ₁(Y, y0) / p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) ≅ π₁(X, x0)\n\nSince p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) ≅ Z/2Z, we have:\n\nπ₁(Y, y0) / (Z/2Z) ≅ Z/2Z\n\nNow, we need to determine the group π₁(Y, y0) that satisfies this isomorphism. The group that satisfies this isomorphism is the direct product of Z/2Z with itself, which is Z/2Z × Z/2Z. This is because (Z/2Z × Z/2Z) / (Z/2Z) ≅ Z/2Z, where the quotient is taken with respect to the normal subgroup {(1,1), (0,1)}.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the space Y is π₁(Y, y0) ≅ Z/2Z × Z/2Z."
