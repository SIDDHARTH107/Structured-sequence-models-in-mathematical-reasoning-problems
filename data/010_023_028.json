    "message_1": "What is the minimum number of crossings required to tie a given knot?\n\nFor example, if you provide the student with a diagram of a knot, they would need to determine the minimum number of crossings required to create that knot. This problem involves applying the concepts of geometric topology and knot theory to quantify the complexity of knots.",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I would need to see the specific knot diagram to determine the minimum number of crossings required to tie that knot. Knots can be classified by their crossing number, which is the smallest number of crossings in any diagram representing the knot. Different knots have different crossing numbers, and without a specific knot diagram, it is impossible to provide a general answer.\n\nIf you can provide a specific knot or its name, I can help you determine the minimum number of crossings required to tie that knot."
