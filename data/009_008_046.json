    "message_1": "A string of length 10m is fixed at both ends. It has a mass of 0.1kg and is under a tension of 100N. Find the wave speed of the transverse waves on the string if the frequency is 50Hz.",
    "message_2": "To find the wave speed of the transverse waves on the string, we can use the formula:\n\nwave speed (v) = √(Tension (F) / Linear mass density (μ))\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. Linear mass density is defined as the mass per unit length of the string. We are given the mass (m) of the string as 0.1 kg and the length (L) as 10 m.\n\nLinear mass density (μ) = mass (m) / length (L)\nμ = 0.1 kg / 10 m\nμ = 0.01 kg/m\n\nNow, we can find the wave speed (v) using the formula:\n\nwave speed (v) = √(Tension (F) / Linear mass density (μ))\nv = √(100 N / 0.01 kg/m)\nv = √(10000 m²/s²)\nv = 100 m/s\n\nThe wave speed of the transverse waves on the string is 100 m/s.\n\nNow, we are given the frequency (f) of the waves as 50 Hz. We can find the wavelength (λ) of the waves using the wave speed (v) and frequency (f) with the formula:\n\nwave speed (v) = frequency (f) × wavelength (λ)\n\nRearranging the formula to find the wavelength (λ):\n\nwavelength (λ) = wave speed (v) / frequency (f)\nλ = 100 m/s / 50 Hz\nλ = 2 m\n\nThe wavelength of the transverse waves on the string is 2 meters."
