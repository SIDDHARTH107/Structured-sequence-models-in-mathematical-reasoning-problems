    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to form a committee of 3 members from a group of 6 people, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (6 in this case), k is the number of people to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= 6! / (3!3!)\n= (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n= (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 20\n\nSo there are 20 ways to form a committee of 3 members from a group of 6 people. However, we need to account for the condition that one member is not eligible to serve on the committee again if they have served on it before.\n\nLet's assume that the person who cannot serve again is person A. We need to find the number of ways to form a committee without person A. This leaves us with 5 people to choose from, and we still need to choose 3 members.\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3!2!)\n= (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n= (5 × 4) / (2 × 1)\n= 10\n\nSo there are 10 ways to form a committee of 3 members from the remaining 5 people, without including person A who has already served on the committee.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 20 - 10 = 10 ways to form a committee of 3 members from a group of 6 people, where one member is not eligible to serve on the committee again if they have served on it before."
