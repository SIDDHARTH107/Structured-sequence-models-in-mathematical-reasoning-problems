    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of G-invariant regular functions on V, we first need to determine the G-invariant functions. Recall that a function f(x, y) is G-invariant if f(g(x, y)) = f(x, y) for all g in G and all (x, y) in V.\n\nLet f(x, y) be a G-invariant regular function on V. Then, we must have:\n\nf(-x, y) = f(x, y) for all (x, y) in V.\n\nNow, consider the coordinate ring of V, which is the quotient ring K[V] = K[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3 + x^2). In this ring, we have the relation y^2 = x^3 - x^2.\n\nSince f(x, y) is G-invariant, it must be a polynomial in x and y that is symmetric with respect to x. That is, f(x, y) = f(-x, y). This implies that f(x, y) can only contain even powers of x.\n\nLet's write f(x, y) as a polynomial in x and y:\n\nf(x, y) = a_0(y) + a_2(y)x^2 + a_4(y)x^4 + ...\n\nwhere a_i(y) are polynomials in y.\n\nNow, we need to make sure that f(x, y) is a regular function on V. This means that f(x, y) must not have any poles on V. Since V is an affine variety, this is equivalent to requiring that f(x, y) does not have any denominators involving the defining equation of V (i.e., y^2 - x^3 + x^2).\n\nNotice that the relation y^2 = x^3 - x^2 in K[V] allows us to replace any even power of y with a polynomial in x. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that f(x, y) is a polynomial in x only:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + a_2x^2 + a_4x^4 + ...\n\nNow, since f(x) is a polynomial in x with even powers only, it is automatically G-invariant. Thus, the space of G-invariant regular functions on V is the space of polynomials in x with even powers only.\n\nThe dimension of this space is infinite, as there is no bound on the degree of the polynomials. Therefore, the dimension of the space of G-invariant regular functions on V is infinite."
