Each unit of Product A yields a profit of $10 and requires 1 hour of work for Assembly and 2 hours of work for Painting. Each unit of Product B yields a profit of $15 and requires 2 hours of work for Assembly and 1 hour of work for Painting.\n\nThe company has 100 hours available for Assembly and 80 hours available for Painting. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the available hours for Assembly and Painting can be represented as:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 100 (Assembly)\n2x + 1y ≤ 80 (Painting)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nTo find the feasible region, we'll first find the intercepts of the constraint inequalities:\n\nFor the Assembly constraint (1x + 2y ≤ 100):\nWhen x = 0, y = 50\nWhen y = 0, x = 100\n\nFor the Painting constraint (2x + 1y ≤ 80):\nWhen x = 0, y = 80\nWhen y = 0, x = 40\n\nNow we'll find the intersection point of the two constraint lines:\n\n1x + 2y = 100\n2x + 1y = 80\n\nSolving this system of equations:\n\ny = 100 - x\n2x + (100 - x) = 80\nx = 20\n\ny = 100 - 20 = 80\n\nSo the intersection point is (20, 80).\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 50), (20, 80), and (40, 0).\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 50) = 10(0) + 15(50) = $750\nP(20, 80) = 10(20) + 15(80) = $200 + $1200 = $1400\nP(40, 0) = 10(40) + 15(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit is $1400, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B."
