    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a polynomial equation, we need to set the function equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx^4 - 4x^3 - 16x^2 + 32x + 60 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, and finding the exact roots can be quite challenging. However, we can try to find possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (60 in this case) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (1 in this case).\n\nFactors of 60: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±30, ±60\n\nWe can test these possible rational roots using synthetic division or by plugging them into the equation. After testing, we find that none of these rational roots work.\n\nSince there are no rational roots, we will have to resort to numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator, to approximate the x-intercepts.\n\nUsing a graphing calculator or software, we find the following approximate x-intercepts:\n\nx ≈ -1.1742\nx ≈ 1.7321\nx ≈ 3.2210\nx ≈ 4.2211\n\nThese are the approximate x-intercepts of the given polynomial equation."
