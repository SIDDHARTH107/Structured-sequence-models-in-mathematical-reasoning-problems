    "message_2": "To find the degree of the projective variety, we need to find the maximum number of intersection points of the variety with a generic line in the projective plane. This is equivalent to finding the maximum total degree of the equation.\n\nThe given equation is $2x^2y-3xz^2+y^3=0$. Let's find the total degree of each term:\n\n1. For the term $2x^2y$, the total degree is $2+1=3$.\n2. For the term $-3xz^2$, the total degree is $1+2=3$.\n3. For the term $y^3$, the total degree is $3$.\n\nSince all terms have the same total degree, the degree of the projective variety is equal to the maximum total degree, which is $3$. Therefore, the degree of the given projective variety is $\\boxed{3}$."
