    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\n2x = 8 - 3y\n\nx = (8 - 3y) / 2\n\nNow we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n-4x + 5y = 3\n\n-4((8 - 3y) / 2) + 5y = 3\n\n-4(8 - 3y) / 2 + 5y = 3\n\nNow we'll simplify the equation:\n\n-2(8 - 3y) + 5y = 3\n\n-16 + 6y + 5y = 3\n\n11y = 19\n\ny = 19 / 11\n\nNow we'll substitute the value of y back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = (8 - 3y) / 2\n\nx = (8 - 3(19 / 11)) / 2\n\nx = (8 - 57 / 11) / 2\n\nx = (33 / 11) / 2\n\nx = 3 / 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3/2 and y = 19/11."
