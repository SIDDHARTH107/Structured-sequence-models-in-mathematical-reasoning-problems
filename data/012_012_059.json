    "message_1": "Consider a simple graph G with 10 vertices and 13 edges. Determine the girth of G if one exists.",
    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor( (2 * |E|) / |V| )\n\nwhere |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn this case, |E| = 13 and |V| = 10. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor( (2 * 13) / 10 )\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor( 26 / 10 )\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor( 2.6 )\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 2\ngirth(G) ≤ 4\n\nSo, the girth of G is at most 4. Since the smallest possible cycle in a simple graph has a length of 3, the girth of G must be either 3 or 4 if a cycle exists."
