Assuming that the student wants to have a portfolio with an overall risk of 15%, determine the optimal allocation of the student's funds in each stock to maximize the expected return of their portfolio.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal allocation of funds in Stock A and Stock B such that the overall risk of the portfolio is 15% and the expected return is maximized.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the total investment in Stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of the total investment in Stock B.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\nRp = x * 8% + (1-x) * 12%\n\nThe risk of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the formula:\nσp = √(x^2 * σa^2 + (1-x)^2 * σb^2)\n\nGiven that the overall risk of the portfolio should be 15%, we can set up the equation:\n√(x^2 * 10%^2 + (1-x)^2 * 20%^2) = 15%\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\nx^2 * 10%^2 + (1-x)^2 * 20%^2 = 15%^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx^2 * 0.01 + (1 - 2x + x^2) * 0.04 = 0.0225\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n0.01x^2 + 0.04 - 0.08x + 0.04x^2 = 0.0225\n\nCombining terms, we get:\n0.05x^2 - 0.08x + 0.0175 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nx = (0.08 ± √(0.08^2 - 4 * 0.05 * 0.0175)) / (2 * 0.05)\n\nx = (0.08 ± √(0.0064 - 0.0035)) / 0.1\n\nx = (0.08 ± √0.0029) / 0.1\n\nx ≈ 0.6 or x ≈ 0.583\n\nSince x represents the proportion of the total investment in Stock A, it should be between 0 and 1. In this case, both values are within the acceptable range. However, we are looking for the allocation that maximizes the expected return. We can plug both values of x back into the expected return formula and see which one yields a higher return:\n\nRp = 0.6 * 8% + (1-0.6) * 12% = 9.6%\nRp = 0.583 * 8% + (1-0.583) * 12% ≈ 9.58%\n\nSince 9.6% > 9.58%, we choose x = 0.6 as the optimal allocation.\n\nTherefore, the student should invest 60% of their funds in Stock A and 40% of their funds in Stock B. In terms of dollar amounts, this means investing $60,000 in Stock A and $40,000 in Stock B to maximize the expected return of their portfolio while maintaining an overall risk of 15%."
