    "message_2": "Let G be a non-abelian group of order 27. Since the order of G is 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is either 1 or 4. If there were only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it would be normal in G, and G would be a semi-direct product of two abelian groups, which would make G abelian, contradicting the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, there must be 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nLet P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the order of P is 9, the possible structures for P are either C_9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). If P were isomorphic to C_9, then it would have an element of order 9, which would imply that G has an element of order 9. However, in a non-abelian group of order 27, all elements have orders 1, 3, or 27, so this is not possible. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to C_3 × C_3.\n\nNow, let's count the elements of order 3 in G. Since P is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, it has 2 * 3 - 1 = 5 elements of order 3 (excluding the identity element). There are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, but we must be careful not to double-count elements that are in more than one subgroup. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), we can conclude that there are no shared elements of order 3 among the Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nThus, the total number of elements of order 3 in G is 4 * 5 = 20."
