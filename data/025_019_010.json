    "message_2": "A Fano surface X of degree d in P^3 is a smooth, irreducible, non-degenerate surface of degree d in the projective 3-space P^3, and it is Fano, meaning that its anticanonical divisor is ample. The maximum number of lines that can be contained in X is given by the Fano-Iskovskikh-Manin formula:\n\nN(d) = (d-1)(d-2)(3d-4)/6\n\nwhere N(d) is the maximum number of lines that can be contained in a Fano surface of degree d in P^3."
