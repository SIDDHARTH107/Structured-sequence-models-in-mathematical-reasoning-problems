    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of the graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. Vertex 2 - Vertex 3 (weight 1)\n2. Vertex 1 - Vertex 3 (weight 2)\n3. Vertex 4 - Vertex 5 (weight 3)\n4. Vertex 3 - Vertex 4 (weight 4)\n5. Vertex 1 - Vertex 2 (weight 5)\n6. Vertex 2 - Vertex 4 (weight 6)\n7. Vertex 3 - Vertex 5 (weight 9)\n\nNow, we add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add Vertex 2 - Vertex 3 (weight 1)\n2. Add Vertex 1 - Vertex 3 (weight 2)\n3. Add Vertex 4 - Vertex 5 (weight 3)\n\nAt this point, if we add the edge Vertex 3 - Vertex 4 (weight 4), it would create a cycle, so we skip it.\n\n4. Add Vertex 1 - Vertex 2 (weight 5)\n\nNow, all vertices are connected, and we have our minimum spanning tree:\n\n- Vertex 1 - Vertex 3 (weight 2)\n- Vertex 1 - Vertex 2 (weight 5)\n- Vertex 2 - Vertex 3 (weight 1)\n- Vertex 4 - Vertex 5 (weight 3)\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 2 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 11."
