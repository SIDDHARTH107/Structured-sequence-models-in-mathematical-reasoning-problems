    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 1) + log(x - 3) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nStep 1: Combine the logarithms using the product rule.\nThe product rule states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog((x + 1)(x - 3)) = 2\n\nStep 2: Remove the logarithm using exponentiation.\nTo remove the logarithm, we can use the property that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to a = b^c. Since the base of the logarithm is not specified, it is assumed to be 10. So, we have:\n\n(x + 1)(x - 3) = 10^2\n\nStep 3: Expand and simplify the equation.\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 3x + x - 3 = 100\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3 = 100\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 103 = 0\n\nStep 4: Solve the quadratic equation.\nNow we have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -103. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-103))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 ± √(4 + 412)) / 2\n\nx = (2 ± √416) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (2 + √416) / 2 and x = (2 - √416) / 2\n\nHowever, since we have a logarithm of (x - 3) in the original equation, we must ensure that x > 3 to have a valid solution (as the logarithm of a negative number is undefined). \n\nChecking the two solutions, we find that only x = (2 + √416) / 2 satisfies this condition. Therefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\nx = (2 + √416) / 2"
