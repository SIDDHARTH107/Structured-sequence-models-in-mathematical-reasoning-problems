    "message_1": "Suppose you have an elliptic curve represented by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x$ and a point $P = (1,1)$ on the curve. Find the value of the theta function $\\theta(P)$ at $P$ for the curve.",
    "message_2": "The theta function is typically used in the context of complex elliptic curves and their associated lattice structures. However, the elliptic curve given in the problem, $y^2 = x^3 - x$, is a real elliptic curve. Therefore, the theta function is not directly applicable to this curve.\n\nIf you meant to ask for a different property or invariant of the elliptic curve, please clarify the question."
