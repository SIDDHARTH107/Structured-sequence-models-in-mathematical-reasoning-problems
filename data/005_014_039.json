    "message_1": "A group of students take a test with 20 questions. The teacher suspects that some of the questions may be related to a specific topic. Using factor analysis, the teacher determines that there are two factors, one related to the specific topic and the other unrelated. The teacher also determines that the first 10 questions measure Factor 1, while the remaining 10 questions measure Factor 2. The teacher calculates that the total score of each student is the sum of the scores obtained in each factor, with the score of Factor 1 being twice as important as the score of Factor 2. \n\nIf a student gets 7 correct answers out of the first 10 questions (Factor 1), and 5 correct answers out of the remaining 10 questions (Factor 2), what would be their total score out of 40?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total score, we need to consider the weight of each factor. Since Factor 1 is twice as important as Factor 2, we can represent this by multiplying the score of Factor 1 by 2.\n\nFactor 1 score: 7 correct answers\nFactor 2 score: 5 correct answers\n\nWeighted score for Factor 1: 7 * 2 = 14\nWeighted score for Factor 2: 5 * 1 = 5\n\nTotal score: 14 (Factor 1) + 5 (Factor 2) = 19\n\nThe student's total score would be 19 out of 40."
