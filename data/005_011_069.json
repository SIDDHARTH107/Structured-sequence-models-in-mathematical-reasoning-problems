They take a sample of 50 products and find that the average weight of the sample is 100 grams with a standard deviation of 5 grams. Determine a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the products produced by this company.",
    "message_2": "To determine a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the products, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation of the sample\nn = sample size\n\nIn this case, we have:\nx̄ = 100 grams\nσ = 5 grams\nn = 50\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 100 ± (1.96 * (5 / √50))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value inside the parentheses:\n\n5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, multiply this value by the Z-score:\n\n1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, add and subtract this value from the sample mean to find the confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = 100 - 1.3859 ≈ 98.6141 grams\nUpper limit = 100 + 1.3859 ≈ 101.3859 grams\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the products produced by this company is approximately (98.6141, 101.3859) grams."
