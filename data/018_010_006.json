    "message_2": "First, we find the Cartesian product of A and B, which is denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the sets A and B separately. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either A or B.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, we need to show that the product of (A ∪ B) equals the union of the Cartesian products of A and B. To do this, let's first find the Cartesian product of (A ∪ B) with itself:\n\n(A ∪ B) x (A ∪ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the Cartesian products of A and B:\n\nA x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\nB x B = {(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nA x A ∪ B x B = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNotice that (A ∪ B) x (A ∪ B) contains all the ordered pairs in A x A ∪ B x B, but it also contains additional ordered pairs that involve elements from both A and B. Therefore, the product of (A ∪ B) does not equal the union of the Cartesian products of A and B.\n\n(A ∪ B) x (A ∪ B) ≠ A x A ∪ B x B"
