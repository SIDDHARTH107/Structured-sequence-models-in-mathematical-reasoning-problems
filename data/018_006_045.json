    "message_2": "Let U be the universal set with 45 elements. Since A' is the complement of A, it contains all the elements in U that are not in A. By definition of the complement, A and A' have no elements in common, so their intersection is an empty set (A ∩ A' = ∅).\n\nThe cardinality of A is 25, and since A' contains all the other elements in U, the cardinality of A' is (45 - 25) = 20.\n\nNow, let's find the cardinality of the union of A and A' (denoted as |A ∪ A'|). According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\n|A ∪ A'| = |A| + |A'| - |A ∩ A'|\n\nSince A ∩ A' = ∅, the cardinality of their intersection is 0:\n\n|A ∪ A'| = 25 + 20 - 0 = 45\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∪ A' = U. Since A and A' together contain all the elements in U, their union must also contain all the elements in U. Additionally, since A and A' have no elements in common, their union cannot contain any extra elements not in U. Therefore, A ∪ A' = U.\n\nIn conclusion, the cardinality of the union of A and A' is 45, and this union is equal to the universal set U."
