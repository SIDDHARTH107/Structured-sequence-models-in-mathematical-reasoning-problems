    "message_1": "A group of 10 volunteers needs to decide whether to contribute $20 each to purchase a gift for their supervisor or not. If at least 6 of them contribute, the gift will be purchased, and if not, no gift will be purchased. However, if the gift is purchased, the supervisor is willing to contribute $50 towards the purchase. If none of the volunteers contribute, they will all get in trouble with the supervisor, which would be equivalent to a loss of $100 each. If some volunteers contribute and the others don't, the contributors will have to bear the cost of the non-contributors. Given this situation, how many volunteers should contribute to maximize their payoffs?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible outcomes and the total cost for each volunteer in each scenario:\n\n1. No one contributes: Each volunteer loses $100.\n2. Less than 6 contribute: The gift is not purchased, and each volunteer loses $100.\n3. Exactly 6 contribute: The gift is purchased for $200 ($20 x 6 volunteers). The supervisor contributes $50, so the remaining cost is $150. The 6 contributors will have to bear the cost of the non-contributors, so each of the 6 contributors will pay $25 ($150 / 6). The 4 non-contributors will have no cost.\n4. More than 6 contribute: The gift is purchased, and the supervisor contributes $50. The more volunteers contribute, the less each contributor has to pay. However, the total cost remains the same ($150).\n\nTo maximize the payoffs for the volunteers, they should aim for the scenario where the gift is purchased, and the cost is distributed among the contributors. In this case, the best scenario is when exactly 6 volunteers contribute, and each of them pays $25. The other 4 volunteers will have no cost."
