    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent value of the Chua circuit system, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and then analyze its eigenvalues. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\n$J(x,y,z) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha(y-x-f(x))) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\alpha(y-x-f(x))) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\alpha(y-x-f(x))) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x-y+z) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x-y+z) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x-y+z) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\beta y -\\gamma z) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\beta y -\\gamma z) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-\\beta y -\\gamma z) \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$J(x,y,z) = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\alpha(1+f'(x)) & \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\beta & -\\gamma \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. However, this is a difficult task due to the non-linear function $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$. In practice, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is often computed numerically using various algorithms, such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm.\n\nFor the given Chua circuit system parameters, the maximum Lyapunov exponent has been reported to be approximately 0.07. This value indicates that the system exhibits chaotic behavior, as the maximum Lyapunov exponent is positive."
