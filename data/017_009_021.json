    "message_2": "Since G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. This means that there can only be one Sylow 3-subgroup in G, which we will denote as P. Since there is only one such subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of P. Since P is a group of order 9, it must be either cyclic (isomorphic to C9) or non-abelian. However, we know that all groups of prime order p (in this case, p=3^2) are abelian, as they are isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p. Therefore, P must be abelian and isomorphic to C9.\n\nSince P is normal in G and has the same order as G, we can conclude that P = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. There is no non-abelian group of order 9, as we have shown that any group of order 9 must be abelian and isomorphic to C9."
