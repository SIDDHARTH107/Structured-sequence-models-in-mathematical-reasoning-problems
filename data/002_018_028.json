    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 14 cm. What is the volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "The diameter of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 14 cm. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 7 cm.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSubstituting the radius value into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(7^3)\nV = (4/3)π(343)\nV ≈ 1436.76 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed inside the cube is approximately 1436.76 cubic centimeters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
