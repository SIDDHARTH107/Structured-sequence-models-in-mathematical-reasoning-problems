    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than 100, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers whose difference is greater than 100.\n\nThe prime gap between 370261 and 370373 is 112, which is the smallest prime gap greater than 100."
