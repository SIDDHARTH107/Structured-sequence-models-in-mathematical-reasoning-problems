To find the smallest prime gap between the primes 100 and 200, we first need to list the prime numbers in that range:\n\n101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199\n\nNow, we calculate the differences between consecutive prime numbers:\n\n103 - 101 = 2\n107 - 103 = 4\n109 - 107 = 2\n113 - 109 = 4\n127 - 113 = 14\n131 - 127 = 4\n137 - 131 = 6\n139 - 137 = 2\n149 - 139 = 10\n151 - 149 = 2\n157 - 151 = 6\n163 - 157 = 6\n167 - 163 = 4\n173 - 167 = 6\n179 - 173 = 6\n181 - 179 = 2\n191 - 181 = 10\n193 - 191 = 2\n197 - 193 = 4\n199 - 197 = 2\n\nThe smallest prime gap between the primes 100 and 200 is 2."
