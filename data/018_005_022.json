    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and its complement is the empty set, we first need to find the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. In other words, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nSo, A' = {7, 8, 9} since these are the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. Mathematically, A ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}.\n\nLet's check if there are any common elements between set A and set A':\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA' = {7, 8, 9}\n\nThere are no common elements between set A and set A'. Therefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set, denoted by ∅.\n\nSo, A ∩ A' = ∅.\n\nThis proves that the intersection of set A and its complement is the empty set."
