    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 10,000 bottles of soft drinks per day, and the probability of a certain type of defect occurring in a bottle is 0.005%. What is the probability that, out of a random sample of 100 bottles, exactly 2 bottles have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (defective bottles in this case) in n trials (total bottles sampled)\n- n is the number of trials (100 bottles in this case)\n- x is the number of successes (2 defective bottles in this case)\n- p is the probability of success (0.005% or 0.00005 as a decimal)\n- q is the probability of failure (1 - p, or 0.99995 in this case)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCx:\n\nn = 100\nx = 2\n\nn! = 100! = 100 × 99 × 98 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\nx! = 2! = 2 × 1\n(n-x)! = (100-2)! = 98! = 98 × 97 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nnCx = 100! / (2! * 98!)\nnCx = (100 × 99) / (2 × 1)\nnCx = 9900 / 2\nnCx = 4950\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(2) = (4950) * (0.00005^2) * (0.99995^98)\n\nP(2) = 4950 * 0.0000000025 * 0.990049917\n\nP(2) ≈ 0.0123\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 bottles have the defect in a random sample of 100 bottles is approximately 1.23%."
