    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 24 and let x be an element of order 12 in G. Since the order of x is 12, the cyclic subgroup generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩, has order 12. Now, let's consider the factor group G/⟨x⟩. \n\nSince |G| = 24 and |⟨x⟩| = 12, by Lagrange's theorem, we have |G/⟨x⟩| = |G| / |⟨x⟩| = 24 / 12 = 2. Thus, G/⟨x⟩ is a group of order 2, which means it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, Z_2. Let y be an element in G that is not in ⟨x⟩, then the coset y⟨x⟩ generates G/⟨x⟩.\n\nNow, let's consider the element z = yx. Since y and x are not in the same coset, z is not in ⟨x⟩. We will show that the order of z is 12. Since y and x are in different cosets, we have y^2 ∈ ⟨x⟩, which implies that y^2 = x^k for some integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 11. \n\nNow, let's compute the 12th power of z:\nz^12 = (yx)^12 = y^12x^12 = (y^2)^6x^12 = (x^k)^6x^12 = x^(6k+12).\n\nSince the order of x is 12, we have x^12 = e (the identity element). Thus, z^12 = x^(6k+12) = x^(6k) * x^12 = x^(6k) * e = x^(6k). We want to show that z^12 = e, which means x^(6k) = e.\n\nSince gcd(6,12) = 6, by Euler's theorem, we have x^(6k) = (x^6)^k = e^k = e. Thus, the order of z is 12.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H generated by z, denoted as ⟨z⟩. Since the order of z is 12, we have |⟨z⟩| = 12. Since ⟨x⟩ and ⟨z⟩ are both subgroups of G with order 12, and |G| = 24, we have |⟨x⟩ ∩ ⟨z⟩| = 12 / 2 = 6 by Lagrange's theorem. Let w be an element in ⟨x⟩ ∩ ⟨z⟩ with order 6. Then, we have w^6 = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the element u = yw. Since w ∈ ⟨x⟩ and y ∉ ⟨x⟩, u is not in ⟨x⟩. We will show that the order of u is 12. Since w ∈ ⟨x⟩ ∩ ⟨z⟩, we have w^6 = e and w^12 = e. Thus, we can compute the 12th power of u:\nu^12 = (yw)^12 = y^12w^12 = (y^2)^6w^12 = (x^k)^6w^12 = x^(6k)w^12 = x^(6k)e = e.\n\nThus, the order of u is 12. Since u and z both have order 12 and are not in ⟨x⟩, we have u ∈ ⟨z⟩. Therefore, ⟨z⟩ contains elements of order 6, which implies that ⟨z⟩ is not a cyclic group.\n\nNow, let's consider the group G' = ⟨x, y⟩, which is generated by x and y. Since x and y are in G, we have G' ⊆ G. Since |G'| = |⟨x⟩||⟨y⟩| / |⟨x⟩ ∩ ⟨y⟩| = 12 * 2 / 1 = 24, we have G' = G. Thus, G is generated by x and y.\n\nSince ⟨z⟩ is not a cyclic group and G is generated by x and y, G is a non-abelian group. Therefore, G is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 24."
