If it does not have a unique solution, write the system in the form of Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants. Then find the solution for the system by using the inverse of A.",

If the determinant is non-zero, the system has a unique solution.\n\ndet(A) = 1(3*7 - 5*4) - 1(2*7 - 4*3) + 1(2*5 - 3*3)\n       = 1(21 - 20) - 1(14 - 12) + 1(10 - 9)\n       = 1(1) - 1(2) + 1(1)\n       = 1 - 2 + 1\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant is zero, the system does not have a unique solution. Therefore, we cannot find the inverse of A to solve the system."
