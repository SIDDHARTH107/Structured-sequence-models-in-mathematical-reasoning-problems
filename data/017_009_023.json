    "message_2": "There is a mistake in the problem statement. All groups of order 9 are actually abelian, so it is not possible for G to be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 9. We will prove that G is isomorphic to the abelian group Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nSince G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup H of order 3. Let a ∈ H be an element of order 3, so H = {e, a, a^2}, where e is the identity element. Now, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 9 and |H| = 3, we have |G/H| = 9/3 = 3.\n\nLet bH be an element of G/H with order 3, where b ∈ G and b ∉ H. Then, G/H = {H, bH, (b^2)H}. Now, consider the internal direct product G = H × ⟨b⟩, where ⟨b⟩ is the cyclic subgroup generated by b. We have |H| = 3 and |⟨b⟩| = 3, so |H × ⟨b⟩| = 9.\n\nWe claim that H ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}. Suppose there exists an element x ∈ H ∩ ⟨b⟩ such that x ≠ e. Then, x = a^i = b^j for some 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2. But this implies that b^j ∈ H, which contradicts the choice of b ∉ H. Therefore, H ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}.\n\nSince G = H × ⟨b⟩ and H ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e}, G is isomorphic to the external direct product H ⊕ ⟨b⟩. Now, we have two cases:\n\n1. If the order of b is 3, then ⟨b⟩ = {e, b, b^2}, and G is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3.\n2. If the order of b is 9, then G is isomorphic to Z_9.\n\nIn both cases, G is isomorphic to an abelian group of order 9."
