    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 12 cm in this case. We will use the Law of Cosines to find this angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 8 cm, b = 10 cm, and c = 12 cm. We want to find the angle C.\n\n12² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(C)\n\n80 = 160 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 80 / 160\n\ncos(C) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 0.5. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos) to find this angle:\n\nC = arccos(0.5)\n\nC ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 60 degrees."
