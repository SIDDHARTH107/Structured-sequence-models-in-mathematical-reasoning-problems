    "message_2": "This is an isosceles triangle with two equal sides of length 13 cm each and the angle between them is 45 degrees. To find the length of the third side, we can use the Law of Cosines.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = b = 13 cm, and C = 45 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\n45 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 0.7854 radians\n\nNow we can apply the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 13² + 13² - 2 * 13 * 13 * cos(0.7854)\nc² = 169 + 169 - 338 * cos(0.7854)\nc² ≈ 169 + 169 - 338 * 0.7071\nc² ≈ 169 + 169 - 239.18\nc² ≈ 98.82\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc ≈ √98.82\nc ≈ 9.94 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 9.94 cm."
