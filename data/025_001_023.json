    "message_1": "Consider two algebraic curves given by the equations: \nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \nC2: x^2  - 2x + y^2 - 2y + 1 = 0.\n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, find the number of intersection points of C1 and C2 over the complex field.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of intersection points of C1 and C2 over the complex field using Bézout's theorem, we first need to find the degrees of the two curves.\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 is a circle with degree 2 (since the highest degree term is x^2 and y^2).\n\nC2: x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 2y + 1 = 0 can be rewritten as (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 1 = 0, which is also a circle with degree 2.\n\nNow, we can apply Bézout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity, over the complex field, assuming that the curves have no common components.\n\nIn this case, the degrees of both curves are 2, so the number of intersection points is 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 intersection points of C1 and C2 over the complex field."
