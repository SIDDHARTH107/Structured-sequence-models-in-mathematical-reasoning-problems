    "message_1": "If a graph G has 7 vertices and 12 edges, and each vertex has degree at least 2, what is the minimum possible number of connected components in G?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nSince each vertex has a degree of at least 2, we can distribute the degrees among the 7 vertices as follows:\n\n2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 12\n\nHowever, this configuration is not possible, as a vertex with a degree of 12 would require 12 other vertices to connect to, but we only have 6 other vertices in the graph. So, we need to redistribute the degrees in a way that satisfies the Handshaking Lemma and the given conditions.\n\nLet's try the following distribution:\n\n2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6\n\nThis configuration satisfies the Handshaking Lemma (sum of degrees is 24) and the condition that each vertex has a degree of at least 2. Now, let's analyze the connected components.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we can have the first four vertices with a degree of 2 forming a cycle, creating one connected component. The remaining three vertices with degrees 4, 6, and 6 can form another connected component.\n\nThus, the minimum possible number of connected components in G is 2."
