    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π], we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all the b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nFor an even function, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x))\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients a_0 and a_n.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫(f(x)) dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(n * x)) dx from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = |x|, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫(|x|) dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫(|x| * cos(n * x)) dx from -π to π\n\nNow, we can split the integrals into two parts, one for the interval [-π, 0] and the other for the interval [0, π]:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(-x) dx from -π to 0 + ∫(x) dx from 0 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(-x * cos(n * x)) dx from -π to 0 + ∫(x * cos(n * x)) dx from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we can solve the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-x^2/2)| from -π to 0 + (x^2/2)| from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(0 - (-π^2/2)) + (π^2/2 - 0)]\na_0 = (1/π) * (π^2)\na_0 = π\n\nFor a_n, we need to use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = cos(n * x) dx\nThen, du = dx and v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(-x * (1/n) * sin(n * x)| from -π to 0 + (x * (1/n) * sin(n * x)| from 0 to π) - ∫((1/n) * sin(n * x)) dx from -π to 0 + ∫((1/n) * sin(n * x)) dx from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(0 - 0) + (0 - 0) + (1/n^2) * ∫(sin(n * x)) dx from -π to 0 - (1/n^2) * ∫(sin(n * x)) dx from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * (-cos(n * x)/n)| from -π to 0 - (1/n^2) * (-cos(n * x)/n)| from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^3) * (cos(n * π) - 1) - (1/n^3) * (cos(n * π) - 1)]\n\na_n = (1/π) * (2/n^3) * (1 - cos(n * π))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |x|:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ((1/π) * (2/n^3) * (1 - cos(n * π)) * cos(n * x))\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π] with a jump discontinuity."
