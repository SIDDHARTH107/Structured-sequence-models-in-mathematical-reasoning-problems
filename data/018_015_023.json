    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nB × A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these two sets (A × B) ∩ (B × A):\n\n(A × B) ∩ (B × A) = {(2,2), (3,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the sets (B × A) ∩ (A × B):\n\n(B × A) ∩ (A × B) = {(2,2), (3,3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∩ (B × A) = (B × A) ∩ (A × B) = {(2,2), (3,3)}. However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection, as the original statement was incorrect. In this specific case, the intersection of the Cartesian products is the same, but it is important to note that the Cartesian products themselves (A × B and B × A) are not equal."
