    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose you intercepted a Hill cipher message encrypted using a 2x2 matrix and you know that the plaintext was composed of two letters from the English alphabet. The ciphertext you intercepted is 'BN'. The encryption function is C = KP where C is the ciphertext, K is the encryption key (i.e., 2x2 matrix), and P is the plaintext (i.e., 2x1 vector). Find the encryption key used to encrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "To find the encryption key, we first need to convert the ciphertext and plaintext into numerical values. We'll use the standard convention where A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25.\n\nCiphertext (C): 'BN' => B=1, N=13 => C = | 1 |\n                                           |13 |\n\nNow, we need to make an educated guess about the plaintext (P). Since we don't have enough information, let's assume the plaintext is 'AB'.\n\nPlaintext (P): 'AB' => A=0, B=1 => P = | 0 |\n                                         | 1 |\n\nNow, we have C = KP. To find K, we need to multiply both sides by the inverse of P:\n\nK = C * P^(-1)\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of P. Since P is a 2x2 matrix:\n\nP = | 0  1 |\n    | 1  0 |\n\nDeterminant of P = det(P) = (0 * 0) - (1 * 1) = -1\n\nSince the determinant is -1, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of -1 mod 26. In this case, it is 25.\n\nNow, we can find the adjugate of P:\n\nadj(P) = |  0  -1 |\n         | -1   0 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of P:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = 25 * |  0  -1 |\n                                      | -1   0 |\n\nP^(-1) = |  0 -25 |\n         |-25   0 |\n\nNow, we can find K:\n\nK = C * P^(-1) = | 1  13 | * |  0 -25 |\n                             |-25   0 |\n\nK = | 1*(-25) + 13*0, 1*0 + 13*(-25) |\n    |13*(-25) + 0*0, 13*0 + 0*(-25)  |\n\nK = |-25, -325|\n    |-325,   0 |\n\nSince we are working with mod 26, we need to convert the matrix elements to their corresponding values in the range of 0 to 25:\n\nK = | 1,  1 |\n    | 1,  0 |\n\nSo, the encryption key (K) used to encrypt the message is:\n\nK = | 1  1 |\n    | 1  0 |"
