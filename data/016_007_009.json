    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire structure are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a level 3 Menger sponge, we perform this process three times. Let's calculate the number of smaller cubes required at each level:\n\nLevel 0: 1 cube (the initial cube)\n\nLevel 1: We divide the initial cube into 27 smaller cubes and remove 7 of them (6 from the faces and 1 from the center). So, we have 20 smaller cubes remaining.\n\nLevel 2: We perform the same process for each of the 20 smaller cubes from Level 1. So, we have 20 * (27 - 7) = 20 * 20 = 400 smaller cubes remaining.\n\nLevel 3: We perform the same process for each of the 400 smaller cubes from Level 2. So, we have 400 * (27 - 7) = 400 * 20 = 8000 smaller cubes remaining.\n\nTherefore, a total of 8000 smaller cubes are required to construct a Menger sponge of level 3."
