    "message_1": "A person standing at the base of a tower looks up and measures the angle of elevation to be 60 degrees. If the person walks 20 meters closer to the tower and then looks up at the tower, the angle of elevation is now 75 degrees. What is the height of the tower? (Assume the person's eye level is 1.5 meters above the ground.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the tower as h meters, the initial distance from the person to the tower as x meters, and the person's eye level as 1.5 meters above the ground.\n\nWhen the person is at the initial position, we can use the tangent function for the angle of elevation:\n\ntan(60°) = (h - 1.5) / x\n√3 = (h - 1.5) / x  (since tan(60°) = √3)\n\nWhen the person walks 20 meters closer to the tower, the new distance from the person to the tower is (x - 20) meters. Now, we can use the tangent function for the new angle of elevation:\n\ntan(75°) = (h - 1.5) / (x - 20)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (h and x):\n\n1) √3 = (h - 1.5) / x\n2) tan(75°) = (h - 1.5) / (x - 20)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the height of the tower (h). First, let's isolate h in equation 1:\n\nh = √3 * x + 1.5\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into equation 2:\n\ntan(75°) = (√3 * x + 1.5 - 1.5) / (x - 20)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ntan(75°) = (√3 * x) / (x - 20)\n\nNow, let's isolate x:\n\nx * tan(75°) = √3 * x - 20 * √3\n\nx * (tan(75°) - √3) = -20 * √3\n\nx = (-20 * √3) / (tan(75°) - √3) ≈ 39.97\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the tower (h) using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = √3 * x + 1.5 ≈ √3 * 39.97 + 1.5 ≈ 70.43\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 70.43 meters."
