    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph G is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from G to itself) that preserve the structure of the graph. In other words, it is the set of all permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices.\n\nFor the given graph G, let's analyze the possible automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself, is always an automorphism. (1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5, 6 -> 6)\n\n2. We can swap vertices 1 and 4, and at the same time swap vertices 5 and 7. This preserves the adjacency relations. (1 -> 4, 4 -> 1, 5 -> 7, 7 -> 5)\n\n3. We can swap vertices 3 and 6, and at the same time swap vertices 2 and 5. This preserves the adjacency relations. (2 -> 5, 3 -> 6, 5 -> 2, 6 -> 3)\n\n4. We can combine the previous two automorphisms: swap vertices 1 and 4, 3 and 6, and 5 and 7. This preserves the adjacency relations. (1 -> 4, 3 -> 6, 4 -> 1, 5 -> 7, 6 -> 3, 7 -> 5)\n\nThere are no other automorphisms for this graph, as any other permutation of vertices would not preserve the adjacency relations.\n\nThus, the order of the automorphism group of G is 4, as there are 4 automorphisms."
