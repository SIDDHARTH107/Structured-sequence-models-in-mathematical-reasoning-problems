    "message_2": "Let's first find the tangent line to the curve C at the point (-1, 1). To do this, we need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to x. Implicitly differentiating the equation of the curve with respect to x, we get:\n\nd/dx(y^3) + d/dx(3x^2y) - d/dx(3xy^2) - d/dx(x^3) = 0\n\nUsing the chain rule and product rule, we have:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) + (6xy + 3x^2(dy/dx)) - (3y^2 + 6xy(dy/dx)) - 3x^2 = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the point (-1, 1) and solve for dy/dx:\n\n3(1)^2(dy/dx) + (6(-1)(1) + 3(-1)^2(dy/dx)) - (3(1)^2 + 6(-1)(1)(dy/dx)) - 3(-1)^2 = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3(dy/dx) - 6 + 3(dy/dx) - 3 - 6(dy/dx) = 0\n\nCombining the terms with dy/dx, we have:\n\n0 = 6 - 3\n\nSo, dy/dx = -1 at the point (-1, 1). This means the tangent line to the curve at this point has a slope of -1. The equation of the tangent line passing through the point (-1, 1) can be written as:\n\ny - 1 = -1(x + 1)\n\ny = -x\n\nNow, we need to find the equations of all lines passing through the point (-1, 1) that intersect the curve C exactly three times. Let's consider a line with a slope m passing through the point (-1, 1). The equation of such a line can be written as:\n\ny - 1 = m(x + 1)\n\ny = mx + m + 1\n\nTo find the intersection points between the line and the curve, we can substitute the expression for y in terms of x from the line equation into the curve equation:\n\n(mx + m + 1)^3 + 3x^2(mx + m + 1) - 3x(mx + m + 1)^2 - x^3 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation in x. Since the tangent line intersects the curve at the point (-1, 1) with multiplicity 2, the cubic equation must have a double root at x = -1. Therefore, the cubic equation can be factored as:\n\n(x + 1)^2 * (x - r) = 0\n\nWhere r is the third root of the cubic equation. Now, we need to find the conditions on the slope m such that the cubic equation has exactly three distinct roots. This will happen when the double root at x = -1 splits into two distinct roots.\n\nTaking the derivative of the cubic equation with respect to x and setting it equal to 0, we get:\n\n2(x + 1)(x - r) + (x + 1)^2 = 0\n\nPlugging in x = -1, we have:\n\n2(-1 + 1)(-1 - r) + (-1 + 1)^2 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-2r = 0\n\nSo, r = 0. This means the cubic equation becomes:\n\n(x + 1)^2 * x = 0\n\nThe corresponding equation for y in terms of x is:\n\ny = mx + m + 1\n\nSince the curve and the line intersect at x = -1 and x = 0, we can plug in these values to find the corresponding values of y:\n\nFor x = -1, y = -m + m + 1 = 1 (which is the given point (-1, 1))\n\nFor x = 0, y = m + 1\n\nSo, the lines that intersect the curve C exactly three times have the equation:\n\ny = mx + m + 1\n\nFor all real values of m, except for m = -1 (which is the tangent line)."
