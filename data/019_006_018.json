Is there another topic in mathematics that I can assist you with?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can help you with various topics in mathematics, such as algebra, calculus, geometry, probability, statistics, and more. Please provide a specific problem or question related to any of these topics, and I will be happy to help you solve it."
