    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic polynomial of G, we will use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors.\n\n1. Remove edge (2,5) to get G' and contract edge (2,5) to get G''. Now, we have:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\n\n2. G' has edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). It is a tree with 5 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is:\n\nP(G', k) = k(k-1)^(4-1) = k(k-1)^3\n\n3. G'' has vertices: {1, 2', 3, 4, 5}, where 2' is the result of contracting vertices 2 and 5. The edges are: (1,2'), (2',3), (3,4), (4,5). It is also a tree with 4 vertices, so its chromatic polynomial is:\n\nP(G'', k) = k(k-1)^(3-1) = k(k-1)^2\n\n4. Now, substitute P(G', k) and P(G'', k) back into the equation from step 1:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^3 - k(k-1)^2\n\n5. Factor out k(k-1)^2:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^2[(k-1) - 1] = k(k-1)^2(k-2)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)."
