    "message_1": "A 25 meter-high tower is observed from a distance of 30 meters from its base. What is the angle of elevation to the top of the tower, rounded to the nearest degree?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation. In this problem, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tower (25 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the base of the tower (30 meters).\n\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(θ) = 25 / 30\ntan(θ) = 5 / 6\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose tangent is 5/6. We can use the arctangent (inverse tangent) function for this:\n\nθ = arctan(5/6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 39.8 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation is approximately 40 degrees."
