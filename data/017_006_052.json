    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 35 = 5 * 7. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Therefore, n_5 = 1 or 7, and n_7 = 1 or 5.\n\nCase 1: n_5 = n_7 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P and a unique 7-Sylow subgroup Q. By the Sylow theorems, both P and Q are normal in G. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 7 are prime and distinct), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the product set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since P and Q are normal in G, for any g ∈ G, we have gP = Pg and gQ = Qg. Thus, for any p ∈ P and q ∈ Q, we have gpq = pgq, which implies that the product set PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 5 * 7 / 1 = 35, which is the order of G. Therefore, G = PQ.\n\nSince P and Q are cyclic (as they are groups of prime order), G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 5 (or n_5 = 7 and n_7 = 1)\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 5. In this case, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P, which is normal in G. Let Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4, and Q_5 be the distinct 7-Sylow subgroups of G. Since the order of P is 5, P is cyclic and generated by an element of order 5, say a. Similarly, each Q_i is cyclic and generated by an element of order 7, say b_i.\n\nNow, consider the element ab_1 ∈ G. Since a has order 5 and b_1 has order 7, (ab_1)^35 = a^35b_1^35 = e. Thus, the order of ab_1 divides 35. Since 35 is the smallest positive integer k such that a^k = b_1^k = e, the order of ab_1 must be 35. Therefore, G has an element of order 35, which implies that G is cyclic.\n\nConclusion:\nIn either case, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
