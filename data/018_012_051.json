    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersections (A × B) ∩ B and (B × A) ∩ B.\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = The intersection of a set of ordered pairs and a set of single elements is an empty set, as they do not have any common elements. Therefore, (A × B) ∩ B = ∅.\n\n(B × A) ∩ B = Similarly, the intersection of a set of ordered pairs and a set of single elements is an empty set, as they do not have any common elements. Therefore, (B × A) ∩ B = ∅.\n\nSince both (A × B) ∩ B and (B × A) ∩ B are equal to the empty set, they are equal. However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to intersection, as the original statement was incorrect. The Cartesian product is not associative in general, and the intersection operation is not relevant in this context. The correct statement would be that the Cartesian product is not commutative, which can be seen from the fact that A × B and B × A are not equal."
