    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method for finding the roots of a function. The formula for the method is:\n\n$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$\n\nwhere $x_n$ is the current approximation and $x_{n+1}$ is the next approximation. We are given the function $f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 7$ and its derivative is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4$. We are also given the initial guess $x_0 = 2$.\n\nWe need to find the number of iterations required to find the root of the equation accurate to four decimal places. This means that the difference between two consecutive approximations should be less than $10^{-4}$.\n\nNow, let's perform the iterations:\n\n1. First iteration:\n\n$x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = 2 - \\frac{(2^3 - 4\\cdot2 + 7)}{(3\\cdot2^2 - 4)} = 2 - \\frac{7}{8} = 1.125$\n\n2. Second iteration:\n\n$x_2 = x_1 - \\frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = 1.125 - \\frac{(1.125^3 - 4\\cdot1.125 + 7)}{(3\\cdot1.125^2 - 4)} \\approx 1.1349$\n\n3. Third iteration:\n\n$x_3 = x_2 - \\frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} \\approx 1.1349 - \\frac{(1.1349^3 - 4\\cdot1.1349 + 7)}{(3\\cdot1.1349^2 - 4)} \\approx 1.1347$\n\nNow, let's check the difference between the last two approximations:\n\n$|x_3 - x_2| \\approx |1.1347 - 1.1349| = 0.0002$\n\nSince the difference between the last two approximations is less than $10^{-4}$, we can conclude that 3 iterations are required to find the root of the equation accurate to four decimal places."
