    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces x units of product A and y units of product B each day with the following constraints:\n\n- The total number of units produced cannot exceed 500.\n- The number of units of product A produced must be at least twice the number of units of product B produced.\n- The number of units of product A produced cannot exceed 400.\n- The number of units of product B produced cannot exceed 300.\n\nIf the company makes a profit of $10 for each unit of product A and $15 for each unit of product B, how many units of each product should they produce daily to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the given constraints. Let's write the constraints as inequalities:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 500\n2. x ≥ 2y\n3. x ≤ 400\n4. y ≤ 300\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) can be written as:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nNow, we will use the graphical method to find the optimal solution. First, we will plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x + y = 500 (Boundary line for constraint 1)\n2. x = 2y (Boundary line for constraint 2)\n3. x = 400 (Boundary line for constraint 3)\n4. y = 300 (Boundary line for constraint 4)\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied. In this case, the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices A(200, 300), B(400, 100), C(400, 0), and D(0, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(200, 300) = 10(200) + 15(300) = 2000 + 4500 = 6500\n2. P(400, 100) = 10(400) + 15(100) = 4000 + 1500 = 5500\n3. P(400, 0) = 10(400) + 15(0) = 4000\n4. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex A(200, 300), with a profit of $6,500. Therefore, the company should produce 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B daily to maximize their profit."
