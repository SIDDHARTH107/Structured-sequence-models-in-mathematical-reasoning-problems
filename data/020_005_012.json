    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The factory has a total of 120 hours of labor and 80 hours of machine time available each week. If the profit per unit of Product A is $100 and for Product B is $150, how many units of each product should the factory produce in a week to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are:\n\n3x + y ≤ 120 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (machine constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + y ≤ 120\ny ≤ -3x + 120\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 80\ny ≤ -0.5x + 20\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 20), (40, 0), and (24, 32).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 20) = 100(0) + 150(20) = $3,000\n3. P(40, 0) = 100(40) + 150(0) = $4,000\n4. P(24, 32) = 100(24) + 150(32) = $7,200\n\nThe maximum profit of $7,200 is achieved when the factory produces 24 units of Product A and 32 units of Product B each week."
