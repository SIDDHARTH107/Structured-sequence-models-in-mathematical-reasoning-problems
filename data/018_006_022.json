    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to determine the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. However, we need more information about the universal set U to find the complement of set A. \n\nFor the sake of this problem, let's assume that the universal set U contains the integers from 1 to 10. In this case, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nNow, we can find the complement of set A, denoted by A'. A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and its complement A', denoted by A ∪ A'. The union of two sets contains all the elements from both sets, without repetition.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A' equals the universal set U. This demonstrates that the union of a set and its complement always equals the universal set."
