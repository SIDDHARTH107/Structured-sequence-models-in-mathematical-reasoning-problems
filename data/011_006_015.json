    "message_1": "Suppose you have 5 identical red balls, 4 identical blue balls, and 3 identical yellow balls. You want to distribute these balls among three children such that each child gets at least one ball. In how many ways can you distribute the balls?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the stars and bars method. Since each child must get at least one ball, we can give one red ball, one blue ball, and one yellow ball to each child. Now we have 2 red balls, 1 blue ball, and no yellow balls left to distribute.\n\nFor the remaining red balls, we can use the stars and bars method. We have 2 balls and 2 dividers (to separate the balls among the 3 children). This gives us a total of 4 objects, and we need to choose the positions of the 2 dividers, which can be done in C(4, 2) = 6 ways.\n\nFor the remaining blue ball, we can use the stars and bars method again. We have 1 ball and 2 dividers. This gives us a total of 3 objects, and we need to choose the positions of the 2 dividers, which can be done in C(3, 2) = 3 ways.\n\nSince there are no yellow balls left to distribute, we don't need to consider them.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to distribute the red balls and the blue balls: 6 * 3 = 18 ways."
