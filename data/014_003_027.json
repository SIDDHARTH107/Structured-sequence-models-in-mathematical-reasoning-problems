    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using ElGamal encryption. Alice chooses p=11 and g=2 as the public parameters, and her private key is a=5. She also randomly chooses k=3 as the ephemeral key. If the message M=7, what would be the encrypted form of the message that Alice will send to Bob and how would Bob decrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "To use ElGamal encryption, we first need to compute Alice's public key A and the ephemeral public key K.\n\n1. Compute Alice's public key A:\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 2^5 mod 11\nA = 32 mod 11\nA = 10\n\n2. Compute the ephemeral public key K:\nK = g^k mod p\nK = 2^3 mod 11\nK = 8 mod 11\nK = 8\n\nNow, Alice can encrypt the message M=7 using the ephemeral public key K and her public key A.\n\n3. Compute the first part of the ciphertext C1:\nC1 = K mod p\nC1 = 8 mod 11\nC1 = 8\n\n4. Compute the second part of the ciphertext C2:\nC2 = M * (A^k) mod p\nC2 = 7 * (10^3) mod 11\nC2 = 7 * 1000 mod 11\nC2 = 7000 mod 11\nC2 = 3\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Alice will send to Bob is (C1, C2) = (8, 3).\n\nNow, let's see how Bob can decrypt the message using Alice's private key a.\n\n5. Compute the shared secret S:\nS = C1^(p-1-a) mod p\nS = 8^(11-1-5) mod 11\nS = 8^5 mod 11\nS = 32768 mod 11\nS = 6\n\n6. Compute the decrypted message M:\nM = C2 * S mod p\nM = 3 * 6 mod 11\nM = 18 mod 11\nM = 7\n\nSo, Bob successfully decrypted the message, and the original message M is 7."
