    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, so n_3 divides 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n3. n_3 = 1 is the only possibility that satisfies both conditions above.\n\nTherefore, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup H of G, which implies that H is a normal subgroup of G. Now, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 27.\nIf G has an element of order 27, say g, then G is generated by g, i.e., G = ⟨g⟩. This means G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 27.\nIn this case, the order of every non-identity element in G must be a divisor of 27, which means the possible orders are 3 or 9. Let x be an element of order 3 in G (since G is of order 27, there must be an element of order 3). Let H = ⟨x⟩, so H is a cyclic subgroup of order 3.\n\nNow, let K be a subgroup of G of order 9. Since the order of K is a power of a prime, K is a p-group and therefore is not trivial. Also, since |H| = 3 and |K| = 9, we have gcd(|H|, |K|) = 1. By the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, G is the internal direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K.\n\nSince H is a cyclic group of order 3 and K is a group of order 9, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group G has an order of 27, it is either cyclic (Case 1) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (Case 2)."
