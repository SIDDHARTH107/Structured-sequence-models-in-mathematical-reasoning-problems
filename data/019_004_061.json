    "message_2": "To prove the statement \"It is always the case that if x is even, then x + 2 is even\" using mathematical induction, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Base case: Show that the statement holds for the smallest even value, x = 2.\n2. Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for an arbitrary even value x = 2k (where k is an integer), and then show that it also holds for the next even value x = 2k + 2.\n\nBase case:\nLet x = 2. Since 2 is even, we need to show that x + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 is also even. Since 4 is divisible by 2, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that the statement holds for an arbitrary even value x = 2k, where k is an integer. This means that 2k is even, and we assume that 2k + 2 is also even.\n\nNow, we need to show that the statement holds for the next even value x = 2k + 2. We can write this value as (2k + 2) + 2 = 2k + 4.\n\nSince 2k is even (by assumption) and 4 is even (from the base case), their sum (2k + 4) is also even, as the sum of two even numbers is always even.\n\nThus, we have shown that if the statement holds for an arbitrary even value x = 2k, it also holds for the next even value x = 2k + 2.\n\nBy mathematical induction, the statement \"It is always the case that if x is even, then x + 2 is even\" holds for all even values of x."
