    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a central angle of 60 degrees, and its radius is 8 cm. Find the perimeter of the sector.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 8\nL = (1/6) × 2 × 3.14159 × 8\nL = (1/3) × 3.14159 × 8\nL ≈ 8.37758 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the length of the arc (L) to the two radii (each of length 8 cm):\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 2 × 8\nPerimeter ≈ 8.37758 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 24.37758 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.38 cm."
