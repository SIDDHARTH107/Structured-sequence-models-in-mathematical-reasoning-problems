    "message_2": "To reach the target in the shortest time possible, the missile should accelerate at its maximum acceleration until it reaches its maximum speed, and then maintain that speed until it reaches the target.\n\nFirst, let's find the time it takes for the missile to reach its maximum speed:\n\nv = u + at\nwhere v is the final velocity (400 m/s), u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration (200 m/s^2), and t is the time.\n\n400 = 0 + 200t\nt = 400 / 200\nt = 2 seconds\n\nNow, let's find the distance covered during this acceleration phase:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at^2\nwhere s is the distance, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration (200 m/s^2), and t is the time (2 seconds).\n\ns = 0 + (1/2)(200)(2^2)\ns = 0 + 400\ns = 400 meters\n\nThe missile has covered 400 meters during the acceleration phase. The remaining distance to the target is:\n\n10,000 meters (10 km) - 400 meters = 9,600 meters\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes for the missile to cover the remaining distance at its maximum speed:\n\nt = s / v\nwhere t is the time, s is the remaining distance (9,600 meters), and v is the maximum speed (400 m/s).\n\nt = 9,600 / 400\nt = 24 seconds\n\nSo, the total time it takes for the missile to reach the target is:\n\n2 seconds (acceleration phase) + 24 seconds (constant speed phase) = 26 seconds\n\nThe optimal way to control the missile is to accelerate at its maximum acceleration for 2 seconds, and then maintain its maximum speed of 400 m/s for the remaining 24 seconds to reach the target in the shortest time possible, which is 26 seconds."
