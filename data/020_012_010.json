The selling price for each bag of Snack A is $3.00 and for each bag of Snack B is $2.50. The demand for Snack A is 200 bags and for Snack B is 250 bags. What should be the production quantity of Snack A and Snack B to maximize the profit for the snack company?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, the snack company should produce the maximum demand for each type of snack.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the profit per bag for each type of snack:\n\nProfit per bag of Snack A = Selling price - Production cost\nProfit per bag of Snack A = $3.00 - $1.50 = $1.50\n\nProfit per bag of Snack B = Selling price - Production cost\nProfit per bag of Snack B = $2.50 - $2.00 = $0.50\n\nNow, let's calculate the total profit for producing the maximum demand for each type of snack:\n\nTotal profit for Snack A = Profit per bag of Snack A * Demand for Snack A\nTotal profit for Snack A = $1.50 * 200 = $300\n\nTotal profit for Snack B = Profit per bag of Snack B * Demand for Snack B\nTotal profit for Snack B = $0.50 * 250 = $125\n\nTo maximize the profit, the snack company should produce 200 bags of Snack A and 250 bags of Snack B. The total profit will be $300 + $125 = $425."
