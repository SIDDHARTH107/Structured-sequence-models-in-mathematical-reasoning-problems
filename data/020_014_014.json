    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The factory has 10 machines and can produce either Product A or Product B, but not both at the same time. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of Product A and 3 hours to produce one unit of Product B. Each machine can produce a maximum of 6 units per day. The profit is $12 for each unit of Product A and $15 for each unit of Product B. What is the maximum profit the factory can make each day?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many units of each product can be produced by a single machine in a day.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day. \n\nFor Product A, it takes 2 hours to produce one unit. So, a single machine can produce 24 hours / 2 hours = 12 units of Product A in a day.\n\nFor Product B, it takes 3 hours to produce one unit. So, a single machine can produce 24 hours / 3 hours = 8 units of Product B in a day.\n\nHowever, each machine can produce a maximum of 6 units per day. So, we need to consider the maximum limit.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit for each product when producing the maximum number of units.\n\nFor Product A, the profit per unit is $12. If a machine produces 6 units, the profit will be 6 units * $12 = $72.\n\nFor Product B, the profit per unit is $15. If a machine produces 6 units, the profit will be 6 units * $15 = $90.\n\nSince the profit for Product B is higher, the factory should produce Product B to maximize the profit.\n\nThere are 10 machines in the factory. If each machine produces 6 units of Product B, the total number of units produced will be 10 machines * 6 units = 60 units.\n\nThe maximum profit the factory can make each day is 60 units * $15 = $900."
