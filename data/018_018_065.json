    "message_2": "The symmetric difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference between set A and B:\n\nA = {2, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {3, 5, 7}\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 9} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {5, 7} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 9} - {5, 7} = {2, 3, 9}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative using the properties of set theory. We need to show that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection of sets are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nComparing this with the definition of A Δ B, we can see that they are the same:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A"
