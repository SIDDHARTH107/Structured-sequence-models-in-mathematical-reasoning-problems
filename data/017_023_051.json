    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we need to consider the prime factorization of 72 and the possible ways to combine these factors to form groups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Now, we will use the formula for the number of groups of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are their respective powers.\n\nThe formula is (m + 1)(n + 1), where m is the number of groups of order p^a, and n is the number of groups of order q^b.\n\nFor 2^3, there are two groups: the cyclic group C_8 and the dihedral group D_4. So, m = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nFor 3^2, there is only one group: the cyclic group C_9. So, n = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nUsing the formula, we get (1 + 1)(0 + 1) = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
