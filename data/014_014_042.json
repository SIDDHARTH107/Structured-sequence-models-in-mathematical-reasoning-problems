    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHISEASY\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\", we first need to create a 5x5 grid using the keyword.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: CRYPTOAGH\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as it is combined with I in the Playfair cipher): CRYPTOAGHBDFIKLMNQSUVWXZ\n\nNow, the 5x5 grid looks like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A G H B\nD F I K L\nM N Q S U\nV W X Z\n\nNext, we break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters) and apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. MATH\n2. IS\n3. EA\n4. SY (add an X between S and Y to make them a valid digraph)\n\nNow, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. MATH -> OQSD\n2. IS -> KL\n3. EA -> YR\n4. SX -> UV\n\nThe encrypted message is: OQSDKLYRUV"
