    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and its two parallel sides measure 10 cm and 15 cm respectively. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two non-parallel sides. We can do this by dividing the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nLet's call the length of one of the non-parallel sides 'a' and the other 'b'. The height of the trapezium (8 cm) will be the height of both right triangles. Let's call the length of the base of the smaller right triangle 'x' and the length of the base of the larger right triangle 'y'. Then, x + y = 15 cm (the length of the longer parallel side).\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for both right triangles:\n\nFor the smaller right triangle:\na^2 = x^2 + 8^2\n\nFor the larger right triangle:\nb^2 = y^2 + 8^2\n\nSince x + y = 15, we can express y in terms of x: y = 15 - x. Now, substitute this expression into the equation for the larger right triangle:\n\nb^2 = (15 - x)^2 + 8^2\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the length of the shorter parallel side (10 cm) is equal to the sum of the bases of the two right triangles: x + (15 - x) = 10. This simplifies to x = 5.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the lengths of 'a' and 'b':\n\na^2 = 5^2 + 8^2\na^2 = 25 + 64\na^2 = 89\na = √89\n\nb^2 = (15 - 5)^2 + 8^2\nb^2 = 10^2 + 64\nb^2 = 100 + 64\nb^2 = 164\nb = √164\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 15 + √89 + √164 ≈ 10 + 15 + 9.43 + 12.81 ≈ 47.24 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 47.24 cm."
