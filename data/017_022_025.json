    "message_2": "There are five non-isomorphic groups of order 60. They are:\n\n1. C_60: The cyclic group of order 60.\n2. A_5: The alternating group on 5 elements, which is the group of even permutations of 5 elements.\n3. D_30: The dihedral group of order 60, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 30-gon.\n4. C_2 x C_2 x A_5: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and the alternating group A_5.\n5. C_3 x D_10: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and the dihedral group of order 20 (symmetries of a regular 10-gon).\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic, meaning that there is no one-to-one correspondence between their elements that preserves the group structure."
