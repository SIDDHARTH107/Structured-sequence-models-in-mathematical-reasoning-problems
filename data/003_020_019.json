    "message_1": "A 50-foot long ladder is placed against a wall, and the ladder makes an angle of 60 degrees with the ground. How far is the base (foot) of the ladder from the wall? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot.)",
    "message_2": "We can use the trigonometric function cosine to solve this problem. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the adjacent side (the side along the wall) divided by the hypotenuse (the ladder). In this case, we have:\n\ncos(60°) = adjacent side / 50 feet\n\nWe need to find the adjacent side, which represents the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall. To do this, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nAdjacent side = 50 feet * cos(60°)\n\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, so:\n\nAdjacent side = 50 feet * 0.5 = 25 feet\n\nTherefore, the base of the ladder is approximately 25 feet from the wall."
