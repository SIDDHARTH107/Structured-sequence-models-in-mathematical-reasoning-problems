Let $T$ be the set of first-order sentences that are true for the standard model $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$ of arithmetic.\n\nFind a first-order sentence $\\varphi$ that is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ and is also true in a non-standard model of arithmetic.",
    "message_2": "Consider the first-order sentence $\\varphi$ given by:\n\n$$\\forall x \\, (0 < x \\rightarrow \\exists y \\, (0 < y \\land y < x))$$\n\nThis sentence states that for every natural number $x$ greater than $0$, there exists a natural number $y$ such that $0 < y < x$. This sentence is true in the standard model of arithmetic $\\mathbb{N}$, as for any natural number $x > 0$, we can always find a natural number $y$ between $0$ and $x$ (for example, $y = 1$ if $x > 1$, or $y = x - 1$ if $x > 0$).\n\nNow, let's consider a non-standard model of arithmetic, which we will denote as $\\mathbb{N}^*$. This model contains all the standard natural numbers, as well as additional \"non-standard\" elements that are larger than any standard natural number. In this non-standard model, the sentence $\\varphi$ is still true. For any non-standard element $x^* \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, there must exist a non-standard element $y^* \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$ such that $0 < y^* < x^*$, since $x^*$ is larger than any standard natural number.\n\nThus, the first-order sentence $\\varphi$ is true in both the standard model of arithmetic $\\mathbb{N}$ and a non-standard model of arithmetic $\\mathbb{N}^*$."
