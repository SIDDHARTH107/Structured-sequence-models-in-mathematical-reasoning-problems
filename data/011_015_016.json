What is the minimum number of pairs that must know each other to guarantee that there is a subgroup of three people who all know each other or a subgroup of three people who all do not know each other?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. Consider one person in the group. This person either knows at least 3 people or does not know at least 3 people (since there are 5 other people in the group).\n\nCase 1: The person knows at least 3 people.\nIf any of these 3 people know each other, then we have a subgroup of 3 people who all know each other. If none of these 3 people know each other, then we have a subgroup of 3 people who all do not know each other.\n\nCase 2: The person does not know at least 3 people.\nIf any of these 3 people do not know each other, then we have a subgroup of 3 people who all do not know each other. If all of these 3 people know each other, then we have a subgroup of 3 people who all know each other.\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed to have a subgroup of 3 people who all know each other or a subgroup of 3 people who all do not know each other. Now, let's find the minimum number of pairs that must know each other.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the person knows 3 people, and none of them know each other. In this case, there are 3 pairs of people who know each other (the person and each of the 3 people they know). Additionally, there is 1 pair of people who do not know each other (the 2 remaining people in the group). So, the minimum number of pairs that must know each other to guarantee the desired condition is 3."
