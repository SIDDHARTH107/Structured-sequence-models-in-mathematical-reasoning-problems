    "message_1": "Consider a smooth function $f : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,y) = x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2$. Find the number of critical points of $f$ and their indices using Morse theory.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical points of $f$, we need to compute its gradient and set it equal to zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (4x^3 - 8x, 2y).$$\n\nSetting the gradient equal to zero, we get:\n\n$$4x^3 - 8x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2y = 0.$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. For the first equation, we can factor out $4x$:\n\n$$4x(x^2 - 2) = 0.$$\n\nThis gives us three critical points: $(0,0)$, $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, and $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ to determine the indices of these critical points. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$$H_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n12x^2 - 8 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point:\n\n1. At $(0,0)$, we have:\n\n$$H_f(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-8 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $-8$ and $2$. Since there is one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue, the index of this critical point is $1$.\n\n2. At $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, we have:\n\n$$H_f(\\sqrt{2},0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n16 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $16$ and $2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the index of this critical point is $0$.\n\n3. At $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, we have:\n\n$$H_f(-\\sqrt{2},0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n16 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $16$ and $2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the index of this critical point is also $0$.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three critical points of $f$: $(0,0)$ with index $1$, $(\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ with index $0$, and $(-\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ with index $0$."
