    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we need to compute the first and second derivatives of the curve, as well as the cross product of these derivatives.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of r(t):\n\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)\nr''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at t = π/2:\n\nr'(π/2) = (-sin(π/2), cos(π/2), 1) = (0, 1, 1)\nr''(π/2) = (-cos(π/2), -sin(π/2), 0) = (0, -1, 0)\n\nNext, we need to find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nT'(t) = r'(t) × r''(t) = (1, 0, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) using the following formulas:\n\nk(t) = ||r'(t) × r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\nτ(t) = (r'(t) • (r'(t) × r''(t))) / ||r'(t) × r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of r'(t) and T'(t):\n\n||r'(π/2)|| = √(0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = √2\n||T'(π/2)|| = √(1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = √2\n\nNow, we can find the curvature k(π/2):\n\nk(π/2) = ||T'(π/2)|| / ||r'(π/2)||^3 = (√2) / (√2)^3 = 1/2\n\nFinally, let's find the torsion τ(π/2):\n\nτ(π/2) = (r'(π/2) • T'(π/2)) / ||T'(π/2)||^2 = (0*1 + 1*0 + 1*1) / (√2)^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the curvature k(π/2) = 1/2 and the torsion τ(π/2) = 1/2."
