    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has dimensions of 10 cm, 8 cm, and 6 cm. What is the surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: three pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\nThe dimensions of the faces are:\n1. 10 cm x 8 cm (top and bottom faces)\n2. 10 cm x 6 cm (front and back faces)\n3. 8 cm x 6 cm (left and right faces)\n\nNow, we find the area of each pair of faces and multiply by 2 (since there are two of each face):\n\n1. 2 * (10 cm * 8 cm) = 2 * 80 cm² = 160 cm²\n2. 2 * (10 cm * 6 cm) = 2 * 60 cm² = 120 cm²\n3. 2 * (8 cm * 6 cm) = 2 * 48 cm² = 96 cm²\n\nFinally, we add the areas of all the faces together:\n\nSurface area = 160 cm² + 120 cm² + 96 cm² = 376 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 376 cm²."
