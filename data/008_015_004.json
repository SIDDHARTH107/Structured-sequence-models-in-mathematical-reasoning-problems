    "message_2": "To use Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the given system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be written as:\n\n[ 2  1  0 ] [ x ]   [  5 ]\n[ 0  1  5 ] [ y ] = [ -7 ]\n[ 1  2  3 ] [ z ]   [ 10 ]\n\nNow, we need to check if the matrix A is symmetric and positive definite. The matrix A is symmetric if A = A^T (transpose of A). In this case, A is not symmetric:\n\nA = [ 2  1  0 ]\n      [ 0  1  5 ]\n      [ 1  2  3 ]\n\nA^T = [ 2  0  1 ]\n         [ 1  1  2 ]\n         [ 0  5  3 ]\n\nSince A â‰  A^T, the matrix A is not symmetric. Cholesky decomposition can only be applied to symmetric and positive definite matrices. Therefore, we cannot use Cholesky decomposition to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods like Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, or the inverse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations."
