    "message_2": "To show that G must have at least one element of order 5, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 20, which can be factored as 2^2 * 5^1. According to the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of G with order 5. Let's call this subgroup H.\n\nSince the order of H is 5, which is a prime number, H must be a cyclic group. This means that there exists an element a in H such that H = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of the element a. The order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e. Since H is a cyclic group generated by a, the order of a must be equal to the order of H, which is 5.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that there exists an element a in G with order 5."
