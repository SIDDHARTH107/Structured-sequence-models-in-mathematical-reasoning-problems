    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence (1/n) converges to 0, we need to show that for any given ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the absolute value of the difference between the terms of the sequence and 0 is less than ε, i.e., |1/n - 0| < ε.\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. We want to find N such that for all n > N, |1/n| < ε.\n\nSince 1/n is a decreasing sequence for n ∈ N, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n1/n < ε\n\nNow, we want to find n such that this inequality holds. We can rearrange the inequality:\n\nn > 1/ε\n\nSince n is a natural number, we can choose N to be the smallest integer greater than 1/ε. That is, N = ⌈1/ε⌉, where ⌈x⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n\nNow, for all n > N, we have:\n\nn > ⌈1/ε⌉ ≥ 1/ε\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:\n\n1/n < ε\n\nThus, |1/n - 0| = |1/n| < ε for all n > N.\n\nTherefore, the sequence (1/n) converges to 0."
