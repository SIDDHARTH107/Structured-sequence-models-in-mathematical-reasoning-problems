    "message_2": "To solve the problem using the tabu search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the current solution x, the tabu list, and the best solution found so far.\n2. Generate the neighborhood of the current solution.\n3. Select the best candidate solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list.\n4. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list exceeds its maximum length.\n5. Update the current solution to the best candidate solution.\n6. If the new current solution is better than the best solution found so far, update the best solution.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's implement the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the current solution x, the tabu list, and the best solution found so far:\n   - Let x = 0 (the lower bound of the interval)\n   - Tabu list = []\n   - Best solution = x\n   - Best value = f(x) = 0^2 - 6*0 + 8 = 8\n\n2. Set the maximum number of iterations, e.g., 100.\n\n3. Start the main loop for the tabu search algorithm:\n\nFor each iteration:\n\n  a. Generate the neighborhood of the current solution:\n     - Neighborhood = [x - 0.1, x + 0.1]\n\n  b. Select the best candidate solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list:\n     - Calculate the function values for each candidate solution in the neighborhood.\n     - Exclude the candidate solutions that are in the tabu list or outside the interval [0, 10].\n     - Select the candidate solution with the minimum function value.\n\n  c. Update the tabu list:\n     - Add the current solution to the tabu list.\n     - If the tabu list length exceeds 5, remove the oldest solution.\n\n  d. Update the current solution to the best candidate solution.\n\n  e. If the new current solution is better than the best solution found so far, update the best solution and best value.\n\nAfter 100 iterations, the best solution found will be the minimum value of the function f(x) within the given interval and neighborhood size.\n\nNote: The tabu search algorithm is a metaheuristic, which means it may not always find the exact global minimum, but it can provide a good approximation. In this case, the true minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 is 4, which occurs at x = 3. However, due to the discrete nature of the neighborhood size (x±0.1), the tabu search algorithm may find a slightly different minimum value and corresponding x value."
