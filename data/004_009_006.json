    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * (2x - 1) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2\nv(x) = 2x - 1\n\nNext, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(u(x))/dx = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\nv'(x) = d(v(x))/dx = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstituting our expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x), we get:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(2x - 1) + (x^2)(2)\n\nNow, we want to find the value of f'(2), so we substitute x = 2 into our expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(2) = (2 * 2)(2 * 2 - 1) + (2^2)(2)\nf'(2) = (4)(4 - 1) + (4)(2)\nf'(2) = (4)(3) + (4)(2)\nf'(2) = 12 + 8\nf'(2) = 20\n\nSo, the value of f'(2) is 20."
