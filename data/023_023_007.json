    "message_2": "To find the magnitudes and phase angles of the frequency components in the signal, we need to perform the Fourier transform on the given function f(t) = 3cos(4πt) + 5sin(6πt) - 2cos(8πt).\n\nThe Fourier transform of a continuous function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nHowever, since our function f(t) is already in the sum of sinusoids form, we can directly find the magnitudes and phase angles of the frequency components.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoid is A*cos(ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nWe can rewrite the given function f(t) as a sum of sinusoids with their respective amplitudes and phase angles:\n\nf(t) = 3cos(4πt + 0) + 5sin(6πt - π/2) - 2cos(8πt + 0)\n\nNow, we can identify the magnitudes, frequencies, and phase angles of each component:\n\n1) Magnitude: 3, Frequency: 4π rad/s, Phase angle: 0\n2) Magnitude: 5, Frequency: 6π rad/s, Phase angle: -π/2\n3) Magnitude: 2, Frequency: 8π rad/s, Phase angle: 0\n\nSo, the magnitudes and phase angles of the frequency components in the signal are:\n\n1) Magnitude: 3.00, Phase angle: 0.00 rad\n2) Magnitude: 5.00, Phase angle: -1.57 rad (rounded to two decimal places)\n3) Magnitude: 2.00, Phase angle: 0.00 rad"
