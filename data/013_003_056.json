    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has $100 and proposes to share it with Player 2. Player 2 can either accept or reject the offer. If Player 2 accepts, both players keep the agreed upon amounts. If Player 2 rejects, neither player gets anything. What percentage of the $100 should Player 1 offer to Player 2 to maximize the chances of the offer being accepted?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the optimal percentage to offer Player 2 depends on various factors such as the rationality of the players, their preferences, and their expectations. However, from a purely mathematical standpoint, we can analyze the game using the concept of Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, no player can benefit from changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy. Assuming both players are rational and want to maximize their gains, Player 1 should offer the smallest amount possible to Player 2 that would still be accepted. This is because Player 2 would prefer to accept any amount greater than $0 rather than rejecting the offer and getting nothing.\n\nIn practice, the optimal percentage to offer may be higher than the smallest possible amount, as people tend to have fairness concerns and may reject offers that they perceive as unfair. Experimental results have shown that offers around 40-50% of the total amount are more likely to be accepted, as they are perceived as fair by both players. However, this percentage may vary depending on the specific context and the players involved."
