    "message_2": "Let's denote the initial position of the boat as A, the final position of the boat as B, and the position of the island as C. Let's also denote the top of the mast as M. We are given the following information:\n\n1. Angle of depression from M to C is 30°, so angle AMC = 30°.\n2. After sailing for 500 meters, the angle of depression changes to 45°, so angle BMC = 45°.\n3. The distance between A and B is 500 meters.\n\nWe want to find the distance between the boat's final position (B) and the island (C), which is the length of side BC.\n\nFirst, we need to find angle ABC. Since angle AMC = 30° and angle BMC = 45°, we have:\n\nangle ABC = angle BMC - angle AMC = 45° - 30° = 15°\n\nNow, we have a triangle ABC with angle A = 15°, angle B = 45°, and side AB = 500 meters. We can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side BC:\n\nLaw of Sines: (a/sin(A)) = (b/sin(B)) = (c/sin(C))\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n(AB/sin(angle ABC)) = (BC/sin(angle BAC))\n\nWe want to find BC, so we can rearrange the equation:\n\nBC = (AB * sin(angle BAC)) / sin(angle ABC)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nBC = (500 * sin(45°)) / sin(15°)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nBC ≈ (500 * 0.7071) / 0.2588\n\nBC ≈ 353.55 / 0.2588\n\nBC ≈ 1366.47 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the boat and the island is approximately 1366.47 meters."
