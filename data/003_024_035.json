    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A · B / ||B||^2) * B\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, and ||B|| is the magnitude of vector B.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (4 * 5) + (3 * -2) = 20 - 6 = 14\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector B:\n\n||B|| = √(5^2 + (-2)^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, let's find the square of the magnitude of vector B:\n\n||B||^2 = 29\n\nNow, we can find the projection of A onto B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (14 / 29) * B\n\nProjection of A onto B = (14 / 29) * [5, -2] = [(14/29)*5, (14/29)*(-2)] = [70/29, -28/29]\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is [70/29, -28/29]."
