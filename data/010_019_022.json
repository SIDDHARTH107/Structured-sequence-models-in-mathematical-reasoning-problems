    "message_2": "To compute the Morse complex of $f$, we first need to find its critical points and their indices. The critical points are the solutions to the system of equations given by the gradient of $f$:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy)$\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$\n$-6xy = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. If $x = 0$, the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So we have a critical point at the origin $(0,0)$. If $y = 0$, the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which also implies $x = 0$. So, in this case, we also have the same critical point at the origin.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hessian matrix of $f$:\n\n$H_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAt the critical point $(0,0)$, the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H_f(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSince the Hessian matrix is singular at the critical point, we cannot directly determine the index of the critical point. However, we can still analyze the behavior of $f$ around the critical point. Notice that $f(x,y) = x(x^2 - 3y^2)$, so for any point on the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we have:\n\n$f(x,y) = x(1 - 4y^2)$\n\nFor $0 < y^2 < \\frac{1}{4}$, we have $f(x,y) > 0$ when $x > 0$ and $f(x,y) < 0$ when $x < 0$. For $y^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, we have $f(x,y) = 0$. For $\\frac{1}{4} < y^2 < 1$, we have $f(x,y) < 0$ when $x > 0$ and $f(x,y) > 0$ when $x < 0$. This shows that the critical point $(0,0)$ is a saddle point, and its index is $1$.\n\nNow we can compute the Morse complex. Since we only have one critical point with index $1$, the Morse complex is:\n\n$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$\n\nHence, the homology of the Morse complex is:\n\n$H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H_1 = 0$\n\nSo, the homology of the function $f$ on the space $X$ is given by $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_1 = 0$."
