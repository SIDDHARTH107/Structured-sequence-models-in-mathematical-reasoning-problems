What is the final value of the system, $(x(\\infty), y(\\infty))$, under this optimal control law?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control law $u^*(t)$ that minimizes the cost function, we can use the Hamiltonian method. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function $H(x, y, u, p_x, p_y)$ as follows:\n\n$$\nH(x, y, u, p_x, p_y) = x^2 + y^2 + u^2 + p_x(2u - x) + p_y(xy - x + y - 1),\n$$\n\nwhere $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the costate variables. The necessary conditions for optimality are given by the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = 2u - x, \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} &= \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = xy - x + y - 1, \\\\\n\\frac{dp_x}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -2x - p_x + p_y(y - 1), \\\\\n\\frac{dp_y}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = -2y + p_x - p_y(x - 1), \\\\\n0 &= \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 2u + 2p_x.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nFrom the last equation, we can find the optimal control law $u^*(t)$:\n\n$$\nu^*(t) = -p_x.\n$$\n\nNow, we have a system of four first-order differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= -x - p_x, \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} &= xy - x + y - 1, \\\\\n\\frac{dp_x}{dt} &= -2x - p_x + p_y(y - 1), \\\\\n\\frac{dp_y}{dt} &= -2y + p_x - p_y(x - 1).\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nTo find the final value of the system $(x(\\infty), y(\\infty))$, we need to solve this system of differential equations. However, this system is nonlinear and does not have a closed-form solution. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to solve it, such as the Runge-Kutta method or the shooting method.\n\nIn summary, the optimal control law $u^*(t)$ is given by $u^*(t) = -p_x$. To find the final value of the system $(x(\\infty), y(\\infty))$, we need to solve the system of nonlinear differential equations using numerical methods."
