    "message_2": "1. To compute the theta functions theta_P and theta_Q, we first need to find the divisors associated with the points P and Q. \n\nThe divisor associated with P is (P) - (O), where O is the point at infinity on the elliptic curve. Similarly, the divisor associated with Q is (Q) - (O). \n\nNow, we can compute the theta functions theta_P and theta_Q. The theta function associated with a divisor (D) is given by the sum of the Weierstrass ℘-function and its derivative with respect to the variable x:\n\ntheta_D(x, y) = ℘(x - x_D) + ℘'(x - x_D)\n\nFor P = (0, 0), we have:\n\ntheta_P(x, y) = ℘(x) + ℘'(x)\n\nFor Q = (2, 4), we have:\n\ntheta_Q(x, y) = ℘(x - 2) + ℘'(x - 2)\n\n2. To evaluate the inner product <theta_P, theta_Q>, we need to compute the following integral:\n\n<theta_P, theta_Q> = ∫∫(theta_P * theta_Q) dx dy\n\nSince theta_P and theta_Q are given by the sum of the Weierstrass ℘-function and its derivative, we can rewrite the inner product as:\n\n<theta_P, theta_Q> = ∫∫((℘(x) + ℘'(x)) * (℘(x - 2) + ℘'(x - 2))) dx dy\n\nNow, we can express this inner product as a ratio of two determinants of size 2x2. Let A = ∫∫(℘(x) * ℘(x - 2)) dx dy, B = ∫∫(℘'(x) * ℘'(x - 2)) dx dy, and C = ∫∫(℘(x) * ℘'(x - 2) + ℘'(x) * ℘(x - 2)) dx dy. Then, we have:\n\n<theta_P, theta_Q> = (A * B - C^2) / (A * B)\n\n3. The arithmetic intersection number of P and Q can be computed using the following formula:\n\nI(P, Q) = deg((P) - (O) + (Q) - (O))\n\nSince the degree of the divisor (O) is 0, we have:\n\nI(P, Q) = deg((P) + (Q))\n\nThe degree of a sum of two divisors is equal to the sum of their degrees. Therefore, we have:\n\nI(P, Q) = deg(P) + deg(Q) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, we can find the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated with the divisor (P) - (Q). The Riemann-Roch theorem states that:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated with the divisor D, K is the canonical divisor, and g is the genus of the curve.\n\nFor the divisor (P) - (Q), we have:\n\ndeg((P) - (Q)) = deg(P) - deg(Q) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSince the elliptic curve has genus 1, we have:\n\nl((P) - (Q)) - l(K - (P) - (Q)) = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle associated with the divisor (P) - (Q) is 0."
