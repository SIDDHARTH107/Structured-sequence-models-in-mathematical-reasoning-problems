    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of complex optimization problems. To apply the WOA to the given problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales with random positions within the search space:\n   x ∈ [-π, π] and y ∈ [-π/2, π/2].\n\n2. Define the maximum number of iterations (T) and set the current iteration (t) to 1.\n\n3. Calculate the fitness of each whale using the objective function f(x, y) = -sin(x)cos(y).\n\n4. Find the whale with the best fitness (the global best).\n\n5. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations, which involve the global best position, a random whale's position, and a random number between 0 and 1.\n\n6. Check if the new positions of the whales are within the search space. If not, adjust them to the boundaries.\n\n7. Calculate the fitness of each whale using the updated positions.\n\n8. Update the global best position if a better solution is found.\n\n9. Increment the current iteration (t = t + 1).\n\n10. Repeat steps 5 to 9 until the maximum number of iterations (T) is reached.\n\n11. The global best position represents the minimum value of the objective function.\n\nNote that the WOA is a stochastic algorithm, and the solution may vary depending on the initial population and random factors during the search process. To increase the accuracy of the solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best result."
