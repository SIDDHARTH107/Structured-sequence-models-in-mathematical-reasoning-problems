    "message_2": "In second-order logic, we can express the number of distinct 2-element subsets of a set with n elements using the concept of cardinality and the binomial coefficient. The number of 2-element subsets of a set with n elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, 2), which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n - 2)!)\n\nWhere n! denotes the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nTo express this in second-order logic, we first need to define the concepts of factorial and binomial coefficient. We can define the factorial function as follows:\n\nFactorial(0) = 1\nFactorial(n) = n * Factorial(n - 1) for n > 0\n\nNext, we can define the binomial coefficient function:\n\nBinomial(n, k) = Factorial(n) / (Factorial(k) * Factorial(n - k))\n\nNow, we can express the number of distinct 2-element subsets of a set with n elements using the binomial coefficient function:\n\nNumberOf2ElementSubsets(n) = Binomial(n, 2)\n\nThis second-order logic expression gives the number of distinct 2-element subsets of a set with n elements."
