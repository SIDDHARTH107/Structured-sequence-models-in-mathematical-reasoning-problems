    "message_2": "To prove that B is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in B is also an element in A. In other words, if x is an element of B, then x must also be an element of A.\n\nB is an empty set, which means it has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in B that are not in A. Since there are no counterexamples, we can conclude that B is a subset of A."
