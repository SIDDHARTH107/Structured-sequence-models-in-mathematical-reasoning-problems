    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular octagon with a side length of 5 cm, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = 2 * a^2 * (1 + √2)\n\nwhere a is the side length of the octagon.\n\nPlugging in the given side length:\n\nArea = 2 * (5 cm)^2 * (1 + √2)\nArea = 2 * 25 cm^2 * (1 + √2)\nArea = 50 cm^2 * (1 + √2)\nArea ≈ 50 cm^2 * (1 + 1.414)\nArea ≈ 50 cm^2 * 2.414\nArea ≈ 120.7 cm^2\n\nThe area of the regular octagon is approximately 120.7 square centimeters."
