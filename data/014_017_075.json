    "message_2": "To determine the shift used in the Caesar cipher, we need to find the most frequent letter in the encrypted message. Since \"E\" appears 23 times out of 150 characters, it is likely the most frequent letter in the original message.\n\nIn English, the most common letter is \"E\". Assuming the original message is in English, we can deduce that the letter \"E\" was shifted to the most frequent letter in the encrypted message.\n\nLet's denote the most frequent letter in the encrypted message as \"X\". To find the shift, we need to calculate the difference between the positions of \"E\" and \"X\" in the alphabet.\n\nShift = Position of X - Position of E\n\nSince we don't know the value of \"X\", we cannot provide a specific numerical shift value. However, once the most frequent letter in the encrypted message is identified, the shift can be calculated using the formula above."
