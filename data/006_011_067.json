    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 accidents occurring in a 5-day work week, we can use the complementary probability, which means we will find the probability of 0 or 1 accident occurring and then subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (5 days), x is the number of successes (accidents), p is the probability of success (0.3), q is the probability of failure (1 - p = 0.7), and nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 accidents:\n\nP(0) = (5C0) * (0.3^0) * (0.7^5)\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * 0.16807\nP(0) = 0.16807\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 accident:\n\nP(1) = (5C1) * (0.3^1) * (0.7^4)\nP(1) = 5 * 0.3 * 0.2401\nP(1) = 0.36015\n\nNow, we find the probability of 0 or 1 accident:\n\nP(0 or 1) = P(0) + P(1)\nP(0 or 1) = 0.16807 + 0.36015\nP(0 or 1) = 0.52822\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least 2 accidents by subtracting the probability of 0 or 1 accident from 1:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0 or 1)\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.52822\nP(at least 2) = 0.47178\n\nSo, the probability of at least 2 accidents occurring in a 5-day work week is approximately 0.47178 or 47.18%."
