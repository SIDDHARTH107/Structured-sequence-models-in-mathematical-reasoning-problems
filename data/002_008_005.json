    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem:\nWhat is the volume of a right circular cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a right circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(5²)(12)\nVolume = (1/3)π(25)(12)\nVolume = (1/3)(3.14159)(25)(12)\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume:\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(300)\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(942.477)\nVolume ≈ 314.159 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the right circular cone is approximately 314.159 cubic centimeters."
