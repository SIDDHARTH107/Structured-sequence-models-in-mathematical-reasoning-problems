    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (n * s) / 2^(i - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of line segments in the initial curve, s is the length of each line segment, and i is the iteration number.\n\nFor the Hilbert curve, the number of line segments in the initial curve (n) is 1, and the length of each line segment (s) is 1 unit.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the Hilbert curve for the 4th iteration (i = 4):\n\nLength = (1 * 1) / 2^(4 - 1)\nLength = 1 / 2^3\nLength = 1 / 8\n\nNow, the total length of the Hilbert curve up to the 4th iteration is the sum of the lengths of the curve at each iteration:\n\nTotal Length = Length at 1st iteration + Length at 2nd iteration + Length at 3rd iteration + Length at 4th iteration\n\nLet's calculate the lengths at each iteration:\n\nLength at 1st iteration = (1 * 1) / 2^(1 - 1) = 1 / 2^0 = 1\nLength at 2nd iteration = (1 * 1) / 2^(2 - 1) = 1 / 2^1 = 1/2\nLength at 3rd iteration = (1 * 1) / 2^(3 - 1) = 1 / 2^2 = 1/4\nLength at 4th iteration = (1 * 1) / 2^(4 - 1) = 1 / 2^3 = 1/8\n\nTotal Length = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 8/8 + 4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8 = 15/8\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve up to the 4th iteration is 15/8 units."
