    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\log_{2}(x+1) + \\log_{2}(x-1) = 3$, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the product rule, which states that $\\log_{a}(b) + \\log_{a}(c) = \\log_{a}(bc)$. Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\n$\\log_{2}((x+1)(x-1)) = 3$\n\nNow, we can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n$2^3 = (x+1)(x-1)$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$8 = x^2 - 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$x^2 - 1 = 8$\n\n$x^2 = 9$\n\n$x = \\pm\\sqrt{9}$\n\n$x = \\pm3$\n\nHowever, we must check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If we plug in $x = 3$, we get:\n\n$\\log_{2}(3+1) + \\log_{2}(3-1) = \\log_{2}(4) + \\log_{2}(2) = 2 + 1 = 3$\n\nSo, $x = 3$ is a valid solution. If we plug in $x = -3$, we get:\n\n$\\log_{2}(-3+1) + \\log_{2}(-3-1)$\n\nSince the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, $x = -3$ is not a valid solution. Therefore, the only solution to the equation is $x = 3$."
