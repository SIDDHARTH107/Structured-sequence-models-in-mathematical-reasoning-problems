    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function y = cos(3x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y = cos(3x):\n\ny'(x) = -sin(3x) * 3\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ny'(π/6) = -sin(3(π/6)) * 3\ny'(π/6) = -sin(π/2) * 3\ny'(π/6) = -1 * 3\ny'(π/6) = -3\n\nSo, the value of the derivative of the function y = cos(3x) at x = π/6 is -3."
