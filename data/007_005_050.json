    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 25, and 30, we first find the prime factorization of each number:\n\n15 = 3 × 5\n25 = 5 × 5\n30 = 2 × 3 × 5\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:\n\n2^1 (from 30)\n3^1 (from 15 and 30)\n5^2 (from 25)\n\nMultiply these prime factors together to get the LCM:\n\nLCM(15, 25, 30) = 2^1 × 3^1 × 5^2 = 2 × 3 × 25 = 6 × 25 = 150\n\nSo, the LCM of 15, 25, and 30 is 150."
