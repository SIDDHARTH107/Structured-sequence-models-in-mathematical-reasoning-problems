    "message_2": "The residue of a function at a point is the coefficient of the (z - z0)^(-1) term in the Laurent series expansion of the function around that point. In this case, we are looking for the residue of f(z) at z = 0.\n\nSince f(z) is an entire function, it has a Taylor series expansion around z = 0. The Taylor series expansion of f(z) is given by:\n\nf(z) = 3z^5 - 2z^3 + 4z - 6\n\nThere is no (z - 0)^(-1) term in this expansion, so the residue of f(z) at z = 0 is 0."
