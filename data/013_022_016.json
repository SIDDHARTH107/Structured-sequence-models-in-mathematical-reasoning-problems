    "message_2": "In this scenario, Player 1 gives Player 2 $40. So, Player 2's payoff is $40.\n\nPlayer 1 is left with the remaining amount from the initial $100. To find this, we subtract the amount given to Player 2 from the initial amount:\n\n$100 - $40 = $60\n\nSo, Player 1's payoff is $60.\n\nIn conclusion, the payoff for Player 1 is $60 and the payoff for Player 2 is $40."
