    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the numerator is equal to zero, i.e., $z^3 - 1 = 0$. This can be factored as $(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. So, we have two zeros:\n\n1. $z = 1$, which is a simple zero (order 1) since the exponent of $(z - 1)$ is 1.\n2. The zeros of the quadratic equation $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$$\n\nThese are two complex conjugate zeros, both of order 1.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., $z^2 - 1 = 0$. This can be factored as $(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0$. So, we have two poles:\n\n1. $z = 1$, which is a simple pole (order 1) since the exponent of $(z - 1)$ is 1. However, since there is also a zero at $z = 1$, the zero and pole cancel each other out, and there is no pole at $z = 1$ for the function $f(z)$.\n2. $z = -1$, which is a simple pole (order 1) since the exponent of $(z + 1)$ is 1.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3 - 1}{z^2 - 1}$ has three zeros: $z = 1$ (order 1), $z = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ (order 1), and $z = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ (order 1), and one pole: $z = -1$ (order 1)."
