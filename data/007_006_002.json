    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 144 and 180 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (180) by the smaller number (144) and find the remainder.\n   180 รท 144 = 1 with a remainder of 36.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (180) with the smaller number (144) and the smaller number with the remainder (36) from the previous step.\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 144 and 36.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (144) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n   144 รท 36 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the smaller number (36) in the last step.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 144 and 180 is 36."
