    "message_1": "A boat is sailing with a velocity of 20 km/h northeast direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to its original position where its velocity was initially 12 km/h due north? (Round your answer to one decimal place.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to its original position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet's represent the boat's initial velocity (12 km/h due north) as vector A and its current velocity (20 km/h northeast) as vector B. We need to find the difference between these two vectors, which we'll call vector C.\n\nSince the boat's current velocity is in the northeast direction, we can break it down into its north and east components. The north component of vector B will be equal to 20 * cos(45°), and the east component will be equal to 20 * sin(45°). (We use 45° because northeast is halfway between north and east.)\n\nNorth component of B = 20 * cos(45°) = 20 * 0.7071 ≈ 14.1 km/h\nEast component of B = 20 * sin(45°) = 20 * 0.7071 ≈ 14.1 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the north components of vectors A and B:\n\nNorth component of C = North component of B - North component of A = 14.1 - 12 = 2.1 km/h\n\nThe east component of vector C is the same as the east component of vector B, which is 14.1 km/h.\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of vector C using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nMagnitude of C = √((North component of C)^2 + (East component of C)^2)\nMagnitude of C = √((2.1)^2 + (14.1)^2) ≈ √(4.41 + 198.81) ≈ √203.22 ≈ 14.3 km/h\n\nTo find the direction of vector C, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nDirection of C = arctan(East component of C / North component of C)\nDirection of C = arctan(14.1 / 2.1) ≈ 81.6°\n\nSince the angle is measured from the north direction, the boat's velocity relative to its original position is 14.3 km/h at an angle of 81.6° east of north."
