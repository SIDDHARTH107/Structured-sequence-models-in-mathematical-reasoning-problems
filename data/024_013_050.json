    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor g_ij. The metric tensor for the given metric g in spherical coordinates is:\n\ng_ij = (1/4) * | 1          0          |\n               | 0   sin^2θ |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of g_ij:\n\ndet(g_ij) = (1/4)^2 * (1 * sin^2θ - 0) = (1/16) * sin^2θ\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the differential volume element in the coordinate system. In spherical coordinates, the differential volume element is dV = r^2 sinθ dθ dφ. Since we are considering a sphere of radius 1, r = 1, and the differential volume element becomes dV = sinθ dθ dφ.\n\nNow, we can compute the volume form:\n\n√(det(g_ij)) * dV = √((1/16) * sin^2θ) * sinθ dθ dφ = (1/4) * sinθ dθ dφ\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric on the sphere S^2 of radius 1 is:\n\n(1/4) * sinθ dθ dφ"
