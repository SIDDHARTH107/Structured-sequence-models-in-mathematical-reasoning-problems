    "message_2": "Let $A$ be an abelian variety of dimension $g$ over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. The endomorphism ring $\\text{End}(A)$ is a commutative subring of $\\text{End}_{k}(V)$, where $V$ is the tangent space of $A$ at the identity element. Since $A$ has dimension $g$, the tangent space $V$ is a $g$-dimensional vector space over $k$. The endomorphisms of $V$ form a $k$-algebra isomorphic to the matrix algebra $M_g(k)$, consisting of $g \\times g$ matrices with entries in $k$.\n\nNow, consider the action of $\\text{End}(A)$ on the tangent space $V$. Since $\\text{End}(A)$ is a commutative subring of $\\text{End}_{k}(V)$, it is also a commutative $k$-algebra. By the structure theorem for commutative semisimple algebras, $\\text{End}(A)$ is isomorphic to a product of matrix algebras over division rings:\n\n$$\\text{End}(A) \\cong M_{n_1}(D_1) \\times \\cdots \\times M_{n_r}(D_r),$$\n\nwhere $D_i$ are division rings that are finite-dimensional over their centers $F_i$, which are subfields of $k$. Since $\\text{End}(A)$ is a subalgebra of $M_g(k)$, we have\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^r n_i^2 [F_i : k] \\le g^2.$$\n\nThe maximum number of independent elements in $\\text{End}(A)$ is the dimension of $\\text{End}(A)$ as a $k$-vector space, which is given by\n\n$$\\dim_k \\text{End}(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^r n_i^2 [F_i : k].$$\n\nTo maximize this quantity, we want to maximize the sum of the squares of the degrees $n_i$ of the matrix algebras in the decomposition, subject to the constraint that the sum of the squares of the degrees times the field extensions $[F_i : k]$ is at most $g^2$. \n\nSince $[F_i : k] \\ge 1$ for all $i$, the maximum is achieved when $r = 1$, $n_1 = g$, and $D_1 = k$. In this case, we have\n\n$$\\dim_k \\text{End}(A) = g^2.$$\n\nThus, the maximum number of independent elements in $\\text{End}(A)$ is $g^2$."
