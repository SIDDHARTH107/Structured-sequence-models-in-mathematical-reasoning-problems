    "message_2": "To find the x and y components of a vector, we can use the following formulas:\n\nAx = A * cos(θ)\nAy = A * sin(θ)\n\nwhere A is the magnitude of the vector, θ is the angle with the x-axis, and Ax and Ay are the x and y components, respectively.\n\nGiven that the magnitude of vector A is 5 and the angle with the x-axis is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formulas:\n\nAx = 5 * cos(60°)\nAy = 5 * sin(60°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians, as most calculators and programming languages use radians for trigonometric functions:\n\n60° * (π / 180) = π / 3\n\nNow we can calculate the x and y components:\n\nAx = 5 * cos(π / 3) = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5\nAy = 5 * sin(π / 3) = 5 * (√3 / 2) = 5 * (√3) / 2 ≈ 4.330\n\nSo, the x and y components of vector A are approximately 2.5 and 4.330, respectively."
