    "message_1": "A chemical plant produces two types of paints, glossy and matte. The manufacturing process for glossy and matte paints requires 4 and 5 units of a certain chemical, respectively. The plant has 100 units of this chemical. It takes 2 hours to produce a gallon of glossy paint and 3 hours to produce a gallon of matte paint. The plant can operate for a maximum of 30 hours per day. If the profit for a gallon of glossy paint is $10 and for a gallon of matte paint is $8, how many gallons of each type of paint should be produced to maximize the profit while staying within the constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of gallons of glossy paint and y be the number of gallons of matte paint.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. Chemical constraint: 4x + 5y ≤ 100\n2. Time constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 30\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≥ (100 - 4x) / 5\n2. y ≤ (30 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph. The feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied.\n\nNext, we will find the vertices of the feasible region. These are the points where the constraint lines intersect. We have three vertices:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 20)\n3. (10, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 20) = 10(0) + 8(20) = $160\n3. P(10, 0) = 10(10) + 8(0) = $100\n\nThe maximum profit is $160, which occurs when the plant produces 0 gallons of glossy paint and 20 gallons of matte paint."
