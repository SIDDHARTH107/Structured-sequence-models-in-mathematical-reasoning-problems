    "message_2": "To prove that A ∪ B is a superset of A and B individually, we need to show that every element in A and B is also an element of A ∪ B.\n\nRecall the definition of the union of two sets: A ∪ B is the set containing all elements that are in A or in B (or in both). \n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element x in set A. Since x is in A, it is also in A ∪ B by definition of the union. Therefore, every element in A is also in A ∪ B, which means A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider an arbitrary element y in set B. Since y is in B, it is also in A ∪ B by definition of the union. Therefore, every element in B is also in A ∪ B, which means A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B individually."
