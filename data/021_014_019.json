    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute code or run simulations, but I can guide you through the process of solving this optimization problem using genetic algorithms.\n\n1. Initialization:\nGenerate an initial population of chromosomes (possible solutions) randomly. Each chromosome will represent a pair of values (x, y) that satisfy the constraints. You can represent the chromosomes as binary strings or floating-point numbers.\n\n2. Fitness function:\nDefine a fitness function that evaluates the quality of each solution. In this case, the fitness function will be f(x, y) = 2x + 3y. The higher the fitness value, the better the solution.\n\n3. Selection:\nSelect chromosomes for reproduction based on their fitness values. You can use methods like roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, or rank selection.\n\n4. Crossover:\nPerform crossover (recombination) on the selected chromosomes to create offspring. You can use methods like single-point crossover, two-point crossover, or uniform crossover.\n\n5. Mutation:\nApply mutation to the offspring chromosomes with a certain probability. Mutation introduces small random changes in the chromosomes, which helps maintain diversity in the population and avoid premature convergence.\n\n6. Replacement:\nReplace the least fit individuals in the population with the offspring.\n\n7. Termination:\nRepeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness value.\n\nAfter the termination criterion is met, the chromosome with the highest fitness value in the final population will represent the optimal solution (x, y) for the given problem.\n\nPlease note that the genetic algorithm is a heuristic method, and it may not always find the exact optimal solution. However, it can often find a good approximation of the optimal solution, especially for complex problems."
