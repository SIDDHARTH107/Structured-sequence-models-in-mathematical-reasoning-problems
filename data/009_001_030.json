Assuming that the growth rate remains constant, how long will it take for the population to reach 100,000 people? Use a differential equation model for population growth to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth model, which is a differential equation that describes population growth. The model is given by:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time, and k is the growth rate.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the growth rate from percentage to a decimal value. The growth rate is 5%, so k = 0.05.\n\nNow, we can separate variables and integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫(0.05) dt\n\nln(P) = 0.05t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition: P(0) = 50,000.\n\nln(50,000) = 0.05(0) + C\nln(50,000) = C\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = 0.05t + ln(50,000)\n\nTo find the time it takes for the population to reach 100,000, we can set P = 100,000 and solve for t:\n\nln(100,000) = 0.05t + ln(50,000)\n\nNow, we can subtract ln(50,000) from both sides:\n\nln(100,000) - ln(50,000) = 0.05t\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the left side as:\n\nln(100,000/50,000) = 0.05t\n\nln(2) = 0.05t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = ln(2) / 0.05 ≈ 13.86 years\n\nSo, it will take approximately 13.86 years for the population to reach 100,000 people."
