Take the initial guess as x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0, and iterate until the relative error between two successive approximations is less than or equal to 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To use the Jacobi Iteration method, we first rewrite the given system of equations in the form x = f(x, y, z), y = g(x, y, z), and z = h(x, y, z):\n\nx = 6 - y - z\ny = (2 - 2x + 3z) / (-1)\nz = (5 - 3x - y) / 4\n\nNow, we will iterate using the initial guess x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 6 - 0 - 0 = 6\ny1 = (2 - 2*0 + 3*0) / (-1) = -2\nz1 = (5 - 3*0 - 0) / 4 = 1.25\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 6 - (-2) - 1.25 = 7.25\ny2 = (2 - 2*6 + 3*1.25) / (-1) = 1.25\nz2 = (5 - 3*7.25 - (-2)) / 4 = -1.25\n\nNow, we calculate the relative error between the first and second approximations:\n\nRelative error for x: |(7.25 - 6) / 7.25| = 0.1724\nRelative error for y: |(1.25 - (-2)) / 1.25| = 2.6\nRelative error for z: |(-1.25 - 1.25) / (-1.25)| = 2\n\nSince the relative error for all variables is not less than or equal to 0.01, we continue with the next iteration:\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 6 - 1.25 - (-1.25) = 6\ny3 = (2 - 2*7.25 + 3*(-1.25)) / (-1) = -1.5\nz3 = (5 - 3*6 - 1.25) / 4 = 0.25\n\nNow, we calculate the relative error between the second and third approximations:\n\nRelative error for x: |(6 - 7.25) / 6| = 0.2083\nRelative error for y: |(-1.5 - 1.25) / (-1.5)| = 1.8333\nRelative error for z: |(0.25 - (-1.25)) / 0.25| = 6\n\nThe relative error is still not less than or equal to 0.01, so we would need to continue iterating until the relative error condition is met. However, it seems that the relative error is not decreasing, which indicates that the Jacobi Iteration method may not be converging for this system of equations. In this case, it would be better to try another method, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the Conjugate Gradient method, to find the approximate solution."
