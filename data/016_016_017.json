    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that can be constructed through a series of iterations. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (√7). \n\nGiven that the initial segment has a length of 1 unit, the length of the 5th iteration of the Gosper curve can be calculated as follows:\n\nLength = Initial Length × (√7)^Iteration\nLength = 1 × (√7)^5\nLength ≈ 1 × 168.169\nLength ≈ 168.169 units\n\nSo, the length of the 5th iteration of the Gosper curve is approximately 168.169 units."
