    "message_2": "To find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, we can use the following formula:\n\ndet(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the elements of the first row, d, e, and f are the elements of the second row, and g, h, and i are the elements of the third row.\n\nFor the given matrix:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    3 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\na = 3, b = 2, c = 1, d = 0, e = 4, f = 2, g = 1, h = 5, and i = 2.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ndet(A) = 3(4*2 - 2*5) - 2(0*2 - 2*1) + 1(0*5 - 4*1)\ndet(A) = 3(8 - 10) - 2(0 - 2) + 1(0 - 4)\ndet(A) = 3(-2) - 2(-2) + 1(-4)\ndet(A) = -6 + 4 - 4\ndet(A) = -6\n\nSo, the determinant of the matrix is -6."
