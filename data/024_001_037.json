    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the curve with respect to time t.\n\nGiven the curve:\nx = 2t\ny = 4t\nz = t^2 - 1\n\nFirst derivatives:\ndx/dt = 2\ndy/dt = 4\ndz/dt = 2t\n\nThe tangent vector T(t) is given by:\nT(t) = <2, 4, 2t>\n\nSecond derivatives:\nd^2x/dt^2 = 0\nd^2y/dt^2 = 0\nd^2z/dt^2 = 2\n\nThe normal vector N(t) is given by:\nN(t) = <0, 0, 2>\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk = ||T'(t)|| / ||T(t)||^3\n\nAt t = 2, the tangent vector T(t) is <2, 4, 4> and the normal vector N(t) is <0, 0, 2>. \n\n||T(t)|| = sqrt(2^2 + 4^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(36) = 6\n||T'(t)|| = ||N(t)|| = sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + 2^2) = 2\n\nk = ||T'(t)|| / ||T(t)||^3 = 2 / (6^3) = 2 / 216 = 1/108\n\nNow, we can find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n\nτ = (T(t) x N(t)) • T''(t) / ||T'(t)||^2\n\nT(t) x N(t) = <8, -4, 0>\nT''(t) = <0, 0, 2>\n\nAt t = 2, the cross product of T(t) and N(t) is <8, -4, 0>, and T''(t) is <0, 0, 2>.\n\n(T(t) x N(t)) • T''(t) = <8, -4, 0> • <0, 0, 2> = 0\n\nτ = (T(t) x N(t)) • T''(t) / ||T'(t)||^2 = 0 / (2^2) = 0\n\nSo, at time t = 2, the curvature of the space curve is k = 1/108, and the torsion is τ = 0."
