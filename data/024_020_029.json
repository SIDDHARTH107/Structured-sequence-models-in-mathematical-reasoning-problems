    "message_2": "The Hopf map h: M → S² is a mapping from a 3-dimensional manifold M to the 2-sphere S². The Hopf map is defined as follows:\n\nh(x) = (2x₁x₂ + 2x₃x₄, 2x₂x₃ - 2x₁x₄, x₁² + x₃² - x₂² - x₄²)\n\nwhere x = (x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄) is a point in M, and x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² = 1.\n\nGiven that x = (1, 0, 0, 0) in M, we can find the image of x under the Hopf map by plugging the coordinates of x into the Hopf map formula:\n\nh(x) = (2(1)(0) + 2(0)(0), 2(0)(0) - 2(1)(0), (1)² + (0)² - (0)² - (0)²)\n\nh(x) = (0, 0, 1)\n\nSo, the image of x under the Hopf map is the point (0, 0, 1) in S²."
