    "message_1": "Suppose we have an elliptic curve E defined over a prime field Fp such that E(Fp) has 23 points. If a generator of the subgroup of E(Fp) has order 17, what is the order of the subgroup generated by 3 times this generator?",
    "message_2": "Let G be the generator of the subgroup of E(Fp) with order 17. Then, the subgroup generated by G has 17 elements, including the identity element (the point at infinity).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup generated by 3G, where 3G is the point obtained by adding G to itself three times. We want to find the order of this subgroup.\n\nSince G has order 17, we know that 17G is the identity element. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(17G) = (3G) + (3G) + ... + (3G) (with 3G added to itself some number of times)\n\nLet's find the smallest positive integer k such that (3G) has order k:\n\nk(3G) = (3k)G = 17G\n\nSince 17 is a prime number, the smallest positive integer k that satisfies this equation is when 3k is a multiple of 17. The smallest multiple of 17 that is also a multiple of 3 is 3 * 17 = 51. Therefore, k = 51/3 = 17.\n\nSo, the order of the subgroup generated by 3 times the generator G is 17."
