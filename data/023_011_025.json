    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subject of Fourier analysis and the subtopic of using Fourier transform to analyze the behavior of systems:\n\nConsider a periodic signal given by the equation f(t) = 3sin(5πt) + 5sin(8πt). Using Fourier transform, determine the frequency domain representation of this signal.\n\n(Note: The student should be able to use the Fourier transform formula to determine the frequency domain representation of the given signal.)",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t) = 3sin(5πt) + 5sin(8πt), we can use the Fourier series representation for periodic signals. Since the given signal is a sum of sinusoids, we can directly write its Fourier series representation.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a periodic signal is given by:\n\nf(t) = Σ[Cn * exp(jnω₀t)]\n\nwhere Cn are the complex Fourier coefficients, ω₀ is the fundamental angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nFor the given signal, we can identify the sinusoids and their respective coefficients:\n\n1) A1 = 3, ω1 = 5π\n2) A2 = 5, ω2 = 8π\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the given signal:\n\nf(t) = C1 * exp(jω1t) + C2 * exp(jω2t)\n\nSince the given signal consists of sine functions, we know that the coefficients C1 and C2 will be purely imaginary. We can represent them as:\n\nC1 = j * A1/2 = j * 3/2\nC2 = j * A2/2 = j * 5/2\n\nNow, we can write the frequency domain representation of the signal:\n\nF(ω) = (3/2)jδ(ω - 5π) + (5/2)jδ(ω - 8π)\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSo, the frequency domain representation of the given signal f(t) = 3sin(5πt) + 5sin(8πt) is:\n\nF(ω) = (3/2)jδ(ω - 5π) + (5/2)jδ(ω - 8π)"
