    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (starting length) * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the starting length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10)\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon Curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
