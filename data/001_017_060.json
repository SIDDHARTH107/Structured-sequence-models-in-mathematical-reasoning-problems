    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x) + log(x - 2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the product rule of logarithms, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), we can combine the two logarithms:\n\nlog(x(x - 2)) = 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form to get rid of the logarithm:\n\n10^2 = x(x - 2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n100 = x^2 - 2x\n\nRearranging the equation into a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 100 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -100. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-100))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 ± √(4 + 400)) / 2\n\nx = (2 ± √404) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (2 + √404) / 2 ≈ 10.1\nx = (2 - √404) / 2 ≈ -9.1\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, we cannot have a negative value inside the logarithm function. Therefore, the only valid solution is:\n\nx ≈ 10.1"
