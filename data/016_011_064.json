    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal, also known as the Vicsek snowflake, is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly replacing a square with a cross shape made up of five smaller squares. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal after n iterations as P(n). After the first iteration, the initial square is replaced by a cross shape made up of five smaller squares, and the perimeter becomes 8 times the length of the side of the smaller square.\n\nFor the first iteration, the side length of the smaller square is 1/3 of the original square, so the perimeter is P(1) = 8 * (1/3) = 8/3.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 8/3. Therefore, after four iterations, the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nP(4) = P(1) * (8/3)^3 = (8/3) * (8/3)^3 = (8/3)^4 = 4096/81 â‰ˆ 50.5679 units."
