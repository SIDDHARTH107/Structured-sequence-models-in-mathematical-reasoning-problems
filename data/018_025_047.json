    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B, but not both}\n\nA △ B = {5, 7, 11, 13, 17}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the sets A and B.
