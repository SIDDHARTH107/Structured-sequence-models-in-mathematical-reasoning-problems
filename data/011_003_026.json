    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-k)!]\n\nHere, n = 6 and k = 3.\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10\n\nSo, the value in the 6th row and 3rd column of Pascal's triangle is 10."
