    "message_2": "The truth value for the proposition \"it is necessary that A is true\" is true. This is because the sum of two odd numbers is always even, as odd numbers can be represented as (2n + 1) and (2m + 1), where n and m are integers. When you add these two expressions, you get (2n + 2m + 2), which can be factored as 2(n + m + 1), showing that the sum is a multiple of 2 and therefore even. Since this statement is always true, it is necessary that A is true."
