Let G be the group of transformations generated by the matrices:\nA = [[1, 0], [1, 1]] and B = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]\n\nLet V be the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 3 in x and y, and let W be the subspace of G-invariant polynomials. \n\nFind a basis for W, and determine the dimension of W.",
    "message_2": "To find a basis for W, we need to find the G-invariant polynomials of degree 3 in x and y. First, let's find the action of A and B on a general polynomial in V. Let p(x, y) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in x and y. Then,\n\np(x, y) = ax^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^3\n\nNow, let's find the action of A and B on p(x, y).\n\n1. Action of A:\nA = [[1, 0], [1, 1]]\nA * (x, y) = (x, x + y)\n\np_A(x, y) = p(x, x + y) = a(x^3) + b(x^2)(x + y) + c(x)(x + y)^2 + d(x + y)^3\n\n2. Action of B:\nB = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]\nB * (x, y) = (y, -x)\n\np_B(x, y) = p(y, -x) = a(y^3) - b(y^2)x - c(yx^2) + dx^3\n\nNow, we need to find the polynomials that are invariant under both actions, i.e., polynomials such that p(x, y) = p_A(x, y) = p_B(x, y).\n\nComparing the coefficients of p(x, y) and p_A(x, y), we get:\n\na = a\nb = a + b\nc = b + c\nd = a + c + d\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\na = a\nb = a\nc = a\nd = 2a\n\nSo, the G-invariant polynomials under the action of A are of the form:\n\np(x, y) = a(x^3 + x^2y + xy^2 + 2y^3)\n\nNow, we need to find the polynomials that are also invariant under the action of B. Comparing the coefficients of p(x, y) and p_B(x, y), we get:\n\na = d\nb = -c\nc = -b\nd = a\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\na = a\nb = -a\nc = a\nd = a\n\nSo, the G-invariant polynomials under the action of both A and B are of the form:\n\np(x, y) = a(x^3 - x^2y + xy^2 + y^3)\n\nThus, a basis for W is given by the single polynomial:\n\np(x, y) = x^3 - x^2y + xy^2 + y^3\n\nAnd the dimension of W is 1."
