    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to use the exponent properties. When multiplying two numbers with the same base and different exponents, we add the exponents. \n\nSo, 2^3 x 2^5 = 2^(3+5) = 2^8.\n\nAnd, 2^4 x 2^2 = 2^(4+2) = 2^6.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n2^8 - 2^6\n\nTo further simplify, we can factor out the smallest power of 2, which is 2^6:\n\n2^6(2^2 - 1)\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n\n2^6 = 64\n2^2 = 4\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n64(4 - 1)\n\n64(3) = 192\n\nThe simplified expression is 192."
