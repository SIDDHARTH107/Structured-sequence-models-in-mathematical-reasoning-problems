    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of people that must know each other (or be friends) to ensure that there is a subgroup of at least three people where all three are friends, or a subgroup of at least three people where no two are friends, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nConsider a single person in the group of 6. This person can either be friends or not friends with each of the other 5 people in the group. If this person has at least 3 friends or at least 3 non-friends, we can guarantee that there is a subgroup of 3 people where all three are friends or no two are friends.\n\nNow, let's assume that this person has 2 friends and 2 non-friends. In this case, we cannot guarantee that there is a subgroup of 3 people where all three are friends or no two are friends. However, if this person has at least 3 friends or at least 3 non-friends, we can guarantee that there is such a subgroup.\n\nSo, the minimum number of people that must know each other (or be friends) to ensure that there is a subgroup of at least three people where all three are friends, or a subgroup of at least three people where no two are friends, is 3. This is the Ramsey number R(3,3)."
