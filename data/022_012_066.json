    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the pole of the function f(z) = (z^3 + 1)/(z^2 - 4) at z = 2i, we first need to factor the denominator and see if it has a zero at z = 2i.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^2 - 4 = (z - 2)(z + 2)\n\nNow, let's check if z = 2i is a zero of the denominator:\n\n(2i - 2)(2i + 2) = (2i - 2)(2i + 2) â‰  0\n\nSince z = 2i is not a zero of the denominator, it is not a pole of the function f(z). Therefore, there is no order or type of pole at z = 2i for the given function."
