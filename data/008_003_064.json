    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix, we need to perform Gaussian elimination and count the number of non-zero rows in the resulting row-echelon form.\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nSubtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -6 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nNow, divide the second row by -3:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nAdd 6 times the second row to the third row:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nThe row-echelon form of the matrix has two non-zero rows, so the rank of the matrix is 2."
