    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product at a fixed cost of $50, with a demand equation given by q = 200 - 5p, where q is the quantity demanded and p is the price. What is the optimal price that maximizes the company's revenue?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price that maximizes the company's revenue, we first need to find the revenue equation. Revenue (R) is the product of the price (p) and the quantity demanded (q). \n\nR(p) = p * q\n\nGiven the demand equation q = 200 - 5p, we can substitute q in the revenue equation:\n\nR(p) = p * (200 - 5p)\n\nR(p) = 200p - 5p^2\n\nTo find the optimal price that maximizes revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function by taking the first derivative with respect to p and setting it equal to 0.\n\ndR(p)/dp = 200 - 10p\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for p:\n\n0 = 200 - 10p\n10p = 200\np = 20\n\nThe optimal price that maximizes the company's revenue is $20."
