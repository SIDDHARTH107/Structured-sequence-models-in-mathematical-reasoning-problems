    "message_1": "A student is conducting a survey to determine the favorite color of students in their school. Out of 80 students, 25 students chose blue, 18 students chose green, 12 students chose red, 10 students chose yellow, 7 students chose orange, and 8 students chose purple. Using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test with a 5% significance level, does the color preference of students in the school follow a uniform distribution?",
    "message_2": "To perform the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\nH0: The color preference follows a uniform distribution.\nH1: The color preference does not follow a uniform distribution.\n\n2. Determine the expected frequencies for each category under the assumption of a uniform distribution.\nThere are 6 colors, so if the preferences were uniformly distributed, we would expect each color to be chosen by 80/6 = 13.33 students.\n\n3. Calculate the chi-square test statistic.\nχ² = Σ[(observed frequency - expected frequency)² / expected frequency]\n\nFor blue: ((25 - 13.33)² / 13.33) = 10.24\nFor green: ((18 - 13.33)² / 13.33) = 1.63\nFor red: ((12 - 13.33)² / 13.33) = 0.14\nFor yellow: ((10 - 13.33)² / 13.33) = 0.84\nFor orange: ((7 - 13.33)² / 13.33) = 3.03\nFor purple: ((8 - 13.33)² / 13.33) = 2.16\n\nχ² = 10.24 + 1.63 + 0.14 + 0.84 + 3.03 + 2.16 = 18.04\n\n4. Determine the degrees of freedom.\ndf = number of categories - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\n5. Find the critical value for the chi-square distribution with the given degrees of freedom and significance level (5%).\nUsing a chi-square distribution table, we find that the critical value for df = 5 and α = 0.05 is 11.07.\n\n6. Compare the test statistic to the critical value.\nSince the test statistic (18.04) is greater than the critical value (11.07), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the chi-square goodness-of-fit test with a 5% significance level, we conclude that the color preference of students in the school does not follow a uniform distribution."
