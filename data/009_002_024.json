    "message_1": "The initial number of people infected with a virus in a community is 100. The rate of new infections is proportional to the number of infected people and is given by the differential equation dI/dt = 0.04I, where I is the number of infected people and t is the time in days. Find the number of infected people after 5 days.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation dI/dt = 0.04I. This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its general solution can be found using the integrating factor method or by recognizing that it is a separable equation.\n\nLet's solve it using the separable equation method:\n\ndI/dt = 0.04I\n\nRearrange the equation to separate the variables:\n\ndI/I = 0.04 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n∫(1/I) dI = ∫0.04 dt\n\nln(I) = 0.04t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition: at t=0, I=100.\n\nln(100) = 0.04(0) + C\n\nC = ln(100)\n\nNow we can write the particular solution:\n\nln(I) = 0.04t + ln(100)\n\nTo solve for I, we take the exponential of both sides:\n\nI = e^(0.04t + ln(100))\n\nI = e^(0.04t) * e^(ln(100))\n\nI = 100 * e^(0.04t)\n\nNow we can find the number of infected people after 5 days (t=5):\n\nI(5) = 100 * e^(0.04*5)\n\nI(5) ≈ 100 * e^0.2\n\nI(5) ≈ 122.14\n\nAfter 5 days, there will be approximately 122 infected people in the community."
