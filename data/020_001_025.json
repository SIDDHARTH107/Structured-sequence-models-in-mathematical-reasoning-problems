    "message_1": "A furniture maker produces two types of chairs - an armchair and a dining chair. Each dining chair requires 4 hours of labor and yields a profit of $20, while each armchair requires 6 hours of labor and yields a profit of $30. The maker has 60 hours of labor available per week.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the maker can earn in a week if they can produce no more than 10 armchairs? Solve the problem using linear programming.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of dining chairs and y be the number of armchairs produced.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 60 (each dining chair requires 4 hours of labor, and each armchair requires 6 hours)\n2. Armchair constraint: y ≤ 10 (no more than 10 armchairs can be produced)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (cannot produce a negative number of chairs)\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 6y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 4x) / 6\n\n2. y ≤ 10\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 10), (10, 0), and (15, 0). We will now evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 10) = 20(0) + 30(10) = $300\n3. P(10, 0) = 20(10) + 30(0) = $200\n4. P(15, 0) = 20(15) + 30(0) = $300\n\nThe maximum profit is $300, which can be achieved by producing either 10 armchairs or 15 dining chairs."
