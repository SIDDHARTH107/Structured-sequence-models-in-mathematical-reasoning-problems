    "message_2": "To determine the Cayley table for G, we first need to list the elements of G. Since G has order 4, it has 4 elements. Let's denote them as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, we'll create a 4x4 table with rows and columns labeled by the elements of G. The entry in the i-th row and j-th column will be the product of the i-th and j-th elements, according to the group operation.\n\nCayley Table:\n\n|   | e | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b | c |\n| a | a |   |   |   |\n| b | b |   |   |   |\n| c | c |   |   |   |\n\nNow, we need to fill in the table according to the group operation. Since we don't know the operation yet, we'll use the properties of groups to fill in the table.\n\n1. The identity element: For any element x in G, x * e = e * x = x.\n\n|   | e | a | b | c |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b | c |\n| a | a |   |   |   |\n| b | b |   |   |   |\n| c | c |   |   |   |\n\n2. Inverse elements: For any element x in G, there exists an element y such that x * y = y * x = e. Since G has order 4, each element must be its own inverse or have an inverse among the remaining elements.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4. In this case, the group operation is exponentiation modulo 4. The elements can be represented as {1, i, -1, -i}, where i^2 = -1. The Cayley table would look like:\n\n|   |  1 |  i | -1 | -i |\n|---|----|----|----|----|\n| 1 |  1 |  i | -1 | -i |\n| i |  i | -1 | -i |  1 |\n|-1 | -1 | -i |  1 |  i |\n|-i | -i |  1 |  i | -1 |\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. In this case, the group operation is addition modulo 2 for each coordinate. The elements can be represented as {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)}. The Cayley table would look like:\n\n|       | (0,0) | (1,0) | (0,1) | (1,1) |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| (0,0) | (0,0) | (1,0) | (0,1) | (1,1) |\n| (1,0) | (1,0) | (0,0) | (1,1) | (0,1) |\n| (0,1) | (0,1) | (1,1) | (0,0) | (1,0) |\n| (1,1) | (1,1) | (0,1) | (1,0) | (0,0) |\n\nNow, we need to determine which case G falls into. If G is isomorphic to C4, then there should be an element of order 4 (in this case, 'a'). This means that a * a ≠ e, a * a * a ≠ e, but a * a * a * a = e.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to V4, then every non-identity element has order 2. This means that a * a = b * b = c * c = e.\n\nWithout more information about the group operation or the elements of G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4. However, we have provided the Cayley tables for both cases."
