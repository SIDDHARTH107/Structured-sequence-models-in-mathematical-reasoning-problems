    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven a radius (r) of 5 cm and a height (h) of 10 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(10 + 5)\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 10π(15)\nSurface Area = 150π\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder is 150π square centimeters. If you want a numerical approximation, you can use the value of π ≈ 3.14159:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 150 * 3.14159 ≈ 471.2385 square centimeters."
