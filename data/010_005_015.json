    "message_2": "Yes, X is a connected space.\n\nTo show that X is connected, we need to show that it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that X can be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets A and B. Let f ∈ A and g ∈ B.\n\nNow, consider the function H(x) = (1 - x)f(x) + xg(x) for x ∈ [0,1]. H(x) is a continuous function from [0,1] to the real numbers since it is a linear combination of two continuous functions f(x) and g(x). Therefore, H(x) ∈ X.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether H(x) belongs to A or B. If H(x) belongs to A, then the function H'(x) = (1 - (x + ε))f(x) + (x + ε)g(x) for x ∈ [0,1] and some small ε > 0 also belongs to A, since A is open. However, as ε approaches 0, H'(x) approaches g(x), which is a contradiction since g(x) ∈ B and A and B are disjoint.\n\nSimilarly, if H(x) belongs to B, then the function H'(x) = (1 - (x - ε))f(x) + (x - ε)g(x) for x ∈ [0,1] and some small ε > 0 also belongs to B, since B is open. However, as ε approaches 0, H'(x) approaches f(x), which is a contradiction since f(x) ∈ A and A and B are disjoint.\n\nSince we have reached a contradiction in both cases, our assumption that X can be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets must be false. Therefore, X is a connected space."
