    "message_2": "a) To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(1,0)$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + x^2$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we can use the Implicit Function Theorem to find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ at the point $(1,0)$. We have:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}}$\n\nAt the point $(1,0)$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1,0) = -3(1)^2 + 2(1) = -1$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1,0) = 2(0) = 0$\n\nSince the denominator is zero, the tangent line is vertical. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at the point $(1,0)$ is $x = 1$.\n\nb) To determine whether the curve has a singular point at the origin $(0,0)$, we need to check if both partial derivatives are zero at that point. At the point $(0,0)$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(0,0) = -3(0)^2 + 2(0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(0,0) = 2(0) = 0$\n\nSince both partial derivatives are zero at the origin, the curve has a singular point at $(0,0)$."
