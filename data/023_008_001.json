    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for the given function, we need to compute the Fourier series representation of the function. The Fourier series representation of a function f(t) over the interval (-T/2, T/2) is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(2πnt/T) + b_n * sin(2πnt/T)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and T is the period of the function. Since the given function is non-periodic, we can consider it as a periodic function with a large period T. In this case, we can use the Fourier transform to find the coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) dt] from -T/2 to T/2\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * cos(2πnt/T) dt] from -T/2 to T/2\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(2πnt/T) dt] from -T/2 to T/2\n\nSince the given function is defined over the interval (-5, 5), we can consider the period T = 10. Now, let's compute the Fourier coefficients.\n\na_0 = (1/10) * ∫[t^3 - 3t^2 + 5t - 2 dt] from -5 to 5\na_n = (1/5) * ∫[(t^3 - 3t^2 + 5t - 2) * cos(2πnt/10) dt] from -5 to 5\nb_n = (1/5) * ∫[(t^3 - 3t^2 + 5t - 2) * sin(2πnt/10) dt] from -5 to 5\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/10) * [t^4/4 - t^3 + (5/2)t^2 - 2t] from -5 to 5\na_0 = (1/10) * [(625/4 - 125 + 25/2 - 10) - (625/4 + 125 + 25/2 + 10)]\na_0 = 0\n\nFor a_n and b_n, we can use integration by parts to compute the integrals. However, since the given function is non-periodic, the Fourier coefficients will not have a simple closed-form expression. Instead, we can compute the coefficients numerically for specific values of n using numerical integration techniques such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule."
