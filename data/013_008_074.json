    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 10 people were given $100 each to contribute towards building a park for the community. The park will cost $500 in total to build. Each person must decide how much of their $100 to contribute towards the park. If they all contribute equally, they will be free to use the park once it is built. However, if some people choose not to contribute, those who do contribute will have to cover the cost of the park themselves. What is the Nash Equilibrium of this Public Goods Game? In other words, how much money should each person contribute to the park to ensure they have to pay as little as possible, regardless of what others do?",
    "message_2": "In the Public Goods Game, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when each individual contributes nothing towards the public good (in this case, the park). This is because each person has an incentive to free-ride on the contributions of others, hoping that others will contribute enough to cover the cost of the park while they keep their entire $100.\n\nTo see why this is the Nash Equilibrium, consider the following:\n\n1. If everyone else contributes nothing, then contributing any amount would only increase your own cost without providing any additional benefit (since the park will not be built unless the total contributions reach $500).\n\n2. If everyone else contributes some amount, then you can still free-ride on their contributions and keep your entire $100, as the park will be built regardless of your contribution.\n\nIn either case, contributing nothing is the best strategy for each individual, regardless of what others do. Therefore, the Nash Equilibrium in this Public Goods Game is for each person to contribute $0. However, this outcome is not socially optimal, as the park will not be built even though the total benefit of having the park would likely exceed the total cost of $500. This is known as the \"free-rider problem\" in public goods provision."
