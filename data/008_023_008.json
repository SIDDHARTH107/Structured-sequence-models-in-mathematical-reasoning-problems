    "message_1": "The following system of linear equations represents three variables x, y, and z:\n \n2x + y - z = 3.5 \n \n3x - y + z = -1.5 \n \nx - y + 2z = -0.5\n\nHowever, due to measurement errors, the coefficients of the variables have been corrupted with noise. The noisy system of linear equations is:\n\n2.1x + 0.9y - 1.1z = 3.7\n \n2.8x - 1.2y + 1.3z = -1.3\n \n0.9x - 1.3y + 2.2z = -0.6\n\nSolve the system of linear equations with the given noisy data to find the values of x, y, and z correct to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the noisy system of linear equations, we can use the matrix method. First, we'll represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2.1  0.9 -1.1 | 3.7 |\n| 2.8 -1.2  1.3 |-1.3 |\n| 0.9 -1.3  2.2 |-0.6 |\n\nNext, we'll use Gaussian elimination to convert the matrix to its reduced row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n| 0.9 -1.3  2.2 |-0.6 |\n| 2.8 -1.2  1.3 |-1.3 |\n| 2.1  0.9 -1.1 | 3.7 |\n\n2. Divide Row 1 by 0.9:\n| 1 -1.444  2.444 |-0.667 |\n| 2.8 -1.2  1.3   |-1.3   |\n| 2.1  0.9  -1.1  | 3.7   |\n\n3. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2.8 * Row 1 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 2.1 * Row 1:\n| 1 -1.444  2.444 |-0.667       |\n| 0  2.041 -3.389 | 0.467       |\n| 0  3.833 -4.233 | 5.1         |\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by 2.041:\n| 1 -1.444  2.444 |-0.667       |\n| 0  1     -1.659 | 0.229       |\n| 0  3.833 -4.233 | 5.1         |\n\n5. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 + 1.444 * Row 2 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 3.833 * Row 2:\n| 1  0      0.333 | 0.667       |\n| 0  1     -1.659 | 0.229       |\n| 0  0      2.167 | 4.225       |\n\n6. Divide Row 3 by 2.167:\n| 1  0      0.333 | 0.667       |\n| 0  1     -1.659 | 0.229       |\n| 0  0      1     | 1.95        |\n\n7. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 - 0.333 * Row 3 and Row 2 with Row 2 + 1.659 * Row 3:\n| 1  0      0     | 0.333       |\n| 0  1      0     |-2.5         |\n| 0  0      1     | 1.95        |\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 0.33\ny = -2.50\nz = 1.95\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z are approximately 0.33, -2.50, and 1.95, respectively, correct to two decimal places."
