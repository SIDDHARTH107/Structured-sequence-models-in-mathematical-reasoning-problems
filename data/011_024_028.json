    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to transport goods from its warehouse in city A to its retail stores in cities B, C and D. The warehouse has 800 units of goods available and each store requires a certain number of units. The capacity of the transportation routes is limited and it costs a certain amount to transport goods between each city. The requirements are as follows:\n\n- City B requires 400 units.\n- City C requires 300 units.\n- City D requires 250 units.\n\nThe transportation capacities between cities are as follows:\n\n- City A to city B can transport up to 500 units and costs $5 per unit.\n- City A to city C can transport up to 400 units and costs $8 per unit.\n- City A to city D can transport up to 350 units and costs $10 per unit.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost for the company to transport the required units to each city? How many units are transported on each route to achieve this minimum cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the transportation cost, the company should prioritize sending goods through the cheapest routes first. In this case, the route from city A to city B is the cheapest at $5 per unit. \n\nSince city B requires 400 units and the capacity of the route from city A to city B is 500 units, the company can transport all 400 units required by city B through this route. This will cost 400 units * $5/unit = $2000.\n\nNext, the company should prioritize the route from city A to city C, which costs $8 per unit. City C requires 300 units, and the capacity of the route from city A to city C is 400 units. The company can transport all 300 units required by city C through this route. This will cost 300 units * $8/unit = $2400.\n\nFinally, the company should use the route from city A to city D, which costs $10 per unit. City D requires 250 units, and the capacity of the route from city A to city D is 350 units. The company can transport all 250 units required by city D through this route. This will cost 250 units * $10/unit = $2500.\n\nThe total minimum cost for the company to transport the required units to each city is $2000 (A to B) + $2400 (A to C) + $2500 (A to D) = $6900.\n\nTo achieve this minimum cost, the company should transport:\n- 400 units from city A to city B\n- 300 units from city A to city C\n- 250 units from city A to city D"
