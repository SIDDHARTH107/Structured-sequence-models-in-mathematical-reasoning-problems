    "message_1": "A spring has a mass of 0.25 kilograms hanging from it. The spring has a spring constant of 9 N/m. What is the frequency of the oscillations when the mass is displaced by 0.15 meters from its equilibrium position and released?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the oscillations, we can use the formula for the angular frequency (ω) of a mass-spring system:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (9 N/m) and m is the mass (0.25 kg).\n\nω = √(9/0.25)\nω ≈ 6 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the frequency (f) using the relationship between angular frequency and frequency:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nf ≈ 6 / (2π)\nf ≈ 0.955 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the oscillations when the mass is displaced by 0.15 meters from its equilibrium position and released is approximately 0.955 Hz."
