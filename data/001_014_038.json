    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{27}$, we need to find the prime factors of 27 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n27 can be factored as 3 × 3 × 3, which is also written as $3^3$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as $\\sqrt{3^3}$. Since we are looking for pairs of the same factor, we can take one 3 out of the square root for every pair of 3's. In this case, we have three 3's, so we can take one 3 out and leave one 3 inside the square root.\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is $3\\sqrt{3}$."
