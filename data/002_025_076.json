    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, one of the base angles measures 45 degrees and the length of each of the congruent sides is 8 cm. What is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "Since the triangle is isosceles and one of the base angles is 45 degrees, the other base angle is also 45 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, so the vertex angle (the angle between the congruent sides) is 180 - 45 - 45 = 90 degrees. This means the triangle is a 45-45-90 right triangle.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 right triangle, the congruent sides (legs) are equal in length, and the hypotenuse (the third side) is √2 times the length of one of the legs. So, the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) is 8 * √2 ≈ 11.31 cm."
