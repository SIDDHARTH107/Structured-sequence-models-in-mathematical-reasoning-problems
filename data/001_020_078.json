    "message_2": "To find the range of values for which the absolute value equation |2x + 1| = 5 is true, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 1 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n2x + 1 = 5\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 2x + 1 is negative\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n-(2x + 1) = 5\n-2x - 1 = 5\n-2x = 6\nx = -3\n\nSo, the range of values for which the absolute value equation |2x + 1| = 5 is true is x = -3 and x = 2."
