    "message_2": "Since John and Mary have to be on the committee together, we can consider them as a single unit. Now, we need to select 3 more people from the remaining 8 people (10 people - John and Mary). \n\nUsing Pascal's triangle, we can find the number of ways to choose 3 people from 8. The row of Pascal's triangle corresponding to 8 is:\n\n1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1\n\nThe number in the 4th position (counting from 1) is 56, which represents the number of ways to choose 3 people from 8 (8 choose 3). Therefore, there are 56 ways to form a committee of 5 people with John and Mary together."
