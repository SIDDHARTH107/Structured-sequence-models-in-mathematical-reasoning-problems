    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Cryptography and Cryptanalysis of transposition ciphers:\n\nConsider the transposition cipher technique where the plain text MESSAGE is encrypted by writing the letters in a row and then rearranging them in a specific pattern. If the text is then divided into two columns, what would be the ciphertext if the pattern used is 2-1-4-3 for the first four letters of the message?\n\nHint: The first two letters (ME) would be written in the first row and the next two letters (SS) in the second row, following which the letters would be rearranged in the pattern 2-1-4-3 to obtain the ciphertext.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow the given hint and write the first four letters of the message in two rows:\n\nME\nSS\n\nNow, we will rearrange the letters according to the pattern 2-1-4-3:\n\nE M\nS S\n\nThe ciphertext for the first four letters of the message is obtained by reading the letters column-wise:\n\nEM\nSS\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the first four letters of the message is \"EMSS\"."
