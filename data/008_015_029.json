    "message_2": "First, we need to correct the third equation, as it seems to have a typo. I assume it should be:\n\nx + 2y + 8z = 8\n\nNow, we can rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 4  2  1 |\n    | 2  5  2 |\n    | 1  2  8 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 13 |\n    |  8 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition states that a symmetric positive-definite matrix A can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = L * L^T.\n\nWe will find matrix L:\n\nL = | l11  0    0  |\n    | l21  l22  0  |\n    | l31  l32  l33|\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition formulas, we get:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(4) = 2\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 2 = 1\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 1 / 2 = 0.5\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(5 - 1) = 2\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (2 - 0.5 * 1) / 2 = 0.75\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(8 - 0.5^2 - 0.75^2) = 2.5\n\nSo, the L matrix is:\n\nL = | 2    0    0  |\n    | 1    2    0  |\n    | 0.5  0.75 2.5|\n\nNow, we will solve the system L * Y = B for Y:\n\n| 2    0    0  | | y1 |   | 10 |\n| 1    2    0  | | y2 | = | 13 |\n| 0.5  0.75 2.5| | y3 |   |  8 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 10 / 2 = 5\ny2 = (13 - 1 * 5) / 2 = 4\ny3 = (8 - 0.5 * 5 - 0.75 * 4) / 2.5 = -1\n\nY = |  5 |\n    |  4 |\n    | -1 |\n\nFinally, we will solve the system L^T * X = Y for X:\n\n| 2  1  0.5 | | x |   |  5 |\n| 0  2  0.75| | y | = |  4 |\n| 0  0  2.5 | | z |   | -1 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nz = -1 / 2.5 = -0.4\ny = (4 - 0.75 * (-0.4)) / 2 = 2.15\nx = (5 - 1 * 2.15 - 0.5 * (-0.4)) / 2 = 1.3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1.3\ny = 2.15\nz = -0.4"
