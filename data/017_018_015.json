    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that 32 = 2^5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 32 must divide the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup, which is 1 in this case. Therefore, there must be exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which implies that the group is a 2-group.\n\nFor a group of order 2^5, there are 5 possible abelian groups:\n\n1. Z_32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. Z_16 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_4\n4. Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_2\n5. Z_4 × Z_4 × Z_2\n\nHowever, there are also non-abelian groups of order 32. To find these, we can use the concept of group extensions. The number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32 can be found using the following formula:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = Number of abelian groups + Number of non-abelian groups\n\nWe already found the 5 abelian groups. To find the number of non-abelian groups, we can use the fact that there are 51 groups of order 32 up to isomorphism. This can be found using the software GAP (Groups, Algorithms, Programming) or by consulting the Small Groups Library.\n\nSo, the number of non-abelian groups is:\n\n51 (total groups) - 5 (abelian groups) = 46\n\nTherefore, there are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32 in total."
