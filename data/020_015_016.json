    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The area of the rectangle is given by:\n\nArea = L * W = 48\n\nWe want to minimize the perimeter, which is given by:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nUsing the area equation, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = 48 / L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in the perimeter equation:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2(48 / L)\n\nTo minimize the perimeter, we can take the derivative of the perimeter with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Perimeter)/dL = 2 - (96 / L^2) = 0\n\nNow, solve for L:\n\n96 / L^2 = 2\n\nL^2 = 96 / 2\n\nL^2 = 48\n\nL = sqrt(48)\n\nL = 4 * sqrt(3)\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 48 / (4 * sqrt(3))\n\nW = 4 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3)\n\nW = 4\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that minimize the perimeter are L = 4 * sqrt(3) cm and W = 4 cm."
