Let Theta(z|τ) be the theta function defined by the lattice generated by 1 and τ, where Im(τ) > 0. \n\nWhat is the value of the following sum: \n\nΣ(n=-∞ to +∞) [ (2n+1) * exp(pi*i*E(nτ + z)) ] \n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit and z is an arbitrary complex number?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Weierstrass ℘-function and its relation to the elliptic curve E and the theta function Θ(z|τ).\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of the Weierstrass ℘-function:\n\n℘(z|τ) = 1/z^2 + Σ((1/(z+m+nτ)^2) - (1/(m+nτ)^2)), where the sum is taken over all pairs of integers (m, n) excluding (0, 0).\n\nThe Weierstrass ℘-function is related to the elliptic curve E by the following equation:\n\n℘(z|τ)^2 = 4(℘(z|τ)^3 - g_2(τ)℘(z|τ) - g_3(τ)),\n\nwhere g_2(τ) and g_3(τ) are the Eisenstein series of weight 4 and 6, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the given elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 - 4x. Comparing this equation with the equation relating ℘(z|τ) to the elliptic curve, we can see that g_2(τ) = 4 and g_3(τ) = 0.\n\nNext, let's recall the relation between the theta function Θ(z|τ) and the Weierstrass ℘-function:\n\n℘(z|τ) = (d/dz)^2(log(Θ(z|τ))).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given sum using the Weierstrass ℘-function:\n\nΣ(n=-∞ to +∞) [ (2n+1) * exp(pi*i*E(nτ + z)) ] = Σ(n=-∞ to +∞) [ (2n+1) * exp(pi*i*(℘(nτ + z|τ)^2 - 4℘(nτ + z|τ))) ].\n\nTo evaluate this sum, we can differentiate the theta function with respect to z and use the relation between the ℘-function and the theta function:\n\n(d/dz)(Θ(z|τ)) = Σ(n=-∞ to +∞) [ (2n+1) * exp(pi*i*(℘(nτ + z|τ)^2 - 4℘(nτ + z|τ))) ].\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides of this equation with respect to z:\n\nΘ(z|τ) = ∫(Σ(n=-∞ to +∞) [ (2n+1) * exp(pi*i*(℘(nτ + z|τ)^2 - 4℘(nτ + z|τ))) ]) dz + C,\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nSince the theta function is periodic with period τ, the integral of the sum must be zero. Therefore, the value of the given sum is zero:\n\nΣ(n=-∞ to +∞) [ (2n+1) * exp(pi*i*E(nτ + z)) ] = 0."
