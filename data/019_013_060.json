Define a second-order formula G as:\n\nG(x) = \"for every y, if F(y) holds and y > x, then there exists z such that x < z < y and F(z) does not hold.\"\n\nProve that if G(0) holds, then F(n) does not hold for any natural number n.",
    "message_2": "Proof by contradiction:\n\nAssume that G(0) holds and there exists a natural number n such that F(n) holds. Let n be the smallest natural number for which F(n) holds.\n\nSince G(0) holds, we have that for every y, if F(y) holds and y > 0, then there exists z such that 0 < z < y and F(z) does not hold. \n\nNow, we know that F(n) holds and n > 0. Therefore, according to G(0), there must exist a natural number z such that 0 < z < n and F(z) does not hold. However, this contradicts our assumption that n is the smallest natural number for which F(n) holds, because z is smaller than n and F(z) does not hold.\n\nThus, our assumption that there exists a natural number n such that F(n) holds must be false. Therefore, if G(0) holds, then F(n) does not hold for any natural number n."
