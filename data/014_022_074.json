    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Playfair cipher, we first need to create the 5x5 matrix using the key \"MATHS\". We will remove any duplicate letters from the key and fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (omitting the letter 'Q', which is usually excluded in Playfair ciphers).\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P R U V\nW X Y Z\n\nNow, we will decrypt the message \"OHiDDOtOio\" using the Playfair rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same (or only one letter is left), add an \"X\" after the first letter. Encrypt the new pair and continue. (Not applicable in decryption)\n2. If the letters appear on the same row of the matrix, replace them each with the letter to their immediate left (wrapping around to the right end of the row if necessary).\n3. If the letters appear on the same column of the matrix, replace them each with the letter immediately above (wrapping around to the bottom of the column if necessary).\n4. If the letters are not on the same row or column, replace them with the letters on the same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair.\n\nDecrypting \"OHiDDOtOio\":\n\nOH -> ME\niD -> ET\nDO -> US\ntO -> SA\nio -> GE\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is \"MEETUSAGE\"."
