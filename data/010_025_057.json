    "message_1": "Let G be the circle group S^1, i.e., the group of complex numbers of absolute value 1, under multiplication. Let X be the set of all continuous maps from the circle to the circle. Define an action of G on X by (g · f)(x) = f(g-1x) for f ∈ X, x∈ S^1, and g ∈ S^1.\n\nUsing the above definitions, prove that the set X/G (equivalence classes under the G action) is homeomorphic to the set of integers ℤ.",
    "message_2": "To prove that X/G is homeomorphic to ℤ, we need to find a continuous bijection between the two sets with a continuous inverse.\n\nFirst, let's define a function Φ: X → ℤ as follows: For any continuous map f ∈ X, let Φ(f) be the winding number of f around the origin. The winding number is an integer that represents the number of times f wraps around the origin in the counterclockwise direction. It is well-defined for continuous maps from S^1 to S^1.\n\nNow, let's show that Φ is well-defined on the equivalence classes of X/G. Suppose f, g ∈ X are equivalent under the G action, i.e., there exists h ∈ G such that g(x) = f(h^-1x) for all x ∈ S^1. Then, the winding numbers of f and g are equal, because the winding number is invariant under rotation. Thus, Φ(f) = Φ(g), and Φ is well-defined on X/G.\n\nNext, we show that Φ is a bijection between X/G and ℤ. To show that Φ is surjective, let n ∈ ℤ. Define a continuous map f_n: S^1 → S^1 by f_n(x) = x^n. Then, the winding number of f_n is n, so Φ(f_n) = n. Thus, Φ is surjective.\n\nTo show that Φ is injective, suppose f, g ∈ X have the same winding number, i.e., Φ(f) = Φ(g). Then, the difference in winding numbers between f and g is zero, which means that f and g are homotopic. Let H: S^1 × [0, 1] → S^1 be a homotopy between f and g, i.e., H(x, 0) = f(x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x ∈ S^1. Define h ∈ G by h(x) = H(x, 1)/H(x, 0). Then, h is continuous, and g(x) = f(h^-1x) for all x ∈ S^1. Thus, f and g are equivalent under the G action, and Φ is injective.\n\nSince Φ is a bijection between X/G and ℤ, it remains to show that Φ and its inverse are continuous. The continuity of Φ follows from the fact that the winding number is a topological invariant, i.e., if two continuous maps are close in the topology of X, their winding numbers must be close in the discrete topology of ℤ. The continuity of the inverse of Φ follows from the fact that, given a winding number n, we can construct a continuous map f_n with winding number n, as shown above.\n\nTherefore, X/G is homeomorphic to ℤ, as desired."
