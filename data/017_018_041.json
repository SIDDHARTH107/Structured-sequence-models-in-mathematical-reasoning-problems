    "message_2": "To find all possible non-abelian groups of order 32, we will use the Sylow theorems and the fact that the order of a group is 32, which is 2^5. We will also use the fact that a p-group (a group of order p^n for some prime p and integer n) has a non-trivial center.\n\n1. Let G be a group of order 32. By Sylow's theorem, there exists a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P of G. Since P is of order 2^5, it is a p-group and has a non-trivial center. Let Z(P) be the center of P.\n\n2. If Z(P) has order 2^4, then P is abelian, and G is a direct product of P and another group of order 2. In this case, G is abelian, which we are not considering.\n\n3. If Z(P) has order 2^3, then P/Z(P) is a group of order 2^2, which is abelian. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and another group of order 2. There are two non-abelian groups of order 32 in this case: the dihedral group D_16 and the quaternion group Q_32.\n\n4. If Z(P) has order 2^2, then P/Z(P) is a group of order 2^3, which is abelian. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and another group of order 2. There are three non-abelian groups of order 32 in this case: the semidirect products of Z_8 and Z_4, Z_8 and Z_2 x Z_2, and Z_4 x Z_2 and Z_2.\n\n5. If Z(P) has order 2, then P/Z(P) is a group of order 2^4, which is abelian. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and another group of order 2. There is one non-abelian group of order 32 in this case: the semidirect product of Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 and Z_2.\n\nIn total, there are six non-abelian groups of order 32:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_16\n2. Quaternion group Q_32\n3. Semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_4\n4. Semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_2 x Z_2\n5. Semidirect product of Z_4 x Z_2 and Z_2\n6. Semidirect product of Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 and Z_2\n\nThese groups are isomorphic to the six non-abelian groups of order 32 mentioned in the subtopic."
