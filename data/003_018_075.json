    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 5 sin(3x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is 5 sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(5 sin(u))/du = 5 cos(u)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = (d(5 sin(u))/du) * (d(3x)/dx) = 5 cos(u) * 3\n\nSince u = 3x, we can substitute it back into the equation:\ndy/dx = 15 cos(3x)\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at x = π/6:\ndy/dx = 15 cos(3 * π/6) = 15 cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the derivative at x = π/6 is:\ndy/dx = 15 * 0 = 0"
