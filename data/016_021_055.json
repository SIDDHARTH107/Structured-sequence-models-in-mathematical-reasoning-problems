    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve increases its length by a factor of 3/2 with each iteration. To find the total length of the curve after the sixth iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (3/2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 4 and the number of iterations is 6:\n\nLength = 4 * (3/2)^6\nLength = 4 * (729/64)\nLength = 2916/64\nLength = 45.75\n\nSo, the total length of the curve after the sixth iteration is 45.75 units."
