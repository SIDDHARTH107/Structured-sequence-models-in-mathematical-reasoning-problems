    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, the elimination method is more straightforward.\n\nFirst, notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n\nNow, we have two identical equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n3x + 2y = 7\n\nSince both equations are the same, we can eliminate one of them:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y:\n\n2y = 7 - 3x\ny = (7 - 3x)/2\n\nSince the second equation was just a multiple of the first equation, we have infinitely many solutions that lie along the line represented by the equation 3x + 2y = 7. The solution to this system of linear equations is a dependent system with infinitely many solutions, and can be expressed as:\n\ny = (7 - 3x)/2"
