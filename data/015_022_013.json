    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a time-delay differential equation given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\frac{a \\cdot x(t-\\tau)}{1 + x(t-\\tau)^n} - \\beta x(t)$$\n\nwhere $x(t)$ is the variable of interest, $a$ and $\\beta$ are positive parameters, $\\tau$ is the time delay, and $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo find the period of the limit cycle for the given parameters, we need to perform a numerical simulation of the Mackey-Glass equation. However, as an AI language model, I am not able to perform numerical simulations directly.\n\nI recommend using a numerical solver for delay differential equations, such as the dde23 solver in MATLAB or the DDE-BIFTOOL package, to simulate the Mackey-Glass equation with the given parameters $a=0.2$ and $\\beta=0.1$. Once you have the simulation results, you can analyze the time series data to determine the period of the limit cycle."
