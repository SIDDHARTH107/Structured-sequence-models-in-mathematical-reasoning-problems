    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from the initial square. In each stage, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining 8 smaller squares.\n\nLet's denote the total number of squares at each stage as S_n, where n is the stage number. At the initial stage (n=0), there is only one square, so S_0 = 1.\n\nFor each subsequent stage, the number of squares increases by a factor of 8. So, the total number of squares at stage n can be calculated as:\n\nS_n = S_(n-1) * 8\n\nNow, we can find the total number of squares after 5 stages of iteration:\n\nS_1 = S_0 * 8 = 1 * 8 = 8\nS_2 = S_1 * 8 = 8 * 8 = 64\nS_3 = S_2 * 8 = 64 * 8 = 512\nS_4 = S_3 * 8 = 512 * 8 = 4096\nS_5 = S_4 * 8 = 4096 * 8 = 32768\n\nSo, after 5 stages of iteration, there are a total of 32,768 squares in the Sierpinski carpet."
