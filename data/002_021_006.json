    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 14 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × (14^2)\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 196\n\nArea of sector = 32.67 × π\n\nArea of sector ≈ 102.67 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the sector with a central angle of 60 degrees is approximately 102.67 cm^2."
