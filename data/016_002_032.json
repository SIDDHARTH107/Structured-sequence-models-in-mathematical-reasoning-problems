    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is formed by iterating the Koch curve construction process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nTo find the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length × (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and there are 4 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 × (4/3)^4\nLength = 1 × (256/81)\nLength ≈ 3.1605 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations is approximately 3.1605 units."
