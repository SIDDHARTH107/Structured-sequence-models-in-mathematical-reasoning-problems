    "message_1": "Joe and Tom are the only two firms producing a certain product. Joe, as the leader, must determine his output level before Tom decides his. The total cost function for Joe and Tom are TC1(Q1) = 100 + 10Q1 and TC2(Q2) = 120 + 6Q2 respectively. The market demand is P = 80 − Q1 − Q2. What is the profit of each firm at the Stackelberg equilibrium output?",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium output, we first need to find the reaction function for Tom (firm 2). To do this, we will find Tom's profit function and then find the best response function by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q2 and setting it equal to zero.\n\nTom's profit function is given by:\n\nπ2(Q1, Q2) = P * Q2 - TC2(Q2)\nπ2(Q1, Q2) = (80 - Q1 - Q2) * Q2 - (120 + 6Q2)\n\nNow, we will take the derivative of π2 with respect to Q2:\n\ndπ2/dQ2 = 80 - Q1 - 2Q2 - 6\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the best response function:\n\n0 = 80 - Q1 - 2Q2 - 6\nQ2 = (74 - Q1) / 2\n\nNow that we have Tom's reaction function, we can find Joe's (firm 1) profit function:\n\nπ1(Q1, Q2) = P * Q1 - TC1(Q1)\nπ1(Q1, Q2) = (80 - Q1 - Q2) * Q1 - (100 + 10Q1)\n\nSubstitute Tom's reaction function into Joe's profit function:\n\nπ1(Q1, (74 - Q1) / 2) = (80 - Q1 - (74 - Q1) / 2) * Q1 - (100 + 10Q1)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nπ1(Q1) = (86 - (3/2)Q1) * Q1 - (100 + 10Q1)\n\nNow, we will take the derivative of π1 with respect to Q1:\n\ndπ1/dQ1 = 86 - 3Q1 - 10\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the optimal output for Joe:\n\n0 = 76 - 3Q1\nQ1 = 76 / 3 ≈ 25.33\n\nNow, we can find the optimal output for Tom using his reaction function:\n\nQ2 = (74 - Q1) / 2\nQ2 = (74 - 76/3) / 2 ≈ 12.67\n\nNow that we have the Stackelberg equilibrium outputs for both firms, we can find their respective profits.\n\nJoe's profit at the Stackelberg equilibrium:\n\nπ1(Q1) = (86 - (3/2)(76/3)) * (76/3) - (100 + 10(76/3))\nπ1(Q1) ≈ 1045.33\n\nTom's profit at the Stackelberg equilibrium:\n\nπ2(Q1, Q2) = (80 - (76/3) - (38/3)) * (38/3) - (120 + 6(38/3))\nπ2(Q1, Q2) ≈ 504.67\n\nSo, at the Stackelberg equilibrium output, Joe's profit is approximately $1045.33, and Tom's profit is approximately $504.67."
