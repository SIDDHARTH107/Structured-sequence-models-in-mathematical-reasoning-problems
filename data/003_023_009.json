    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using the formula |A||B|sinθ, we first need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. However, the formula you provided is used to find the magnitude of the cross product, not the cross product itself. The cross product of two vectors A and B can be found using the determinant method:\n\nA x B = (A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y)i - (A_x * B_z - A_z * B_x)j + (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)k\n\nGiven the vectors A = 3i + 2j + k and B = 2i - j + 2k, we can find the cross product as follows:\n\nA x B = ((2 * 2) - (1 * (-1)))i - ((3 * 2) - (1 * 2))j + ((3 * (-1)) - (2 * 2))k\nA x B = (4 + 1)i - (6 - 2)j + (-3 - 4)k\nA x B = 5i - 4j - 7k\n\nSo, the cross product of the two vectors A and B is 5i - 4j - 7k."
