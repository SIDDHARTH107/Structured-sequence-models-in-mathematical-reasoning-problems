    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, the elimination method seems more straightforward. \n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow, we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nSince the equations are the same, we can see that there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy both equations. The system of equations is dependent, and the solution is the entire line described by the equation 2x + 3y = 7."
