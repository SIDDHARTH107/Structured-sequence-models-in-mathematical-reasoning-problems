    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nPrime factorize each number:\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n8 = 2^3\n9 = 3^2\n\nNow, find the highest power of each prime factor in the list:\n2^3, 3^2, and 5\n\nMultiply these together to get the LCM:\n2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 8 * 9 * 5 = 72 * 5 = 360\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is 360."
