    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sine function is the horizontal shift of the function along the x-axis. The general form of a sine function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function y = 2sin(3x - π/4), we can see that A = 2, B = 3, and the phase shift is represented by C.\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to solve the equation inside the sine function for x:\n\n3x - π/4 = 0\n\nNow, isolate x:\n\n3x = π/4\n\nx = (π/4) / 3\nx = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/12."
