    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of graph G, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is the set of all vertices in the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nA possible tree decomposition for graph G is:\n\n```\n       {2,4,5}\n       /     \\\n  {1,2,4}   {2,3,5}\n   /         /   \\\n{1,4}     {3,5}  {5,8,9}\n /           \\\n{4,6}       {5,8}\n \\           /\n  {4,7}   {8,9}\n   \\       /\n    {7,8}\n```\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one. In this case, the largest bag has 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of graph G is 2."
