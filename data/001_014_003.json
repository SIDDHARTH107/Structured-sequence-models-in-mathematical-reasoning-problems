    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{27}$, we need to find the prime factorization of 27 and look for pairs of the same factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 27 is $3^3$ (since $27 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3$).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the radical expression as $\\sqrt{3^3}$. Since there is a pair of 3's, we can take one 3 out of the square root.\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is $3\\sqrt{3}$."
