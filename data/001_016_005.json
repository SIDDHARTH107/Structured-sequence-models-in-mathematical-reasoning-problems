    "message_2": "To simplify the given expression, we can use the properties of exponents. \n\n(5^3 * 5^4) / 5^2\n\nAccording to the product of powers property, when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we can add the exponents:\n\n5^(3+4) / 5^2\n\nNow, we have:\n\n5^7 / 5^2\n\nAccording to the quotient of powers property, when dividing two exponential expressions with the same base, we can subtract the exponents:\n\n5^(7-2)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n5^5\n\nSo, the simplified form of the given expression is 5^5."
