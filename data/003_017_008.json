    "message_1": "A mountain has a peak that is 10,000 feet high. The angle of elevation from a point on the ground to the top of the mountain is measured every hour of the day for one week. The measurements in degrees are as follows: 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, and 85. \n\nWhat is the average angle of elevation to the top of the mountain over the course of the week (in degrees)?",
    "message_2": "To find the average angle of elevation, we need to add up all the angle measurements and then divide by the number of measurements.\n\nSum of angles = 25 + 35 + 45 + 55 + 65 + 75 + 85 = 385 degrees\n\nNumber of measurements = 7\n\nAverage angle of elevation = (Sum of angles) / (Number of measurements) = 385 / 7 = 55 degrees\n\nThe average angle of elevation to the top of the mountain over the course of the week is 55 degrees."
