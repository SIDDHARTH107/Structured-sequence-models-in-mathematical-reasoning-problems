    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the given information and the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C96. This group is unique and isomorphic to itself.\n\nNext, let's consider the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2. This group is also unique and isomorphic to itself.\n\nNow, we need to consider the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. These groups are not isomorphic to each other or to the cyclic group C96 or the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 is 1 (cyclic group) + 1 (alternating group) + 196 (non-abelian groups) = 198.\n\nIn summary, there are 198 non-isomorphic groups of order 96, which include the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, and 196 non-abelian groups of order 96."
