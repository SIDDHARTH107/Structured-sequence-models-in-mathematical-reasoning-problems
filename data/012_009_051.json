    "message_2": "In a graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of all vertices in the graph, sorted in non-increasing order.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have 10 vertices and 25 edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 25 = 50.\n\nSince we have 10 vertices, we need to find a sequence of 10 non-negative integers that sum up to 50 and are sorted in non-increasing order. However, there isn't a unique degree sequence for a graph with 10 vertices and 25 edges. There can be multiple graphs with different degree sequences that satisfy these conditions.\n\nHere are a few examples of possible degree sequences for a graph with 10 vertices and 25 edges:\n\n1. (9, 9, 8, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1)\n2. (8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\n3. (7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0)\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there can be other degree sequences as well. The key is that the sum of the degrees in the sequence must equal 50, and the sequence must be sorted in non-increasing order."
