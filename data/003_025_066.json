    "message_2": "To find the ground speed and direction of the plane, we need to add the plane's velocity vector and the wind's velocity vector. \n\nLet's represent the plane's velocity vector as P and the wind's velocity vector as W. We can break down each vector into its x and y components:\n\nPx = 450 * cos(50°)\nPy = 450 * sin(50°)\n\nWx = 75 * cos(120°)\nWy = 75 * sin(120°)\n\nNow, we can add the x and y components of the two vectors to find the ground velocity vector G:\n\nGx = Px + Wx\nGy = Py + Wy\n\nGx = 450 * cos(50°) + 75 * cos(120°)\nGy = 450 * sin(50°) + 75 * sin(120°)\n\nGx ≈ 289.83 + (-64.95) ≈ 224.88\nGy ≈ 343.98 + 64.95 ≈ 408.93\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude (ground speed) and direction (bearing) of the ground velocity vector G:\n\nGround speed = √(Gx^2 + Gy^2) ≈ √(224.88^2 + 408.93^2) ≈ 467.47 km/hr\n\nBearing = arctan(Gy/Gx) ≈ arctan(408.93/224.88) ≈ 61.24°\n\nSo, the ground speed of the plane is approximately 467.47 km/hr, and its direction is approximately 61.24°."
