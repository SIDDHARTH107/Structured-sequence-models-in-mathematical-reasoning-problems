    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent of the system, we need to analyze the rate at which nearby trajectories in the phase space diverge or converge. Unfortunately, we cannot directly calculate the Lyapunov exponent from the given image. The image only provides a visual representation of the system's behavior over time, but it does not provide the necessary quantitative information to compute the Lyapunov exponent.\n\nTo calculate the Lyapunov exponent, we would need the specific equations governing the system, initial conditions, and a method to compute the divergence of nearby trajectories. This typically involves numerical simulations and calculations.\n\nIf you can provide the specific equations and initial conditions, we can attempt to calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the system."
