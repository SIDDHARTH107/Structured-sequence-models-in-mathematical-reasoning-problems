    "message_2": "To find the intersection of the curve $C$ with the line $l$, we need to find the points on the curve that satisfy the equation of the line. The line $l$ has the equation $y=z=0$. In the projective plane, we can write this line as $[x:0:0]$. \n\nNow, let's find the points on the curve $C$ that satisfy this condition. The curve $C$ is given by the parametric equations:\n\n$x(t) = t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t$\n$y(t) = t^2 - 2t$\n$z(t) = 1$\n\nWe want to find the values of $t$ for which $y(t) = z(t) = 0$. \n\nFirst, let's solve $y(t) = 0$:\n\n$t^2 - 2t = 0$\n$t(t - 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $t$: $t = 0$ and $t = 2$.\n\nNow, let's check if these values also satisfy $z(t) = 0$. However, we see that $z(t) = 1$ for all values of $t$, so there are no points on the curve $C$ that satisfy both $y(t) = 0$ and $z(t) = 0$. \n\nTherefore, the curve $C$ does not intersect the line $l$."
