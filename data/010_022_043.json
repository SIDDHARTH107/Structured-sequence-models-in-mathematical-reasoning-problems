    "message_2": "The largest inscribed sphere in a cube will touch the cube at the center of each face. In this case, the diameter of the sphere will be equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nSince the edge length of the cube is 4, the diameter of the inscribed sphere is also 4. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius of the largest inscribed sphere in the cube is:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nThe radius of the largest inscribed sphere in the cube is 2."
