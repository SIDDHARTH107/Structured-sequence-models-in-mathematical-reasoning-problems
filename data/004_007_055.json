    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1)^(1/2) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet g(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1 and h(x) = x^(1/2). Then f(x) = h(g(x)).\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x) with respect to x:\n\ng'(x) = d(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1)/dx = 6x^2 + 10x - 3\nh'(x) = d(x^(1/2))/dx = (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x) = (1/2)(g(x))^(-1/2) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute g(x) back into the equation:\n\nf'(x) = (1/2)(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1)^(-1/2) * (6x^2 + 10x - 3)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = (1/2)(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1)^(-1/2) * (6x^2 + 10x - 3)"
