    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, X and Y. The total production time is limited to 16 hours. Product X requires 2 hours of production time and can be sold for $50 per unit, while product Y requires 3 hours of production time and can be sold for $60 per unit. The factory wants to maximize its profit. Using the Firefly Algorithm, what is the optimal number of each product that should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is not typically used for solving linear programming problems like this one. Instead, we can solve this problem using a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 60y, subject to the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 16 (the total production time).\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequality for y:\n\ny ≤ (16 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers (we cannot produce a negative or fractional number of products), we can list the possible combinations of x and y that satisfy the constraint:\n\n(x, y) = (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)\n\nNow, we'll calculate the profit for each combination:\n\nP(0, 0) = 0\nP(0, 1) = 60\nP(0, 2) = 120\nP(0, 3) = 180\nP(0, 4) = 240\nP(0, 5) = 300\nP(1, 0) = 50\nP(1, 1) = 110\nP(1, 2) = 170\nP(1, 3) = 230\nP(1, 4) = 290\nP(2, 0) = 100\nP(2, 1) = 160\nP(2, 2) = 220\nP(2, 3) = 280\nP(3, 0) = 150\nP(3, 1) = 210\nP(3, 2) = 270\nP(4, 0) = 200\nP(4, 1) = 260\nP(5, 0) = 250\nP(6, 0) = 300\nP(7, 0) = 350\nP(8, 0) = 400\n\nThe maximum profit is $400, which occurs when producing 8 units of product X and 0 units of product Y. Therefore, the optimal number of each product to maximize profit is 8 units of product X and 0 units of product Y."
