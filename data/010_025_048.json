    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the partition function behaves under the decomposition of the torus.\n\nA genus-2 torus can be decomposed into two annuli by cutting along two non-contractible cycles. Let's denote the partition function of each annulus as Z(A1) and Z(A2). The partition function of the genus-2 torus can be expressed as a product of the partition functions of the two annuli:\n\nZ(T^2) = Z(A1) * Z(A2)\n\nWe are given that Z(T^2) = 4. Now, we need to find Z(A1) and Z(A2).\n\nIn a topological quantum field theory, the partition function is invariant under continuous deformations of the manifold. Therefore, the partition function of each annulus should be the same, i.e., Z(A1) = Z(A2). Let's denote this common value as Z(A).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4 = Z(A) * Z(A)\n\n4 = Z(A)^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nZ(A) = Â±2\n\nSince the partition function is a physical quantity, it should be positive. Therefore, the partition function for each annulus is:\n\nZ(A1) = Z(A2) = 2"
