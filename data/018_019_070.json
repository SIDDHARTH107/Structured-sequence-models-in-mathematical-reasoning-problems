    "message_2": "First, let's recall the definition of symmetric difference. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. Mathematically, A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nNow, let's calculate the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) Δ C and A Δ (B Δ C).\n\n1. Calculate A Δ B:\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 5}) - ({2, 3}) = {1, 4, 5}\n\n2. Calculate B Δ C:\nB Δ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = ({2, 3, 5} ∪ {3, 4, 6}) - ({3}) = {2, 4, 5, 6}\n\n3. Calculate A Δ (B Δ C):\nA Δ (B Δ C) = (A ∪ (B Δ C)) - (A ∩ (B Δ C)) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {2, 4, 5, 6}) - ({2, 4}) = {1, 3, 5, 6}\n\n4. Calculate (A Δ B) Δ C:\n(A Δ B) Δ C = ((A Δ B) ∪ C) - ((A Δ B) ∩ C) = ({1, 4, 5} ∪ {3, 4, 6}) - ({4}) = {1, 3, 5, 6}\n\nWe can see that (A Δ B) Δ C = A Δ (B Δ C) = {1, 3, 5, 6}. This demonstrates that the symmetric difference is associative, as the order in which we perform the operation does not affect the final result."
