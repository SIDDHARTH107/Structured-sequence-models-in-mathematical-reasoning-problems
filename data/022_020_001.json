    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem, we first find the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + 4u = 0$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$r = \\pm 2i$\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is of the form:\n\n$u(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x)$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) $u(0) = 1$\n\n$1 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)$\n\n$1 = C_1$\n\n2) $u(\\pi/2) = 0$\n\n$0 = C_1 \\cos(\\pi) + C_2 \\sin(\\pi)$\n\n$0 = -C_1 + 0$\n\nSince $C_1 = 1$, we have:\n\n$0 = -1$\n\nThis implies that there is no unique solution for the given boundary value problem. The boundary conditions are inconsistent with the differential equation, and there is no function $u(x)$ that satisfies both the differential equation and the boundary conditions."
