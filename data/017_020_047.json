    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 40, we know that |G| = 40 = 2^3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) in G is denoted by n_5 and must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 â‰¡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 2^3 = 8\n\nThe possible values for n_5 are 1 and 8. However, since G is non-abelian, it cannot have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup (otherwise, it would be a normal subgroup, and G would be a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2 and Sylow 5 subgroups, which would make G abelian). Therefore, n_5 must be equal to 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 subgroups of order 5 in the non-abelian group G of order 40."
