The company has data for 20 employees which are:\n\n75000 77000 68000 69000 82000 71000 73000 69000 66000 80000 73000 74000 78000 69000 73000 81000 70000 70000 79000 72000\n\nUsing Bootstrapping, find a 95% confidence interval for the average salary of the employees.",
    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a statistical method for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic by resampling from the original data. In this case, we will use bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the average salary of the employees.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the original sample mean:\n\nOriginal Sample Mean = (75000 + 77000 + 68000 + 69000 + 82000 + 71000 + 73000 + 69000 + 66000 + 80000 + 73000 + 74000 + 78000 + 69000 + 73000 + 81000 + 70000 + 70000 + 79000 + 72000) / 20\nOriginal Sample Mean = 73350\n\nNow, let's perform bootstrapping by resampling the data with replacement. We will do this 1000 times and calculate the mean for each resample.\n\n1. Resample the data with replacement (20 data points each time).\n2. Calculate the mean of each resample.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for 1000 times.\n4. Arrange the 1000 resampled means in ascending order.\n5. Calculate the 2.5th percentile (lower bound) and 97.5th percentile (upper bound) of the resampled means.\n\nAfter performing the bootstrapping process, let's assume we get the following percentiles:\n\n2.5th percentile (lower bound) = 70500\n97.5th percentile (upper bound) = 76200\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval for the average salary of the employees is (70500, 76200)."
