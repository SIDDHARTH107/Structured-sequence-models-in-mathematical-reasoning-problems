    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + (-4)²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nTo find A · B, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y)\n\nwhere A_x and A_y are the x and y components of vector A, and B_x and B_y are the x and y components of vector B.\n\nA · B = (3 * 5) + (-4 * 2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNow we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = 7 / (5 * √29)\n\nSince we have cos(θ), we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(7 / (5 * √29))\n\nNow we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * (7 / (5 * √29))\n\nThe √29 and 5 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving:\n\nA · B = 7\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors A and B is 7."
