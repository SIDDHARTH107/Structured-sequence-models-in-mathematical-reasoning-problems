Now we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups to find the possible abelian groups of order 40.\n\n1. Z_40 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_20 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_5\n4. Z_4 × Z_10\n5. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5\n\nNow, we need to consider non-abelian groups. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, there is only one possibility: a unique 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5, which is isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, there are two possibilities: either a unique 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8, which is isomorphic to Z_8 or D_4 (dihedral group of order 8), or three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8.\n\nIf there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8, it must be normal. In this case, we have two possibilities:\n\n6. Z_8 × Z_5 (semi-direct product, where Z_8 is normal)\n7. D_4 × Z_5 (semi-direct product, where D_4 is normal)\n\nIf there are three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8, we can use the fact that the outer automorphism group of Z_8 is isomorphic to Z_2, which has only one non-trivial automorphism. Thus, there is only one non-abelian group in this case:\n\n8. A non-abelian group with three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and a unique 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5.\n\nIn total, there are 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 40:\n\n1. Z_40\n2. Z_20 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_5\n4. Z_4 × Z_10\n5. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5\n6. Z_8 × Z_5 (semi-direct product)\n7. D_4 × Z_5 (semi-direct product)\n8. A non-abelian group with three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and a unique 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5."
