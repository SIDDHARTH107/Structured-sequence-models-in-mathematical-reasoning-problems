    "message_2": "To show that the congruence x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) has a solution, we will use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a such that gcd(a, p) = 1, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nGiven that p ≡ 3 (mod 4), we can write p = 4k + 3 for some integer k. Now consider the following expression:\n\na = (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2)\n\nSince p is a prime number and x is an integer, gcd(x^2 + 1, p) = 1. Therefore, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\na^((p-1)/2) ≡ (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, let's consider the expression (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2). We can rewrite this expression as:\n\n(x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) = (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) * (x^2 + 1)\n\nSince (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) ≡ 1 (mod p), we have:\n\n(x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ 1 * (x^2 + 1) ≡ x^2 + 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, let's raise both sides of the congruence x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) to the power of (p+1)/2:\n\n(x^2)^((p+1)/2) ≡ (-1)^((p+1)/2) (mod p)\n\nSince p = 4k + 3, we have (p+1)/2 = 2k + 2. Therefore, the left side of the congruence becomes:\n\nx^(p+1) ≡ (-1)^(2k+2) (mod p)\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, x^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p), so we can rewrite the left side as:\n\nx^(p+1) ≡ x * x^(p-1) ≡ x (mod p)\n\nOn the right side, we have (-1)^(2k+2) = (-1)^2 * (-1)^(2k) = 1 * 1 = 1. So the congruence becomes:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nThis implies that x^2 + 1 ≡ 1^2 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod p). Since we have shown that (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ x^2 + 1 (mod p), we can conclude that:\n\n(x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ 2 (mod p)\n\nNow, let's consider the Legendre symbol (2|p). By the quadratic reciprocity theorem, we have:\n\n(2|p) = (-1)^((p^2 - 1)/8)\n\nSince p = 4k + 3, we have p^2 - 1 = (4k + 3)^2 - 1 = 16k^2 + 24k + 8. Therefore, (p^2 - 1)/8 = 2k^2 + 3k + 1, which is an odd integer. Thus, we have:\n\n(2|p) = (-1)^((p^2 - 1)/8) = -1\n\nThis means that the congruence x^2 ≡ 2 (mod p) has no solution. However, we have shown that (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ 2 (mod p), which implies that x^2 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution. Therefore, the congruence x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) must have a solution as well."
