    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection of the given surfaces, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's consider the function:\n\nF(x, y, z, λ) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9 - λ(x + y + z - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of F and set it equal to the zero vector:\n\n∇F(x, y, z, λ) = (2x - λ, 2y - λ, 2z - λ, x + y + z - 1) = (0, 0, 0, 0)\n\nFrom this, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1) 2x - λ = 0\n2) 2y - λ = 0\n3) 2z - λ = 0\n4) x + y + z = 1\n\nFrom equations (1), (2), and (3), we can see that x = y = z. Substituting this into equation (4), we get:\n\nx + x + x = 1\n3x = 1\nx = 1/3\n\nSince x = y = z, we have:\n\nx = 1/3\ny = 1/3\nz = 1/3\n\nNow, we can find the value of λ using any of the first three equations. Let's use equation (1):\n\n2x - λ = 0\n2(1/3) - λ = 0\n2/3 - λ = 0\nλ = 2/3\n\nNow, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the equation of the plane. The equation of the plane can be written as:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nWhere (x₀, y₀, z₀) is a point on the plane, and (A, B, C) is the normal vector to the plane. We can use the gradient of the constraint function (x + y + z - 1) as the normal vector:\n\n∇(x + y + z - 1) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nSo, the normal vector is (A, B, C) = (1, 1, 1). Using the point (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) as (x₀, y₀, z₀), we can write the equation of the plane as:\n\n1(x - 1/3) + 1(y - 1/3) + 1(z - 1/3) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx - 1/3 + y - 1/3 + z - 1/3 = 0\nx + y + z - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection of the surfaces is:\n\nx + y + z = 1"
