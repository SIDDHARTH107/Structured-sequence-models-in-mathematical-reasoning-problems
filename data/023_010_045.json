    "message_2": "To calculate the 2D Fourier transform of an image, we use the following formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N))))\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier transform of the image, f(x, y) is the brightness value of the pixel at position (x, y), M and N are the dimensions of the image (256 x 256 in this case), and j is the imaginary unit (sqrt(-1)).\n\nHowever, since the image has uniform brightness values ranging from 0 to 255, we can simplify the calculation. Let's assume that the brightness values are uniformly distributed, and the average brightness value is:\n\navg_brightness = (0 + 255) / 2 = 127.5\n\nNow, we can modify the pixel at (0, 0) to have a brightness value of 128, which is 0.5 more than the average brightness. We can represent the image as:\n\nf(x, y) = 127.5 for all (x, y) except (0, 0)\nf(0, 0) = 128\n\nNow, let's calculate the Fourier transform:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N))))\n\nFor all pixels except (0, 0), the brightness value is 127.5, so we can factor it out:\n\nF(u, v) = 127.5 * Σ(Σ(e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N)))) + (0.5 * e^(0))\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of the exponential terms. Since the image is 256 x 256, we have:\n\nΣ(Σ(e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / 256 + v * y / 256)))) = Σ(x=0 to 255) Σ(y=0 to 255) (e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / 256 + v * y / 256)))\n\nThis sum is difficult to compute analytically, but it can be calculated numerically using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The final Fourier transform will be:\n\nF(u, v) = 127.5 * FFT_sum + 0.5\n\nwhere FFT_sum is the sum of the exponential terms calculated using an FFT algorithm."
