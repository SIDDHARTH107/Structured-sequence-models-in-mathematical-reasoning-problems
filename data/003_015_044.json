    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2 sin(3x).\n\nThe amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the coefficient is 2, so the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\nThe period of a sine function is found by dividing the standard period (2π) by the absolute value of the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 3, so the period is (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 2 and the period is (2π) / 3 radians."
