    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by replacing each square in the pattern with a smaller version of the pattern itself. In each iteration, the perimeter of the fractal increases.\n\nFor the first iteration, the perimeter is given as 20 units. In the second iteration, each side of the square is divided into three equal parts, and the middle part is replaced by two sides of a smaller square. This means that each side of the square now has 4 segments instead of 1. So, the perimeter of the second iteration will be 4 times the perimeter of the first iteration.\n\nPerimeter of the second iteration = 4 * 20 = 80 units.\n\nIn the third iteration, the same process is repeated for each of the smaller squares. Each side of the smaller squares will now have 4 segments instead of 1. So, the perimeter of the third iteration will be 4 times the perimeter of the second iteration.\n\nPerimeter of the third iteration = 4 * 80 = 320 units.\n\nFinally, in the fourth iteration, the same process is repeated again for each of the even smaller squares. Each side of these smallest squares will now have 4 segments instead of 1. So, the perimeter of the fourth iteration will be 4 times the perimeter of the third iteration.\n\nPerimeter of the fourth iteration = 4 * 320 = 1280 units.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the fourth iteration of the Vicsek fractal is 1280 units."
