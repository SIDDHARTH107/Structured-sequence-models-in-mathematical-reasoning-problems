If the system has a unique solution or infinitely many solutions, then solve the system.",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the three equations are multiples of each other. If we divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3, we get:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 1\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 1\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 1\n\nSince all three equations are the same, this system does not have a unique solution. Instead, it has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve the first equation for z:\n\n4z = 1 - 2x - 3y\n\nz = (1/4) - (1/2)x - (3/4)y\n\nThe general solution for this system is:\n\n(x, y, (1/4) - (1/2)x - (3/4)y)"
