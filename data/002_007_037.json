    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and bases of lengths 6 cm and 12 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 = 6 cm, base2 = 12 cm, and height = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (6 + 12) * 10\nArea = (1/2) * (18) * 10\nArea = 9 * 10\nArea = 90 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 90 square centimeters."
