    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere inscribed in a cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. In this case, the side length of the cube is 8 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 8 cm.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 4 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSubstituting the given radius into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(4^3)\n\nV = (4/3)π(64)\n\nV = (256/3)π\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters."
