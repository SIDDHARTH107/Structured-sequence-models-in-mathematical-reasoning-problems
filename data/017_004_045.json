    "message_2": "(a) Since the order of G is 49, which is a prime power (7^2), we can use the Sylow theorems to analyze its structure. Let n_7 denote the number of Sylow 7-subgroups of G. By Sylow's third theorem, n_7 must divide the order of G, and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibilities for n_7 are 1 and 49. \n\nIf n_7 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let H be this normal Sylow 7-subgroup. Since the order of H is 7, which is prime, H is cyclic, say H = ⟨a⟩. Now, |G/H| = |G|/|H| = 49/7 = 7, so G/H is a cyclic group of order 7. Let bH be a generator of G/H, where b ∈ G. Then G = ⟨a⟩ ⋊ ⟨b⟩, where ⟨a⟩ is normal in G. Since the orders of a and b are coprime, by the coprime order property, G is a cyclic group of order 49.\n\nIf n_7 = 49, then G has 49 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7. Since there are 49-1 = 48 non-identity elements in G, and each Sylow 7-subgroup has 7-1 = 6 non-identity elements, there must be a pair of distinct Sylow 7-subgroups, say H and K, whose intersection is the identity element. Since both H and K are of order 7, they are cyclic, say H = ⟨a⟩ and K = ⟨b⟩. The product HK has order |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 7 * 7 / 1 = 49, so HK = G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7, i.e., G ≅ ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩.\n\nIn summary, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\n(b) Examples of each type of group:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 49: The group Z_49 (integers modulo 49 under addition) is a cyclic group of order 49. It can be generated by the element 1, i.e., Z_49 = ⟨1⟩.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7: The group Z_7 × Z_7 (direct product of integers modulo 7 under addition) is an example of a group isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7. It can be generated by the elements (1,0) and (0,1), i.e., Z_7 × Z_7 = ⟨(1,0)⟩ × ⟨(0,1)⟩."
