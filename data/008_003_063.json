    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by row reducing the matrix to its row echelon form or reduced row echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n[ 3  7  9 ]\n[ 2  5  8 ]\n[ 1  4  7 ]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2/3 * row 1 from row 2, and subtract 1/3 * row 1 from row 3 to make the first element of rows 2 and 3 equal to 0.\n\n[ 3   7   9 ]\n[ 0  1/3  2/3 ]\n[ 0  5/3  4/3 ]\n\nStep 2: Multiply row 2 by 3 to get rid of the fractions.\n\n[ 3  7  9 ]\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n[ 0  5/3  4/3 ]\n\nStep 3: Subtract 5 * row 2 from row 3 to make the second element of row 3 equal to 0.\n\n[ 3  7  9 ]\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n[ 0  0 -2 ]\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form, and we can see that there are 3 non-zero rows, which means the rank of matrix A is 3."
