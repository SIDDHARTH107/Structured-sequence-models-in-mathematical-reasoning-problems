    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of winning this game using a Monte Carlo simulation, we will simulate the rolling of two dice one million times and count the number of times the sum of the numbers is greater than 7. Then, we will divide that count by the total number of trials (one million) to get the probability.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef roll_dice():\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\n\ndef simulate_game(trials):\n    wins = 0\n    for _ in range(trials):\n        dice1 = roll_dice()\n        dice2 = roll_dice()\n        if dice1 + dice2 > 7:\n            wins += 1\n    return wins / trials\n\ntrials = 1000000\nprobability = simulate_game(trials)\nprint(\"Estimated probability of winning:\", probability)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you an estimated probability of winning the game. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the Monte Carlo method. However, with one million trials, the estimate should be quite accurate."
