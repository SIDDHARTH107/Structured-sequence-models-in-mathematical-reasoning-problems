(Hint: The Gosper curve is a fractal that can be generated iteratively by replacing each line segment with a specific pattern. You can use the fact that the Gosper curve has a self-similarity property to find the length of the curve at each iteration.)",
    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal that can be generated iteratively by replacing each line segment with a specific pattern. The curve has a self-similarity property, which means that the length of the curve at each iteration can be found using a simple formula.\n\nAt each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 7 smaller segments, each of which is scaled down by a factor of √(1/2). Therefore, the length of the curve at each iteration can be found by multiplying the length of the previous iteration by 7 and dividing by √2.\n\nLet L_n be the length of the Gosper curve at the nth iteration. Then, we have the following formula:\n\nL_n = L_(n-1) * (7/√2)\n\nSince the initial side length is 1 unit, we have L_0 = 1. We can now find the length of the curve up to the 6th iteration using the formula:\n\nL_1 = L_0 * (7/√2) = 1 * (7/√2) = 7/√2\nL_2 = L_1 * (7/√2) = (7/√2) * (7/√2) = 49/2\nL_3 = L_2 * (7/√2) = (49/2) * (7/√2) = 343/√2\nL_4 = L_3 * (7/√2) = (343/√2) * (7/√2) = 2401/2\nL_5 = L_4 * (7/√2) = (2401/2) * (7/√2) = 16807/√2\nL_6 = L_5 * (7/√2) = (16807/√2) * (7/√2) = 117649/2\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve up to the 6th iteration is 117649/2 units."
