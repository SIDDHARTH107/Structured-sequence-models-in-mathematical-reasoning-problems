    "message_1": "Suppose a statistics class has 25 students, and the mean score on a recent exam was 72 with a standard deviation of 5.5. Using bootstrapping, generate 10,000 bootstrap samples and find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean score.",
    "message_2": "To perform bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a random sample of size 25 (the same as the original sample size) with replacement from the original data.\n2. Calculate the mean of the resampled data.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for 10,000 times to generate 10,000 bootstrap samples.\n4. Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the 10,000 bootstrap means to find the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual scores of the 25 students, we can only provide a general outline of the process. Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to perform bootstrapping using the NumPy library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original data (assuming we have the exam scores of the 25 students)\noriginal_data = np.array([...])\n\n# Number of bootstrap samples\nn_bootstrap_samples = 10000\n\n# Generate bootstrap samples\nbootstrap_means = []\nfor _ in range(n_bootstrap_samples):\n    resampled_data = np.random.choice(original_data, size=len(original_data), replace=True)\n    bootstrap_mean = np.mean(resampled_data)\n    bootstrap_means.append(bootstrap_mean)\n\n# Calculate the 95% confidence interval\nlower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)\nupper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)\n\nprint(f\"The 95% confidence interval for the population mean score is ({lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f})\")\n```\n\nReplace the ellipsis in the `original_data` array with the actual exam scores of the 25 students, and run the code to find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean score."
