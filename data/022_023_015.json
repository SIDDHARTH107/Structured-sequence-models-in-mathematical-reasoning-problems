    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation using complex analysis techniques, we first rewrite the sine function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\n$\\sin(x) = \\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}$\n\nNow, we can represent the solution $u(x,t)$ as a sum of forward and backward traveling waves:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2i}(F(x-ct) e^{i(x-ct)} - F(x+ct) e^{-i(x+ct)})$\n\nwhere $F(x)$ is an arbitrary function that we will determine using the initial conditions.\n\nTaking the partial derivative with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2i}(F'(x-ct) e^{i(x-ct)} - F'(x+ct) e^{-i(x+ct)})$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n1) $u(x,0) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2i}(F(x) e^{ix} - F(x) e^{-ix}) = 0$\n\nThis implies that $F(x) e^{ix} = F(x) e^{-ix}$, which means $F(x) = 0$.\n\n2) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = \\sin(x) \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2i}(F'(x) e^{ix} - F'(x) e^{-ix}) = \\sin(x)$\n\nComparing this with the expression for $\\sin(x)$ in terms of complex exponentials, we can see that $F'(x) = 1$. Integrating with respect to $x$, we find that $F(x) = x + C$, where $C$ is a constant. However, since $F(x) = 0$, we have $C = 0$, and thus $F(x) = x$.\n\nNow, we can write the solution $u(x,t)$ as:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2i}((x-ct) e^{i(x-ct)} - (x+ct) e^{-i(x+ct)})$\n\nThis is the solution to the wave equation with the given initial conditions using complex analysis techniques."
