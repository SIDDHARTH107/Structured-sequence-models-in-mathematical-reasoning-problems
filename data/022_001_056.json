    "message_2": "The function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$ is already analytic on the domain $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}$. However, it has a singularity at $z=1$. To find an analytic continuation that includes $z=1$, we can consider the Laurent series expansion of the function around $z=1$. \n\nThe Laurent series of a function is a representation of that function as a power series which includes both positive and negative powers of $(z-a)$, where $a$ is the point around which the series is expanded. In this case, we want to expand around $z=1$, so we will consider the series in powers of $(z-1)$.\n\nTo find the Laurent series of $f(z)$ around $z=1$, we first rewrite the function as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z} = \\frac{1}{(1-1)-(z-1)} = \\frac{1}{-(z-1)} = -\\frac{1}{z-1}.$$\n\nNow, we can see that the function has a simple pole at $z=1$, and the Laurent series is just the principal part of the series, which is:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{z-1}.$$\n\nThis is already the analytic continuation of the function $f(z)$ that includes $z=1$. However, it is important to note that the function is still not defined at $z=1$, as it has a singularity there. The analytic continuation simply provides a representation of the function that is valid in a neighborhood of $z=1$."
