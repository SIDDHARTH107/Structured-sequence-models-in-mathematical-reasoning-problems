    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob are using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to encrypt their messages. Alice chooses the prime number p = 17 and the generator g = 3. Bob chooses the secret value a = 7 and calculates A = g^a mod p. Alice chooses the secret value b = 5 and calculates B = g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their messages?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B.\n\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 3^7 mod 17\nA = 2187 mod 17\nA = 10\n\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 3^5 mod 17\nB = 243 mod 17\nB = 6\n\nNow, Alice and Bob will calculate the shared secret key using the following formulas:\n\nShared secret key (Alice) = B^a mod p\nShared secret key (Bob) = A^b mod p\n\nSince both calculations should result in the same shared secret key, we can just calculate one of them:\n\nShared secret key = B^a mod p\nShared secret key = 6^7 mod 17\nShared secret key = 279936 mod 17\nShared secret key = 4\n\nSo, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their messages is 4."
