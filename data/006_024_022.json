    "message_2": "To find the probability that a traveler will either miss their flight or experience a delay, we simply add the probabilities of these two events occurring.\n\nProbability of missing a flight = 25% = 0.25\nProbability of experiencing a delay = 20% = 0.20\n\nProbability of either missing a flight or experiencing a delay = 0.25 + 0.20 = 0.45\n\nSo, the probability that a traveler will either miss their flight or experience a delay on a trip is 0.45 or 45%."
