The demand function for the cakes is given by: Q = 1200 - 50P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per cake. Determine the optimal price and the maximum profit that the bakery can earn.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price and maximum profit, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue is the product of the price per cake (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). So, the revenue function R(P) can be expressed as:\n\nR(P) = P * Q = P * (1200 - 50P)\n\nNext, we need to find the profit function. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost. The cost function is given by C(Q) = 4Q. Since Q = 1200 - 50P, we can rewrite the cost function in terms of P:\n\nC(P) = 4 * (1200 - 50P)\n\nNow, we can find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function:\n\nProfit(P) = R(P) - C(P) = P * (1200 - 50P) - 4 * (1200 - 50P)\n\nTo find the optimal price, we need to maximize the profit function. We can do this by finding the critical points of the profit function, which occur when the derivative of the profit function with respect to P is equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 0\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the profit function:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = d(P * (1200 - 50P) - 4 * (1200 - 50P))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = (1200 - 50P) - P * 50 - 200 + 4 * 50\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = -100P + 1000\n\nNow, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for P:\n\n-100P + 1000 = 0\n\n100P = 1000\n\nP = 10\n\nSo, the optimal price per cake is $10. Now, we can find the maximum profit by plugging this value of P back into the profit function:\n\nProfit(10) = 10 * (1200 - 50 * 10) - 4 * (1200 - 50 * 10)\n\nProfit(10) = 10 * (1200 - 500) - 4 * (1200 - 500)\n\nProfit(10) = 10 * 700 - 4 * 700\n\nProfit(10) = 7000 - 2800\n\nProfit(10) = $4200\n\nTherefore, the optimal price per cake is $10, and the maximum profit the bakery can earn is $4200."
