    "message_1": "A two-player Centipede Game starts with a prize of $100. In each round, the player who starts the round decides whether to \"take\" the prize or \"pass\" it to the other player. If they pass, the other player decides whether to take the prize or pass it back. Each time the prize is passed, it increases by $20. If a player decides to take the prize, the game ends and that player wins the prize.\n\nSuppose Player 1 starts the game. What is the minimum amount that Player 1 would need to be offered to guarantee that they will take the prize in the first round?",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum amount Player 1 would need to be offered to guarantee they take the prize in the first round, we need to consider the potential outcomes of the game.\n\nIf Player 1 passes the prize to Player 2, the prize increases to $120. Player 2 then has the option to take the prize or pass it back to Player 1. If Player 2 believes that passing the prize back to Player 1 will result in a higher prize for themselves, they will pass it back. In this case, the prize would increase to $140.\n\nNow, Player 1 must decide whether to take the $140 or pass it back to Player 2. If Player 1 believes that passing the prize back to Player 2 will result in a higher prize for themselves, they will pass it back. However, if Player 1 is offered an amount equal to or greater than the potential prize they could receive by passing the prize back to Player 2, they will take the prize in the first round.\n\nIn this scenario, the minimum amount Player 1 would need to be offered to guarantee they take the prize in the first round is equal to the potential prize they could receive by passing the prize back to Player 2 and having it passed back to them again, which is $140."
