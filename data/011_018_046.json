    "message_1": "A school wants to organize a field day with 40 students participating in 5 different events. Each event must have an equal number of students competing and each student must participate in exactly 2 events. How many different ways can the school create the schedule of events?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 40 students and each student participates in exactly 2 events, there will be a total of 80 \"participations\" (40 students * 2 events per student). Since there are 5 events, each event must have 16 participants (80 participations / 5 events).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to divide the 40 students into 5 groups of 16, with each student participating in 2 events.\n\nFirst, let's choose the 16 students for the first event. There are C(40, 16) ways to do this, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. \n\nC(40, 16) = 40! / (16! * (40 - 16)!) = 40! / (16! * 24!) = 3,315,315\n\nNow, we have 24 students left, and we need to choose 16 for the second event. There are C(24, 16) ways to do this:\n\nC(24, 16) = 24! / (16! * (24 - 16)!) = 24! / (16! * 8!) = 735\n\nNow, we have 8 students left, and they will form the remaining 3 groups of 16 participants. Since each of these students will participate in 2 events, we can pair them up to form 3 groups of 2. There are C(8, 2) ways to choose the first pair:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * (8 - 2)!) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28\n\nNow, we have 6 students left, and there are C(6, 2) ways to choose the second pair:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15\n\nFinally, the last 4 students will form the last 2 pairs, and there is only 1 way to do this.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to create the schedule of events is:\n\n3,315,315 (first event) * 735 (second event) * 28 (first pair) * 15 (second pair) * 1 (last pairs) = 9,846,976,350 ways."
