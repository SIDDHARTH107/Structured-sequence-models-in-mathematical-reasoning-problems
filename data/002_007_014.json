    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and the length of its two parallel bases are 12 cm and 15 cm, respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the lengths of the parallel bases are 12 cm and 15 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 15) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (27) * 8\nArea = 13.5 * 8\nArea = 108\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 108 square centimeters."
