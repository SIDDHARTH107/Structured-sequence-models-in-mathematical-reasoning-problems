However, you want to make sure that the packaging of the products is robust enough to withstand any possible damage during transit. You decide to use robust optimization to ensure that the packaging can withstand at least two standard deviations above the mean external forces experienced in transit.\n\nYou have collected data on the external forces experienced by packages during transit, and have determined that they follow a normal distribution with a mean of 10 N and a standard deviation of 2 N. Using robust optimization, determine the minimum thickness (in centimeters) of packaging material you should use to ensure that packages can withstand at least two standard deviations above the mean external forces.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum thickness of packaging material, we first need to find the force that the packaging should be able to withstand. Since we want the packaging to withstand at least two standard deviations above the mean external forces, we can calculate this force as follows:\n\nForce = Mean + 2 * Standard Deviation\nForce = 10 N + 2 * 2 N\nForce = 10 N + 4 N\nForce = 14 N\n\nNow, we need to determine the minimum thickness of packaging material required to withstand this force. This will depend on the material's properties, such as its density, strength, and elasticity. However, since this information is not provided, we cannot determine the exact thickness of the packaging material.\n\nIn practice, you would need to consult with a packaging engineer or material scientist to determine the appropriate thickness based on the material's properties and the desired force resistance."
