    "message_1": "A thin rectangular plate measures 6cm by 4cm, and is made to vibrate in the plane by applying a driving force at a frequency of 10Hz. The plate is allowed to vibrate freely and the displacement is described by a partial differential equation. \n\nFind the Fourier series for the displacement of the plate in the form of an infinite sum of sines and cosines, and determine the amplitude and phase of the term for the fundamental frequency.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the displacement of the plate, we need to solve the wave equation for a rectangular plate. The wave equation for a rectangular plate is given by:\n\n∇^4 u(x, y, t) = (1/c^2) * ∂^2 u(x, y, t) / ∂t^2\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) is the displacement of the plate at position (x, y) and time t, and c is the speed of the wave in the plate.\n\nWe assume that the displacement u(x, y, t) can be separated into a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x) * Y(y) * T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation and dividing by u(x, y, t) gives:\n\n(1/X(x) * ∇^4 X(x)) * (1/Y(y) * ∇^4 Y(y)) = (1/c^2) * (1/T(t) * ∂^2 T(t) / ∂t^2)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and y, and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ^2:\n\n1/X(x) * ∇^4 X(x) = -λ^2\n1/Y(y) * ∇^4 Y(y) = -λ^2\n\nSolving these equations gives the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the plate:\n\nX(x) = cos(λx) or sin(λx)\nY(y) = cos(λy) or sin(λy)\n\nThe boundary conditions for a freely vibrating plate are that the displacement and its second derivative with respect to x and y are zero at the edges:\n\nu(0, y, t) = u(6, y, t) = u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 4, t) = 0\n∂^2 u(0, y, t) / ∂x^2 = ∂^2 u(6, y, t) / ∂x^2 = ∂^2 u(x, 0, t) / ∂y^2 = ∂^2 u(x, 4, t) / ∂y^2 = 0\n\nApplying these boundary conditions to the eigenfunctions gives the allowed values of λ:\n\nλ_x = m * π / 6, m = 1, 2, 3, ...\nλ_y = n * π / 4, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe general solution for the displacement of the plate is then given by a double Fourier series:\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ Σ A_mn * sin(m * π * x / 6) * sin(n * π * y / 4) * cos(λ_mn * c * t + φ_mn)\n\nwhere A_mn and φ_mn are the amplitude and phase of the term with mode numbers m and n, and λ_mn = sqrt(λ_x^2 + λ_y^2).\n\nThe fundamental frequency is given by the lowest mode numbers m = 1 and n = 1:\n\nu_11(x, y, t) = A_11 * sin(π * x / 6) * sin(π * y / 4) * cos(λ_11 * c * t + φ_11)\n\nTo determine the amplitude A_11 and phase φ_11 of the fundamental frequency, we would need more information about the initial conditions of the plate and the driving force."
