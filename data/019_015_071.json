    "message_1": "Given the type hierarchy N : Z : Q : R : C, where N, Z, Q, R, and C represent the sets of natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers respectively, how many types higher than Z can you go if you start from Q and take the dual of a type m by augmenting it with a new bottom element, then reversing all relation to have the strict order defined by <:?",
    "message_2": "If you start from Q (rational numbers) and take the dual of a type m by augmenting it with a new bottom element and reversing all relations to have the strict order defined by <:, you will still be within the same type hierarchy. This is because the dual operation does not change the inherent properties of the number sets, but rather the order in which they are considered.\n\nSince you are starting from Q, which is already one type higher than Z, you can go two more types higher to reach C (complex numbers). So, the answer is 2 types higher than Z."
