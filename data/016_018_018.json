    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces at each iteration, and R is the scaling factor (the ratio of the length of the original line segment to the length of each subinterval).\n\nIn this case, the original line segment has a length of 27 cm, and it is split into 6 equal subintervals for each iteration. Therefore, N = 6 and R = 6.\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(6) / log(6)\n\nHausdorff dimension = 1\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust in this case is 1."
