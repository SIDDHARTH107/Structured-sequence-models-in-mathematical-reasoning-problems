    "message_2": "To find the number of rational points on the curve, we will count the number of solutions $(x, y)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ that satisfy the equation $y^2 = x^5 + x^3 + x + 1$. We will do this by iterating through all possible values of $x$ and counting the number of corresponding $y$ values that satisfy the equation.\n\nFor each $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we compute the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n1. For $x = 0$, we have $y^2 = 0^5 + 0^3 + 0 + 1 = 1$. There are two solutions: $y = 1$ and $y = 4$.\n2. For $x = 1$, we have $y^2 = 1^5 + 1^3 + 1 + 1 = 4$. There are two solutions: $y = 2$ and $y = 3$.\n3. For $x = 2$, we have $y^2 = 2^5 + 2^3 + 2 + 1 = 2$. There are no solutions.\n4. For $x = 3$, we have $y^2 = 3^5 + 3^3 + 3 + 1 = 3$. There are no solutions.\n5. For $x = 4$, we have $y^2 = 4^5 + 4^3 + 4 + 1 = 0$. There is one solution: $y = 0$.\n\nSo far, we have found $2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 5$ solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_5$. Additionally, we must include the point at infinity, which is always a rational point on the curve. Therefore, the total number of rational points on the curve is $5 + 1 = 6$."
