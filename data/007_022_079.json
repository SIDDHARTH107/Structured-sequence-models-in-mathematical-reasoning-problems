    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 12 over the field F_p where p = 11, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in the field F_11 and checking if they satisfy the curve equation. If they do, we increment the count of points on the curve.\n\nHere's the process:\n\n1. Initialize the count to 1 (to account for the point at infinity).\n2. Iterate through all x values from 0 to 10 (since we are working in F_11).\n3. For each x value, compute the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 7x + 12) modulo 11.\n4. Check if there is a y value in F_11 such that y^2 is congruent to the computed right-hand side modulo 11. If there is, increment the count by 2 (since there will be two points with the same x value and different y values).\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. count = 1\n2. For x = 0 to 10:\n   - x = 0: RHS = (0^3 + 7*0 + 12) % 11 = 1. There are two points (0, 1) and (0, 10).\n   - x = 1: RHS = (1^3 + 7*1 + 12) % 11 = 10. There are two points (1, 5) and (1, 6).\n   - x = 2: RHS = (2^3 + 7*2 + 12) % 11 = 6. No points.\n   - x = 3: RHS = (3^3 + 7*3 + 12) % 11 = 9. No points.\n   - x = 4: RHS = (4^3 + 7*4 + 12) % 11 = 5. No points.\n   - x = 5: RHS = (5^3 + 7*5 + 12) % 11 = 4. There are two points (5, 2) and (5, 9).\n   - x = 6: RHS = (6^3 + 7*6 + 12) % 11 = 3. No points.\n   - x = 7: RHS = (7^3 + 7*7 + 12) % 11 = 0. There are two points (7, 0) and (7, 0).\n   - x = 8: RHS = (8^3 + 7*8 + 12) % 11 = 7. No points.\n   - x = 9: RHS = (9^3 + 7*9 + 12) % 11 = 2. No points.\n   - x = 10: RHS = (10^3 + 7*10 + 12) % 11 = 8. No points.\n\nThe count of points on the curve is 1 (point at infinity) + 2 (x = 0) + 2 (x = 1) + 2 (x = 5) + 1 (x = 7) = 8.\n\nSo, the order of the elliptic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 12 over the field F_p where p = 11 is 8."
