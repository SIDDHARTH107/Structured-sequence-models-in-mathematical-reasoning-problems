    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 6 cm and a slant height of 10 cm. What is the surface area of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (the area of the curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven, radius (r) = 6 cm and slant height (l) = 10 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(6)(6 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(6)(16)\nSurface Area = 96π\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 96π square centimeters."
