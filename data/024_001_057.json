    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the curve with respect to the parameter t.\n\nLet r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (t, t^2, t^3).\n\nFirst, find the first derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\nr'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)) = (1, 2t, 3t^2).\n\nNow, find the second derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\nr''(t) = (x''(t), y''(t), z''(t)) = (0, 2, 6t).\n\nNext, find the third derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\nr'''(t) = (x'''(t), y'''(t), z'''(t)) = (0, 0, 6).\n\nNow, we can find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) of the curve using the following formulas:\n\nCurvature (k) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\nTorsion (τ) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (1, 2t, 3t^2) x (0, 2, 6t) = (12t^2 - 6t, -6t, 2).\n\nNext, find the magnitude of r'(t) x r''(t):\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = sqrt((12t^2 - 6t)^2 + (-6t)^2 + 2^2).\n\nNow, find the magnitude of r'(t):\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(1^2 + (2t)^2 + (3t^2)^2).\n\nAt t = 1/2, we have:\nr'(1/2) = (1, 1, 3/4),\nr''(1/2) = (0, 2, 3),\nr'''(1/2) = (0, 0, 6).\n\nNow, find the curvature (k) at t = 1/2:\nk = ||r'(1/2) x r''(1/2)|| / ||r'(1/2)||^3\nk = ||(3, -3/2, 2)|| / ||(1, 1, 3/4)||^3\nk = sqrt(3^2 + (-3/2)^2 + 2^2) / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + (3/4)^2)^3\nk = sqrt(45/4) / (5/4)^3\nk = (3/2) / (125/64)\nk = 96/125\n\nNow, find the torsion (τ) at t = 1/2:\nτ = (r'(1/2) x r''(1/2)) • r'''(1/2) / ||r'(1/2) x r''(1/2)||^2\nτ = (3, -3/2, 2) • (0, 0, 6) / (45/4)^2\nτ = 12 / (45/4)^2\nτ = 48/405\n\nSo, the curvature (k) of the curve at t = 1/2 is 96/125, and the torsion (τ) is 48/405."
