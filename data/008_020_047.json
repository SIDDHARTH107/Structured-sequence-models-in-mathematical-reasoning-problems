    "message_2": "The non-square matrix method is not applicable to this problem, as it is used for solving systems of linear equations with more variables than equations or vice versa. In this case, we have 3 variables and 3 equations, so we can use the Gaussian elimination method or Cramer's rule to solve the system.\n\nLet's use the Gaussian elimination method:\n\nFirst, write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n|  2  3  4 |  7 |\n| -3  2  5 |  1 |\n|  6 -5  7 | -3 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Add 1.5 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the -3 in the second row:\n\n```\n|  2   3   4 |  7  |\n|  0  6.5 11 | 11.5|\n|  6  -5   7 | -3  |\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by 6.5 to get a 1 in the second row's second column:\n\n```\n|  2   3   4 |  7  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  6  -5   7 | -3  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Add -3 times the second row to the first row to eliminate the 3 in the first row's second column:\n\n```\n|  2   0   0.2308 |  1.6923  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  6  -5   7 | -3  |\n```\n\nStep 4: Divide the first row by 2 to get a 1 in the first row's first column:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0.1154 |  0.84615  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  6  -5   7 | -3  |\n```\n\nStep 5: Add -6 times the first row to the third row to eliminate the 6 in the third row's first column:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0.1154 |  0.84615  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  0  -5  6.3077 | -8.0769  |\n```\n\nStep 6: Add 5 times the second row to the third row to eliminate the -5 in the third row's second column:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0.1154 |  0.84615  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  0   0   14.7692 | 1.7692  |\n```\n\nStep 7: Divide the third row by 14.7692 to get a 1 in the third row's third column:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0.1154 |  0.84615  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  0   0   1 | 0.12  |\n```\n\nStep 8: Subtract 0.1154 times the third row from the first row to eliminate the 0.1154 in the first row's third column:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0 |  0.84615 - 0.0138  |\n|  0   1   1.6923 | 1.7692|\n|  0   0   1 | 0.12  |\n```\n\nStep 9: Subtract 1.6923 times the third row from the second row to eliminate the 1.6923 in the second row's third column:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0 |  0.83235  |\n|  0   1   0 | 1.7692 - 0.2031|\n|  0   0   1 | 0.12  |\n```\n\nNow we have the solution in the form of an identity matrix:\n\n```\nx = 0.83235\ny = 1.5661\nz = 0.12\n```\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx ≈ 0.83235\ny ≈ 1.5661\nz ≈ 0.12"
