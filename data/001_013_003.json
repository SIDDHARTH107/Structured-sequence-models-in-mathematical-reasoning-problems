    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(x + 5) - 3 = 4, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nAdd 3 to both sides of the equation:\n√(x + 5) = 4 + 3\n√(x + 5) = 7\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(x + 5))^2 = 7^2\nx + 5 = 49\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\nx = 49 - 5\nx = 44\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(x + 5) - 3 = 4 is x = 44."
