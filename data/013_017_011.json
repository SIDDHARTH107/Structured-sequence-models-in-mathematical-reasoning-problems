The sellers know the quality of their cars, but the buyers are not sure and can only check the condition of the car after they have bought it. The buyers are willing to pay $10,000 for a good quality car and $5,000 for a bad quality car. The sellers are willing to sell their good quality cars for $8,000 and their bad quality cars for $4,000. Assume that buyers and sellers are equally likely to be matched. What is the average price of a car sold in the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the average price of a car sold in the market, we need to consider the prices at which the cars are sold and the proportion of good and bad quality cars.\n\nSince buyers are willing to pay $10,000 for a good quality car and sellers are willing to sell for $8,000, we can assume that good quality cars will be sold at a price between $8,000 and $10,000. For simplicity, let's assume the average price for a good quality car is $9,000.\n\nSimilarly, buyers are willing to pay $5,000 for a bad quality car and sellers are willing to sell for $4,000. We can assume that bad quality cars will be sold at a price between $4,000 and $5,000. Let's assume the average price for a bad quality car is $4,500.\n\nNow, we know that there are 60 good quality cars and 40 bad quality cars. So, the total number of cars is 100.\n\nThe average price of a car sold in the market can be calculated as follows:\n\nAverage price = (Total value of good quality cars + Total value of bad quality cars) / Total number of cars\n\nTotal value of good quality cars = 60 (number of good quality cars) * $9,000 (average price of a good quality car) = $540,000\n\nTotal value of bad quality cars = 40 (number of bad quality cars) * $4,500 (average price of a bad quality car) = $180,000\n\nAverage price = ($540,000 + $180,000) / 100 = $720,000 / 100 = $7,200\n\nSo, the average price of a car sold in the market is $7,200."
