    "message_2": "To find the degree of membership of the number 7 in the fuzzy set A, we need to substitute x = 7 into the membership function µA(x).\n\nµA(x) = 1/[(x-5)²+1]\n\nµA(7) = 1/[(7-5)²+1]\nµA(7) = 1/[(2)²+1]\nµA(7) = 1/[4+1]\nµA(7) = 1/5\n\nTherefore, the degree of membership of the number 7 in the fuzzy set A is 1/5 or 0.2."
