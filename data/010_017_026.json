Suppose further that $f$ has only two critical points, both non-degenerate. Let $i_k$ denote the number of critical points of index $k$ and $b_j$ denote the $j$-th Betti number of the level set $f^{-1}(c)$.\n\nIf $i_0 = i_2 = 1$ and $i_1 = 2$, prove that $b_1 \\geq 1$ for any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.",
    "message_2": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two critical points of $f$. Since $i_0 = i_2 = 1$, we know that one of them is a local minimum and the other is a local maximum. Without loss of generality, let $f(p) < f(q)$. \n\nNow, consider the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We have three cases to consider:\n\n1. $c < f(p)$: In this case, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is empty, and all Betti numbers are zero.\n\n2. $f(p) \\leq c < f(q)$: In this case, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth submanifold that encloses the local minimum $p$. Since $f$ has only two critical points, the level set must be a simple closed curve, which is homotopic to a circle. Therefore, the first Betti number $b_1 = 1$.\n\n3. $c \\geq f(q)$: In this case, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth submanifold that encloses both critical points $p$ and $q$. Since $i_1 = 2$, there must be two non-degenerate saddle points on the level set. The level set must be a figure-eight curve, which is homotopic to the wedge sum of two circles. Therefore, the first Betti number $b_1 = 2$.\n\nIn all cases, we have $b_1 \\geq 1$ for any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$."
