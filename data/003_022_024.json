    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √((-4)^2 + (3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n|B| = √((5)^2 + (-2)^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the vectors A and B. To find the dot product, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y\n\nA · B = (-4) * (5) + (3) * (-2) = -20 - 6 = -26\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (-26) / (5 * √29) ≈ -0.956\n\nθ ≈ arccos(-0.956) ≈ 167.47°\n\nFinally, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * (-0.956) ≈ -26\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors is -26."
