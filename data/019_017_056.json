Let T be the theory of L which contains the Peano axioms for arithmetic (including the induction schema) and the axiom \"0 ≠ succ(x)\", where succ(x) is the successor of x, meaning x+1. \n\nFind a sentence σ in the language L such that T ⊢ σ, but T ⊬ 2σ, where 2σ means the statement \"σ implies σ\".",
    "message_2": "There seems to be a misunderstanding in the question. The notation \"2σ\" is not standard in the context of first-order logic. However, I will try to interpret the question as follows: Find a sentence σ in the language L such that T ⊢ σ, but T ⊬ (σ → σ), where (σ → σ) means the statement \"σ implies σ\".\n\nIn classical first-order logic, (σ → σ) is a tautology, which means it is true in every interpretation. Therefore, if T ⊢ σ for some sentence σ, then T ⊢ (σ → σ) as well, since (σ → σ) is true in every interpretation, including those that satisfy the axioms of T.\n\nSo, it is not possible to find a sentence σ in the language L such that T ⊢ σ, but T ⊬ (σ → σ)."
