Suppose that the complete linear system |L| has no base points. Prove that X is isomorphic to a Fano variety of some index. \n\nWhat is the index of X?",
    "message_2": "To prove that X is isomorphic to a Fano variety of some index, we need to show that the anticanonical divisor -K_X is ample. Since X has Picard number one, there exists a rational number r such that K_X = rL. We will find the value of r and show that it is negative, which implies that -K_X is ample.\n\nConsider the intersection numbers L^n and K_X * L^(n-1) for some positive integer n. By the projection formula, we have:\n\nK_X * L^(n-1) = rL * L^(n-1) = rL^n.\n\nNow, let's compute the self-intersection number L^n. Since L is ample, L^n > 0 for any positive integer n.\n\nNext, let's compute the intersection number K_X * L^(n-1). By the adjunction formula, we have:\n\nK_X * L^(n-1) = (K_X + L) * L^(n-1) - L^n.\n\nSince |L| has no base points, the linear system |K_X + L| also has no base points. Therefore, the divisor K_X + L is effective, which implies that (K_X + L) * L^(n-1) ≥ 0. Combining this with the previous equation, we get:\n\nrL^n = K_X * L^(n-1) = (K_X + L) * L^(n-1) - L^n ≥ -L^n.\n\nThus, r ≤ -1. Since r is a rational number, we can write r = -m/n for some positive integers m and n. Then, K_X = -m/n * L, and -K_X = m/n * L. Since L is ample, m/n * L is also ample. Therefore, X is a Fano variety of index n.\n\nIn conclusion, X is isomorphic to a Fano variety of index n, where n is the positive integer such that K_X = -m/n * L for some positive integer m."
