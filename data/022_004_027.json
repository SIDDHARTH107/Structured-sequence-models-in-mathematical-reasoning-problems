    "message_2": "To find the singularities of f(z), we first need to find the points where the function is not defined. This occurs when the denominator is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 - 4 = 0\n\nThis factors as:\n\n(z - 2)(z + 2) = 0\n\nSo, the singularities are at z = 2 and z = -2.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of singularities. We can do this by analyzing the behavior of the function near the singular points.\n\n1. Singularity at z = 2:\n\nf(z) = (z-1)/((z-2)(z+2))\n\nAs z approaches 2, the function behaves like:\n\nf(z) ≈ (2-1)/((z-2)(4))\n\nf(z) ≈ 1/(4(z-2))\n\nThis shows that the singularity at z = 2 is a simple pole, as the function behaves like 1/(z-2) near z = 2.\n\n2. Singularity at z = -2:\n\nf(z) = (z-1)/((z-2)(z+2))\n\nAs z approaches -2, the function behaves like:\n\nf(z) ≈ (-2-1)/((-4)(z+2))\n\nf(z) ≈ -3/(4(z+2))\n\nThis shows that the singularity at z = -2 is also a simple pole, as the function behaves like -3/(4(z+2)) near z = -2.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) has two singularities at z = 2 and z = -2, and both of them are simple poles. There are no removable or essential singularities."
