Next, we will perform back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 5: Solve for z:\n\n21z = 49\nz = 49 / 21\n\nStep 6: Solve for y:\n\ny + z = 6\ny + (49 / 21) = 6\ny = 6 - (49 / 21)\ny = 77 / 21\n\nStep 7: Solve for x:\n\n3x + 4y - 5z = 1\n3x + 4(77 / 21) - 5(49 / 21) = 1\n3x = 1 - 4(77 / 21) + 5(49 / 21)\nx = (1 - 308 / 21 + 245 / 21) / 3\nx = -5 / 3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -5/3\ny = 77/21\nz = 49/21"
