    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one passenger will get sick during the journey, we can first find the probability that no one gets sick and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a passenger not getting sick is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nThere are a total of 5 carriages * 50 people = 250 passengers.\n\nThe probability that no one gets sick is (0.98)^250 ≈ 0.0144.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one passenger will get sick:\n\n1 - 0.0144 ≈ 0.9856.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one passenger will get sick during the journey is approximately 0.9856 or 98.56%."
