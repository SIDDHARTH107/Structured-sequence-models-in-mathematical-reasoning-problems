    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron is a fractal created by recursively removing smaller tetrahedrons from the original tetrahedron. In this case, we are constructing a third-level Sierpinski tetrahedron, which means the process is repeated three times.\n\nFirst, let's find the surface area of the original tetrahedron. The surface area of a tetrahedron with edge length 'a' can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = a² * √3\n\nFor the original tetrahedron with edge length 12 cm:\n\nSurface area = 12² * √3 = 144 * √3 cm²\n\nNow, let's find the total surface area of all the smaller tetrahedrons created in the process. Each time we repeat the process, the surface area of the smaller tetrahedrons increases by a factor of 4. So, for a third-level Sierpinski tetrahedron, the total surface area will be:\n\nTotal surface area = Original surface area * 4^(number of iterations)\n\nIn this case, the number of iterations is 3:\n\nTotal surface area = 144 * √3 * 4^3 = 144 * √3 * 64 = 9216 * √3 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of all the smaller tetrahedrons created in the process of constructing a third-level Sierpinski tetrahedron with an original edge length of 12 cm is 9216 * √3 cm²."
