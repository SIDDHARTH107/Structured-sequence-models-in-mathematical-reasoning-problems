Plot the numerical solution for t=0, t=0.02, t=0.05 and t=0.1.",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot directly plot graphs or run code. However, I can guide you through the process of solving the given partial differential equation using the finite element method.\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain:\nDivide the spatial domain into a 20x20 uniform square mesh. Let Δx = Δy = 1/20. Denote the mesh points as (x_i, y_j) where i, j = 0, 1, ..., 20.\n\n2. Discretize the time domain:\nLet Δt = 0.01 and denote the time steps as t_n where n = 0, 1, ..., N.\n\n3. Approximate the second partial derivatives:\nUse central difference approximations for the second partial derivatives u_xx and u_yy:\n\nu_xx(i, j, n) ≈ (u(i+1, j, n) - 2*u(i, j, n) + u(i-1, j, n)) / (Δx)^2\nu_yy(i, j, n) ≈ (u(i, j+1, n) - 2*u(i, j, n) + u(i, j-1, n)) / (Δy)^2\n\n4. Discretize the PDE using the forward Euler method:\nu(i, j, n+1) = u(i, j, n) + k * Δt * (u_xx(i, j, n) + u_yy(i, j, n))\n\n5. Apply the initial and boundary conditions:\nu(i, j, 0) = sin(πx_i) * sin(πy_j)\nu(0, j, n) = u(20, j, n) = u(i, 0, n) = u(i, 20, n) = 0\n\n6. Iterate through time steps:\nFor n = 0 to N-1, update u(i, j, n+1) using the discretized PDE and boundary conditions.\n\n7. Plot the numerical solution:\nPlot the numerical solution u(x, y, t) for t = 0, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1.\n\nTo implement this algorithm in a programming language like Python, you can use libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for plotting the results."
