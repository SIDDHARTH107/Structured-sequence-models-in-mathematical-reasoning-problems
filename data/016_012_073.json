    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it can pass through an arbitrary number of points in a given area as the construction process is repeated. The construction process for the Peano curve involves dividing the current curve into 9 equal segments and rearranging them to form a new curve. Each iteration increases the number of points the curve passes through by a factor of 9.\n\nLet n be the number of iterations needed for the Peano curve to pass through 10^6 points in both x and y directions. We can set up the following equation:\n\n9^n = 10^6\n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nn * log(9) = log(10^6)\n\nn = log(10^6) / log(9)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nn â‰ˆ 13.573\n\nSince n must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nn = 14\n\nSo, the construction process for the Peano curve must be repeated 14 times to obtain a curve that passes through 10^6 points in both x and y directions."
