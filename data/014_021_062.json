    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted the following ciphertext that was encrypted using a Hill cipher with a 2x2 key matrix:\n\nEL HD\n\nand you know that the corresponding plaintext is \"OK BO\".\n\nDetermine the 2x2 key matrix used for encryption and decrypt the intercepted message.",
    "message_2": "To find the key matrix, we need to solve the following equation:\n\nCiphertext = KeyMatrix * Plaintext\n\nFirst, we need to convert the letters to numbers using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nCiphertext: EL HD -> E=4, L=11, H=7, D=3 -> (4, 11), (7, 3)\nPlaintext: OK BO -> O=14, K=10, B=1, O=14 -> (14, 10), (1, 14)\n\nNow, we can write the equation as:\n\n(4, 11) = KeyMatrix * (14, 10)\n(7, 3) = KeyMatrix * (1, 14)\n\nLet the key matrix be:\n\n(a, b)\n(c, d)\n\nThen, we have:\n\n(4, 11) = (a, b) * (14, 10)\n(7, 3) = (c, d) * (1, 14)\n\nWhich gives us the following system of linear equations:\n\n14a + 10b = 4\n14c + 10d = 11\na + 14b = 7\nc + 14d = 3\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\na = 6, b = 1, c = 23, and d = 2\n\nSo, the key matrix is:\n\n(6, 1)\n(23, 2)\n\nNow, to decrypt the intercepted message, we need to find the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\n1/determinant * (d, -b)\n                  (-c, a)\n\nThe determinant is (ad - bc) mod 26:\n\ndeterminant = (6 * 2 - 1 * 23) mod 26 = (12 - 23) mod 26 = -11 mod 26 = 15\n\nThe inverse of the determinant modulo 26 is the number x such that 15x ≡ 1 (mod 26). We can find this by trial and error:\n\n15 * 7 = 105 ≡ 1 (mod 26)\n\nSo, the inverse of the determinant is 7. Now, we can find the inverse of the key matrix:\n\nInverseKeyMatrix = 7 * (2, -1)\n                         (-23, 6)\n\nInverseKeyMatrix = (14, -7)\n                         (-161, 42)\n\nInverseKeyMatrix mod 26 = (12, 19)\n                                       (11, 16)\n\nNow, we can decrypt the intercepted message by multiplying the inverse key matrix by the ciphertext:\n\n(12, 19) * (4, 11) = (14, 10) -> OK\n(11, 16) * (7, 3) = (1, 14) -> BO\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"OK BO\"."
