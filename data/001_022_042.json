    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n2x^3 - 7x^2 - 24x + 45 = 0\n\nFirst, let's try to find if there are any integer solutions using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (45) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (2). The factors of 45 are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±9, ±15, and ±45, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, the possible rational roots are:\n\n±1, ±3, ±5, ±9, ±15, ±45, ±1/2, ±3/2, ±5/2, ±9/2, ±15/2, and ±45/2.\n\nNow, let's test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 7(1)^2 - 24(1) + 45 = -34 ≠ 0\nf(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - 7(-1)^2 - 24(-1) + 45 = 20 ≠ 0\nf(3) = 2(3)^3 - 7(3)^2 - 24(3) + 45 = 0\n\nWe found a rational root: x = 3. Now, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining factors of the polynomial:\n\n3 |  2  -7  -24  45\n     |     6   9  -99\n     ----------------\n       2  -1  -15  -54\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\nf(x) = (x - 3)(2x^2 - x - 15)\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic factor:\n\n2x^2 - x - 15 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(2)(-15))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 120)) / 4\n\nx = (1 ± √121) / 4\n\nx = (1 ± 11) / 4\n\nThe two roots are:\n\nx = (1 + 11) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 (which we already found)\n\nx = (1 - 11) / 4 = -10 / 4 = -5/2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation are x = 3 and x = -5/2."
