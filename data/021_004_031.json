    "message_2": "To find the first derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 7x^2 - 5x + 3 at x=2 using the Three-Point Forward Difference Method with a step size of h=0.1, we will use the following formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (-3f(x) + 4f(x+h) - f(x+2h)) / (2h)\n\nFirst, let's find the values of f(x), f(x+h), and f(x+2h) for x=2 and h=0.1.\n\nf(x) = f(2) = 2(2)^3 + 7(2)^2 - 5(2) + 3 = 16 + 28 - 10 + 3 = 37\nf(x+h) = f(2.1) = 2(2.1)^3 + 7(2.1)^2 - 5(2.1) + 3 ≈ 45.262\nf(x+2h) = f(2.2) = 2(2.2)^3 + 7(2.2)^2 - 5(2.2) + 3 ≈ 54.328\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (-3 * 37 + 4 * 45.262 - 54.328) / (2 * 0.1) ≈ (-111 + 181.048 - 54.328) / 0.2 ≈ 15.72 / 0.2 ≈ 78.6\n\nSo, the first derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 7x^2 - 5x + 3 at x=2 using the Three-Point Forward Difference Method with a step size of h=0.1 is approximately 78.6."
