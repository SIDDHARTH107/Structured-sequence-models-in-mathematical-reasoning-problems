    "message_2": "Let the radius of the base of the cylindrical can be r cm and the height be h cm. The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h. Since the volume is 100 cubic centimeters, we have:\n\nπr^2h = 100\n\nThe cost of the material for the top and bottom of the can is $0.05/cm², and the area of the top and bottom is 2πr^2. So the cost for the top and bottom is:\n\n0.05 * 2πr^2 = 0.1πr^2\n\nThe cost of the material for the sides is $0.03/cm², and the area of the sides is 2πrh. So the cost for the sides is:\n\n0.03 * 2πrh = 0.06πrh\n\nThe total cost of the materials is the sum of the costs for the top and bottom and the sides:\n\nC = 0.1πr^2 + 0.06πrh\n\nWe want to minimize this cost. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable λ and form the function:\n\nF(r, h, λ) = 0.1πr^2 + 0.06πrh - λ(πr^2h - 100)\n\nNow we take the partial derivatives with respect to r, h, and λ, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂F/∂r = 0.2πr + 0.06πh - 2λπrh = 0\n∂F/∂h = 0.06πr - λπr^2 = 0\n∂F/∂λ = πr^2h - 100 = 0\n\nWe can solve the second equation for λ:\n\nλ = 0.06πr / (πr^2) = 0.06 / r\n\nSubstitute this expression for λ into the first equation:\n\n0.2πr + 0.06πh - 2(0.06 / r)πrh = 0\n\nSimplify and rearrange:\n\n0.2r + 0.06h - 0.12h = 0\n0.2r = 0.06h\nh = 10/3 * r\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the third equation:\n\nπr^2(10/3 * r) - 100 = 0\n10/3 * πr^3 - 100 = 0\n\nSolve for r:\n\nr^3 = (100 * 3) / (10π)\nr^3 = 30 / π\nr ≈ 1.534 cm\n\nNow find the height using the expression for h:\n\nh = 10/3 * r\nh ≈ 10/3 * 1.534\nh ≈ 5.115 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can that will minimize the cost of materials are approximately r ≈ 1.534 cm and h ≈ 5.115 cm."
