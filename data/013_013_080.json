    "message_1": "Suppose there are four bidders participating in a sealed-bid second-price auction, where the item being auctioned off is a rare stamp with an estimated value of $100,000. The bidders' valuations for the stamp are as follows: \n\nBidder 1: $85,000\nBidder 2: $90,000\nBidder 3: $100,000\nBidder 4: $110,000\n\nWhat is the expected revenue for the seller of the stamp in this auction?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $85,000\nBidder 2: $90,000\nBidder 3: $100,000\nBidder 4: $110,000\n\nBidder 4 has the highest bid at $110,000, so they will win the auction. However, they will pay the second-highest bid price, which is $100,000 from Bidder 3. Therefore, the expected revenue for the seller of the stamp in this auction is $100,000."
