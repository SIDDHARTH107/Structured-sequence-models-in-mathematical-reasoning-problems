    "message_2": "To find the cut vertices and bridges in the given graph, we can use Tarjan's algorithm or DFS traversal. In this case, we will use DFS traversal.\n\nFirst, let's label the vertices for easier reference:\n\n```\nA - B - C\n|   |   |\nD - E - F\n```\n\nNow, let's perform DFS traversal and keep track of the discovery time and the low value for each vertex.\n\n1. Start at vertex A (discovery time = 1, low value = 1)\n2. Visit vertex B (discovery time = 2, low value = 2)\n3. Visit vertex C (discovery time = 3, low value = 3)\n4. Visit vertex F (discovery time = 4, low value = 4)\n5. Backtrack to vertex C and update its low value to 2 (low value = 2)\n6. Backtrack to vertex B and update its low value to 1 (low value = 1)\n7. Visit vertex E (discovery time = 5, low value = 5)\n8. Visit vertex D (discovery time = 6, low value = 6)\n9. Backtrack to vertex E and update its low value to 1 (low value = 1)\n10. Backtrack to vertex B and update its low value to 1 (low value = 1)\n11. Backtrack to vertex A and update its low value to 1 (low value = 1)\n\nNow, let's find the cut vertices and bridges:\n\nCut vertices:\n- A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child with a low value greater than or equal to its discovery time.\n- In this graph, vertex B is a cut vertex because it has two children (A and E) and its low value (1) is equal to its discovery time (1).\n\nBridges:\n- An edge is a bridge if the low value of one of its vertices is greater than the discovery time of the other vertex.\n- In this graph, there are no bridges because there are no edges that meet this condition.\n\nSo, the cut vertices in the given graph are {B}, and there are no bridges."
