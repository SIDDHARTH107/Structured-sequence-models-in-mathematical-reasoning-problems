    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after 12 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^12)\n\nPerimeter = 1 * 4096\n\nPerimeter = 4096 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after 12 iterations is 4096 units."
