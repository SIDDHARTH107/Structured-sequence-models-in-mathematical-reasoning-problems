    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of the graph G, we first need to find the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with 10 vertices. A connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges. In this case, with 10 vertices, the minimum number of edges is 10 - 1 = 9 edges. This would form a tree, which has a diameter equal to the longest path between any two vertices.\n\nNow, let's consider the graph G with 15 edges. Since it has more edges than the minimum required for a connected graph with 10 vertices, it must contain at least one cycle. We can use the following inequality to find an upper bound for the diameter:\n\ndiameter(G) ≤ 2 * ceil[log2(n)]\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices in G. In this case, n = 10, so:\n\ndiameter(G) ≤ 2 * ceil[log2(10)] = 2 * ceil[3.32] = 2 * 4 = 8\n\nNow we have an upper bound for the diameter of G, which is 8. Since G is connected and has at least one cycle, the diameter must be at least 2. Therefore, the diameter of G lies in the range of 2 to 8.\n\nTo find the exact diameter, we would need more information about the structure of the graph G. However, we can conclude that the diameter of G is between 2 and 8, inclusive."
