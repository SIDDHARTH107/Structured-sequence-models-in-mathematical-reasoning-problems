    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces different models of smartphones every year. If they started with 100 units of the latest model this year and predict that for every year after, half of the latest model will be replaced by the newer model, how many of the latest model will remain after 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many of the latest model will remain after 5 years, we can use the formula:\n\nRemaining units = Initial units * (1/2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, the initial units are 100, and we want to find out the remaining units after 5 years, so n = 5.\n\nRemaining units = 100 * (1/2)^5\nRemaining units = 100 * (1/32)\nRemaining units = 100/32\nRemaining units â‰ˆ 3.125\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a smartphone, we can round down to the nearest whole number. So, approximately 3 units of the latest model will remain after 5 years."
