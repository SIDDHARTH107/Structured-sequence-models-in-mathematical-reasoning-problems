    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 is prime and greater than 100.\n\nLet's start with n = 5 (since 2^5 - 1 = 31, which is less than 100). We'll increment n by the next prime numbers and check if 2^n - 1 is prime:\n\nn = 7: 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127 (prime)\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100 is 127."
