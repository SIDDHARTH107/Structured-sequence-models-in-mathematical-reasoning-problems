    "message_1": "Consider the surface defined by the equation z = x^2 + y^2. Find the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,2).",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2), where x = u and y = v. Then, we can compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = ||ru||^2 = ||(1, 0, 2u)||^2 = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <ru, rv> = <(1, 0, 2u), (0, 1, 2v)> = 2uv\nG = ||rv||^2 = ||(0, 1, 2v)||^2 = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nruu = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = (0, 0, 0)\nrvv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nL = <ruu, N> = <(0, 0, 2), N>\nM = <ruv, N> = <(0, 0, 0), N>\nN = <rvv, N> = <(0, 0, 2), N>\n\nTo find the normal vector N, we compute the cross product of ru and rv:\n\nN = ru × rv = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1, so the normal vector N = (-2, -2, 1). Now, we can compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <(0, 0, 2), (-2, -2, 1)> = 2\nM = <(0, 0, 0), (-2, -2, 1)> = 0\nN = <(0, 0, 2), (-2, -2, 1)> = 2\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(K - kI) = 0\nwhere K is the shape operator matrix and k is the principal curvature.\n\nThe shape operator matrix K is given by:\n\nK = | E L |^-1 | L M |\n      | F G |       | M N |\n\nK = | 1+4u^2  2uv |^-1 | 2  0 |\n      |  2uv  1+4v^2 |       | 0  2 |\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1, so:\n\nK = | 5  2 |^-1 | 2  0 |\n      | 2  5 |       | 0  2 |\n\nK = 1/21 | 5 -2 | | 2  0 |\n            | -2  5 | | 0  2 |\n\nK = | 2/7  0 |\n      |  0  2/7 |\n\nThe principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator matrix K, which in this case are k1 = 2/7 and k2 = 2/7."
