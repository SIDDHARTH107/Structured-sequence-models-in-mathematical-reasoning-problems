    "message_1": "A factory produces 500 units of a certain product per day. The manager wants to increase the production of the product by introducing a new machine. The new machine can produce 200 units of the product per day and costs $20,000. If the product is sold at $35 per unit, how many units must be produced using the new machine to cover the cost of the machine, and what would be the total profit per day?",
    "message_2": "To determine how many units must be produced using the new machine to cover the cost of the machine, we can set up the following equation:\n\nCost of machine = Number of units * Price per unit\n\n$20,000 = Number of units * $35\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of units:\n\nNumber of units = $20,000 / $35 â‰ˆ 571.43\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, we need to produce 572 units to cover the cost of the machine.\n\nNow let's calculate the total profit per day. With the new machine, the factory can produce 500 + 200 = 700 units per day. The revenue generated from selling these units is:\n\nRevenue = 700 units * $35 per unit = $24,500\n\nAssuming there are no other costs involved, the total profit per day would be $24,500."
