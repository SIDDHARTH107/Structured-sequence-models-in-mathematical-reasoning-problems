    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 centimeters and a height of 12 centimeters. What is the surface area of the cylinder? (Give your answer in square centimeters, rounded to 2 decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * r * (r + h)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, r = 5 cm and h = 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * 5 * (5 + 12)\nSurface Area = 2 * π * 5 * 17\nSurface Area = 10 * π * 17\nSurface Area ≈ 10 * 3.14 * 17\nSurface Area ≈ 534.60 square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 534.60 square centimeters, rounded to 2 decimal places."
