    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from the initial square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. \n\nLet's calculate the number of removed squares in each iteration:\n\n1. Initial square: 1 square (81x81 units)\n2. First iteration: 1 square removed (27x27 units)\n3. Second iteration: 8 squares removed (9x9 units each)\n4. Third iteration: 8^2 = 64 squares removed (3x3 units each)\n5. Fourth iteration: 8^3 = 512 squares removed (1x1 units each)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of squares removed after 4 iterations:\n\nTotal removed squares = 1 + 8 + 64 + 512 = 585\n\nSince the initial carpet has a side length of 81 units, there are 81*81 = 6561 squares (1x1 units each) in the initial carpet. To find the total number of squares present in the Sierpinski carpet after the first 4 iterations, we subtract the removed squares from the initial carpet:\n\nTotal squares present = Initial carpet squares - Total removed squares\nTotal squares present = 6561 - 585 = 5976\n\nSo, there are 5976 squares present in the Sierpinski carpet after the first 4 iterations."
