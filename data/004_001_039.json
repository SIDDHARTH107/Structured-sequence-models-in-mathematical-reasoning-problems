    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 7, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nFor the term 3x^2:\nThe derivative is (2)(3)x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\nFor the term 4x:\nThe derivative is (1)(4)x^(1-1) = 4.\n\nFor the constant term -7:\nThe derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term together:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 7 is f'(x) = 6x + 4."
