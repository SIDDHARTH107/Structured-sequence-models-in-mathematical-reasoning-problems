    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct objects into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find S(10, 4).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can find S(10, 4) by calculating the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k and then using the formula to find the desired value. Here's a table of Stirling numbers for n = 1 to 10 and k = 1 to 4:\n\nn\\k | 1       2       3       4\n-------------------------------\n1   | 1       0       0       0\n2   | 0       1       0       0\n3   | 0       1       1       0\n4   | 0       1       3       1\n5   | 0       1       7       6\n6   | 0       1      15      25\n7   | 0       1      31      90\n8   | 0       1      63     301\n9   | 0       1     127     966\n10  | 0       1     255    3025\n\nAccording to the table, S(10, 4) = 3025. Therefore, there are 3025 ways to split 10 distinct objects into 4 non-empty groups."
