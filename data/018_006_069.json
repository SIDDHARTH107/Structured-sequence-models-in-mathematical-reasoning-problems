    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of A from the universal set U:\n\nA' = U - A = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, we need to verify that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nSince A ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, which is equal to the universal set U, we have verified that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
