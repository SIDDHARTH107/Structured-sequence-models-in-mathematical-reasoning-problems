    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node D using Dijkstra's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (A) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (initially A) and mark it as visited.\n3. Update the distances to all neighboring unvisited nodes by adding the distance to the current node and the weight of the edge connecting them. If the new distance is smaller than the previous distance, update the distance.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited or the target node (D) is visited.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E}\n   Distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞\n\n2. Select node A (smallest distance), mark it as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E}\n\n3. Update distances:\n   A->B: 0 + 2.5 = 2.5\n   A->C: 0 + 3.1 = 3.1\n   Distances: A=0, B=2.5, C=3.1, D=∞, E=∞\n\n4. Select node B (smallest distance), mark it as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {C, D, E}\n\n5. Update distances:\n   B->C: 2.5 + 1.7 = 4.2 (larger than 3.1, no update)\n   B->D: 2.5 + 3.3 = 5.8\n   B->E: 2.5 + 4.5 = 7.0\n   Distances: A=0, B=2.5, C=3.1, D=5.8, E=7.0\n\n6. Select node C (smallest distance), mark it as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {D, E}\n\n7. Update distances:\n   C->D: 3.1 + 2.2 = 5.3 (smaller than 5.8, update)\n   Distances: A=0, B=2.5, C=3.1, D=5.3, E=7.0\n\n8. Select node D (smallest distance), mark it as visited.\n   Unvisited nodes: {E}\n\nSince we have visited the target node D, we can stop the algorithm. The shortest path from node A to node D is 5.3 (rounded to two decimal places)."
