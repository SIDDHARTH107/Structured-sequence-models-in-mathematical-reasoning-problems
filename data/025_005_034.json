    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety X, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 + y^3 - 3xy = 0\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\n\nPartial derivative with respect to y:\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nNow we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3y = 0\n3y^2 - 3x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\nx^2 - y = 0\ny^2 - x = 0\n\nNow, solve the system of equations:\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\ny = x^2\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n(x^2)^2 - x = 0\nx^4 - x = 0\nx(x^3 - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nFor x = 0, substitute into y = x^2:\ny = (0)^2 = 0\n\nFor x = 1, substitute into y = x^2:\ny = (1)^2 = 1\n\nSo, we have two singular points: (0, 0) and (1, 1).\n\nNow, we need to classify these singular points as either ordinary or non-ordinary. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix of the given equation and evaluate its determinant at the singular points.\n\nThe Hessian matrix H is given by:\n\nH = | ∂^2f/∂x^2  ∂^2f/∂x∂y |\n    | ∂^2f/∂y∂x  ∂^2f/∂y^2 |\n\nCompute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = 6x\n∂^2f/∂x∂y = -3\n∂^2f/∂y∂x = -3\n∂^2f/∂y^2 = 6y\n\nSo the Hessian matrix H is:\n\nH = | 6x  -3  |\n    | -3  6y |\n\nNow, compute the determinant of H:\n\ndet(H) = (6x)(6y) - (-3)(-3)\n       = 36xy - 9\n\nEvaluate the determinant at the singular points:\n\nFor (0, 0):\ndet(H) = 36(0)(0) - 9 = -9\n\nFor (1, 1):\ndet(H) = 36(1)(1) - 9 = 27\n\nA singular point is ordinary if the determinant of the Hessian matrix is non-zero, and non-ordinary if the determinant is zero.\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is non-zero for both singular points, we can conclude that both singular points (0, 0) and (1, 1) are ordinary singular points."
