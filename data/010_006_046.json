Determine the number of homotopy classes of continuous maps f: S^1 → X that induce a nontrivial element in π_1(X,x_0), where S^1 is the unit circle in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the cyclic group of order 4 as Z_4. Since X is path-connected, the fundamental group π_1(X, x_0) is well-defined and isomorphic to Z_4. We are given that π_1(X, x_0) ≅ Z_4, which has elements {0, 1, 2, 3} under addition modulo 4.\n\nNow, consider a continuous map f: S^1 → X. The induced homomorphism f*: π_1(S^1) → π_1(X) maps the fundamental group of the circle to the fundamental group of X. Since S^1 is simply connected, its fundamental group is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π_1(S^1) ≅ Z.\n\nThe induced homomorphism f* is a group homomorphism, so it must map the generator of π_1(S^1) to an element in π_1(X). The generator of π_1(S^1) is 1, so f*(1) can be any element in π_1(X). Since π_1(X) ≅ Z_4, f*(1) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the homotopy classes of continuous maps f that induce a nontrivial element in π_1(X). This means we want to exclude the case where f*(1) = 0, which corresponds to the trivial element in π_1(X).\n\nThus, there are 3 possible nontrivial elements in π_1(X) that can be induced by a continuous map f: S^1 → X, namely 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, there are 3 homotopy classes of continuous maps f: S^1 → X that induce a nontrivial element in π_1(X, x_0)."
