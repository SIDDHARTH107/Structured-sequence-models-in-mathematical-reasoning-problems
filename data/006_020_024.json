    "message_1": "Suppose there are 500 people aged between 21-30 in a community. Based on a survey, it is found that 60% of them attend social events regularly. What is the probability that at least 300 people aged 21-30 attend a social event if there is one in the community tonight?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of at least 300 people aged 21-30 attending a social event tonight, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of people (500 in this case)\n- k is the number of people attending the event (at least 300)\n- p is the probability of a person attending the event (60% or 0.6)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n\nHowever, since we want to find the probability of at least 300 people attending, we need to calculate the cumulative probability for k = 300 to k = 500.\n\nP(X >= 300) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 300 to 500\n\nCalculating this probability directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p = 500 * 0.6 = 300\nσ = √(n * p * (1-p)) = √(500 * 0.6 * 0.4) ≈ 10.95\n\nNow, we can standardize the normal distribution by calculating the z-score for k = 300:\n\nz = (k - μ) / σ = (300 - 300) / 10.95 ≈ 0\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score of 0 is 0.5. However, since we want the probability of at least 300 people attending, we need to find the probability for z-scores greater than 0:\n\nP(X >= 300) = 1 - P(X < 300) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that at least 300 people aged 21-30 attend a social event tonight is approximately 50%."
