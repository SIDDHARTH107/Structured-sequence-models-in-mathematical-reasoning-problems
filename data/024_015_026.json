    "message_2": "To find the exterior derivative of the given differential form w, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the coefficients of the form with respect to the variables x, y, and z.\n\nLet's first rewrite the differential form w as:\n\nw = A dx ∧ dy + B dy ∧ dz + C dz ∧ dx\n\nwhere A = 4x - 2yz, B = 2x^2 + 2z, and C = 6y.\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂A/∂x = 4\n∂A/∂y = -2z\n∂A/∂z = -2y\n\n∂B/∂x = 4x\n∂B/∂y = 0\n∂B/∂z = 2\n\n∂C/∂x = 0\n∂C/∂y = 6\n∂C/∂z = 0\n\nNow, we can find the exterior derivative dw:\n\ndw = (∂A/∂z - ∂C/∂y) dz ∧ dx ∧ dy + (∂C/∂x - ∂B/∂z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz + (∂B/∂y - ∂A/∂x) dy ∧ dz ∧ dx\n\ndw = (-2y - 6) dz ∧ dx ∧ dy + (0 - 2) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz + (0 - 4) dy ∧ dz ∧ dx\n\nNow, let's evaluate dw at the point (1, 2, √2):\n\ndw = (-2(2) - 6) dz ∧ dx ∧ dy + (0 - 2) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz + (0 - 4) dy ∧ dz ∧ dx\ndw = (-10) dz ∧ dx ∧ dy - 2 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz - 4 dy ∧ dz ∧ dx\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the differential form w at the point (1, 2, √2) is:\n\ndw = -10 dz ∧ dx ∧ dy - 2 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz - 4 dy ∧ dz ∧ dx"
