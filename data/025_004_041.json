    "message_2": "To find all rational points on the elliptic curve, we can first transform the curve into the Weierstrass form. We can do this by setting $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$Y^2Z = X^3 - XZ^3$.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $Z^3$ to get:\n\n$(Y/Z)^2 = (X/Z)^3 - (X/Z)$.\n\nLet $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$. Then, we have:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - x$.\n\nThis is the Weierstrass form of the elliptic curve. Now, we can use the group law on elliptic curves to find all rational points. The group law states that given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, there exists a third point $R = (x_3, y_3)$ on the curve such that $P + Q = R$. The coordinates of $R$ are given by:\n\n$x_3 = \\frac{(y_2 - y_1)^2}{(x_2 - x_1)^2} - x_1 - x_2$,\n\n$y_3 = \\frac{(y_2 - y_1)(x_1 - x_3) - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n\nWe can start with the point $P = (0, 0)$, which is on the curve since $0^2 = 0^3 - 0$. Then, we can find other rational points by adding $P$ to itself using the group law. For example, let $Q = (1, 0)$, which is also on the curve since $0^2 = 1^3 - 1$. Then, we can compute $R = P + Q$:\n\n$x_3 = \\frac{(0 - 0)^2}{(1 - 0)^2} - 0 - 1 = -1$,\n\n$y_3 = \\frac{(0 - 0)(0 - (-1)) - 0}{1 - 0} = 0$.\n\nSo, $R = (-1, 0)$ is another rational point on the curve. We can continue this process to find more rational points on the curve.\n\nHowever, finding all rational points on an elliptic curve is a difficult problem in general. In this case, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. This means that there exists a finite set of points $P_1, P_2, ..., P_n$ such that every rational point on the curve can be written as a sum of these points.\n\nIn our case, the curve has rank 1, which means that there is only one independent point generating the group of rational points. This point is $P = (0, 0)$. Therefore, all rational points on the curve can be obtained by adding $P$ to itself a certain number of times using the group law.\n\nIn conclusion, finding all rational points on the given elliptic curve is a difficult problem, but we can use the group law and the Mordell-Weil theorem to find some of them. The curve has rank 1, so all rational points can be obtained by adding the point $P = (0, 0)$ to itself using the group law."
