    "message_1": "A store has only four items for sale - item A, B, C, and D. The prices of these items are $10, $20, $30, and $40 respectively. A customer has a budget of $60 and wants to buy as many items as possible. However, the customer can only carry a maximum weight of 6 units. The weights of the items are 2, 3, 4, and 5 units respectively. What is the maximum number of items the customer can buy?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of items the customer can buy, we need to consider both the budget and the weight constraint. Let's first list down the items with their prices and weights:\n\nItem A: $10, 2 units\nItem B: $20, 3 units\nItem C: $30, 4 units\nItem D: $40, 5 units\n\nNow, let's try different combinations of items to see which ones fit within the budget and weight constraints:\n\n1. One of each item A, B, C, and D: Total cost = $100, total weight = 14 units (exceeds both budget and weight constraints)\n2. Two of item A and one of item B: Total cost = $10*2 + $20 = $40, total weight = 2*2 + 3 = 7 units (exceeds weight constraint)\n3. One of item A and two of item B: Total cost = $10 + $20*2 = $50, total weight = 2 + 3*2 = 8 units (exceeds weight constraint)\n4. One of item A and one of item B: Total cost = $10 + $20 = $30, total weight = 2 + 3 = 5 units (fits within both budget and weight constraints)\n5. One of item A and one of item C: Total cost = $10 + $30 = $40, total weight = 2 + 4 = 6 units (fits within both budget and weight constraints)\n6. One of item B and one of item C: Total cost = $20 + $30 = $50, total weight = 3 + 4 = 7 units (exceeds weight constraint)\n\nFrom the above combinations, the maximum number of items the customer can buy is 2 items. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. One of item A and one of item B (total cost $30, total weight 5 units)\n2. One of item A and one of item C (total cost $40, total weight 6 units)\n\nSince the customer wants to buy as many items as possible, they should choose the combination of one item A and one item B, which costs $30 and has a total weight of 5 units."
