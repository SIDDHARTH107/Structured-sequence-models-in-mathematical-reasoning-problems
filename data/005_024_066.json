    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Data mining:\n\nIn a survey of 100 college students, 60% have a laptop, 30% have a desktop computer, and 10% have a tablet. What is the probability that a student selected at random has either a laptop or a tablet?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a student selected at random has either a laptop or a tablet, we can simply add the individual probabilities of having a laptop and having a tablet.\n\nProbability of having a laptop = 60% = 0.6\nProbability of having a tablet = 10% = 0.1\n\nProbability of having either a laptop or a tablet = Probability of having a laptop + Probability of having a tablet\n= 0.6 + 0.1\n= 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that a student selected at random has either a laptop or a tablet is 0.7 or 70%."
