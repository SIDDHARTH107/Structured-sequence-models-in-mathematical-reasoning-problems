    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players A and B in a game who want to coordinate their actions. They can either choose strategy X or strategy Y. If they both choose the same strategy, they will earn a payoff of 10. If they choose different strategies, they will earn a payoff of -5. Before making their choices, they can engage in \"cheap talk\" to communicate with each other. What is the probability that they will both choose strategy X if they can communicate perfectly?",
    "message_2": "Since the players can communicate perfectly, they will be able to coordinate their actions to choose the same strategy and maximize their payoff. However, the problem does not specify any preference for strategy X or strategy Y. Therefore, we can assume that the players are equally likely to choose either strategy.\n\nThe probability that both players choose strategy X is 1/2 (since there are two strategies, X and Y, and they are equally likely to choose either). So, the probability that they will both choose strategy X is 1/2 or 50%."
