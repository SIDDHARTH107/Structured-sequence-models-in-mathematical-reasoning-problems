    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 on a fair six-sided dice, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 5) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 5) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 is:\n\nP(3 or 5) = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 on a fair six-sided dice is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)."
