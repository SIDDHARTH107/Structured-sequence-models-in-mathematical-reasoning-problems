    "message_2": "The Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of the Koch Island after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 10 cm, the number of sides is 3 (since it's an equilateral triangle), and we want to find the perimeter after the 5th iteration (n = 5).\n\nPerimeter = 10 * 3 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter = 30 * (1024/243)\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 30 * 4.214\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch Island after the 5th iteration is approximately 126.42 cm."
