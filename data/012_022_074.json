    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph of order R (i.e., having R vertices) with its edges colored either red or blue will contain either a red subgraph of order m or a blue subgraph of order n.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the Ramsey number R(3, 4), which means we want to find the smallest integer R such that any graph of order R with its edges colored either red or blue will contain either a red triangle (a complete subgraph of order 3) or a blue complete subgraph of order 4.\n\nThe Ramsey number R(3, 4) is known to be 9. This means that in any graph with 9 vertices and its edges colored either red or blue, there will always be either a red triangle or a blue complete subgraph of order 4."
