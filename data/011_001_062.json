    "message_1": "How many different 7-letter words can be formed using the letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS\" if each letter can only be used once?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 letters from the 14 letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS\" and then arrange them. However, since some letters are repeated, we need to account for these repetitions.\n\nThe word \"COMBINATORICS\" has the following letter counts:\nC - 2\nO - 2\nM - 1\nB - 1\nI - 2\nN - 1\nA - 1\nT - 1\nR - 1\nS - 1\n\nFirst, we need to choose 7 letters from these 10 distinct letters (C, O, M, B, I, N, A, T, R, S). We can do this using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nHere, n = 10 (total distinct letters) and r = 7 (number of letters we want to choose).\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!(10-7)!) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120\n\nNow, we need to account for the repetitions of the letters C, O, and I. We can do this by using the multinomial coefficient formula:\n\nMultinomial(n1, n2, ..., nk) = (n1 + n2 + ... + nk)! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nFor the repetitions of C, O, and I, we have the following cases:\n\n1. One C, one O, and one I are used: Multinomial(1, 1, 1) = (1+1+1)! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 6\n2. Two C's are used: Multinomial(2) = (2)! / (2!) = 1\n3. Two O's are used: Multinomial(2) = (2)! / (2!) = 1\n4. Two I's are used: Multinomial(2) = (2)! / (2!) = 1\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 7 letters (120) by the number of ways to arrange the repeated letters (6+1+1+1 = 9).\n\nTotal 7-letter words = 120 * 9 = 1080\n\nSo, there are 1080 different 7-letter words that can be formed using the letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS\" if each letter can only be used once."
