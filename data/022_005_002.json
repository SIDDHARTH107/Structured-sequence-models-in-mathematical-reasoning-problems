    "message_2": "To find the residue at the pole $z=2i$, we first need to factor the denominator of the function $f(z)$.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic equation: $z^2 + 4z + 13$. We can use the quadratic formula to find its roots:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 13$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 52}}{2}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-36}}{2}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm 6i}{2}$$\n\nThe roots are $z = -2 + 3i$ and $z = -2 - 3i$. The pole we are interested in is $z = 2i$, which is not a root of the denominator. Therefore, the function $f(z)$ does not have a pole at $z = 2i$, and the residue is 0."
