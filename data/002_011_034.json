    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that is 12 cm and the hypotenuse is 15 cm. What is the length of the other leg using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). The formula is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nIn this problem, we are given one leg (a = 12 cm) and the hypotenuse (c = 15 cm), and we need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the equation:\n\n12² + b² = 15²\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\n144 + b² = 225\n\nSubtract 144 from both sides:\n\nb² = 81\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √81\n\nb = 9\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 9 cm."
