    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 1  2  1 | 0 |\n| 2 -1  1 | 0 |\n| 3  4  3 | 0 |\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 2:\n| 1  2  1 | 0 |\n| 0 -5 -1 | 0 |\n| 3  4  3 | 0 |\n\n2. Subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3:\n| 1  2  1 | 0 |\n| 0 -5 -1 | 0 |\n| 0 -2  0 | 0 |\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by -5:\n| 1  2  1 | 0 |\n| 0  1  1/5 | 0 |\n| 0 -2  0 | 0 |\n\n4. Add 2 times Row 2 to Row 3:\n| 1  2  1 | 0 |\n| 0  1  1/5 | 0 |\n| 0  0  2/5 | 0 |\n\n5. Multiply Row 3 by 5/2:\n| 1  2  1 | 0 |\n| 0  1  1/5 | 0 |\n| 0  0  1 | 0 |\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nFrom the third equation, we have z = 0.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have y + 1/5 * 0 = 0, which implies y = 0.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have x + 2 * 0 + 0 = 0, which implies x = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to this homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
