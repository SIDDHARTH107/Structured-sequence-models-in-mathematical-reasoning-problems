    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B. The symmetric difference A∆B is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA∆B = {3, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of sets B and A. The symmetric difference B∆A is the set of elements that are in either B or A, but not in both.\n\nB∆A = {3, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A∆B and B∆A. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA∆B ∩ B∆A = {3, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B∆A and A∆B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nB∆A ∩ A∆B = {3, 7}\n\nAs we can see, A∆B ∩ B∆A = B∆A ∩ A∆B = {3, 7}. This means that the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to intersection, contrary to the original statement. The original statement is incorrect."
