    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph:\n\nCut vertices: Vertex 3 is a cut vertex. If we remove vertex 3, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2} and {4, 5}.\n\nBridges: There are no bridges in this graph. Removing any single edge will not increase the number of connected components."
