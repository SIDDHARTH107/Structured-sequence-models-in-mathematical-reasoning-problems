    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C20, D10, or a non-abelian group of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, note that the order of G is 20 = 2^2 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups (n_5) must divide 2^2 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (n_2) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is unique, it is normal in G. Now, consider the cases for the 2-Sylow subgroups.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nLet Q be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since Q is unique, it is normal in G. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 20. Thus, PQ = G, and G is a semi-direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are cyclic of prime order, they are abelian, and their semi-direct product is also abelian. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIn this case, there are five 2-Sylow subgroups. Let Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_5 be these subgroups. Since the index of the 2-Sylow subgroups is 5, which is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, at least one of these subgroups is normal in G (by a corollary of the Sylow theorems). Without loss of generality, assume Q_1 is normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the semi-direct product of P and Q_1. Since P and Q_1 are both normal in G, their product PQ_1 is also normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q_1 are relatively prime, |PQ_1| = |P| * |Q_1| = 20. Thus, PQ_1 = G, and G is a semi-direct product of P and Q_1. Since P is abelian and Q_1 is a subgroup of order 4, Q_1 is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If Q_1 is isomorphic to C4, the semi-direct product is abelian, and G is isomorphic to C20. If Q_1 is isomorphic to V4, the semi-direct product is non-abelian, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20 or the dihedral group D10, depending on the structure of its 2-Sylow subgroups. There is no non-abelian group of order 20 other than D10, so G cannot be isomorphic to any other non-abelian group of order 20."
