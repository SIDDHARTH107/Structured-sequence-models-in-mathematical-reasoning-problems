    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the symmetric difference of A and B using this Cartesian product. Show that the two expressions obtained by exchanging A and B in the symmetric difference operation are not equal.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B using this Cartesian product. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's exchange A and B in the symmetric difference operation:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nB Δ A = {1, 4}\n\nAs we can see, the expressions obtained by exchanging A and B in the symmetric difference operation are equal:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4} = B Δ A\n\nNote that the Cartesian product was not used in finding the symmetric difference, as it is not relevant to the symmetric difference operation. The Cartesian product is used to find all possible combinations of elements from two sets, while the symmetric difference is used to find the elements that are unique to each set."
