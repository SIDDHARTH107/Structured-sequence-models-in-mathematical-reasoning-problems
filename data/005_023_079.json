    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Outlier Detection:\n\nThe following data represents the ages of 10 students in a classroom: 12, 14, 13, 10, 15, 16, 18, 17, 14, 11. Find the outliers present in the data using the 1.5 × IQR (Interquartile Range) method.",
    "message_2": "To find the outliers using the 1.5 × IQR method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\n2. Find the median (Q2): (14 + 14) / 2 = 14\n3. Find the lower quartile (Q1): Median of the lower half of the data (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) = 12\n4. Find the upper quartile (Q3): Median of the upper half of the data (14, 15, 16, 17, 18) = 16\n5. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR): Q3 - Q1 = 16 - 12 = 4\n6. Calculate the lower bound: Q1 - 1.5 × IQR = 12 - 1.5 × 4 = 12 - 6 = 6\n7. Calculate the upper bound: Q3 + 1.5 × IQR = 16 + 1.5 × 4 = 16 + 6 = 22\n8. Identify the outliers: Any data points below the lower bound or above the upper bound are considered outliers. In this case, there are no data points below 6 or above 22.\n\nTherefore, there are no outliers in the given data using the 1.5 × IQR method."
