    "message_2": "To determine if f is continuous, we need to check the continuity of f at every point in the set S. We can break this down into three cases:\n\n1. x < 0: In this case, f(x) = x^2, which is a continuous function for all x in the real numbers. Therefore, f is continuous for all x in the interval (-2, 0).\n\n2. x > 0: In this case, f(x) = 2x, which is also a continuous function for all x in the real numbers. Therefore, f is continuous for all x in the interval (0, 2).\n\n3. x = 0: To check the continuity of f at x = 0, we need to check if the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are equal to the function value at x = 0.\n\nThe left-hand limit as x approaches 0 is given by the limit of the function x^2 as x approaches 0 from the left:\nlim (x -> 0-) x^2 = 0\n\nThe right-hand limit as x approaches 0 is given by the limit of the function 2x as x approaches 0 from the right:\nlim (x -> 0+) 2x = 0\n\nThe function value at x = 0 is given by f(0) = 2(0) = 0.\n\nSince the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and the function value at x = 0 are all equal to 0, f is continuous at x = 0.\n\nSince f is continuous for all x in the intervals (-2, 0), (0, 2), and at x = 0, we can conclude that f is continuous on the set S = {x ∈ R | -2 ≤ x ≤ 2}."
