    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we first need to find the largest side, which is already given as 10 cm. The smallest angle will be opposite to the largest side. Now, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle opposite to the 10 cm side.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite to side c. In our case, a = 5 cm, b = 8 cm, and c = 10 cm. We want to find angle C.\n\n10² = 5² + 8² - 2 * 5 * 8 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 25 + 64 - 80 * cos(C)\n\n11 = -80 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = -11/80\n\nNow, we can use the inverse cosine function to find the angle C:\n\nC = arccos(-11/80)\n\nC ≈ 97.41°\n\nNow that we have found the largest angle, we can use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles. The Law of Sines states:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe already know the side lengths and angle C, so we can find angles A and B:\n\n5/sin(A) = 10/sin(97.41°)\n\nsin(A) = 5 * sin(97.41°) / 10\n\nsin(A) ≈ 0.499\n\nA = arcsin(0.499)\n\nA ≈ 30.06°\n\nNow, we can find angle B using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nB = 180° - 97.41° - 30.06°\n\nB ≈ 52.53°\n\nThe smallest angle in the triangle is angle A, which is approximately 30.06°."
