    "message_2": "The forward difference approximation for the first derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h is the step size.\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 1, and we want to estimate the first derivative at x = 2 with a step size of h = 0.01.\n\nFirst, let's find f(2):\n\nf(2) = 2(2)^2 + 4(2) + 1 = 2(4) + 8 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17\n\nNow, let's find f(2 + 0.01):\n\nf(2.01) = 2(2.01)^2 + 4(2.01) + 1 ≈ 2(4.0801) + 8.04 + 1 ≈ 8.1602 + 8.04 + 1 ≈ 17.2002\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference approximation formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.01) - f(2)) / 0.01 ≈ (17.2002 - 17) / 0.01 ≈ 0.2002 / 0.01 ≈ 20.02\n\nSo, the estimated first derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 1 at x = 2 using the forward difference approximation with a step size of h = 0.01 is approximately 20.02."
