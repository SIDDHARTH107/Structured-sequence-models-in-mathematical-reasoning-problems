It's possible that the message was encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a forward shift of 3 instead of a reverse shift. Let's try decrypting it with a forward shift of 3:\n\nThe encrypted message is: \"EB GUR FNJ QBJA GUR EBNQ\"\n\nDecrypting each letter by shifting 3 positions forward in the alphabet, we get the following message:\n\n\"DA FTO EMH PAIZ FTO DAMZ\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. It's possible that the message was encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a backward shift of 3 instead of a forward shift. Let's try decrypting it with a backward shift of 3:\n\nThe encrypted message is: \"EB GUR FNJ QBJA GUR EBNQ\"\n\nDecrypting each letter by shifting 3 positions backward in the alphabet, we get the following message:\n\n\"AX DSQ FLI OXHY DSQ CZKP\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. It's possible that the message was encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, but the alphabet is reversed. Let's try decrypting it with a reversed alphabet and a shift of 3:\n\nThe encrypted message is: \"EB GUR FNJ QBJA GUR EBNQ\"\n\nDecrypting each letter by shifting 3 positions in the reversed alphabet, we get the following message:\n\n\"AT THE END DOWN THE ROAD\"\n\nThis message makes sense, so the decryption key for the given message is a simple substitution cipher with a shift of 3 in the reversed alphabet."
