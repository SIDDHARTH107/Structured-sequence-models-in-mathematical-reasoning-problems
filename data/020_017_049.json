    "message_2": "To find the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x, we can use the method of completing the square or take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.\n\nMethod 1: Completing the square\nf(x) = x^2 - 4x\nf(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4\nf(x) = (x - 2)^2 - 4\n\nNow, we can see that the function is a perfect square minus a constant. The minimum value of a square is 0, so the minimum value of f(x) occurs when (x - 2)^2 = 0. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx - 2 = 0\nx = 2\n\nMethod 2: Taking the derivative\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 4x)\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSo, the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x is x = 2."
