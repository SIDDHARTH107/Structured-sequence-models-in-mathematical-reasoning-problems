    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need to consider the chromatic number of the graph. The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFor a graph with 7 vertices, the chromatic number depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, which is 7.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not a complete graph, the chromatic number could be lower. For example, if the graph is a cycle with an odd number of vertices (such as 7), the chromatic number is 3. If the graph is a tree, the chromatic number is at most 2.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact chromatic number. However, we can say that the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is between 2 and 7, inclusive."
