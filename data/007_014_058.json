    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, and 3. The next perfect number is 28, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.\n\nNow, let's check if 28 is divisible by both 7 and 11. \n\n28 ÷ 7 = 4 (remainder 0)\n28 ÷ 11 = 2 (remainder 6)\n\n28 is divisible by 7, but not by 11. \n\nThe next perfect number is 496. Let's check if it is divisible by both 7 and 11.\n\n496 ÷ 7 = 70 (remainder 6)\n496 ÷ 11 = 45 (remainder 1)\n\n496 is not divisible by either 7 or 11.\n\nThe next perfect number is 8128. Let's check if it is divisible by both 7 and 11.\n\n8128 ÷ 7 = 1162 (remainder 2)\n8128 ÷ 11 = 739 (remainder 1)\n\n8128 is not divisible by either 7 or 11.\n\nPerfect numbers are quite rare, and it is not guaranteed that there is a perfect number divisible by both 7 and 11. In fact, all known even perfect numbers can be written in the form 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This form does not guarantee divisibility by 7 and 11. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the smallest perfect number that is divisible by both 7 and 11 with the current knowledge of perfect numbers."
