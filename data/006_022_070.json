    "message_1": "In a certain school of 700 students, 320 students are enrolled in a program that includes an internship. If two students are randomly selected from this school, what is the probability that both of them are enrolled in the internship program?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that both students are enrolled in the internship program, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when selecting two students from the school. This can be found using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (700) and k is the number of students we are selecting (2).\n\nC(700, 2) = 700! / (2!(700-2)!)\nC(700, 2) = 700! / (2! * 698!)\nC(700, 2) = (700 * 699) / (2 * 1)\nC(700, 2) = 244650\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to select two students enrolled in the internship program. There are 320 students enrolled in the program, so we can use the combination formula again:\n\nC(320, 2) = 320! / (2!(320-2)!)\nC(320, 2) = 320! / (2! * 318!)\nC(320, 2) = (320 * 319) / (2 * 1)\nC(320, 2) = 51040\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 51040 / 244650\nProbability â‰ˆ 0.2085\n\nSo, the probability that both students are enrolled in the internship program is approximately 0.2085 or 20.85%."
