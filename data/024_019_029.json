    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface to its topological properties. For a closed surface like a sphere, the theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the entire surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ of the surface:\n\n∫∫ K dA = 2πχ\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic χ is 2. Therefore, the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere is:\n\n∫∫ K dA = 2π(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the Gaussian curvature K for a sphere. The Gaussian curvature of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nK = 1/r^2\n\nIn our case, the radius r is 5 cm. So, the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = 1/(5^2) = 1/25 cm^(-2)\n\nNow, we can find the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere by integrating K over the entire surface:\n\n∫∫ K dA = (1/25) ∫∫ dA\n\nTo find the total Gaussian curvature, we need to find the surface area of the sphere. The surface area A of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nA = 4πr^2\n\nFor our sphere with radius 5 cm, the surface area is:\n\nA = 4π(5^2) = 100π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total Gaussian curvature by multiplying the Gaussian curvature K by the surface area A:\n\n∫∫ K dA = (1/25) * (100π) = 4π\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere is 4π."
