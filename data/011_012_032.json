    "message_1": "A student is arranging a bookshelf and has 8 books on combinatorics and 10 books on algebra. If the student wants to place 4 books on combinatorics and 5 books on algebra side-by-side, how many ways can this be done if no two books on combinatorics can be placed next to each other? Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we first count the total number of ways to arrange the books without any restrictions, and then subtract the number of ways that violate the condition that no two combinatorics books can be next to each other.\n\nStep 1: Total number of ways to arrange the books without any restrictions\nThere are 8 books on combinatorics and 10 books on algebra, so there are 8! ways to arrange the combinatorics books and 10! ways to arrange the algebra books. Since the student wants to place 4 books on combinatorics and 5 books on algebra side-by-side, there are C(8,4) ways to choose 4 combinatorics books and C(10,5) ways to choose 5 algebra books. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the books without any restrictions is:\n\nC(8,4) * C(10,5) * 4! * 5! = (70) * (252) * (24) * (120)\n\nStep 2: Subtract the number of ways that violate the condition\nTo count the number of ways that violate the condition, we can think of the 4 combinatorics books as a single unit. There are 6 \"gaps\" between the 5 algebra books, and we need to place the 4 combinatorics books in these gaps. This can be done in C(6,4) ways. Now, we need to arrange the combinatorics books within this unit, which can be done in 4! ways. So, the number of ways that violate the condition is:\n\nC(6,4) * 4! = (15) * (24)\n\nStep 3: Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of ways to arrange the books such that no two combinatorics books are next to each other is:\n\nTotal ways - Violating ways = (70 * 252 * 24 * 120) - (15 * 24)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n= 24 * (70 * 252 * 120 - 15)\n= 24 * (2116800 - 15)\n= 24 * 2116785\n= 50,802,840\n\nSo, there are 50,802,840 ways to arrange the books such that no two combinatorics books are next to each other."
