    "message_2": "The total length of the dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length of line segment) * (2^(n/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial length of the line segment is 1, and we want to find the total length after the 10th iteration. So, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\n\nLength = 1 * 32\n\nLength = 32\n\nSo, the total length of the dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 32."
