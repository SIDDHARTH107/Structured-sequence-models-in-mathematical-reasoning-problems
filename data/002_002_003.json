    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius of 4 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (4³)\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (64)\n\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 64\n\nV = 268.082573106329\n\nTherefore, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 4 cm is approximately 268.08 cubic centimeters."
