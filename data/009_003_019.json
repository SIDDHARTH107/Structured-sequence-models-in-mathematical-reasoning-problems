    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example question for a math student studying Heat transfer and diffusion equations:\n\nA metal plate of thickness 1 cm has a thermal diffusivity of 0.001 m²/s. At time t=0, the temperature at the surface of the plate is 200°C but the temperature at the opposite surface of the plate is maintained at 100°C. Find the temperature at the center of the plate at a time t=10 seconds assuming that the temperature distribution in the plate can be modeled by a one-dimensional diffusion equation with constant coefficients.\n\n(Note: You can adjust the values and units as per your preference, but make sure they are in line with the subject and subtopic.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional diffusion equation with constant coefficients, which is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T_initial + (T_surface - T_initial) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(alpha * t)))\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, T_initial is the initial temperature, T_surface is the surface temperature, alpha is the thermal diffusivity, and erf is the error function.\n\nGiven the problem parameters:\n- Thickness of the plate: 1 cm = 0.01 m\n- Thermal diffusivity (alpha): 0.001 m²/s\n- Surface temperature (T_surface): 200°C\n- Opposite surface temperature (T_initial): 100°C\n- Time (t): 10 seconds\n\nWe want to find the temperature at the center of the plate, which is at x = 0.005 m (half of the thickness). Plugging the values into the equation, we get:\n\nT(0.005, 10) = 100 + (200 - 100) * erf(0.005 / (2 * sqrt(0.001 * 10)))\n\nT(0.005, 10) = 100 + 100 * erf(0.005 / (2 * sqrt(0.01)))\n\nT(0.005, 10) = 100 + 100 * erf(0.005 / 0.02)\n\nT(0.005, 10) = 100 + 100 * erf(0.25)\n\nUsing a calculator or a table of error function values, we find that erf(0.25) ≈ 0.2763.\n\nT(0.005, 10) = 100 + 100 * 0.2763\n\nT(0.005, 10) ≈ 100 + 27.63\n\nT(0.005, 10) ≈ 127.63°C\n\nSo, the temperature at the center of the plate at t = 10 seconds is approximately 127.63°C."
