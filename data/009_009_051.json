    "message_2": "For a particle in a one-dimensional box with a potential energy function V(x) = 0, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n-(h^2)/(8m)*(d^2/dx^2)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nThe solutions to this equation are well-known and given by:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(n * π * x / L)\n\nwhere L is the length of the box, n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), and the corresponding energy levels are:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nFor the ground state, we have n = 1. Given the mass of the particle m = 6.64 x 10^-27 kg and the length of the box L = 2 nm = 2 x 10^-9 m, we can calculate the ground state energy E_1:\n\nE_1 = (1^2 * π^2 * (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s)^2) / (8 * (6.64 x 10^-27 kg) * (2 x 10^-9 m)^2)\n\nE_1 ≈ 9.47 x 10^-20 J\n\nSo the energy of the ground state of the particle is approximately 9.47 x 10^-20 Joules."
