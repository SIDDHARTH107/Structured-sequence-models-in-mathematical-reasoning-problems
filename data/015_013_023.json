    "message_2": "To find the steady-state solution (equilibria) of the logistic equation x_{n+1} = r * x_n * (1 - x_n), we need to find the values of x_n for which x_{n+1} = x_n. In other words, we need to find the fixed points of the equation.\n\nLet's set x_{n+1} = x_n = x and substitute it into the equation:\n\nx = 3.5 * x * (1 - x)\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x:\n\nx - 3.5 * x^2 + 3.5 * x^3 = 0\n\nWe can factor out x:\n\nx * (1 - 3.5 * x + 3.5 * x^2) = 0\n\nThis equation has three solutions:\n\n1. x = 0\n2. x = 1/2\n3. x = 2/3\n\nHowever, since the logistic equation is defined for x in the interval [0, 1], only the first two solutions are valid:\n\n1. x = 0\n2. x = 1/2\n\nSo, the steady-state solutions (equilibria) of the logistic equation x_{n+1} = 3.5 * x_n * (1 - x_n) are x = 0 and x = 1/2."
