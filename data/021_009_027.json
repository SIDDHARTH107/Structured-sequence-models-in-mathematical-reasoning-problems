    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a student to solve:\n\nA company's profit function is given by: \n\nP(x,y) = 500x - 10x^2 + 50xy - 2y^2 - 100y\n\nwhere x is the number of units of product X produced and y is the number of units of product Y produced. \n\nUsing the gradient descent method, determine the optimal values of x and y that will maximize the company's profit. Use an initial guess of (x,y) = (2,2) and a learning rate of 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the profit function with respect to x and y:\n\n∂P/∂x = 500 - 20x + 50y\n∂P/∂y = 50x - 4y - 100\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method with an initial guess of (x, y) = (2, 2) and a learning rate of 0.01. We will update the values of x and y using the following formulas:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * ∂P/∂x\ny_new = y_old - learning_rate * ∂P/∂y\n\nWe will iterate this process until the change in x and y is very small, indicating that we have reached the optimal values.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 2 - 0.01 * (500 - 20*2 + 50*2) = 2 - 0.01 * 480 = 2 - 4.8 = -2.8\ny1 = 2 - 0.01 * (50*2 - 4*2 - 100) = 2 - 0.01 * 0 = 2\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = -2.8 - 0.01 * (500 - 20*(-2.8) + 50*2) = -2.8 - 0.01 * 1160 = -2.8 - 11.6 = -14.4\ny2 = 2 - 0.01 * (50*(-2.8) - 4*2 - 100) = 2 - 0.01 * (-240) = 2 + 2.4 = 4.4\n\nWe can continue this process for several iterations. However, gradient descent can be sensitive to the learning rate and initial guess, and it may not converge to the optimal solution in some cases. In this case, it seems that the values of x and y are diverging, which indicates that the learning rate might be too large or the initial guess is not suitable.\n\nTo find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the company's profit, it would be better to use a more advanced optimization method, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a quasi-Newton method like BFGS. These methods are more robust and can handle non-convex functions better than gradient descent."
