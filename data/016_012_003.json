    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it passes through every point in a square. However, the problem states that the curve passes 4 times through each side of the square. This means that the curve is not a true Peano curve, but rather a modified version of it.\n\nTo find the total length of the curve, we can consider the length of the curve on each side of the square and multiply it by the number of sides.\n\nSince the curve passes 4 times through each side of the square, and the side length of the square is 1 unit, the length of the curve on each side is 4 units.\n\nThere are 4 sides in a square, so the total length of the curve is:\n\n4 (sides) * 4 (units per side) = 16 units."
