    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is created by recursively subdividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the central square at each iteration. After the first 5 iterations, the number of holes can be calculated using the formula:\n\nholes = (8^n) - 1\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor 5 iterations:\n\nholes = (8^5) - 1\nholes = 32768 - 1\nholes = 32,767\n\nThere are 32,767 holes in the Sierpinski carpet fractal after the first 5 iterations."
