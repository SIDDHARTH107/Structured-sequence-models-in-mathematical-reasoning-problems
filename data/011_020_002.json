    "message_2": "To form a team of 5 members with at least 2 developers and 2 testers, we can have the following combinations:\n\n1. 3 developers and 2 testers\n2. 2 developers and 3 testers\n\nWe will calculate the number of ways to form a team for each combination and then add them together.\n\n1. 3 developers and 2 testers:\nWe have 6 developers and need to choose 3, which can be done in C(6,3) ways. (C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.)\nWe have 4 testers and need to choose 2, which can be done in C(4,2) ways.\nSo, the number of ways to form a team with 3 developers and 2 testers is C(6,3) * C(4,2).\n\n2. 2 developers and 3 testers:\nWe have 6 developers and need to choose 2, which can be done in C(6,2) ways.\nWe have 4 testers and need to choose 3, which can be done in C(4,3) ways.\nSo, the number of ways to form a team with 2 developers and 3 testers is C(6,2) * C(4,3).\n\nNow, we will add the number of ways for both combinations:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(6,3) * C(4,2) + C(6,2) * C(4,3)\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes the factorial:\n\nC(6,3) = 6! / (3!3!) = 20\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2!2!) = 6\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2!4!) = 15\nC(4,3) = 4! / (3!1!) = 4\n\nTotal number of ways = (20 * 6) + (15 * 4) = 120 + 60 = 180\n\nSo, there are 180 ways to form a team of 5 members with at least 2 developers and 2 testers."
