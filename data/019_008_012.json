    "message_1": "A factory produces widgets that are labeled as \"good\" or \"defective\". A widget is considered \"good\" if it passes a quality test with a score of at least 70. Suppose the factory produces 1000 widgets and tests show that 650 are considered \"good\" by traditional logic, while fuzzy logic shows that 780 widgets have a quality score of at least 0.65. What percentage of widgets are considered \"good\" according to traditional logic? What percentage are considered \"good\" according to fuzzy logic?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of widgets considered \"good\" according to traditional logic, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of good widgets / Total number of widgets) * 100\n\nFor traditional logic:\nPercentage = (650 / 1000) * 100 = 65%\n\nFor fuzzy logic:\nPercentage = (780 / 1000) * 100 = 78%\n\nSo, according to traditional logic, 65% of widgets are considered \"good\", while according to fuzzy logic, 78% of widgets are considered \"good\"."
