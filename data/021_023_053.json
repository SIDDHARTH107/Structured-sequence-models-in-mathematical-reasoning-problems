    "message_2": "To solve the optimization problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of grey wolves (search agents) and their positions in the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each search agent.\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the three best search agents).\n4. Update the positions of the other search agents based on the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nFor this problem, let's assume we have 10 search agents and a maximum of 100 iterations. Here's a simplified version of the GWO algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the positions of the 10 search agents randomly in the search space (e.g., between -10 and 10).\n2. Calculate the fitness of each search agent using the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6.\n3. Identify the alpha, beta, and delta wolves as the search agents with the best (lowest), second-best, and third-best fitness values, respectively.\n4. Update the positions of the other search agents using the following equations:\n\n    X_new = X_old - A * D_alpha + A * D_beta + A * D_delta\n\n    where A is a random number between 0 and 1, and D_alpha, D_beta, and D_delta are the distances between the current search agent and the alpha, beta, and delta wolves, respectively.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 100 iterations.\n\nAfter 100 iterations, the position of the alpha wolf should be close to the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6. Note that the GWO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, so the solution might not be the exact minimum value, but it should be a good approximation."
