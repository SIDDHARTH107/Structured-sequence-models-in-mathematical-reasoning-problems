    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means that it fills the entire 2D space within a square. In this case, we are asked to find the length of the Peano curve of order 3.\n\nFor the Peano curve, the length of the curve at each iteration is multiplied by a factor of 3. This is because the curve is divided into 9 smaller copies of itself, and each copy has 1/3 the length of the previous iteration.\n\nLet's denote the length of the initial curve (order 0) as L0. Then, the length of the curve at order 1 (L1) would be 3 times the length of the initial curve:\n\nL1 = 3 * L0\n\nSimilarly, the length of the curve at order 2 (L2) would be 3 times the length of the curve at order 1:\n\nL2 = 3 * L1 = 3 * (3 * L0) = 3^2 * L0\n\nNow, we can find the length of the Peano curve at order 3 (L3):\n\nL3 = 3 * L2 = 3 * (3^2 * L0) = 3^3 * L0\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve of order 3 is 3^3 times the length of the initial curve (L0). However, without knowing the length of the initial curve (L0), we cannot determine the exact length of the Peano curve of order 3."
