    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length × width): 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm². Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 2 × 50 cm² = 100 cm².\n2. The area of another pair of opposite faces (length × height): 10 cm × 3 cm = 30 cm². Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 2 × 30 cm² = 60 cm².\n3. The area of the last pair of opposite faces (width × height): 5 cm × 3 cm = 15 cm². Since there are 2 of these faces, their total area is 2 × 15 cm² = 30 cm².\n\nNow, add the total areas of all three pairs of faces: 100 cm² + 60 cm² + 30 cm² = 190 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 190 cm²."
