    "message_2": "First, let's prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we know that G has a non-trivial center (by the center theorem for p-groups). Let Z(G) denote the center of G. Then, the order of Z(G) must be a divisor of 9, which means it can be either 1, 3, or 9.\n\nIf the order of Z(G) is 9, then Z(G) = G, which implies that G is abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, since there is only one abelian group of order 9 up to isomorphism.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the order of Z(G) is 3. In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which must be cyclic (since 3 is prime). Let a be a generator of G/Z(G), and let b be a generator of Z(G). Then, every element of G can be written as a^i * b^j, where 0 ≤ i < 3 and 0 ≤ j < 3.\n\nSince G/Z(G) is cyclic, we know that a^3 is in Z(G). Thus, a^3 = b^k for some 0 ≤ k < 3. If k = 0, then a^3 = e (the identity element), which contradicts the fact that a has order 3 in G/Z(G). Therefore, k must be either 1 or 2. Without loss of generality, let's assume a^3 = b (i.e., k = 1).\n\nNow, we can compute the product of two elements in G: (a^i * b^j) * (a^m * b^n) = a^i * (b^j * a^m) * b^n. Since a^m is in G/Z(G), we know that b^j * a^m = a^m * b^j * b^r for some 0 ≤ r < 3. Thus, the product becomes a^i * a^m * b^j * b^n * b^r = a^(i+m) * b^(j+n+r). This shows that G is non-abelian, as the product depends on the order of the factors.\n\nIn summary, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 (when G is abelian) or the non-abelian group of order 9 (when G has a center of order 3).\n\nNow, let's find an explicit isomorphism between G and either C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C9, then G is generated by a single element, say g, of order 9. The isomorphism φ: G → C9 can be defined as φ(g^i) = i, where 0 ≤ i < 9. This is a bijective homomorphism, as it preserves the group operation and maps each element in G to a unique element in C9.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9, we can define the isomorphism φ: G → H, where H is the non-abelian group of order 9 with generators a and b as described above. The isomorphism can be defined as φ(a^i * b^j) = (i, j), where 0 ≤ i < 3 and 0 ≤ j < 3. This is a bijective homomorphism, as it preserves the group operation and maps each element in G to a unique element in H."
