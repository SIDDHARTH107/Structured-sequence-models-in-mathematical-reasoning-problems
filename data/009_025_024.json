    "message_1": "Consider a European call option with a current stock price of $S_0 = 100$, strike price of $K = 105$, maturity date of $T = 1$ and volatility $\\sigma(t) = 0.2 + 0.1\\cos(t)$ where $t$ is the time elapsed from the present. Using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility, determine the option price at time $t = 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility. However, the BSM equation does not directly account for stochastic volatility. Instead, we can use the Heston model, which is an extension of the BSM model that incorporates stochastic volatility.\n\nThe Heston model is given by the following system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs):\n\n1. $dS_t = rS_t dt + \\sqrt{v_t}S_t dW^1_t$, where $S_t$ is the stock price at time $t$, $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, and $W^1_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n\n2. $dv_t = \\kappa(\\theta - v_t) dt + \\xi\\sqrt{v_t} dW^2_t$, where $v_t$ is the variance of the stock price at time $t$, $\\kappa$ is the mean reversion rate, $\\theta$ is the long-term variance, $\\xi$ is the volatility of volatility, and $W^2_t$ is another standard Brownian motion.\n\nThe correlation between the two Brownian motions, $W^1_t$ and $W^2_t$, is denoted by $\\rho$.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we have the following information:\n\n- $S_0 = 100$\n- $K = 105$\n- $T = 1$\n- $\\sigma(t) = 0.2 + 0.1\\cos(t)$\n\nHowever, we are missing some crucial information to solve this problem using the Heston model, such as the risk-free interest rate ($r$), the mean reversion rate ($\\kappa$), the long-term variance ($\\theta$), the volatility of volatility ($\\xi$), and the correlation between the Brownian motions ($\\rho$).\n\nWithout this information, we cannot determine the option price at time $t = 0$ using the Heston model."
