    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 variables that are believed to be related to a special skill. A researcher wishes to determine how many factors are necessary to explain the correlation among these variables using factor analysis. If the total variance explained by the first two factors is 60%, and the first factor accounts for 35% of this variance, what percentage of the total variance is explained by the second factor?",
    "message_2": "If the total variance explained by the first two factors is 60%, and the first factor accounts for 35% of this variance, we can find the percentage of the total variance explained by the second factor by subtracting the percentage explained by the first factor from the total percentage explained by both factors.\n\nPercentage explained by the second factor = Total percentage explained by both factors - Percentage explained by the first factor\n\nPercentage explained by the second factor = 60% - 35%\n\nPercentage explained by the second factor = 25%\n\nSo, the second factor explains 25% of the total variance."
