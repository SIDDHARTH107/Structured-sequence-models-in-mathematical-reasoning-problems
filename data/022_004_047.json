    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}$, we first need to find the values of $z$ for which the function is not defined. This occurs when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$z^2 - 1 = 0$\n\n$(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are $z = 1$ and $z = -1$. These are the points where the function is not defined, and thus they are the singularities of the function.\n\nNow we need to classify these singularities as removable, pole, or essential singularities.\n\n1. Removable singularities: A singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singular point such that the function becomes continuous at that point. In this case, there is no way to redefine the function at $z = 1$ or $z = -1$ to make it continuous, so neither of these singularities is removable.\n\n2. Pole singularities: A singularity is a pole if the function approaches infinity as $z$ approaches the singular point. In this case, as $z$ approaches either $1$ or $-1$, the denominator approaches zero, and the function approaches infinity. Therefore, both singularities are poles.\n\n3. Essential singularities: A singularity is essential if it is neither removable nor a pole. Since we have already determined that both singularities are poles, neither of them is an essential singularity.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}$ has two singularities at $z = 1$ and $z = -1$, and both of them are pole singularities."
