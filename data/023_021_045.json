    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the voltage waveform, we can use the following formula:\n\n$$\nF(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} V(t) e^{-j\\omega t} dt\n$$\n\nHowever, since the given waveform is a cosine function, we can use the property of the Fourier Transform for cosine functions:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{\\cos(at)\\} = \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(\\omega - a) + \\delta(\\omega + a)]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta(\\omega)$ is the Dirac delta function, and $a$ is the angular frequency of the cosine function.\n\nIn our case, $a = 1000$ and the amplitude is $20$. So, the Fourier Transform of the voltage waveform is:\n\n$$\nF(\\omega) = 20 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta(\\omega - 1000) + \\delta(\\omega + 1000)] = 10[\\delta(\\omega - 1000) + \\delta(\\omega + 1000)]\n$$\n\nNow, to determine the frequency of the signal, we can use the relationship between angular frequency and frequency:\n\n$$\n\\omega = 2\\pi f\n$$\n\nIn our case, $\\omega = 1000$. Solving for $f$:\n\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1000}{2\\pi} \\approx 159.15 \\text{ Hz}\n$$\n\nSo, the frequency of the signal is approximately $159.15$ Hz."
