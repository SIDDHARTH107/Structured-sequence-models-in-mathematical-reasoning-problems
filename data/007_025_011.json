Alice's secret number is a = 4 and Bob's secret number is b = 9. They exchange their public keys and calculate the shared secret key. What is the shared secret key?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice calculates her public key (A) using the formula: A = g^a mod p\n   A = 2^4 mod 29\n   A = 16\n\n2. Bob calculates his public key (B) using the formula: B = g^b mod p\n   B = 2^9 mod 29\n   B = 512 mod 29\n   B = 24\n\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n\n4. Alice calculates the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = B^a mod p\n   S = 24^4 mod 29\n   S = 331776 mod 29\n   S = 20\n\n5. Bob calculates the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = A^b mod p\n   S = 16^9 mod 29\n   S = 68719476736 mod 29\n   S = 20\n\nThe shared secret key is 20."
