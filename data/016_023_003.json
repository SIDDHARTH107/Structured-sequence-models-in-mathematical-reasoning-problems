    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, we start with a square and divide it into nine equal squares (3x3 grid). We remove the central square and repeat the process on the remaining eight squares. So, N = 8 (eight self-similar pieces) and s = 3 (scaling factor).\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(8) / log(3)\nD â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nSo, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.8928."
