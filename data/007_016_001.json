    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. The given Sophie Germain prime is p = 11, since 2(11) + 1 = 23, which is also prime.\n\nTo find the next Sophie Germain prime greater than p, we will test prime numbers greater than 11 and check if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe next prime number after 11 is 13. Let's check if it's a Sophie Germain prime:\n\n2(13) + 1 = 27, which is not prime (3 * 9 = 27).\n\nThe next prime number after 13 is 17. Let's check if it's a Sophie Germain prime:\n\n2(17) + 1 = 35, which is not prime (5 * 7 = 35).\n\nThe next prime number after 17 is 19. Let's check if it's a Sophie Germain prime:\n\n2(19) + 1 = 39, which is not prime (3 * 13 = 39).\n\nThe next prime number after 19 is 23. Let's check if it's a Sophie Germain prime:\n\n2(23) + 1 = 47, which is prime.\n\nSo, the next Sophie Germain prime number greater than p = 11 is 23."
