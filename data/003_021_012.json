    "message_1": "Suppose you have two vectors in two-dimensional space: Vector A with magnitude 5 and direction of 30 degrees east of north, and vector B with magnitude 3 and direction of 120 degrees clockwise from north. What is the angle between the two vectors?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the two vectors, we first need to convert the given directions into standard angles measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\nVector A: 30 degrees east of north is equivalent to 90 - 30 = 60 degrees counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\nVector B: 120 degrees clockwise from north is equivalent to 360 - 120 = 240 degrees counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the two vectors by subtracting the smaller angle from the larger angle:\n\nAngle between A and B = 240 - 60 = 180 degrees."
