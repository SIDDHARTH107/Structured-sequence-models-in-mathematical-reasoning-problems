    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using block matrix methods, we first need to perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix. Then, we can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\n1. The matrix is already in the form where the first element (1,1) is a pivot.\n2. Add the first row to the second row to eliminate the element in position (2,1):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} \n1 & -1 & 0 & 2\\\\ \n0 & 1 & -1 & -1\\\\ \n0 & -1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n3. Add the second row to the third row to eliminate the element in position (3,2):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c} \n1 & -1 & 0 & 2\\\\ \n0 & 1 & -1 & -1\\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. Notice that the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. This means that the system has infinitely many solutions, as there is a free variable (z).\n\nTo find the general solution, we can use back-substitution:\n\n1. From the second row, we have y - z = -1, so y = z - 1.\n2. From the first row, we have x - y = 2, substituting y = z - 1, we get x - (z - 1) = 2, so x = z + 1.\n\nThe general solution is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\ y \\\\ z\n\\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nz + 1 \\\\ z - 1 \\\\ z\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
