    "message_2": "To find all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 40, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups and Sylow Theorems.\n\nThe prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. We will first consider the abelian groups.\n\nAbelian groups:\n\n1. The group can be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, we have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either C_8 (cyclic group of order 8) or C_4 × C_2. The Sylow 5-subgroup is always C_5. So, we have two possibilities here:\n\n   a) C_8 × C_5\n   b) (C_4 × C_2) × C_5\n\n2. The group can be a direct product of cyclic groups whose orders are divisors of 40. We have the following possibilities:\n\n   a) C_40\n   b) C_20 × C_2\n   c) C_10 × C_4\n\nAll these abelian groups are isomorphic to one of the groups listed above. So, we have 5 abelian isomorphism classes: C_40, C_8 × C_5, (C_4 × C_2) × C_5, C_20 × C_2, and C_10 × C_4.\n\nNon-abelian groups:\n\n1. We can have a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either C_8 or C_4 × C_2. The Sylow 5-subgroup is always C_5. The automorphism group of C_5 is isomorphic to C_4, and it has two subgroups of order 2: one generated by the identity and the inversion automorphism, and the other generated by the identity and the square automorphism.\n\n   a) If the Sylow 2-subgroup is C_8, we have a semidirect product C_5 ⋊ C_8. However, C_8 has no elements of order 2, so it cannot act nontrivially on C_5. This case does not produce any non-abelian groups.\n\n   b) If the Sylow 2-subgroup is C_4 × C_2, we have a semidirect product C_5 ⋊ (C_4 × C_2). There are two non-isomorphic actions of C_4 × C_2 on C_5, corresponding to the two subgroups of order 2 in the automorphism group of C_5. These actions produce two non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nSo, we have 2 non-abelian isomorphism classes.\n\nIn summary, there are 7 isomorphism classes of groups of order 40: 5 abelian and 2 non-abelian. The abelian ones are C_40, C_8 × C_5, (C_4 × C_2) × C_5, C_20 × C_2, and C_10 × C_4. The non-abelian ones are C_5 ⋊ (C_4 × C_2) with two different actions."
