Therefore, A - (B x C) = A = {1, 2}.\n\nSimilarly, (B x C) - A = (B x C) = {(2, 4), (3, 4)}.\n\nSo, A Δ (B x C) = {1, 2} ∪ {(2, 4), (3, 4)} = {1, 2, (2, 4), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare (A Δ B) x C and A Δ (B x C).\n\n(A Δ B) x C = {(1, 4), (3, 4)}\n\nA Δ (B x C) = {1, 2, (2, 4), (3, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x C ≠ A Δ (B x C). Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
