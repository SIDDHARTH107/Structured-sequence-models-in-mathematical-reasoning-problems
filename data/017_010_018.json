    "message_2": "A non-abelian group of order 10 is the dihedral group D_5, which represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon. The elements of D_5 can be represented as {e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4}, where e is the identity element, r represents a rotation by 72 degrees, and s represents a reflection.\n\nHere is the multiplication table for D_5:\n\n```\n   | e   r   r^2 r^3 r^4 s   sr  sr^2 sr^3 sr^4\n---+------------------------------------------\ne  | e   r   r^2 r^3 r^4 s   sr  sr^2 sr^3 sr^4\nr  | r   r^2 r^3 r^4 e   sr  sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 s\nr^2| r^2 r^3 r^4 e   r   sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 s   sr\nr^3| r^3 r^4 e   r   r^2 sr^3 sr^4 s   sr  sr^2\nr^4| r^4 e   r   r^2 r^3 sr^4 s   sr  sr^2 sr^3\ns  | s   sr  sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 e   r   r^2 r^3 r^4\nsr | sr  sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 s   r^4 e   r   r^2 r^3\nsr^2| sr^2 sr^3 sr^4 s   sr  r^3 r^4 e   r   r^2\nsr^3| sr^3 sr^4 s   sr  sr^2 r^2 r^3 r^4 e   r\nsr^4| sr^4 s   sr  sr^2 sr^3 r   r^2 r^3 r^4 e\n```\n\nIn this table, the rows and columns are indexed by the elements of D_5, and the entry in row i and column j is the product of the elements i and j in the group."
