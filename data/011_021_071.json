What is the shortest possible route that he can take to visit all 5 cities exactly once and return to his starting city, given the following distances between each pair of cities:\n\nCity 1 to City 2: 10 km\n\nCity 1 to City 3: 12 km\n\nCity 1 to City 4: 8 km\n\nCity 1 to City 5: 11 km\n\nCity 2 to City 3: 9 km\n\nCity 2 to City 4: 7 km\n\nCity 2 to City 5: 6 km\n\nCity 3 to City 4: 5 km\n\nCity 3 to City 5: 14 km\n\nCity 4 to City 5: 3 km",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can list all possible routes and calculate their total distances. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, but since the route is circular, we can divide this by 5, resulting in 4! (4 factorial) which is 24 possible routes. However, we can further divide this by 2 since the reverse order of the routes will have the same distance, leaving us with 12 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the 12 unique routes and their total distances:\n\n1. City 1 → City 2 → City 3 → City 4 → City 5 → City 1\nDistance: 10 + 9 + 5 + 3 + 11 = 38 km\n\n2. City 1 → City 2 → City 3 → City 5 → City 4 → City 1\nDistance: 10 + 9 + 14 + 3 + 8 = 44 km\n\n3. City 1 → City 2 → City 4 → City 3 → City 5 → City 1\nDistance: 10 + 7 + 5 + 14 + 11 = 47 km\n\n4. City 1 → City 2 → City 4 → City 5 → City 3 → City 1\nDistance: 10 + 7 + 3 + 14 + 12 = 46 km\n\n5. City 1 → City 2 → City 5 → City 3 → City 4 → City 1\nDistance: 10 + 6 + 14 + 5 + 8 = 43 km\n\n6. City 1 → City 2 → City 5 → City 4 → City 3 → City 1\nDistance: 10 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 12 = 36 km\n\n7. City 1 → City 3 → City 2 → City 4 → City 5 → City 1\nDistance: 12 + 9 + 7 + 3 + 11 = 42 km\n\n8. City 1 → City 3 → City 2 → City 5 → City 4 → City 1\nDistance: 12 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 8 = 38 km\n\n9. City 1 → City 3 → City 4 → City 2 → City 5 → City 1\nDistance: 12 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 11 = 41 km\n\n10. City 1 → City 3 → City 4 → City 5 → City 2 → City 1\nDistance: 12 + 5 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 36 km\n\n11. City 1 → City 3 → City 5 → City 2 → City 4 → City 1\nDistance: 12 + 14 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 47 km\n\n12. City 1 → City 3 → City 5 → City 4 → City 2 → City 1\nDistance: 12 + 14 + 3 + 7 + 10 = 46 km\n\nThe shortest possible route is 36 km, which can be achieved by either route 6 (City 1 → City 2 → City 5 → City 4 → City 3 → City 1) or route 10 (City 1 → City 3 → City 4 → City 5 → City 2 → City 1)."
