    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x + 5| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x + 5 is positive or zero, so the absolute value does not change the expression.\n3x + 5 = 11\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n3x = 6\n\nDivide by 3:\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 3x + 5 is negative, so the absolute value changes the sign of the expression.\n-(3x + 5) = 11\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-3x - 5 = 11\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n-3x = 16\n\nDivide by -3:\nx = -16/3\n\nSo, the solution set of the absolute value equation |3x + 5| = 11 is {2, -16/3}."
