    "message_2": "We know that the Pythagorean identity states that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. So, we can replace sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) with 1 in the given expression.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n1 - sin(x)cos(x)\n\nThis is the simplified form of the given expression using trigonometric identities."
