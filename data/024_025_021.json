    "message_2": "To find the first Chern class $c_1(M)$ of the complex manifold $M$, we first need to determine if $M$ is a complex submanifold of some ambient complex space. In this case, $M$ is given by the equation $z_1^2 + z_2^3 + z_3^4 = 0$, which is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{C}^3$.\n\nNow, let's compute the tangent space of $M$ at a point $p = (z_1, z_2, z_3) \\in M$. The tangent space $T_pM$ is given by the kernel of the differential of the defining function $F(z_1, z_2, z_3) = z_1^2 + z_2^3 + z_3^4$. The differential of $F$ is given by the matrix:\n\n$$\ndF = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2z_1 & 3z_2^2 & 4z_3^3\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe tangent space $T_pM$ is the kernel of this matrix, which is a complex vector space of dimension 2 since $M$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{C}^3$.\n\nNow, let's compute the normal bundle $N_pM$ of $M$ at the point $p$. The normal bundle is given by the quotient of the ambient tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{C}^3$ and the tangent space $T_pM$. Since $T_p\\mathbb{C}^3$ is a complex vector space of dimension 3 and $T_pM$ is a complex vector space of dimension 2, the normal bundle $N_pM$ is a complex line bundle.\n\nThe first Chern class $c_1(M)$ is the first Chern class of the normal bundle $N_pM$. To compute this, we can use the adjunction formula:\n\n$$\nc_1(M) = c_1(T_p\\mathbb{C}^3) - c_1(T_pM).\n$$\n\nThe first Chern class of the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{C}^3$ is zero since it is a flat space. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\nc_1(M) = 0 - c_1(T_pM).\n$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the first Chern class of the tangent bundle $T_pM$. Since $M$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{C}^3$, we can use the restriction of the standard holomorphic line bundle over $\\mathbb{C}^3$ to compute the first Chern class of $T_pM$. The standard holomorphic line bundle over $\\mathbb{C}^3$ has first Chern class equal to 1. Therefore, the first Chern class of the tangent bundle $T_pM$ is also 1.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n$$\nc_1(M) = 0 - 1 = -1.\n$$\n\nSo, the first Chern class $c_1(M)$ of the complex manifold $M$ is $-1$."
