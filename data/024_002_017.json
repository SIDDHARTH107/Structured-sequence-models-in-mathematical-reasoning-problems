    "message_1": "A student is given a surface in 3D space defined by the equation z = x^2 + y^2, and is asked to determine the geodesics between the points (1,0,1) and (-1,0,1) on the surface. What is the equation for this geodesic?",
    "message_2": "To find the geodesic between two points on a surface, we need to minimize the arc length between the points while staying on the surface. In this case, the surface is given by z = x^2 + y^2. We can parameterize the curve on the surface by a vector function r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), where z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2.\n\nThe arc length of the curve can be expressed as:\n\nL = ∫√(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + z'(t)^2) dt\n\nUsing the constraint z(t) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2, we can find z'(t) = 2x(t)x'(t) + 2y(t)y'(t). Now, we can rewrite the arc length as:\n\nL = ∫√(x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 + (2x(t)x'(t) + 2y(t)y'(t))^2) dt\n\nTo minimize this arc length, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. However, solving these equations for this particular surface is quite complicated. Instead, we can use the fact that the given surface is a paraboloid, and the geodesics on a paraboloid are the intersections of the surface with planes that pass through the two given points and the vertex of the paraboloid.\n\nThe vertex of the paraboloid is (0, 0, 0). So, we need to find the equation of the plane that passes through the points (1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, 1), and (0, 0, 0). Using the three-point form of the plane equation, we get:\n\n(x - 1)(0 - 0) - (y - 0)(1 - (-1)) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the plane as y = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the plane y = 0 with the surface z = x^2 + y^2. Since y = 0, the equation of the geodesic on the surface is:\n\nz = x^2 + 0^2\n\nz = x^2\n\nThus, the equation for the geodesic between the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is z = x^2 with y = 0."
