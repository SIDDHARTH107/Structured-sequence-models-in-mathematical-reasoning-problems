    "message_2": "To compute the SHA-256 hash value of the message \"Math is amazing!\", you can use a programming language or an online tool. I cannot compute it directly as I am an AI language model. However, I can guide you on how to do it.\n\nHere's an example using Python:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\nmessage = \"Math is amazing!\"\nhash_object = hashlib.sha256(message.encode())\nhash_hex = hash_object.hexdigest()\n\nprint(hash_hex)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the SHA-256 hash value of the message \"Math is amazing!\"."
