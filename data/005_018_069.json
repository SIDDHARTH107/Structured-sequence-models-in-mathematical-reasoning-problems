    "message_1": "A survival analysis was conducted on a sample of patients diagnosed with a particular disease. The survival times of 20 patients were recorded and are as follows (in months): \n\n{12, 24+, 36+, 44, 60, 66+, 72+, 88+, 100, 112, 120+, 132+, 148, 152+, 164+, 176, 188, 200, 212+, 224}\n\nAssuming that the data is right-censored, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the median survival time for this sample?\n2. What is the probability that a patient with this disease will survive for over 5 years (60 months)?\n3. What is the hazard rate at 2 years (24 months) after diagnosis?",
    "message_2": "1. To find the median survival time, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order, which is already done. Since there are 20 patients, the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th values. The 10th value is 112 months, and the 11th value is 120+ months. Since the 11th value is right-censored, we cannot determine the exact survival time, so the median survival time is 112 months.\n\n2. To find the probability that a patient will survive for over 5 years (60 months), we need to count the number of patients who survived for more than 60 months and divide that by the total number of patients. There are 14 patients with survival times greater than 60 months (66+, 72+, 88+, 100, 112, 120+, 132+, 148, 152+, 164+, 176, 188, 200, and 212+). So, the probability of surviving for more than 5 years is 14/20 = 0.7 or 70%.\n\n3. To calculate the hazard rate at 2 years (24 months) after diagnosis, we need to find the number of patients who experienced the event (death) at 24 months and divide that by the number of patients who were at risk at that time. In this case, there is only one patient with a survival time of 24+ months, which means they are still alive at 24 months, so there are no events (deaths) at 24 months. Therefore, the hazard rate at 2 years (24 months) after diagnosis is 0/20 = 0."
