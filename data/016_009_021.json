    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be found using the formula:\n\nLength = (Original Length) * (Square root of 2) ^ (Number of iterations)\n\nIn this case, the original length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 10th iteration. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2))^10\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 32.000\n\nLength ≈ 32\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after the 10th iteration is approximately 32."
