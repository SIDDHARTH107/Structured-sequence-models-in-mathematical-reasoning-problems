    "message_1": "If p is true and q is false, what is the truth value of the proposition (p ∨ q) ⇒ (¬p ∧ q)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the truth value of the given proposition using the given values of p and q. We are given that p is true and q is false. Let's break down the proposition step by step:\n\n1. (p ∨ q): This is the disjunction (OR) operation, which is true if at least one of p or q is true. Since p is true, (p ∨ q) is true.\n\n2. (¬p ∧ q): This is the conjunction (AND) operation, which is true only if both ¬p (not p) and q are true. Since p is true, ¬p is false. Therefore, (¬p ∧ q) is false.\n\nNow, we have the proposition (True) ⇒ (False). The implication (⇒) operation is false only if the antecedent (left side) is true and the consequent (right side) is false. In this case, that is exactly the situation we have: (True) ⇒ (False).\n\nSo, the truth value of the proposition (p ∨ q) ⇒ (¬p ∧ q) is False."
