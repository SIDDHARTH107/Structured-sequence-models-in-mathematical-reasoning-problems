    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 * 11 = 385.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/5 = 385/5 = 77\nN2 = N/7 = 385/7 = 55\nN3 = N/11 = 385/11 = 35\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\ny1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod 5) => 77y1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\ny2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod 7) => 55y2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod 11) => 35y3 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nSolving these congruences, we get:\ny1 = 3 (mod 5)\ny2 = 1 (mod 7)\ny3 = 2 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can find the solution x using the formula:\nx = (a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) + (a3 * N3 * y3) (mod N)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nx = (2 * 77 * 3) + (1 * 55 * 1) + (3 * 35 * 2) (mod 385)\nx = 462 + 55 + 210 (mod 385)\nx = 727 (mod 385)\n\nThe smallest positive integer x that satisfies all three congruences is x ≡ 342 (mod 385)."
