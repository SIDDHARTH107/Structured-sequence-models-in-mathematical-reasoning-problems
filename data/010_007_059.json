    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the figure-eight space, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a topological space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected subsets A and B, then the fundamental group of X can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements corresponding to the loops in the intersection of A and B.\n\nLet's consider the figure-eight space X as the union of two open, path-connected subsets A and B, where A contains the large loop and B contains the small loop, and both A and B contain the intersection point. We can choose A and B such that their intersection is a small open neighborhood around the intersection point of the loops.\n\nThe fundamental group of A is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle, which is the infinite cyclic group Z generated by the large loop. Similarly, the fundamental group of B is also isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle, generated by the small loop.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of A and B. Since the intersection is a small open neighborhood around the intersection point, it is contractible, and its fundamental group is trivial.\n\nApplying the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we get that the fundamental group of the figure-eight space X is the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the trivial group. In other words, the fundamental group of X is the free product of Z and Z, which is the free group on two generators.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the figure-eight space is the free group on two generators, usually denoted as F_2 or ⟨a, b⟩, where a and b represent the large and small loops, respectively."
