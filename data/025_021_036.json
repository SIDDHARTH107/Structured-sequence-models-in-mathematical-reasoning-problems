    "message_2": "To calculate the B-model period using mirror symmetry, we first need to find the mirror curve of the given algebraic curve. The given curve is a genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve), and its mirror curve can be found using the method of Hori-Vafa mirror symmetry.\n\nThe Hori-Vafa mirror symmetry for genus 1 curves involves finding a dual torus by inverting the complex structure modulus τ. The complex structure modulus is given by the integral of the holomorphic differential over the A-cycle, divided by the integral of the holomorphic differential over the B-cycle.\n\nFor the given curve, y^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 4, the holomorphic differential is given by:\n\nω = dx/y\n\nNow, we need to find the A-cycle and B-cycle on the curve. The A-cycle is a closed loop that does not encircle any singular points, while the B-cycle is a closed loop that encircles a singular point. In this case, the singular points are the roots of the polynomial x^3 + 4x^2 - 4.\n\nLet's denote the roots as x1, x2, and x3. Then, the A-cycle can be chosen as a path from x1 to x2 and back to x1, while the B-cycle can be chosen as a path from x1 to x3 and back to x1.\n\nNow, we can compute the complex structure modulus τ:\n\nτ = ∫(A-cycle) ω / ∫(B-cycle) ω\n\nTo compute the integrals, we can use the path integral method or numerical integration techniques. Once we have τ, we can find the mirror curve by inverting τ:\n\nτ' = -1/τ\n\nFinally, we can compute the B-model period by integrating the holomorphic differential of the mirror curve over the A-cycle and B-cycle:\n\nB-model period = ∫(A-cycle) ω' / ∫(B-cycle) ω'\n\nHere, ω' is the holomorphic differential of the mirror curve. The B-model period is a complex number that encodes important information about the mirror curve and its geometry."
