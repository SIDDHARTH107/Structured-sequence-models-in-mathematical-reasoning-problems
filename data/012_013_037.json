    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic polynomial of G, we will use the deletion-contraction algorithm. First, let's label the vertices as $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5,$ and $v_6$. We will start by considering the edge $(v_1, v_2)$.\n\n1. Delete the edge $(v_1, v_2)$: The resulting graph, G', has the edges $(1,4)$, $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, $(3,5)$, and $(4,6)$. The chromatic polynomial of G' is $P(G', k)$.\n\n2. Contract the edge $(v_1, v_2)$: Merge vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ into a single vertex, say $v_{12}$. The resulting graph, G'', has the vertices $v_{12}, v_3, v_4, v_5,$ and $v_6$. The edges are $(12,3)$, $(12,4)$, $(3,4)$, $(3,5)$, and $(4,6)$. The chromatic polynomial of G'' is $P(G'', k)$.\n\nNow, we have the chromatic polynomial of G as $P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)$. We need to find the chromatic polynomials of G' and G''.\n\nFor G', we can see that it is composed of two disconnected subgraphs: a triangle with vertices $v_2, v_3,$ and $v_4$, and a path with vertices $v_1, v_5,$ and $v_6$. The chromatic polynomial of a triangle is $k(k-1)(k-2)$, and the chromatic polynomial of a path with three vertices is $k(k-1)^2$. Since the subgraphs are disconnected, we can multiply their chromatic polynomials to get the chromatic polynomial of G': $P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2) \\cdot k(k-1)^2$.\n\nFor G'', we can see that it is a tree with 5 vertices. The chromatic polynomial of a tree with n vertices is $k(k-1)^{n-1}$. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial of G'' is $P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^4$.\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G: $P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2) \\cdot k(k-1)^2 - k(k-1)^4 = k(k-1)^2[(k-2)k - (k-1)^2] = k(k-1)^2(k^2 - k) = k^4(k-1)^2 - k^3(k-1)^3$.\n\nThus, the chromatic polynomial of G is $P(G, k) = k^4(k-1)^2 - k^3(k-1)^3$."
