    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one of the faces with length 8 cm and width 5 cm is:\nA1 = 8 * 5 = 40 square centimeters.\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is:\n2 * A1 = 2 * 40 = 80 square centimeters.\n\n2. The area of one of the faces with length 8 cm and height 3 cm is:\nA2 = 8 * 3 = 24 square centimeters.\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is:\n2 * A2 = 2 * 24 = 48 square centimeters.\n\n3. The area of one of the faces with width 5 cm and height 3 cm is:\nA3 = 5 * 3 = 15 square centimeters.\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is:\n2 * A3 = 2 * 15 = 30 square centimeters.\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together to find the total surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 80 + 48 + 30 = 158 square centimeters."
