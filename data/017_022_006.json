    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we need to analyze the possible group structures and their properties. Let's start by looking at the Sylow theorems, which give us information about the possible subgroups of G.\n\nThe order of G is 60, which factors as 2^2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow let's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, then G has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of G. In this case, n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. This would mean that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Since these subgroups are unique, they are all normal in G. The product of their orders is 4 * 3 * 5 = 60, which is the order of G. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is the direct product of these subgroups, which means G is isomorphic to C4 × C3 × C5. Since C4 × C3 × C5 is isomorphic to C60, G could be isomorphic to C60.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5. The order of A5 is 5!, which is divisible by 3 and 5. Thus, A5 has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which implies n_3 = n_5 = 1. The order of A5 is not divisible by 4, so A5 does not contain a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. However, since the order of G is divisible by 4, G must have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. This means that n_2 > 1. Since A5 × C2 has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5 and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, G could be isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\n3. For G to be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, G must not be isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2. This means that G cannot have a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of G, and G cannot have a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5. Thus, G must have at least one of n_2 > 1, n_3 > 1, or n_5 > 1. Since there are 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, G could be one of these groups.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the specific group G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. However, we have shown that G could potentially be isomorphic to any of these groups based on the possible values of n_2, n_3, and n_5."
