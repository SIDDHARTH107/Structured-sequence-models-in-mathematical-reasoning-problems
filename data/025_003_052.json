    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the projective variety defined by the equation $x^2y + 2xy^2 + z^3 = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and find the points where all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = x^2y + 2xy^2 + z^3$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2xy + 2y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = x^2 + 4xy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 3z^2$\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n(1) $2xy + 2y^2 = 0$\n\n(2) $x^2 + 4xy = 0$\n\n(3) $3z^2 = 0$\n\nFrom equation (3), we get $z = 0$. Now, we need to consider the remaining equations:\n\n(1') $2xy + 2y^2 = 0$\n\n(2') $x^2 + 4xy = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1'), we can factor out $2y$:\n\n$2y(x + y) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possibilities: $y = 0$ or $x = -y$.\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2'), we have:\n\n$x^2 = 0$\n\nSo, $x = 0$. Thus, we have a singular point at $(0:0:1)$.\n\nCase 2: $x = -y$\n\nSubstitute this into equation (2'):\n\n$(-y)^2 + 4(-y)y = 0$\n\n$y^2 - 4y^2 = 0$\n\n$3y^2 = 0$\n\nSo, $y = 0$. But this leads us back to the first case, which we already considered.\n\nTherefore, the only singular point of the projective variety is $(0:0:1)$."
