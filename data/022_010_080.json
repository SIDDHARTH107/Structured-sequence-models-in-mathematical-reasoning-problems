    "message_2": "Let's consider the complex function f(z) = 1/(z^2 + 1). We want to find the Laurent series expansion of this function in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2.\n\nTo find the Laurent series expansion, we can use partial fraction decomposition. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = 1/(z^2 + 1) = A/(z - i) + B/(z + i)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can use the following equations:\n\nA(z - i) + B(z + i) = 1\n\nPlugging in z = i:\n\nA(2i) = 1 => A = 1/2i\n\nPlugging in z = -i:\n\nB(-2i) = 1 => B = -1/2i\n\nNow, we have:\n\nf(z) = (1/2i) * (1/(z - i)) - (1/2i) * (1/(z + i))\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of each term in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2.\n\nFor the first term:\n\n1/(z - i) = 1/((z/i) - 1) = 1/(1 - (1/z)i)\n\nUsing the geometric series formula, we get:\n\n1/(1 - (1/z)i) = Σ ((1/z)^n * i^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nFor the second term:\n\n1/(z + i) = 1/((z/i) + 1) = 1/(1 + (1/z)i)\n\nUsing the geometric series formula, we get:\n\n1/(1 + (1/z)i) = Σ ((-1/z)^n * i^n) for n = 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we can combine the two series and multiply by the constants:\n\nf(z) = (1/2i) * Σ ((1/z)^n * i^n) - (1/2i) * Σ ((-1/z)^n * i^n)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z^2 + 1) in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2."
