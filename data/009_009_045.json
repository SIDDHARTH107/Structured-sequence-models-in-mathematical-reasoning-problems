    "message_2": "To find the probability density $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$ of finding the electron within the interval $[-1,1]$ at time $t = 1$ s, we first need to solve the Schrödinger equation for the given potential function and initial wave function. However, solving the Schrödinger equation for a Gaussian wave packet in a harmonic oscillator potential is not trivial and requires advanced mathematical techniques, such as the use of coherent states and time-dependent wave functions.\n\nInstead, we can provide an approximate solution by assuming that the wave function remains Gaussian over time. This is a reasonable assumption for short times and small displacements, as the Gaussian wave packet will spread slowly in the harmonic oscillator potential. Under this assumption, the time-dependent wave function can be written as:\n\n$$\\Psi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_t)^{1/2}} \\exp{(-\\frac{x^2}{4\\sigma_t^2} + i\\alpha_t x)}$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_t$ and $\\alpha_t$ are time-dependent parameters that describe the width and phase of the Gaussian wave packet, respectively. Note that this is an approximation and not an exact solution to the Schrödinger equation.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability density $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$:\n\n$$|\\Psi(x,t)|^2 = \\Psi(x,t)\\Psi^*(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_t} \\exp{(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_t^2})}$$\n\nTo find the probability of finding the electron within the interval $[-1,1]$ at time $t = 1$ s, we need to integrate the probability density over this interval:\n\n$$P(-1 \\le x \\le 1, t=1) = \\int_{-1}^{1} |\\Psi(x,1)|^2 dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_1} \\exp{(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_1^2})} dx$$\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide an exact value for this integral without knowing the time-dependent parameters $\\sigma_1$ and $\\alpha_1$. However, if we assume that the width of the Gaussian wave packet does not change significantly over the short time interval of $t = 1$ s, we can use the initial width $\\sigma = 0.1$ as an approximation:\n\n$$P(-1 \\le x \\le 1, t=1) \\approx \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp{(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2})} dx$$\n\nThis integral can be evaluated numerically to obtain an approximate probability:\n\n$$P(-1 \\le x \\le 1, t=1) \\approx 0.9996$$\n\nSo, the approximate probability of finding the electron within the interval $[-1,1]$ at time $t = 1$ s is about 99.96%. Keep in mind that this is an approximation based on the assumption that the width of the Gaussian wave packet does not change significantly over time, and the actual probability may be different."
