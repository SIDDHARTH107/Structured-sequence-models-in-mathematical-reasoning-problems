    "message_1": "Suppose there are two bidders in an auction for a painting, bidder A and bidder B. The true value of the painting for bidder A is $10,000, and for bidder B it is $15,000. The auction will be a sealed-bid second-price auction, meaning that each bidder will submit a single bid, and the highest bidder will win the painting but pay the second-highest bid amount. If bidder A bids $12,000, what should bidder B bid in order to maximize their expected utility? Assume that both bidders have linear utility functions.",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation of the item. This is because the winner pays the second-highest bid, so there is no incentive to overbid or underbid.\n\nIn this case, since bidder A has already submitted a bid of $12,000, bidder B should bid their true valuation of the painting, which is $15,000. By doing so, bidder B will win the auction and pay the second-highest bid, which is $12,000. This maximizes bidder B's utility, as they will obtain the painting for a price lower than their true valuation, resulting in a net gain of $3,000 ($15,000 - $12,000)."
