    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required to embed the graph on a surface without any edge crossings. To find the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given V = 13, E = 26, and the graph has 1 connected component. To find F, we can use the formula for the maximum number of edges in a planar graph:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, 26 ≤ 3(13) - 6, which simplifies to 26 ≤ 33. Since the inequality holds, the graph is planar, and its genus is 0."
