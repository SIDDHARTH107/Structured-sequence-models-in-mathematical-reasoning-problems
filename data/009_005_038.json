    "message_2": "To find the differential equation governing the circuit, we'll use Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is equal to zero. In this circuit, the voltage across the capacitor (Vc) and the voltage across the inductor (VL) must add up to the voltage source (Vs).\n\nVs = Vc + VL\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by Vc = Q/C, where Q is the charge on the capacitor and C is the capacitance. The voltage across the inductor is given by VL = L * (dI/dt), where I is the current through the inductor and L is the inductance.\n\nNow, we know that the current I is the time derivative of the charge Q: I = dQ/dt. Therefore, we can write the voltage across the capacitor as Vc = (1/C) * ∫I dt.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for Vc and VL into the KVL equation, we get:\n\nVs = (1/C) * ∫I dt + L * (dI/dt)\n\nGiven Vs = 20 sin(120πt), C = 10 μF = 10 * 10^(-6) F, and L = 5 H, we can now find the differential equation governing the circuit:\n\n20 sin(120πt) = (1/(10 * 10^(-6))) * ∫I dt + 5 * (dI/dt)\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time, we get:\n\n(20 * 120π) cos(120πt) = (1/(10 * 10^(-6))) * I + 5 * (d²I/dt²)\n\nRearranging the equation and simplifying, we get:\n\nd²I/dt² + (1/(10 * 10^(-6) * 5)) * I = (2400π) cos(120πt)\n\nThis is the differential equation governing the circuit.\n\nNow, to find the current through the circuit as a function of time, we need to solve this second-order non-homogeneous differential equation. This can be done using the method of undetermined coefficients or Laplace transforms. We'll use the Laplace transform method.\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of the equation, we get:\n\ns²I(s) - sI(0) - I'(0) + (1/(50 * 10^(-6))) * I(s) = (2400π) * (s/(s² + (120π)²))\n\nAssuming the initial conditions I(0) = 0 and I'(0) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\n(s² + (1/(50 * 10^(-6)))) * I(s) = (2400π) * (s/(s² + (120π)²))\n\nNow, we can solve for I(s):\n\nI(s) = (2400π) * (s/((s² + (1/(50 * 10^(-6)))) * (s² + (120π)²)))\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of I(s), we get the current as a function of time:\n\nI(t) = A * sin(120πt) + B * cos(120πt) + C * e^(-t/(50 * 10^(-6)))\n\nTo find the constants A, B, and C, we can use the initial conditions and the fact that the circuit is initially at rest:\n\nI(0) = 0 => B + C = 0 => C = -B\n\nI'(0) = 0 => 120πA - (1/(50 * 10^(-6))) * B = 0\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact values of A and B, the current through the circuit as a function of time is given by:\n\nI(t) = A * sin(120πt) + B * (cos(120πt) - e^(-t/(50 * 10^(-6))))"
