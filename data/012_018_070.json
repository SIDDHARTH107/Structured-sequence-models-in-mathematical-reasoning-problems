    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, when removed, will result in the graph being split into two or more disconnected components.\n\nFor a graph with n vertices and m edges, the edge connectivity can be found using the following formula:\n\nedge connectivity = min(δ(G), m - n + 1)\n\nwhere δ(G) is the minimum degree of the vertices in the graph.\n\nSince we are given a graph with 8 vertices and 11 edges, we have:\n\nm = 11\nn = 8\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum degree of the vertices in the graph, δ(G). The minimum degree of a vertex is the smallest number of edges connected to that vertex. Since we don't have any specific information about the graph, we can't determine the exact value of δ(G). However, we can make some observations to find a lower bound for δ(G).\n\nSince the graph has 11 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 11 = 22. If we try to distribute these degrees as evenly as possible among the 8 vertices, we would have:\n\n22 / 8 = 2.75\n\nSince the degree of a vertex must be an integer, we can conclude that at least one vertex has a degree of 3 or more. Therefore, δ(G) ≥ 3.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for edge connectivity:\n\nedge connectivity = min(δ(G), m - n + 1)\nedge connectivity = min(3, 11 - 8 + 1)\nedge connectivity = min(3, 4)\nedge connectivity = 3\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the given graph is 3. This means that at least 3 edges must be removed to disconnect the graph."
