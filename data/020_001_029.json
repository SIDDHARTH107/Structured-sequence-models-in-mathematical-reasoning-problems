    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production time for Product A is 2 hours and for Product B is 3 hours. The company has only 120 hours of production time per week. Product A sells for $10 per unit, and Product B sells for $12 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit. What should be the production levels for each product?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe production time constraint can be written as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 120\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 12y\n\nTo find the optimal production levels, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we need to find the intercepts of the constraint equation:\nWhen x = 0, y = 120/3 = 40\nWhen y = 0, x = 120/2 = 60\n\nSo, the constraint equation can be plotted as a line passing through the points (0, 40) and (60, 0). The feasible region is the area below this line, including the axes where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\nA(0, 0), B(0, 40), and C(60, 0)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\nP(A) = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\nP(B) = 10(0) + 12(40) = $480\nP(C) = 10(60) + 12(0) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, with a profit of $600. Therefore, the company should produce 60 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize its profit."
