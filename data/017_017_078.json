    "message_2": "Let G be a non-abelian group of order 30. The order of G is 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's Theorems, we know that there are unique Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups in G, since 3 and 5 are prime and their highest powers dividing 30 are 3^1 and 5^1.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Then |P| = 3 and |Q| = 5. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. The elements of P have orders 1 and 3, and the elements of Q have orders 1 and 5. Thus, none of the elements in P or Q have order 2.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since P and Q are normal in G, |PQ| = |P||Q| = 3 * 5 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 elements in G that are not in PQ. Since the identity element is in PQ, there are 14 non-identity elements in G that are not in PQ.\n\nThese 14 elements must have order 2, as they are not in P or Q and their orders must divide 30. So, there are 14 elements of order 2 in any non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the cyclic group C30 and the dihedral group D15.\n\n1. Cyclic group C30:\nIn a cyclic group of order n, there is only one element of order 2 if n is even, and no elements of order 2 if n is odd. Since 30 is even, there is only 1 element of order 2 in C30.\n\n2. Dihedral group D15:\nThe dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15 = 30. It consists of 15 rotations and 15 reflections. The rotations have orders dividing 15, while the reflections have order 2. Therefore, there are 15 elements of order 2 in D15.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 14 elements of order 2 in any non-abelian group of order 30, which is more than the 1 element of order 2 in the cyclic group C30, and the same as the 15 elements of order 2 in the dihedral group D15."
