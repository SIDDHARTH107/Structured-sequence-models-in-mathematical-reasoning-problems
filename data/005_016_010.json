    "message_1": "Suppose a university administration wants to determine which factors (such as GPA, SAT/ACT scores, extracurricular activities, etc.) are most important in predicting admission decisions for their graduate program, with the two possible outcomes being admitted or not admitted. They collect data from 200 graduate program applicants, and apply discriminant analysis to determine the most important predictors.\n\nUsing the following data, can you help the university administration determine which factors are most important in predicting graduate program admission decisions?\n\n| Applicant | GPA | SAT | Extracurricular | Admit |\n|-----------|-----|-----|----------------|-------|\n| 1         | 3.2 | 1200 | 1 | Admitted   |\n| 2         | 3.5 | 1300 | 2 | Admitted   |\n| 3         | 3.1 | 1250 | 3 | Admitted   |\n| ...       | ... | ... | ... | ...   |\n| 200       | 2.9 | 1100 | 1 | Not Admitted | \n\nUsing the above data, can you determine the most important factors in predicting graduate program admission decisions?",
    "message_2": "To determine the most important factors in predicting graduate program admission decisions, we need to perform a discriminant analysis on the given data. However, since the complete data set of 200 applicants is not provided, we cannot perform the analysis here. \n\nIn general, discriminant analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between a categorical dependent variable (in this case, admission decisions) and continuous independent variables (GPA, SAT scores, and extracurricular activities). The analysis will help to identify which independent variables have the most significant impact on the dependent variable.\n\nOnce the complete data set is available, you can perform the discriminant analysis using statistical software like R, Python, or SPSS. The output will provide you with the standardized discriminant coefficients for each independent variable. The higher the absolute value of the coefficient, the more important the variable is in predicting the admission decision.\n\nIn conclusion, we need the complete data set of 200 applicants to perform the discriminant analysis and determine the most important factors in predicting graduate program admission decisions."
