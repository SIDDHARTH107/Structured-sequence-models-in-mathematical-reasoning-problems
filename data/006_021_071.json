    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of experiencing a drought during monsoon season is 0.2, while the probability of facing a flood during the same season is 0.15. What is the probability of not experiencing any environmental event during the monsoon season in this region?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of not experiencing any environmental event during the monsoon season, we first need to find the probability of experiencing either a drought or a flood. Since these events are mutually exclusive (they cannot both happen at the same time), we can simply add their probabilities:\n\nP(drought or flood) = P(drought) + P(flood) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35\n\nNow, to find the probability of not experiencing any environmental event, we subtract the probability of experiencing either a drought or a flood from 1:\n\nP(no event) = 1 - P(drought or flood) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65\n\nSo, the probability of not experiencing any environmental event during the monsoon season in this region is 0.65 or 65%."
