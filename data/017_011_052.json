    "message_2": "Problem: Let G be a group of order 12. Prove that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C12, A4, or D6.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order 12. The order of a group is the number of its elements. Since 12 = 2^2 * 3, there are three possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 12: C12, A4, and D6.\n\n2. Now, we will prove that every group of order 12 is isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nCase 1: G is a cyclic group.\nIf G is a cyclic group, then G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: G is not a cyclic group.\nIf G is not a cyclic group, then by Sylow's Theorems, there exists a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P of G. Since the order of P is 3, P is isomorphic to C3.\n\nNow, let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the order of Q is 4, Q is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If Q is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is D6.\n\nIf Q is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is A4.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 12 is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6."
