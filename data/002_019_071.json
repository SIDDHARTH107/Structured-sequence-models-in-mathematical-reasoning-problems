    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (cone) separately, and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (circle):\nA = πr^2\nA = π(4)^2\nA = 16π square centimeters\n\n2. Lateral surface area (cone):\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can do this using the Pythagorean theorem, since the height, radius, and slant height form a right triangle:\nl^2 = h^2 + r^2\nl^2 = (10)^2 + (4)^2\nl^2 = 100 + 16\nl^2 = 116\nl = √116 ≈ 10.77 cm\n\nNow, we can find the lateral surface area (LSA) using the formula:\nLSA = πr * l\nLSA = π(4)(10.77)\nLSA ≈ 135.72 square centimeters\n\n3. Total surface area:\nSurface area = Base area + Lateral surface area\nSurface area = 16π + 135.72\nSurface area ≈ 50.27 + 135.72\nSurface area ≈ 185.99 square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the right circular cone is approximately 185.99 square centimeters."
