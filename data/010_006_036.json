    "message_2": "The complement of a circle with radius 1 in three-dimensional space is the space obtained by removing the circle from R^3. This space is homotopy equivalent to a punctured plane, which can be seen by projecting the circle onto a plane and removing the projection point.\n\nThe fundamental group of the punctured plane is isomorphic to the integers, Z. This is because the punctured plane is homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1, and the fundamental group of S^1 is Z.\n\nTo see this, consider a loop in the punctured plane based at a point. We can continuously deform this loop to a loop in the circle S^1 that wraps around the circle an integer number of times. This integer is the winding number of the loop and serves as an invariant that classifies the loop up to homotopy. The fundamental group of the punctured plane is then the set of all loops up to homotopy, which is isomorphic to the integers Z under the operation of addition (corresponding to the concatenation of loops).\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the complement of a circle with radius 1 in three-dimensional space is isomorphic to the integers, Z."
