    "message_2": "To find the integral of cos^2(x)dx from 0 to pi/2, we can use the power-reduction formula:\n\ncos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate this expression with respect to x:\n\n∫(1 + cos(2x))/2 dx from 0 to pi/2\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\n(1/2)∫1 dx + (1/2)∫cos(2x) dx from 0 to pi/2\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n(1/2)[x] from 0 to pi/2 + (1/2)[(1/2)sin(2x)] from 0 to pi/2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(1/2)[(pi/2) - 0] + (1/2)[(1/2)sin(pi) - (1/2)sin(0)]\n\n(1/2)(pi/2) + (1/2)(0 - 0)\n\n(pi/4)\n\nSo, the integral of cos^2(x)dx from 0 to pi/2 is pi/4."
