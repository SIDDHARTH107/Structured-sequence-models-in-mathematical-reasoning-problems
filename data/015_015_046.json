    "message_1": "Assuming a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction has a concentration of malonic acid of 0.1 mol/L, and the reaction is taking place at a rate of 0.05 mol/L/min. After 10 minutes, what will be the concentration of malonic acid left in the reaction?",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of malonic acid left in the reaction after 10 minutes, we can use the following formula:\n\nFinal concentration = Initial concentration - (Reaction rate × Time)\n\nInitial concentration of malonic acid = 0.1 mol/L\nReaction rate = 0.05 mol/L/min\nTime = 10 minutes\n\nFinal concentration = 0.1 mol/L - (0.05 mol/L/min × 10 min)\n\nFinal concentration = 0.1 mol/L - (0.5 mol/L)\n\nFinal concentration = -0.4 mol/L\n\nHowever, the concentration of a substance cannot be negative. This means that after 10 minutes, all the malonic acid has been consumed in the reaction, and the concentration of malonic acid left is 0 mol/L."
