    "message_2": "To show that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is a smooth manifold, we need to find an atlas of charts that cover $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ and whose transition maps are smooth. We will use the following charts:\n\nFor each $i = 0, 1, \\dots, n$, define a chart $\\phi_i: U_i \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, where $U_i = \\{[x_0:\\dots:x_n] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n \\mid x_i \\neq 0\\}$, and\n$$\n\\phi_i([x_0:\\dots:x_n]) = \\left(\\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_n}{x_i}\\right).\n$$\n\nNote that the sets $U_i$ cover $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ since for any point $[x_0:\\dots:x_n] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n$, at least one of the coordinates $x_i$ is nonzero.\n\nNow, let's check that the transition maps are smooth. Consider two charts $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ with $i \\neq j$. We have\n$$\n\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\phi_j\\left[\\frac{x_1}{x_i}:\\dots:\\frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}:1:\\frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}:\\dots:\\frac{x_n}{x_i}\\right].\n$$\n\nIf $i < j$, then\n$$\n\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{1}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{j+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_n}{x_i}\\right),\n$$\nand if $i > j$, then\n$$\n\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{j+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{1}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_n}{x_i}\\right).\n$$\n\nIn both cases, the transition map is a smooth function, as it is a composition of rational functions with nonzero denominators.\n\nThus, we have shown that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is a smooth manifold with an atlas of charts $\\{\\phi_i\\}_{i=0}^n$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is the dimension of the image of the charts, which is $n$."
