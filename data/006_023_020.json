    "message_2": "To determine the probability of the next customer buying the product, we need more information about the buying behavior of customers in the market. However, we can calculate the current buying rate based on the information provided.\n\nOut of the 20 people in the market, 5 have already purchased the product. This means that the current buying rate is:\n\n5 (number of people who bought the product) / 20 (total number of people in the market) = 1/4 or 25%\n\nThis 25% is the current buying rate, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the next customer will have a 25% chance of buying the product. We would need more information about the customers' buying behavior to determine the probability for the next customer."
