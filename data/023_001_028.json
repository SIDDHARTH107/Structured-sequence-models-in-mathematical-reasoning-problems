    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The function f(x) is defined on the interval [0, 4) and has a period of 4. We can use the following formulas to find the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to L (L is the period)\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nFor the given function, L = 4. Let's find the coefficients:\n\n1. a_0:\na_0 = (1/4) * [∫[4 dx] from 0 to 2 + ∫[-1 dx] from 2 to 4]\na_0 = (1/4) * [(4x)| from 0 to 2 + (-x)| from 2 to 4]\na_0 = (1/4) * [(8 - 0) + (2 - 4)]\na_0 = (1/4) * (8 - 2)\na_0 = 3/2\n\n2. a_n:\na_n = (1/2) * [∫[4 * cos(n * π * x / 4) dx] from 0 to 2 + ∫[-1 * cos(n * π * x / 4) dx] from 2 to 4]\na_n = (1/2) * [(8/πn) * sin(n * π * x / 4)| from 0 to 2 - (4/πn) * sin(n * π * x / 4)| from 2 to 4]\na_n = (1/2) * [(8/πn) * (sin(n * π * x / 2))| from 0 to 2 - (4/πn) * (sin(n * π * x / 2))| from 2 to 4]\n\nSince sin(n * π) is always 0 for integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\n3. b_n:\nb_n = (1/2) * [∫[4 * sin(n * π * x / 4) dx] from 0 to 2 + ∫[-1 * sin(n * π * x / 4) dx] from 2 to 4]\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-8/πn) * cos(n * π * x / 4)| from 0 to 2 + (4/πn) * cos(n * π * x / 4)| from 2 to 4]\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-8/πn) * (cos(n * π * x / 2))| from 0 to 2 + (4/πn) * (cos(n * π * x / 2))| from 2 to 4]\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nSince a_n = 0 for all n, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = 3/4 + Σ[b_n * sin(n * π * x / 4)]\n\nSubstituting the expression for b_n:\n\nf(x) = 3/4 + Σ[((-8/πn) * (cos(n * π * x / 2))| from 0 to 2 + (4/πn) * (cos(n * π * x / 2))| from 2 to 4) * sin(n * π * x / 4)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x)."
